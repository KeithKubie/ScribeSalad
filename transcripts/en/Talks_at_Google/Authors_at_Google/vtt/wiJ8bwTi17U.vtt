JOHN STOKES: Welcome to this
edition of Google Authors

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.140
Talks with Chris Cheng.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.410
I am John Stokes.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.397
And normally, if
I'm at Google HQ,

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:11.980
I am sitting out
there in the audience

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.400
live blogging about
a Nexus phone,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.830
or trying to think of
good questions to ask.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.330
But this time, I
get to be on stage.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.690
If you know me, you
probably know me

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.870
as one of the founders
of Ars Technica.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.890
And I've also, in the past,
done some work for Wired,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.220
and a couple of other
tech publications.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.880
And now, weirdly enough, I'm
kind of a gun guy like Chris.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.390
And we'll talk a
little bit about how

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.260
I made that transition,
and how he made it.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.730
Chris, some of you
probably know him.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.590
He is a former Googler,
a member of the Google

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.670
Apps for Enterprise team.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.730
And while he was
on that team, he

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.130
entered and won History
Channel's "Top Shot"

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.840
Season Four Championship.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.570
And if you're not
familiar with "Top Shot,"

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.632
we're going show
a clip, I believe.

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:01.340
CHRIS CHENG: Yup.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.173
JOHN STOKES: OK, we're
going to show a clip.

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:04.950
It's a reality show
elimination type

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.032
of competition, where
the participants compete,

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.240
and they shoot lots of
different kinds of projectiles

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.823
at lots of different
kinds of targets.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:13.780
And so Chris has shot everything
from grenade launchers

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.620
to spear chuckers, and
so on, and so forth.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.770
And he competed against some
pretty serious marksmen,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.330
and he went on as
an amateur and won.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.130
And it's a pretty cool
story of how he did that.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.520
And now he is sponsored
by Bass Pro Shops.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.010
He's a professional marksman.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.980
And he is also an
NRA commentator,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.010
and he has a new
book, "Shoot To Win."

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.287
And so we're going to be
talking about some things

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:41.870
from the book.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.550
I got a chance to read it,
and it's a great introduction

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.490
to firearms and to
firearm culture, and also,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.910
interestingly enough, to
the kinds of techniques that

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.400
allowed Chris to
go on to "Top Shot"

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.381
and beat the pants off of people
who were very, very experienced

00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:58.880
marksmen.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.290
So we're just going to do
a really informal QA style

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.260
interview format.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.840
And I'm just going to
be bouncing questions

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.615
off Chris here.

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:11.990
CHRIS CHENG: And there will
be opportunities for audience

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.860
participation, so if
you have any questions,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.500
you can definitely feel free
to-- we'll have opportunities

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.810
for Q and A from the audience.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.390
JOHN STOKES: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.860
So Chris, one of the themes
in the book that really

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.369
is super predominant is the
sort of power of the internet

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.160
to teach you anything
you want to know now,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.470
especially YouTube, and
forums, and things like this.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.030
And it's sort of I think of it
as the rise of the autodidact

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.810
and the rise of the self-taught
person as an expert.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.199
And so not only can you teach
yourself anything on YouTube

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.740
now-- I taught myself
how to barbecue

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.960
by watching YouTube videos.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.030
And my daughter thinks
I'm a master pizza chef,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.950
and I just watched
a bunch of YouTube.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.750
But you can do it to a very
high degree competency.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.400
You can train yourself to
a high degree of competency

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.750
in the privacy of your
own apartment or whatever,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.860
just on the internet.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.160
And historically gun culture--
that's not how it works.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.750
Knowledge about guns,
about firearms, safety,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.150
maintenance, when to shoot, how
to shoot, why to shoot-- this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.910
is something that's passed on
typically from father to son,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.700
because it's very male
dominant, although that's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.540
changing rapidly.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.000
But it's passed on.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.700
It's a relational
kind of knowledge.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.500
It's steeped in
tradition and heritage,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.380
and so you kind of parachuted
in off the internet.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.230
You're like this
internet-powered, YouTube,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.160
self-taught, goal-oriented,
project-oriented person.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.560
You're, like, here's a project.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.630
I'm going to tackle it.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.420
I'm going to optimize
this and that.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.130
I'm going to train myself.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.729
And you just show up
in this competition

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.145
with these people who are kind
of heritage type of people,

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.600
and then you beat them.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.020
And there's got be some kind
of backlash or culture clash

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.520
there.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.840
And I was wondering if you
could speak to that difference.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.550
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, I think
it at a very high level,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.795
it was really interesting
to approach a subject that I

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:13.140
didn't know a lot about,
which was marksmanship.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.160
And I mean, I learned how
to shoot when I was six,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.751
and my father taught
me how to shoot.

00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:19.334
But growing up in
Southern California,

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.730
it wasn't an activity
that we did all the time.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.350
It just wasn't a very strong
or active gun culture.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.960
And it's just amazing to see how
much information is on the web,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.550
and the huge role that Google
has played in providing people

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.310
with a platform, and
giving people a voice,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.140
too, to say what they want
to say, teach other people.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.020
And it's all about sharing
knowledge and learning.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.630
And I'm a lifelong
student of the philosophy

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.770
that we're lifelong learners,
and that you're never

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.050
too old to learn something new.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.970
And there's certain
types of people

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.290
who either get really
excited about the unknown,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.200
and they just dive in, and
learn as much they can.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.490
And there's other people who
get intimidated by the things

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.010
that they don't know, the fact
that they may not be as good,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.340
or they may not be good at
all at a certain activity.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.330
And I just have always wanted
to learn as much as I can,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.730
and get as good as I can about
things as quickly as possible.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.560
And so YouTube and the web
was a primary way for me

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.445
to learn about marksmanship.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.360
I didn't have a lot of
friends or colleagues

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.920
here at Google that
shot guns, and so I

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.130
didn't have a lot of that
sort of in-person interaction

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.930
and knowledge transfer
from other people,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.280
like face to face.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.050
I mean, I did have that
to a certain extent,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.690
but the web was a huge,
important resource for me

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.464
to learn about marksmanship
and training for "Top Shot."

00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:08.130
JOHN STOKES: Could
you talk a little bit

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.255
about some of the specific
resources that you used?

00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:13.970
Were there any YouTube
channels that you can just

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.720
throw out there real
quick for reference

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.928
for them to go back and look?

00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:19.910
CHRIS CHENG: Gosh, I mean,
I was just, like, scouring.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.190
It's just one of those
exercises where I didn't even

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.415
know what I didn't know.

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:27.580
So I was just seeing
it all-- everything

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:35.320
from beginning marksmanship to
the advanced stuff, semi auto

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.410
pistols, fully automatic,
fully automatic rifles,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.510
and trying to then parse
through all of this data,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.400
and try and figure
out, OK, how do I

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.410
whittle down this
massive body of knowledge

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.630
and pare it down to the
core essentials of what

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.840
will help me win Top Shot?

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.000
And so I don't remember,
like, specific sites,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.375
just because I
was so overwhelmed

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.720
with-- I was
watching FPS Russia.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.080
If you're familiar
with FPS Russia--

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.890
he's a YouTube personality.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.610
I think he's got, I don't
know, a gillion followers.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.230
And he just blows stuff up.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.550
And so that's just
a lot of fun--

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.490
not so much educational,
but just more

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.200
entertainment and a good time.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.600
But there's a lot of
discussion forums,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.010
and a lot of journalists who
also write about firearms,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.200
technique, and tactics.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.410
And it was just
fascinating that whatever

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.060
topic that we want
to learn about,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.060
there are all these
micro communities

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.880
online that we can dive in
and learn as much or as little

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.430
as we want.

00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:52.200
JOHN STOKES: Yeah, I
don't think growing up,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.120
I would've ever thought
that the skill set of here's

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.010
a giant mass of relatively
unstructured information.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.425
How do I sort it by
usefulness, and how do I

00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:06.550
learn to process it and
weed out what's irrelevant?

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.556
I would never lump
that in as one

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:10.930
of the marksmanship
fundamentals.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.830
This is not the kind
of thing that you

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.840
think of as, I want
to learn to shoot,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.720
or I want to learn
to cook, or whatever

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720
it is that you're doing.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.200
But it's fascinating that that
skill set is now a component,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.480
especially if you're
going to go this route.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.740
And that's actually what I
did a lot as a journalist

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.860
for Ars Technica and for
"Wired," was you go out,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.630
and you look, and you
process information.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.539
You try to figure out what's
relevant, and what's not,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.150
and throw out the
irrelevant stuff.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.679
And I think that kind of skill
set has to be democratized.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.210
The more people that can
do it, the more people

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.320
can teach themselves.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.810
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, something
that I always continually think

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.640
about my time here at
Google, and just the skill

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.720
sets that I gained from
my experience working

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.230
in customer support
and technical support.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.850
And I mean, all of
us here, I mean,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.150
I know your inboxes just get
flooded with hundreds of emails

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.140
a day, and not just your
inbox, but Buganizer,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.340
and you've got all sorts
of other internal tools.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.660
You've got all these
signals coming at you.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.260
And applying that
skill set of how do you

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.250
filter out the
low priority noise

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.520
and prioritize, OK, what are the
things that I need to do either

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.450
right now, or from your team
perspective, what are the most

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.300
important things that our team
should be focusing on to build

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.560
the product, product
enhancements,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.090
et cetera, et cetera?

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.771
And we're all busy people.

00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:38.520
It doesn't matter what
industry you're in.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.190
I think that it's a
good, general skill set

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.010
to apply to all
parts of your life.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.470
And that's a big part of what
I talk about in the book.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.500
The book, "Shoot To
Win," is not just

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.590
a book about beginning
marksmanship.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.340
It's about how I took work
skills that I learned here

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.020
at Google, and I'm a musician,
and I played a lot of baseball

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.620
when I was a kid.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.850
And so taking these
other skill sets,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.450
and taking the frameworks,
and applying it

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.040
to other parts in
my life is a way

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.790
that I'm able to bring my full
skill set to a task at hand.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.860
So I'm not, like
if I'm at work, I'm

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.160
not just thinking
about my work skills.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.630
Or if I'm working on
a personal project,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.770
I'm pulling from work
skills, oftentimes.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.950
So I really want encourage
a multi-disciplinary kind

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.040
of cross-platform
approach, if you will,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.210
to optimizing your own life.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.820
JOHN STOKES: So let's go back
to the skill thing in a minute.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.430
I want to hop
around, and ask you

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.070
about gun culture 1.0 and 2.0.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.500
I don't know how many of
you guys sort of follow

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.120
this discussion, but there's
kind of gun culture 1.0,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.380
which is hunting and the gun
should have a wooden stock,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.390
and it should be, like,
single shot maybe.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.150
And it's about sort
of outdoor-centric,

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.790
and there's not really
a competition focus.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.330
And then there's
gun culture 2.0,

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.059
which is people that come in
to guns from "Call of Duty,"

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:20.850
or from the movies, or
something like this.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.300
And the clothing
is more tactical,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.730
and it's got that
more competition vibe.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.800
And so there's
historically been a bit

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.430
of a clash between
the two kind of camps,

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.770
and that's narrowed quite a bit
in the past five years or so.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:42.710
But Chris is very much a sort
of a more gun 2.0 kind of guy.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.440
I was raised as a
gun 1.0 kind of guy,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.400
and I was pretty hostile to the
2.0 guys with the black rifles.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.290
I would go into a gun store, and
I would see these on the wall,

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.990
I would think, "What freak
buys that, because surely you

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.910
must have some kind of
weird James Bond fantasy."

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.250
And then eventually I got one,
and it's a lot of fun to shoot,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.500
and my nerd gear
tech side kicked in.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.660
I was, like, this is a gadget.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.810
So I made that
transition myself.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.780
And it's funny.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.160
Most of my community--
I grew up in Louisiana,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.760
in South Louisiana, and very
sporting-centric, hunting,

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.986
and camping, and stuff.

00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:22.110
And one Christmas, I went
back and all of a sudden,

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.392
the guys were pulling
AR-15s out of the gun safe

00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:26.350
and showing each other.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.520
And that was kind
of a shock for me.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.450
So that's happened
kind of rapidly,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.890
and I was wondering if
you could speak to that.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.560
Have you seen this
dichotomy, or kind of

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.050
lived on either side of it?

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.850
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, it's a
very interesting discussion

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.880
we have about the
1.0 versus 2.0 folks.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.820
And for me, I love--
I've been hunting a lot.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.845
I'm also a competition shooter.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.650
But then I also
enjoy trap shooting,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.000
which trap shooting is sort
of more in that 1.0 kind

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.510
old-school break-action shotgun.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:05.260
It's very meditative, and
it requires your whole focus

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.010
to literally just do one thing
at a given moment in time.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.700
And in the multitasking kind
of world that we live in,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.060
being able to just be
disciplined and focused

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.430
on a single task
that's literally right

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.340
in front of your face-- that's
another skill set that I enjoy.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:30.410
And so I have my feet
planted in both the 1.0

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.150
and the 2.0 worlds, because
when I'm at the trap range,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.970
I hear some of these guys talk--
the guys with their AR-15s

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:45.602
and their race pistols that they
shoot really fast with red dot

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:46.685
sites, and all that stuff.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.160
I think it's just
really exciting

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.510
to see 2.0 and
obviously, eventually,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.090
the next phase, viewing
how our culture--

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.485
how gun culture will develop.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.970
It is bringing in new
people into the sport.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.680
And John had written
a really great article

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.280
for Wired talking
about how the AR-15 is

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.300
very similar to building
your own computer.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.230
And the modularity
of each platform,

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.230
and how you can pick and
choose your hard drive,

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.160
and your graphics card, and
how much RAM, and so on.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.520
And then on the
AR side of things,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.390
what kind of bulk carrier
group, and trigger, and barrel.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.860
And you can just geek
out as much as you want.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:39.190
And the big picture for
me is that this is just

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:44.420
about having fun in a safe
and responsible manner,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.760
and having productive
conversations about gun

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.700
culture.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.560
And that what we see in the
news and in the media about how

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.940
bad people use guns
for bad things--

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.210
that is not the
full story, right?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.520
What we see with gun
violence is statistically,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.840
a very small
percentage of the way

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.760
that guns are being
used in America,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.110
and that the
overwhelming majority--

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.420
I'm talking 98% or 99%
of gun-owning Americans

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.850
are law-abiding citizens who
are not causing any problems,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.320
and not committing any crime.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:37.390
So for me, this is about
the pursuit of the truth.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.520
And if, as long as we
know what the truth is,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.550
base whatever opinion you want,
but at least base your opinions

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.400
and perspectives
off of the facts.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:56.710
And I guess I think a little
bit about how-- let's just

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.450
take an example.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.150
So I mean, I'm gay.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.860
And if you've never
met a gay person,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.120
then you just have
an incomplete picture

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.540
of what the LGBT
community is about.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.300
Then you can just
live in your own head

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.570
about what you think
gay people are.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.470
And it's very similar
with gun people, right?

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.580
If you don't know
any gun owners,

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.510
if you've never shot
a gun, it's just

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.440
something that you are
not basing your opinions

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.880
and perspectives off of the
truth, whether it's facts,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.880
or whether it's
in-person experience.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.710
So that's a big part of my
involvement in gun culture,

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.080
is to shine the
light on the stories

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.520
in the gun community
that are not

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.320
being told in
traditional mass media.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.570
JOHN STOKES: Yeah, it's funny.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.490
I see some of that
myself as a media person

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.710
and as a gun person.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.760
And actually, I'll go ahead
and jump into another question,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.170
because we should talk briefly
about tragedy, because it

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.760
strikes with depressing
regularity right now.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.890
And I find that when there's
a gun-related tragedy

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.849
in the news, I become
like a punching bag slash

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:15.280
lightning rod slash defendant
on trial for all gun people

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.270
everywhere amongst my friends.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.089
And being a media
person, I have a lot

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.780
of friends who are not
comfortable with guns

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.410
or outright hostile.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.940
And so I often find
that I kind of end up

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.450
having to have an answer
for a lot of these things.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:36.680
And a lot of it, you end
up going on the defense,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.170
and you're trying
to defend something

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.170
that's important to you.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.735
And for me, it's
also-- for myself

00:17:42.735 --> 00:17:44.860
it's a heritage thing,
because it's sort of the way

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.900
that I was raised.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.910
And it's tied up
with my ancestors

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.290
and all this other
kind of thing.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.020
But you end up trying to defend
on these different grounds.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.810
And what I want from
gun people like myself

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.700
and from other gun
people is more of, OK,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.080
what are we going to do to help?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.780
What are the goals
that gut people

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.900
are going to work towards to
minimize these kinds of things?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.630
Because there has
to be something

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:22.530
that can be done other
than, well, there's

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.860
a lot of proposals that
come out that are not

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.310
grounded in any basic
knowledge of firearms.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.770
So a lot of you have seen this.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.990
People that don't know,
like, a gun is a machine.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.490
So people that don't
know the basics

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.780
about how these things work
will commonly produce proposals.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.750
Well, this would
solve the problem,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.640
or this would solve the
problem, or maybe we

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.770
should have some sort
of punitive tax on ammo,

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.900
or something like this.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.907
And so they're not
plugged in enough.

00:18:47.907 --> 00:18:49.490
And you would never
get away with that

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.650
if you were trying to propose
regulations around GMOs

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.670
or any other kind
of safety thing,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.380
if you didn't know basics
about planting, and growing,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.250
or genetics.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.180
But you can kind of do
this in the gun world.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.987
And so anyway, to go
back to it, I mean,

00:19:04.987 --> 00:19:06.820
I personally have my
own opinions about what

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.670
gun people can do, but I'd like
to hear from Chris just sort

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.570
of what his take
on this issue is,

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.550
and how gun people can not
just be on the defensive,

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.000
but can be proactive
about addressing

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.610
just the whole spectrum of
gun violence-- crime, suicide,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.330
mass shooting, all that stuff.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.360
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, it's
a really good question.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.200
And at a very high
level, I think

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.340
the first step is, if
you're a gun owner--

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.380
or if you don't own a gun
but you support the Second

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.160
Amendment-- it's important
that you speak up.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.980
And in the same way that
someone can't look at me

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.000
and know that I'm a gun
owner or know that I'm gay,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.120
I have to be vocal about--
hey, if somebody starts saying

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.466
bad things about gay
people in front of me,

00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:55.840
and they don't
know that I'm gay,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.080
I'm going to say, hey, like,
you're talking to a gay person.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.790
So in a very similar
way of there's

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.860
sort of a gay shaming and gun
shaming element that happens,

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.360
right?

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.350
So you're at the
office, and there's

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.000
some sort of mass
shooting event,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.640
and someone starts
saying, oh my gosh,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.690
we should just ban
AR-15s and whatnot.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.750
And I mean, I've been in that
position, where it's like, OK,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.890
do you keep your mouth shut?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.180
And I understand, obviously,
your relationships

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.920
with your colleagues
are something

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.780
that you want to maintain.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.810
But on the other hand,
you remaining silent

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:41.440
is, in a way, compliance,
and agreeing with someone

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.950
who you disagree with.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:48.880
So I think first and
foremost, being vocal.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.920
Number two, knowing
facts-- and I am really

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:01.440
trying to promote a thoughtful
discussion and dialogue that we

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.180
just do not see with
our politicians,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.240
with policymakers-- and to be
honest, even just amongst us,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.220
just regular citizens.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.090
It's turned into this hyper
partisanship, extreme, just

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.240
extremism, where it's either
ban guns or no regulation

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.700
at all kind of discussion.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.590
And I mean, the nuances
are interesting,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.800
but at the very high
level, it's too much

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.950
of an emotionally driven
conversation most of the time.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.250
And so one of my
focuses for gun violence

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.390
is actually suicide prevention.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.610
And so for some of the
numbers-- in the United States,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.330
there's approximately
30,000 people

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:56.100
who die at the hands of a gun.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.430
Now 20,000 of
those are suicides,

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.070
and 10,000 are homicides.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.350
So how are we looking at his
gun violence problem, where

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.650
the majority of gun deaths--
which are suicides-- and we

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.310
barely-- I don't
think anybody talks.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.810
I won't say no one, but this
is not front and center in CNN,

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.380
and Fox News, and all
the other media outlets.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.720
If you look at the 10,000
number for homicides,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.075
a majority of that is gang
and criminal violence.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:33.420
And so if we're going to
tackle the biggest problem,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.390
well, let the data
dictate sort of where

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.530
we should put our focus.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.060
And I think the suicide
prevention piece,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:49.320
because it is so tightly
connected to firearm safety,

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.270
it's something I think
everyone can agree on,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.190
that firearm safety
is important.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.180
We want to protect people
from hurting themselves.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.440
And I think there's
more areas like this

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.070
where look-- it's low
hanging fruit, potential

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.090
for high impact,
literally move the needle,

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.450
and reduce the number of
suicides in our country.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.130
And I think if we spend more
time trying to work together

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.160
towards common
goals versus butting

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.060
heads all the time--
of course, there

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.270
will be times where, sure,
it's just going to happen.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.353
You're going to but heads.

00:23:28.353 --> 00:23:33.070
But I think our country is
in a place where we're not

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.660
trying to work together
as much as we should.

00:23:36.357 --> 00:23:37.690
JOHN STOKES: I totally get that.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.970
I mean, I am far to the
left of Barack Obama,

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.210
but I'm also a gun person.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.230
And a lot of my
colleagues and friends

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.630
on the left-- I'm always trying
to get them to be, like, let's

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.520
not demonize.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.260
Let's not stereotype.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.960
Let's not be prejudiced.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.760
Let's not demonize, because
there are a lot of gun owners

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.270
who are a lot more
moderate than you think,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.080
and who are interested
in solutions.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.520
And whenever all
gun-owners get lumped

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.347
together with the
crazies or with the mass

00:24:13.347 --> 00:24:15.180
shooters or whatever,
it sort of contributes

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.675
to this polarization that is
totally counterproductive.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.080
And not that I want
to say gun owners

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.660
are victims or
this kind of thing,

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.950
because that's the kind of
rhetoric that's also not

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.970
helpful-- when gun owners try
to paint themselves as victims

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.740
of some kind of
persecution thing.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.500
But it's, like,
if everybody could

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.560
dial back down,
that would be great.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.600
But it's so hard to
think about doing that.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.470
And we can come back to this.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.380
This is a super loaded
and super touchy topic,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.530
but we can definitely
come back to it

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.645
later or in the Q&amp;A session.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.970
I want to switch
gears a little bit

00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:03.390
and ask about going from being
a tech nerd to being a gun nerd,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.410
because this is kind of
a transition that I made.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.250
And I was super fascinated.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.960
I covered CES back
when it was COMDEX.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:19.810
And it was very much elastic
waistbands and giant PDAs.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.340
And it was, like,
nerd central, man.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.560
And I came out of the
PC enthusiast scene,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.170
and we over-clocked, and we
did graphics card benchmarks,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.235
and frames per second.

00:25:30.235 --> 00:25:32.300
And we had system wars.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.960
And there was a whole
online kind of geek culture.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.010
And CES has totally
flushed all that out.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.370
Now it's like celebrities,
and it's-- of course,

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.850
this is the rise of the
post-PC era and smartphones,

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.870
stuff like this.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.520
There are car people at
CES, and Verizon execs.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.590
But anyway, it was
kind of pristine,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.600
sort of nerd paradise
back in the day.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.990
And when I jumped
into gun culture,

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.130
my first experience
was covering Shot Show.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.400
This is where I met Chris.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.600
This is right after Newtown, and
I was aware of the black rifle

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.320
phenomenon, but was not
really that into it.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.910
But I kind of was
aware enough to know

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.700
that there was a
gadget component.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.490
So I got the "Wired"
guys to approve a pitch,

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.260
and I went to Shot as part
of the second media crew.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.370
And I agreed to do some blogging
for the Firearm blog as well.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.780
And that got me credentials,
which Shot wasn't really

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.196
handing out credentials to
anybody that was not gun press.

00:26:24.196 --> 00:26:28.360
CHRIS CHENG: And Shot Show
is the largest gun convention

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.310
in Las Vegas every year.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.660
JOHN STOKES: Yes,
it's the CES of guns.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.460
So I was able to get in, and go
and do a bunch of interviews.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.720
And I was so struck.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.450
I was, like, this is like
going back in time 12 years.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.820
I mean, these people are so
nerdily into what they're into.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.610
And they don't even really
care about the press.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.590
I was, like, the last
person anybody really

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.330
was just interested
in talking to.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.010
And then when you go
on forums, there's

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.350
operating system wars
in the AR-15 world--

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.060
the piston versus
direct infringement.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.300
And they call it an
operating system.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.410
There is a feet per second
benchmarks-- FPS instead

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.710
of frames per second
for a graphics card.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.190
And so you have benchmark bake
offs, and operating system

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.230
wars, and you have people
in different camps.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.610
And there's religious fervor.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:14.890
CHRIS CHENG: Caliber
controversies.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.389
JOHN STOKES: Caliber
controversies--

00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:20.220
it's just as vicious as Mac
versus PC of yesteryear.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.500
And so many similarities,
and I end up

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.860
feeling pretty well at home.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.730
But I wanted to get
Chris's take on that,

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.470
because I know that you've
made the jump as well.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.080
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, it's
been exciting to go

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.450
from a place like
Google, where all of us

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.910
are so passionate
about technology,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.410
and about making things
better in our world,

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.710
and that passion that
you have here at a place

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.120
like Google, which really
activates you, right?

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.340
You have just tremendous
resources here

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.640
at your disposal to do some
really, really great things

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.510
in the world.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.780
And I think one of
my biggest concerns

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.250
about leaving Google there's
so many intelligent and driven,

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.900
smart, capable
people-- would I find

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.440
that in the firearms world?

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.600
I mean, I literally didn't
know a single person

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.350
in the firearms
industry leaving Google.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.030
And it was just this
exciting adventure

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:34.100
of leaving kind of the creature
comforts of three square meals

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.270
a day, and delicious Google
cafes, and the shuttles,

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:42.800
and just all-- a
recurring paycheck, just

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.840
simple securities like that.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.340
And thankfully, I've
been pleasantly surprised

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.410
with the types of
people that I've

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:58.610
met in the shooting community
on the industry side of things,

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:04.370
that again-- very intelligent,
very driven, and very smart

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.231
people that are also just very
passionate about the Second

00:29:09.231 --> 00:29:09.730
Amendment.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:16.420
And for me, when I
shot recreationally,

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.500
that's all it was, right?

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.780
For me, shooting was not
about the Second Amendment.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.380
I didn't care about the
politics, or the policies.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.900
This was before "Top Shot."

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.950
I just go to the
range to have fun.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:32.390
It was just kind of an exciting,
stress relief activity.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.850
But now that I've
been paying attention

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.040
to the politics and
the policy discussions,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:47.090
and realizing that the
Second Amendment is our right

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.900
to defend ourselves.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.200
And it's about personal
responsibility,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.820
and not saying that, hey, if
I'm in trouble that I'm just

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.440
going to call 9-1-1 and
the police will save me.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.990
It's about being responsible
for your own safety,

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.090
for your family's safety,
for the safety of the ones

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.560
that you love.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.955
And the tyrannical
government piece

00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:13.700
is, I think, a very interesting
kind of conversation piece.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.910
You hear gun people
say, all right,

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.070
the Second Amendment is our
way of protecting the people

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.260
from tyranny.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.270
And I don't know about you,
but at least, like, before idea

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.570
I was studying the Second
Amendment a little bit more,

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:28.570
I hear the word tyranny.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:35.650
I just think, like 17th century
England with kings, and knights

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:39.270
in armor, and the
tyrannical king

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.950
that's laying waste
to his subjects.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:48.690
And tyranny in
today's time-- tyranny

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:53.530
is all about the unfair
application or abuse

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.565
of power on a specific
group of people.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:04.380
And so, for example, in the
'60s-- in the '50s, '60s, '70s,

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:09.830
when the KKK was really
kind of doing well,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:16.770
there were sheriffs who were
the Grandmaster of the KKK.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.910
And if a black person needed
the help of the sheriff,

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.320
probably forget about it.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.860
And so the fact that
a government entity

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.210
like a Sheriff's Department
or Police Department

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.530
would not protect an
African-American-- there's

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:37.040
some examples of some
individual police officers

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.125
not protecting LGBT
gay pride parades.

00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:42.770
This happened in Salt Like City.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.390
That was an individual,
but you can swap that out

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.970
for a Police Chief
or a Deputy Sheriff,

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.920
or something like that.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:56.480
And that is, for me, the
modern version of tyranny,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.880
and that's why we need to have
a way to protect ourselves

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.240
when the government won't
be there to protect us.

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:05.562
JOHN STOKES: Yeah,
I totally hear that.

00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:08.465
And I think if there are
ever robot overlords,

00:32:08.465 --> 00:32:09.840
I'm either going
to run and hide,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.710
or I'm going to
become a collaborator.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.090
So don't come to me if
that happens and be,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.930
like, John's a gun person.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.260
He's going to help me
out with my under-- no,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.830
I'm going to sell you out
to the robot overlord.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.725
So I'm going to put this
on YouTube so people know.

00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:25.850
I'm warning you in advance.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:34.870
Anyway, to kind of piggy
back on that, you definitely

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:38.930
overlap multiple communities,
I mean-- Asian community,

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.140
tech community, gun
community, gay community.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.700
And the gun community
and the gay community

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.570
have historically been at odds.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.380
And I mean, you're now
an NRA commentator,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.745
and these guys had Sarah
Palin at the last--

00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:55.620
CHRIS CHENG: Something
caught in your throat?

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.660
JOHN STOKES: Yeah, I
almost had to spit.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.430
At the most recent
NRA convention, and so

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.370
I know that you get a lot
from-- or you probably

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.070
face some backlash
from both sides.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.120
CHRIS CHENG: Sure.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.760
JOHN STOKES: And
I'd love to hear

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.785
any kind of stories
or anecdotes.

00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:16.440
And I also know that gay
men can really snark it up,

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.670
and so you probably have
some great stories there, too

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.050
of deadly snark,
or redneck bigotry,

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.250
or whatever kind of a--

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.390
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, I think
there's a false narrative that

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.410
is being told in the media.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.100
So you mentioned historically
that the gay community

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.910
and the gun community
are at odds.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.475
And I actually-- I think
that's completely false.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.450
But if all you watch
is the media, then

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.050
sure-- that is the narrative
that you continue to hear.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.970
And so for the past two
years since leaving Google,

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.320
I've traveled all across the
country to parts of states,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.320
and parts of states I never
imagined myself being in.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.500
But it's been wonderful.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.429
And I've met so many gun
people who are just-- they

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.920
are ecstatic when they meet
me and they know that I'm gay.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.980
And I can't tell you
the number of times

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.909
that I hear someone say, I'm so
glad that you're representing

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.480
the firearms community,
because there

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.500
are more people like us that
really welcome anybody that's

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.440
interested in
learning how to shoot.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.380
Come out and join us.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:40.420
And this is a perception
problem that I think the gun

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:46.270
community-- that I'm trying to
counter, because all in all,

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.470
sure, I've met a
few-- actually, I

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:51.210
haven't met anybody who's,
like, to my face said, like,

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.730
oh you're gay and
you talk-- it's

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.580
all just internet
troll nonsense.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:02.250
Which these days-- look
I managed a product forum

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.220
here at Google for
a year and a half.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.050
And like that was my job,
like, manage the trolls.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.800
Occasionally I would feed them,
mostly trying and starve them.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.380
But it just comes
with the territory,

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.470
right, to deal with criticism.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:20.610
And I think the
other kind of thought

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:25.950
to answer your question about
sort of my experiences--

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:31.680
ultimately, for me this is
about encouraging each of us

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:37.410
to live our own truth, and to
be not ashamed of who we are

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.590
and what we believe in.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:43.280
And there's always going to be
people who disagree with you,

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:43.780
right?

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.090
If you build an argument
starting with that base,

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.320
just knowing that
there's people who

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.600
are going to disagree with
you on just everything.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.870
And I used to treat
life to a certain extent

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.871
like a popularity contest, like
high school and junior high.

00:36:01.871 --> 00:36:03.620
Like, I want to be
friends with everybody.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.240
And to a large extent, I
mean, that is still very much

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.400
a strong goal and a
strong drive for me,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.930
is to be nice to people, and to
find ways for us to get along.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.065
But on the other
hand, I'm not willing,

00:36:21.065 --> 00:36:25.060
and I'm not going to
compromise who I am

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:30.750
and what I believe in for the
sake of being-- I'll be civil,

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.170
but I'm not going to
obviously, go out of my way

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:38.580
to pretend like I like them
if they are not a good person.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.919
So living our own truth is
a real big focus for me,

00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:45.210
and encouraging that in others.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.050
JOHN STOKES: So we're kind
of running long on time,

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.420
and this is a great sort
of a vein of discussion.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.472
But I want to break out of it,
because we do have the clip.

00:36:57.472 --> 00:36:58.430
CHRIS CHENG: Oh, right.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.460
JOHN STOKES: And we have
to get out the clip.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.130
And so I want to
set up the clip,

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.950
because as a gun
culture 1.0 person,

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:08.390
you learned that shooting
is about muscle memory,

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.930
and it's about talent, and
all this other kind of stuff.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.520
And Chris talks a lot in
his book about visualization

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.970
and stress management.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.250
And I am [SQUEAK] what is this?

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.690
What kind of a--
like, how do you--

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.149
like, I would never
think that this

00:37:24.149 --> 00:37:26.398
is important for a marksman--
visualization and stress

00:37:26.398 --> 00:37:26.950
management.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.630
But these were kind of the
keys to his sort of come

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.470
from nowhere kind of success.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:36.344
And I want to ask him a question
about that, because I told him,

00:37:36.344 --> 00:37:38.760
I said, I feel like your book
should have been called "The

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.926
Four-hour Marksman," because
it comes from this kind

00:37:40.926 --> 00:37:41.770
of hacker--

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:42.811
CHRIS CHENG: Tim Ferriss.

00:37:43.311 --> 00:37:47.160
JOHN STOKES: Yeah,
but not quite.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.750
Training is still
important, but I

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.790
want to get a look at Chris in
action doing his visualization,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.449
and the fruit of that.

00:37:53.449 --> 00:37:54.240
CHRIS CHENG: Great.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.927
We're going to set
up a projector here.

00:37:56.927 --> 00:37:59.260
And so while we're waiting
for the projector to fire up,

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.520
I'll do a little
bit of an intro here

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.900
to what we're going to see here.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.390
So this was one of
the most thrilling

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.040
and harrowing elimination
challenges for me,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.820
where I was going up against
William Bethards, who

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:20.760
is a Marine Corps
rifleman, and he

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.510
trains FBI Special
Agents in Quantico.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.436
And so every single FBI
Special Agent over the past-- I

00:38:27.436 --> 00:38:29.310
don't know, whatever,
10 years or something--

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.630
has gone through his tutelage.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.130
So let me just go
ahead and play it.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.610
It's a five-minute clip.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.260
And enjoy.

00:38:36.962 --> 00:38:39.170
JOHN STOKES: Stress management,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.010
I almost wet my pants watching
it, and I know how it ends.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.630
So I can't imagine.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.512
And you can see the marksman
just, like, fumbling with it.

00:38:48.512 --> 00:38:50.470
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, to
kind of talk a little bit

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.560
about what was
going on, and sort

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.700
of what I talk about in the
book is stress management

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.550
and emotional management.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.550
So with that 1860 Henry
rifle that I was shooting,

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.020
there's a whole
practice session that

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.050
was aired before
the actual event.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.890
And so I knew that
rifle shot high.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.790
So for a lot of guns
that are sighted,

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.650
you put your front
sight on the target,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.941
you're going to hit the target.

00:39:19.941 --> 00:39:23.120
Well, in this case,
the point of impact

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.539
was higher above the target.

00:39:26.539 --> 00:39:28.080
And so basically
what that means is I

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.590
needed to aim low
to hit my target.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:36.570
Now when the elimination
challenge first started off,

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.510
I was missing high,
high, and high,

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.320
and just all that stress that
was building up-- there's

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.780
a phrase called the
amygdala hijack, where

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.790
the emotional part of
your brain just, like,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:54.200
literally takes over any
cognitive, rational thinking

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.910
abilities.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.190
And so in my mind, like, I
know that this gun shoots high.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.600
I need to shoot lower.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.120
But like a dumb caveman, I just
kept on doing the same thing,

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.970
expecting a different result.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:10.010
And it was really
funny that usually when

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.320
Colby, who's the host that you
saw there, when he's narrating

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.870
during these challenges, you
just want him to just be quiet.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:23.220
I don't need to hear you
narrating all my mistakes,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.650
and let me focus on shooting.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:29.140
But in this specific
challenge, when

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.870
you heard him say Chris
is falling behind,

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.360
or Chris better pick
up pace, I heard that,

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.950
because he was literally
about 12 feet behind me.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.050
But I heard that, and
that snapped me out of it.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.730
And I had this
moment where I just

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.570
said, OK, I need
to just recenter.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.320
And for me a big part
of stress management

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.945
is pulling on other
experiences where

00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:54.450
I've had to deal with stress.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.740
And so at Google dealing
with angry customers--

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.240
that was a big part of my job.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.100
Customers would
call in or email.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.060
My Gmail is not working.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.805
Google calendar's not showing
certain events or whatever.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.830
And remaining calm
when a customer is just

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.270
screaming and yelling
at you because there's

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:21.840
all sorts of problems-- it's a
hard skill, to focus, to build.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.540
Because the customer's angry,
but you need to stay calm

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.520
and just focus on
the task at hand.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.260
So when I was stressed out in
that elimination challenge,

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.610
I definitely was pulling
on that Google experience.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:39.360
And so again, that's like my
cross-disciplinary approach

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.180
to problem solving.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.500
And project
management definitely

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:48.015
came forward in helping me win
that elimination challenge.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.090
JOHN STOKES: We're
almost done here,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.500
and I want to throw out one
last quick questions, and--

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.070
CHRIS CHENG: Take
some questions.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.444
JOHN STOKES: We'll take some
questions from the audience.

00:41:57.444 --> 00:41:59.895
So just a very quick question--
so the Zombie Apocalypse,

00:41:59.895 --> 00:42:02.560
man-- what are the
three guns that you're

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.680
going to have for the
Zombie Apocalypse?

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.540
You know I had to ask it.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.300
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah,
especially with the Ebola

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.240
and the Enterovirus D68.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.950
I mean, there's all sorts of
stuff going on these days.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.250
So three guns--
I'm not a prepper,

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.960
and I'm not a survivalist, but
being a native Californian,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.270
having an earthquake kit
is just like standard.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:32.430
And now that I'm in the
gun world, adding guns-- so

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.820
your earthquake
basically just doubles

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.070
as Doomsday disaster kit.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.180
So sort of there's
a holy trinity,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.060
if you will, of pistol,
shotgun, and rifle.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.019
But I really would just
say there's really not

00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:49.560
much of a discussion
about the rifle.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.380
It should be an
AR-15 for the rifle.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.090
I'm a 12-gauge shotgun.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:01.650
I would say there's this
huge controversy around what

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.640
is the right shotgun for
a survival situation?

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.390
I would say pump Remington
870 or Mossberg 500.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:11.230
They're reliable.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.590
You've got capacity in it.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.210
And then with the
pistol, just get--

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.580
I'd say a revolver's
a really good choice,

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:23.350
but I'm a Glock guy, so
I'd have my Glock 34.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.660
JOHN STOKES: Cool.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.642
So do you guys have questions?

00:43:26.642 --> 00:43:28.600
We could take some
questions from the audience.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.170
I guess I should
grab a mic here.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:32.170
AUDIENCE: That we had a
serious suicide problem.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:37.240
And the host was just
all about anti-guns.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:41.690
And he saw it as an opportunity
to push his anti-gun stance,

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.520
while the person
who was recognizing

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.200
this problem of suicide, was,
like, listen-- in Oregon,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.120
it's really bad.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:52.890
It's actually, of all
gun deaths, 80% or 85%

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.540
are suicides.

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.190
Is that something
maybe we can address?

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.979
How do we get that
out there more?

00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:01.609
How do we make that part
of the conversation?

00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:03.650
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.180
And I think what I
want to encourage

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.080
is that each of
us as individuals

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:16.460
has a lot of power over
dictating or directing

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:21.350
the conversation that happens in
our local communities, and then

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.290
county-wide, statewide,
and nationwide.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:30.890
And especially with the web--
a single voice, a single story,

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.450
can have a tremendous
resonating impact.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:39.040
And so my answer
is, we need to talk

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.190
about this in any
appropriate forum, where

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:47.120
we come in with the knowledge,
and the facts, and the stories.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.500
Because arguments
can't just be dry,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.520
factual, logical arguments.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.740
There has to be an emotional
connection and a grounding.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:03.320
Because that is this combination
of logic and emotion-- for me,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.070
I think that is-- finding
that sweet spot for how

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.555
to convey a compelling argument.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:20.195
And I think suicide prevention
is-- it's not just about guns.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.600
I would add the word
just, because yes, guns

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.470
are a part of it.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.960
Like, I don't want to make it
seem like extreme, like it's

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.180
just a mental health issue.

00:45:30.512 --> 00:45:31.720
Guns are part of the problem.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.970
But one thing that I look
back at my experience here

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:40.450
at Google, and I worked
with a lot of engineers

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.570
as a part of my role,
where it's, like,

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.550
I would hear customer problems.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.770
And we're relaying
information to engineers

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:52.100
who are trying to figure out
the root cause of a problem.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.470
And that root cause
analysis and approach

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:58.310
has always just stayed with me.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:03.950
Because the customer
may say something like,

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:07.480
I'm seeing something in Gmail
where I click on a button,

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.520
and my messages
disappear-- whatever.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.450
We relay that information
on to the engineers,

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.750
and the engineering
team's looking into this.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:19.550
And the problem may not
even lie with Gmail.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.580
It may be related to the
Google account framework,

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.210
and causing some
sort of problem.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.540
So you have all of these
potential red herrings

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.430
out there.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.250
I see a Gmail problem.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.820
I see a suicide
problem with guns,

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.950
and therefore, it
must be a gun problem.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.280
When in actuality,
the suicide problem

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.790
has its own root causes, right?

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:45.350
The gun is not causing people
to kill themselves, right?

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.570
There is something
else, and deeper,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.940
with that particular topic.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.180
And so again, just
the more conversations

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.390
that we can have that
are driven by facts,

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.450
but also by anecdotes
and narratives, I think,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.950
is an effective approach.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:07.680
And this is a long, hard slog.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.850
There's not going to be
any immediate solution

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:12.850
that we're going to see.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.420
This is going to take decades.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.740
And this is the
kind of commitment

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:21.650
that I have to
this kind of issue.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.960
And I know there's
lots of other people

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.110
that are also committed
to reducing gun violence

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.245
and preventing suicides.

00:47:29.721 --> 00:47:32.054
AUDIENCE: Back when you were
here and going through "Top

00:47:32.054 --> 00:47:34.620
Shot," and doing
[INAUDIBLE], which is great,

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.480
it was super
exciting, I remember

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.520
at one point you shared,
like, some trick sheet.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.139
And I don't want to say
it was like light bulb,

00:47:41.139 --> 00:47:42.430
but it was something like that.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.450
And I remember looking at that
and for one, I was kind of,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.790
like, oh, my god, this guy
shared what his goals for life

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.290
are.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.848
This is amazing, because this
seems private and all that.

00:47:52.848 --> 00:47:54.200
But it was really inspiring.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.940
And I seem to vaguely remember
there was some stuff in there

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.840
about maybe you want
to go into politics.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.590
CHRIS CHENG: Sure.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.612
AUDIENCE: And I don't
want to try and hold you

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.266
to something from
several years ago,

00:48:03.266 --> 00:48:06.242
because it was a different
time and everything.

00:48:06.242 --> 00:48:09.070
But do you still think
that maybe one day you'll

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:10.150
pursue that route?

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:11.500
Because I know I'd vote for you.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.833
CHRIS CHENG: Sure, well, thanks.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.940
Yeah, that's definitely
still in the cards for me.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.310
But it's funny
that you mentioned

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:23.500
the personal development plan,
or otherwise known as a PDP.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.770
That's actually in Chapter
One of the book, which

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.240
is talking about
why learn to shoot.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.900
And how does the specific
marksmanship skill sets

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:41.510
and related skills-- trigger
control, sight alignment,

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.000
sight picture-- these
are marksmanship skills,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.450
but they also feed into hard
work, discipline, mind, body,

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.445
soul control, and mindfulness.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:59.250
And how do you effectively
leverage your whole skill set

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.270
into a career path?

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:06.070
And so in the book, I talk
about how marksmanship for me--

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.060
I mean, unexpectedly.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.300
This wasn't something
that I'm, like, hey,

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.310
I'm working at Google.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.240
I'm going to study guns
and go do a career in guns.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:23.230
But it's how to really, again,
just tie this all together,

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:28.480
and be happy, and be
fulfilled in your career path,

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.220
and know that the work
that you're doing today

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:38.450
is building to your own
personal and professional goals,

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.290
and having a plan around that.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.410
So quick background--
part of my role at Google

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:46.750
was also leadership training,
and also management training.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.610
So if you've taken
True Colors, which

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.550
is like a whittled-down
version of Myers-Briggs,

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.780
I was a True Colors facilitator.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.800
And I was a career
coach for my team.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.550
And so I think the
main point, though,

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:11.160
especially related
to your question,

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.680
is knowing what you
want to get out of life,

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.340
and being very specific--
as specific as you can,

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.490
and sharing that with people.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.000
And look, I'll tell you.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.550
So I actually have
a Google short link

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:29.490
to my PDP in the book.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:36.590
And I may not hit all my
goals that I have out there,

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.850
but there's some really
lofty stuff out there.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.290
And obviously at a
place like Google,

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:47.550
I mean, we dream big for
ourselves, for the company,

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.360
for the potential that
Google products have

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.790
to do good in the world.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.430
And I think it's just
very natural for us

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.840
to want the same.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:02.010
We want to optimize and maximize
our own personal happiness.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.430
So thanks for bringing up
the question, because it's

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.050
actually related to the book.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.040
JOHN STOKES: So we're
out of time, but Chris,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.410
did you have any kind
of final thoughts

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:11.701
that you want to share briefly?

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:19.080
CHRIS CHENG: Yeah, so I
think just to really, really

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.460
bring home the point of
living your own truth.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:26.720
That, I think, is
just so important.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:33.930
And this whole gun stuff,
and all the gay stuff,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:39.260
with same-sex marriage, and
all these assault weapons,

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:46.020
and the 30-round magazine
controversies-- these

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.560
are hard conversations to
have with a lot of people.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.660
And we can't shy away from
the things that we believe in.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.230
And again, just
live your own truth,

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:01.900
and whatever that truth
is, make sure people know.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.520
And for me, I mean,
that's just been,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.620
I think, a huge key to my
own personal happiness.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.564
And I hope it is for
other people as well.

00:52:10.564 --> 00:52:12.230
JOHN STOKES: Thank
you, Chris, and thank

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:13.230
you guys for coming out.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:17.180
CHRIS CHENG: Thanks, everybody.
