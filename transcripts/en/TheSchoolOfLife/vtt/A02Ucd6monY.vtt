00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.549
One of the most surprising but powerful explanations
for why we may, as adults, be in trouble mentally

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:14.910
is that we were, in our earliest years, denied
the opportunity to be fully ourselves, that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.860
is, we were not allowed to be wilful and difficult,
we could not be as demanding, aggressive,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.460
intolerant, and unrestrictedly selfish as
we needed to be. Because our caregivers were

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.020
preoccupied or fragile, we had to be preternaturally
attuned to their demands, sensing that we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.760
had to comply in order to be loved and tolerated;
we had to be false before we had the chance

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.920
to feel properly alive. And as a result, many
years later, without quite understanding the

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.621
process, we risk feeling unanchored, inwardly
dead and somehow not entirely present. This

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:05.750
psychological theory of the True and the False
Self is the work of one of the twentieth century’s

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.141
greatest thinkers, the English psychoanalyst
and child psychiatrist Donald Winnicott. In

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:17.780
a series of papers written in the 1960s and
based on close observations of his adult and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.049
infant patients, Winnicott advanced the view
that healthy development invariably requires

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.490
us to experience the immense, life-sustaining
luxury of a period when we do not have to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.869
bother with the feelings and opinions of those
who are tasked with looking after us. We can

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.610
be wholly and, without guilt, our True Selves,
because those around us have – for a time

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.210
– adapted themselves entirely to our needs
and desires, however inconvenient and arduous

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.009
these might be. The true self of the infant,
in Winnicott’s formulation, is by nature

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.609
asocial and amoral. It isn’t interested
in the feelings of others, it isn’t socialised.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.459
It screams when it needs to – even if it
is the middle of the night or on a crowded

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.820
train. It may be aggressive, biting and – in
the eyes of a stickler for manners or a lover

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.940
of hygiene – shocking and a bit disgusting.
It wants to express itself where and how it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.430
wants. It can be sweet of course but on its
own terms, not in order to charm or bargain

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.500
for love. If a person is to have any sense
of feeling real as an adult, then it has to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.510
have enjoyed the immense emotional privilege
of being able to be true in this way, to disturb

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.230
people when it wants, to kick when it is angry,
to scream when it is tired, to bite when it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.400
is feeling aggressive. The True Self of the
child must be granted the imaginative opportunity

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.960
to destroy the parent when it is in a rage
– and then witness the parent surviving

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.800
and enduring, which lends the child a vital
and immensely reassuring sense that it is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.210
not in fact omnipotent, and that the world
won’t collapse simply because it sometimes

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.230
wishes or fears it could. When things go well,
gradually and willingly, the child develops

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.010
a False Self, a capacity to behave according
to the demands of external reality. This is

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.530
what enables a child to submit to the rigours
of school and, as it develops into an adult,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.270
of working life as well. When we have been
given the chance to be our true selves we

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.160
do not, at every occasion, need to rebel and
insist on our needs. We can follow the rules

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.100
because we have, for a time, been able to
ignore them entirely. In other words, Winnicott

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.180
was not a thorough enemy of a False Self;
he understood its role well enough, he simply

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.310
insisted that it belonged to health only when
it had been preceded by a thorough earlier

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:05.450
experience of an untrammelled True Self. Unfortunately,
many of us have not enjoyed such an ideal

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.370
start. Perhaps mother was depressed, or father
was often in a rage, maybe there was an older

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.320
or younger sibling who was in a crisis and
required all the attention. The result is

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.990
that we will have learnt to comply far too
early; we will have become obedient at the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.189
expense of our ability to feel authentically
ourselves. In relationships, we may now be

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:35.830
polite and geared to the needs of our partners,
but not for that matter able properly to love.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.650
At work, we may be dutiful but uncreative
and unoriginal. In such circumstances, and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.210
this is its genius, psychotherapy offers us
a second chance. In the hands of a good therapist,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.300
we are allowed to regress before the time
when we started to be False, back to the moment

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.319
when we so desperately needed to be true.
In the therapist’s office, safely contained

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:08.509
by their maturity and care, we can learn – once
more – to be real; we can be intemperate,

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:15.930
difficult, unconcerned with anyone but ourselves,
selfish, unimpressive, aggressive and shocking.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.210
And the therapist will take it – and thereby
help us to experience a new sense of aliveness

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.039
which should have been there from the start.
The demand to be False, which never goes away,

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.219
becomes more bearable because we are regularly
being allowed, in the privacy of the therapist’s

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:40.360
room, once a week or so, to be True. Winnicott
was famously calm and generous towards his

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.740
patients when they were attempting to refind
their True Selves in this way. One of them

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.830
smashed a favourite vase of his, another stole
his money, a third shouted insults at him

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.590
session after session. But Winnicott was unruffled,
knowing that this was part of a journey back

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.800
towards health, away from the deadly fakeness
afflicting these patients in the rest of their

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.721
lives. We can be grateful to Winnicott for
reminding us that contentment and a feeling

00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:14.440
of reality have to pass through stages of
almost limitless delinquent selfishness. There

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.710
is simply no other way. We have to be True
before we can be usefully a bit fake – and

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.730
if we have never been allowed, then our sickness
and depression is there to remind us that

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.400
we need to take a step back, and therapy is
there to allow us to do so.
