00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.440
SORAB: We have a very special
guest here with us today.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.096
Please join me in
welcoming Jeremy Miller.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.211
JEREMY MILLER: Thank you.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.442
Thank you.

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:14.150
Thank you, Sorab.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.870
It's-- it's a real honor to be
here and talk about the book,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.140
and my experience in learning
from the process of studying

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.200
these letters and
compiling the book.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.320
You know, I'm not a
professional writer.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.350
I view myself much more as
a sort of project manager

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.600
for what I saw as something
that was being widely neglected

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.680
by the value community
and the public at large.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.210
I mean, everyone knows
about Warren Buffet's time

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.840
at Berkshire Hathaway and
how successful that's been,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.770
so, you know, last year
was the 50th anniversary

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.980
of his ascension into the
chairman role of that company.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.500
So we have his 50
letters from that period.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.940
But you know, there was also
a period between 1956 and 1970

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.732
where he was running a
partnership largely comprised

00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:17.690
of people that he knew.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.430
In fact, the initial
investors were

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.730
family members, and roommates,
and people from Omaha

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.924
that he knew.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.340
Folks that he was
very close with.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310
And he was writing
these letters to them.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.830
So you can imagine trying to
convey a sense of philosophy,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.820
in terms of how to
think about markets,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.220
covering this 14-year period.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.660
33 or so letters,
compared to the 50

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.700
that we've all known and loved
and studied very closely.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.520
You know, I just felt like there
was this big swath of wisdom

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.730
that was being overlooked,
coming from Buffett at a time

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.840
when he was talking
to his family members.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.550
And he was running
small sums of money.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.250
So the initial
partnership was started

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.450
with seven other people.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.450
$100,000 of their money. $100
that he threw in on his own.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.600
And you know, he also
taught a class at the time.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.000
So I like this slide,
because it sort of shows him

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.090
as the teacher
which he really was.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.680
So it was a very productive
time for Warren Buffett.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.190
You had a 29% compounded
annual rate of return

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.720
over the 14 year period.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.300
He never had a down year.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.640
The markets had several.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.100
He never underperformed
the market.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.600
Right?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.020
Which is just really impressive.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.270
And there's a quote from
1999, which is obviously

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.570
sort of towards the peak of
the NASDAQ, where he said,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.550
if I was running
small sums again

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.640
today, I think I could do a
50% compounded annual return.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.630
And he went as far
as to say that he

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.070
guarantees he could do that.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.720
So you know, there's a
lot to be explored here

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.490
in terms of what you can do when
you truly have a go anywhere,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.650
do anything strategy.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.640
And that's very different
from the position

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.160
that he finds himself in today,
where he's sort of saddled

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.910
with more capital than ideas.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.264
This is the time where his ideas
far outweighed his capital.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.100
Right?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.590
So I've organized
this talk in a way

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.440
that I ripped off from Charlie
Munger, who ripped it off

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.020
from Johnny Carson, you know,
who may have ripped it off

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.910
from Carl Jacobi, the
famous algebrist, who

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.440
had a view that if you really
want to solve a problem,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.241
one great way to go about it
is to invert the question.

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:17.740
Right?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.130
Think about it backwards.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.430
So the talk that
I've put together

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.040
is a few really sound ways to
avoid success in investing.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.740
And the idea is, if you can
just not do these three things,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.780
and I'll unpack
them for you, you're

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.480
going to go a long way
in finding success.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.300
And so let's get started.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.310
So the first one is
about predictions.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.030
We live in a 24-hour
news cycle culture,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.720
where people that claim
themselves to be experts

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.790
are more than happy
to get up on TV

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.590
and hold forth on the outlook
for interest rates, oil

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.350
prices, what's going
to happen with Brexit,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.840
you know, all sort of
backed by a Wall Street

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.454
culture that benefits from
churn in people's portfolio.

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:24.210
And Buffett, as of
the first meeting

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.970
of the partners,
before he even allowed

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.504
them to write the check, said
to them, very specifically,

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:33.420
I am not in the business
of making predictions

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.300
on the general stock market
or business fluctuations.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.970
If you think that I can do
this, or it's even necessary,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.680
the partnership is not for you.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.300
Well, first of all, so a great
way to turn your net worth

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.380
into your broker's
current income

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.280
is to trade every
whim that you have.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.951
You think, OK, I have a view.

00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:09.450
The EU, you know, the UK is
going to leave the Union.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.100
Right?

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.420
So I'm going to sell the market.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.570
That's, like, a terrible idea.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.235
Right?

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:19.850
And the reason for that
is because the world

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.980
is full of radical uncertainty,
and there's a lot of things

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.170
that you can't predict.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.750
So I think one of the
distinguishing factors

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.100
about Buffett from a very
early point in his career

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.290
was that he was very
comfortable saying, you know,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.751
it's OK to have no idea.

00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.250
Right?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.490
And he'll say that up
to today, when it comes

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.500
to interest rates, et cetera.

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:50.130
It's not about being able
to predict everything.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.450
It's about having confidence
in what you're actually

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.330
trying to predict.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.019
And really, the past being the
best source for making guesses

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.810
about what's going to
happen in the future,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.860
and being long term in the
way that you think about it.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.370
So that is number one.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:20.540
The second really great way
to destroy your net worth

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.870
is to use the market as
a source of information

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.560
as to what you think
a business is worth.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.340
The average investor's
experience in the stock market

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.589
is rather poor, right?

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:38.630
I think we all know that.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.710
There's a tendency to
buy high and sell low,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.335
and it's sort of
natural, right, I guess?

00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:49.560
Stanford's got their
first football game

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.420
coming up next Friday, right?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.130
And so if you go
to campus, you want

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.030
to find your way to the
stadium, the best way

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.820
to do that is to sort
of follow the crowd.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.030
That's a natural thing.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:10.450
But in the market, when you're
in agreement with everybody,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.660
that could be a really
dangerous thing.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.160
Right?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.040
Let me back up a bit.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.830
So if you invest in
equity security--

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.270
you buy a stock, right?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.340
I would encourage
you to think of that

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.450
as if you were buying
a proportional share

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.490
in the assets of the company.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.720
Right?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.940
And you should
value that business.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.330
Right?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.840
And hopefully you're
doing it in a field

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.000
that you know
something about, so

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.030
that you can make an
educated guess as to what

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.200
that business is worth.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:01.630
So if you and I got together and
bought a dry cleaning business,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.570
and someone walked
in one day and said,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.840
I'll give you $5.00
for this place.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.970
Right?

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.840
You'd tell him to take
a walk, but it certainly

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.725
wouldn't freak you out, right?

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:17.430
That your dry cleaning
business is only worth $5.00.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.930
Right?

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.960
The same thing is true
about the equity markets.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.480
You can't let a market
quote turn from an asset

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.090
that you can utilize
when it's in your favor

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.265
to a liability that's going
to take you out of the market.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.980
So that comes down
to a concept of what

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.070
I would think of as true north.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.680
Right?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.500
So if you can't use the market
to tell you what something's

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.460
worth-- you can only use the
market as the price at which

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.640
you have the option
of transacting-- then

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.540
you need to be able to value
the business yourself, right?

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.360
And here you have
this wonderful quote

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.450
that basically says,
being right is not

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.650
about being in the crowd.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.580
Being right is not about having
well-respected people agree

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.730
with you.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.550
Being right is about
putting your facts together,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:25.030
and then reasoning them through
in a sound and logical manner.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.660
And if you do that
consistently over time,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.050
that's what's going
to give you success.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.710
So I just think, again, to
Brexit, where all these folks,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.690
they see the television, you
know, oh, my God, the world's

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.690
going to come to an end.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.940
I mean, forests were
felled to create

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.460
the paper on which Wall
Street wrote reports

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.330
about the implications
of Brexit, right?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.180
Literally.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.430
I can't imagine.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.050
And they all end with the same
thing, which is basically,

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.710
I think it's going to bad,
but I really have no idea.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.210
Right?

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.488
That's the conclusion.

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:06.320
So folks that get
scared because of that.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.900
And I think they
get-- it all gets

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:17.300
rather accentuated by the way
it's portrayed in the media.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.410
And ultimately, for
value investors,

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.360
it's about finding
great companies.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.610
Harnessing the power
of compound interest.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.180
You know, Fidelity had this
great story that I just love.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.410
The best performing
Fidelity accounts,

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.690
according to a big
study that they did,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.110
were of the
individuals who forgot

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.891
that they had an account.

00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:38.390
Right?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.180
So trading is not your friend.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.010
Listening to the market
is not your friend.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.630
Try and figure
out what you think

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.440
a business is worth, and
worry about your view

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.500
of its intrinsic value and
how it's changing over time,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.435
and put the market aside.

00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:04.460
One more point I'll make
on this that I really

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.980
enjoy from Buffett's
commentary, is

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:14.130
that risk is oftentimes
a quantifiable notion

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:14.930
to a lot of people.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.430
And Buffett thought
very differently

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.850
from almost the very
beginning, right?

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.760
Risk is not beta.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.060
Beta is the amount by
which a stock squiggles

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.990
over a certain period of time.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.490
Right?

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.630
To Buffet, that's not risk.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.610
Risk is not knowing
what you're doing.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.620
So maybe you have
the wrong facts.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.150
Maybe you've thought
them through in a way

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.990
that was internally unsound.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.520
Maybe something that you didn't
consider came into the picture,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.490
and your hypothesis was wrong.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.000
Right?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.360
Being wrong is risk.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.470
Not knowing what you
don't know is risk.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:09.470
Squiggles don't
matter when you're

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.820
in Buffett's shoes, which
is thinking about companies

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.620
divorced of their stock price.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.590
Willing to cheer for
them to go lower,

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.234
because you don't really care.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:23.650
You don't have to
sell, and you're

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.670
more than happy to buy more.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.410
Buffett found himself
in these positions

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.420
where he would buy a little bit,
and the stock would go down.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.690
And his intrinsic value
estimate didn't change,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.080
so he'd buy a little more.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.130
And it would go down.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.510
And it would do so for years.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.920
And he didn't need the market
to tell him he was right.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.260
It was his own reasoning that
led him to that conclusion.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.710
The third thing that I think
is a really good way to fail

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.240
is to play somebody else's game.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.400
And, you know,
there's going to be

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.900
times where value investors
feel like they are out of sync

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.960
with the market.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.170
And it's really hard,
I think, to stick

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.230
to your philosophy
and your principles

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.410
when you're in the, sort of,
speculative froth of a bull

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.111
market.

00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:20.610
Right?

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.410
So we saw this at the end of
the partnership era, which is,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.980
as we approached 1970, you were
in what they called the "go-go"

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.250
phase of the market.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.830
It was the conglomerate era.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.630
And it just predated
the Nifty Fifty,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.530
if people have heard of that.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.140
But Buffett couldn't
find stuff that

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.940
made sense for him to invest.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.820
And so he returned the capital.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.710
Right?

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.330
The same thing happened
in the tech bubble.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.730
I mean, there was all
sorts of articles about how

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.617
Buffett had lost his way.

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:02.116
Right?

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:06.500
Old fogeyism, you know, knew too
much that was no longer true,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.560
it's a new era, you
know, all this stuff.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:15.252
And he told folks that
nothing had changed,

00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:16.710
and that the market
was overvalued.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:22.160
And so, for the second
time, he issued a warning.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.580
So I think this is really
important to investors,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:33.283
is to really figure out
what you're all about.

00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:36.010
There's been some
really-- people

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:41.220
that I admire so much come
here to speak to you that

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.100
have very different approaches.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.850
And something that I
struggled with quite a bit,

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.390
for a few months, actually,
was thinking about,

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.680
OK, we had young Buffett--
OK, in the early stages he's

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.220
a lot like Tobias
Carlyle was, right?

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.680
He's pure Graham.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.250
He's looking for
statistical cigar

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.760
butts that are super cheap.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.520
Out of favor.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.253
By the end, he's a
lot like Tom Gayner.

00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:08.752
Right?

00:16:08.752 --> 00:16:15.030
Where he's got the majority of
his funds in American Express.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.530
Right?

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.680
He bought Walt Disney.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.980
So he went from buying
Dempster Mill, which

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.000
is a windmill implements company
on the verge of bankruptcy,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.740
to high quality businesses
that were compounding, and were

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.620
compounders in general.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.939
And so the question
is, what should you do?

00:16:35.939 --> 00:16:37.980
So I was trying to think,
OK, what kind of advice

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.920
should I be giving?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.780
And if somebody asked
me what's right?

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.840
And, you know, Tobias has got
great statistics, you know,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.080
he's got all this math that
shows his way is better.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.580
Right?

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.640
But then Tom Gayner's
got this great stat

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.505
on Graham, which is that, yeah,
he bought a lot of cigar butts,

00:16:56.505 --> 00:16:57.130
but guess what?

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.110
He made more money
in GEICO than he

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.280
made in all his other
investments combined.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.369
So if you find one
great compounder,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.819
and you make 19 other
mistakes, you're

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.630
still bound to do wonderfully
well because of the way

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.440
that compound interest works.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:18.480
So the answer that I came to
was that, unfortunately, it

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.829
depends-- what should you do?

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.109
It depends on you.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:22.780
Right?

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.839
Play your game.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.350
Figure out what your
circle of competence is.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.840
What areas are you interested
in, and passionate about?

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.430
Where are you apt to be able to
have an understanding of what

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.557
a business is worth?

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.770
And then, what is your, sort
of, psychological disposition

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.920
to being on this
treadmill of cigar butts?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.560
Because they are sort of
fleeting in their value,

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.840
and you have to be on a
constant search for them.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.530
Which is very different
than what Buffett does now,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.210
or Mr. Gayner does at Markel,
which is buy great businesses

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.900
and sort of sit on your butt.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:18.910
So the other thing I will say
before I close on this topic

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:25.770
is that very early in
the partnership-- 1959,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:33.650
1960-- Buffett put 35%
of the funds in a company

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.010
called Sanborn
Map Company, which

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:44.220
was a mapping business used
in the insurance field.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.700
And the market cap
at the time was

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.470
right around its stated book
equity, of $4 and 1/2 million.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.120
OK?

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.320
So the inflation factor
being seven or eight,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.060
you can be thinking $35
million, market cap.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.700
Now, that is a minuscule thing.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.200
Right?

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:12.680
So the idea of following
Buffett because he bought,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.350
you know, Phillips 66,
that might be great.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.960
But if you are at a position
where you can sort of put

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.640
the Geiger counter over some of
these micro caps, you should.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.080
Because there's a
lot of fertile ground

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.680
where institutions can't go.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.140
So I would just say go anywhere.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.586
Do anything.

00:19:39.586 --> 00:19:43.260
Don't try and copy anybody.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.180
You can look to them to see
what you like about what they're

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.190
doing, what resonates with you.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.230
But like Guy Spier
said when he was here,

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.310
don't try to be Warren Buffett.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.350
Try to be the best Guy Spier.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.320
Or try to be the
best Jeremy Miller.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.150
Because that's
really the only way

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.550
that you're going to be able to
make it through the tough times

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:11.040
when your strategy
is-- inevitably,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.200
you're going to come through
times where it gets hard.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.480
So to invert the inversion, you
really need to think long term,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.170
and get yourself away from
making predictions, especially

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.860
short term predictions.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.700
Forget the market.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.940
Carefully assemble the facts.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.350
Apply sound reasoning.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.557
Come up with your own
value-- your own view

00:20:34.557 --> 00:20:35.640
of what something's worth.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.190
And be confident in it
before you do anything.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.500
Because if you're not
confident in your view,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.840
you're going to get shaken
out of your position.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.070
And then third is, figure out
what kind of investor you are.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.910
What suits you, from a
temperament perspective,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.330
and play that game.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.750
Don't play someone else's game.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:04.770
So with that, I thought
I'd stop and see

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.394
if there's any questions.

00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:08.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and see what happens?

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:09.685
JEREMY MILLER: Yeah,
so the question

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:14.280
is sort of the continuum
by which Buffett was active

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.880
and engaged with his companies
during the partnership era

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.036
versus today.

00:21:20.036 --> 00:21:21.110
Is that fair?

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.460
And so what I would say,
interestingly enough, is,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.070
so-- you know, Buffett
came out of Columbia,

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.610
where he studied with Graham.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.110
Right?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.005
And then he begged Graham
for a couple years for a job

00:21:35.005 --> 00:21:38.390
at Graham-Newman, and
he ended up getting one.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.890
Right?

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.870
And at Graham-Newman,
it was very much

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.190
the way that you described.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.148
Initially, this sort of
hands-off off approach.

00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:47.510
Because Graham had this
view that you should

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.930
be able to just read
the Intelligent Investor

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.000
and securities analysis and
make money, and it would be,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.540
kind of, we're trying to
prove that to people, so

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.570
don't go talk to
management teams,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:05.170
or get one-on-one access to
these things, and so forth.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:13.040
But then, as soon as Buffett
started the partnership,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.540
he moved away from that.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.830
And what he did was, he had
three categories of investing,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.330
right?

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.150
One was called the "Generals."

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.560
These were generally
undervalued securities,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.364
these ultra-cheap cigar
butt-type things, right?

00:22:26.364 --> 00:22:28.280
And then he had "Workouts,"
which is basically

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.345
just risk arbitrage.

00:22:29.345 --> 00:22:30.990
You know, one company
buys the other,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.800
so you bet that the
transaction closes.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.580
And then the third category was
actually born out of the first.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.020
So the Generals--
so, for instance,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.260
I mentioned Sanborn Map. $4
and 1/2 million market cap.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.230
Right?

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:50.960
So over time, he
comes to acquire 20%.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.530
Gets together with some
other friends, gets 40%.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.020
Forces his way onto the board.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.080
Now, Sanborn Map was unique
because it was asset rich.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.690
It had all these
securities in its portfolio

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.807
that it didn't need.

00:23:02.807 --> 00:23:04.640
It was just making so
much money for so long

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.580
that they bought
stocks and bonds.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.865
The board was
comprised of people

00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:10.490
from the insurance
industry that didn't

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.190
own any shares in the company.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.540
They didn't care.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.652
So if you've read "Snowball,"
you know, this story

00:23:17.652 --> 00:23:18.970
is in that.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.860
He forces his way on to the
board, threatens a proxy,

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:29.002
does an exchange for his
shares in Sanborn Map

00:23:29.002 --> 00:23:30.210
for the securities portfolio.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.390
Makes a very nice return.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.470
Avoids some taxes.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:40.570
So even back then, he
was very willing to do

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:44.890
what it takes to unlock
the value, if he had to.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.370
So I kind of think of that
as-- him as an activist.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.120
Later on, he would buy
full controlling positions

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.420
in companies.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.665
So maybe just one
last point on that,

00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:02.340
that I think you
might find interesting

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.590
is that Buffett seamlessly moves
between the world of business

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.400
and investing.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.900
Right?

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.040
So a portfolio manager takes
a pile of capital-- people

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.550
give them money, right?

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.650
That portfolio manager then
selects the best stocks

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.470
that they can find to earn
the highest return possible.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.480
Well, Buffett thinks the
same way about a CEO.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.320
A CEO has a pile of capital.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.040
It's in the form of the assets
of the company, the working

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.260
capital of the
company, et cetera.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.690
You know, the cash.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.330
And says, how are we going
to deploy these assets

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.330
to their highest and best use?

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.220
AUDIENCE: So an alternate
approach that may be something

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.950
that, say, a Tom Gayner would
propose is to study business

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.010
that are good quality,
and Buffett has this knack

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.390
of making everything look very
easy, but it actually isn't.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.560
And so maybe instead
of doing what Buffett

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.460
did in his early years,
just study good businesses,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.097
and whenever you have a Brexit,
you just buy those businesses

00:25:00.097 --> 00:25:00.930
and hang on to them.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.590
And obviously, you're not going
to make 30% annualized returns,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.090
but for most people, if
you do it over 30 years,

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.720
I don't need to make
30% annualized to do OK.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.190
What do you think
of that approach?

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.030
JEREMY MILLER: Fabulous.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.363
I think that's a great approach.

00:25:14.363 --> 00:25:18.110
I mean, if you can identify
the field in which--

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.910
if you can identify
a field of securities

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.930
that you think you
understand and can value,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.230
then you can also identify
the price at which they'll

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:30.200
offer you the compounded rate
of return that you're after.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.670
And that you think maybe
you're entitled to.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.250
And what I mean by that is,
if interest rates are at 10%,

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.350
you know, the demanded
rate of return

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.610
that you're going to
expect from the investment

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.130
is going to be higher
than if they're 2%.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.740
Right?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.920
But if you have a field
of, say, 25 businesses that

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.890
have public equities
associated with them,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.460
you can value those
businesses, and then

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.960
determine the price
at which they're

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.840
going to offer you
the rate of return

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.230
that you think you need
to make the investment.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:06.140
I think Buffett always used 15.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.530
I think now, with the
size of his capital,

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.070
it's dropped down closer to 10.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.550
But if you're not
operating with billions,

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.860
then maybe 15 is
the right number.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.610
But whatever that is, I think
that's a great strategy.

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.329
Especially if it suits you.

00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:26.870
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
regarding what you're saying,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.350
versus, I guess, what you
call the efficient market

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:34.150
theory, which is, really,
no individual can actually

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.970
get more information
from the system,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.228
you know, legally, than anybody
else, and it's all built in.

00:26:39.228 --> 00:26:42.310
And in particular,
people do talk

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:47.130
about how almost nobody can
do better than the indexes.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.530
And of course there is
two counterexamples,

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.540
which is Peter Lynch of
Magellan, and Warren Buffett,

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.810
of course.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.550
And then people say,
well, Warren Buffett, you

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.560
can't really count him,
because he actually

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.090
goes and, like you
said, gets on the boards

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.370
and helps manage the company.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:09.550
So he personally takes a role in
making the company successful.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.670
Which, obviously,
most of us can't do.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.720
And then Peter Lynch, he
had a very strong run.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.220
But then once he
got out of Magellan

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:20.900
and started predicting stocks,
his private portfolio actually

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.870
didn't beat the market.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.820
So even-- and I would say all
of us here, we work at Google,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.560
and yet even we--
and so we think

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.810
we probably know something
about the internet business

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.890
and whatnot-- and even
I think most of us

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.050
are pretty astounded by
the way Google's performed,

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.650
and continues to perform, and
even I'm here for many years,

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.030
I have no idea what's
going to happen

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.440
in the internet business, in
the sales and advertising market

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.070
and so forth.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.110
So I'm not sure how I
would even apply the things

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.880
that you're saying personally,
even being in the business

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.467
that I'm in.

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:55.300
JEREMY MILLER: Sure.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.060
So let me try and unpack
that a little bit.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.180
So, you know, Buffett's best
rebuttal to efficient market

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.664
theory is, it was a
speech that he gave called

00:28:07.664 --> 00:28:09.580
"The Superinvestors of
Graham-and-Doddsville,"

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.540
where he played out a scenario
of a national coin-flipping

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.870
contest, where
everybody flipped a coin

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.610
and, you know, the
iterations went daily

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:23.920
until there were 20
or so left, and said

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.310
that wouldn't it be awful
weird if all 20 came

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.070
from the same town?

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.180
Right?

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.330
And then he outlined
the results of what

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.960
he called "The Superinvestors
of Graham-and-Doddsville," which

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.880
were basically a
collection of people that

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.090
studied under Graham, or
were heavily influenced

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:46.440
by his teachings.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.760
I will say that during
the partnership years,

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.670
there was no index
investing, right?

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.710
That hadn't been invented yet.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.480
But even then, Buffett was
making the case that if you

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:09.060
can't outperform the market--
the index, the general results

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.060
of the Dow Jones, which is
what was the primary one;

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.710
I guess S&amp;P today--
then you shouldn't

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.720
be investing actively.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.370
It is the onus of the active
investor to outperform,

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.840
and those who can't
outperform are

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:36.240
doing a disservice to their
investors by being active,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.750
right?

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.980
In terms of how
you personally can

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:50.150
go about taking on a value
approach would be to do,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.080
one, exactly what you
started with, which is,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:59.950
reject things that you don't
think that you can really

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.700
have a strong view
upon, in terms of how

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.770
the future is going to unfold.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:10.472
You know, it may be very
different than, perhaps,

00:30:10.472 --> 00:30:14.950
buying a dry cleaner that
has an advantaged position

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.370
next to the train
station in the town,

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.980
that-- in the commuter
town, and whatever.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.250
XYZ America.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:24.750
Right?

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:30.120
So looking at the stocks
as businesses, I think,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.170
is the best way to do it.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.310
When you have a strong view of
what those businesses are worth

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.390
and you're presented with
prices in the market that

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.670
are different than that, I
think that's the essence of it.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.690
And what those will be will be
dependent on your own circle

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.500
of competence-- what you know,
and are capable of valuing.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.970
Which I'm sure is a lot, when
you start to think about it.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.310
SORAB: We were talking-- you
were alluding to it, I think,

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.170
before you began the talk.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:05.110
And I was just thinking, for the
benefit of the audience here,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.770
in doing such a deep study
of his early years, what

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.310
are things that stood
out to you, in terms

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.230
of-- things that have impacted
you at a personal level?

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.570
Not just in investing,
but maybe-- in any aspect.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.500
And if that question
were put to you,

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.640
what would stand out to you?

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.050
JEREMY MILLER: The
way that Buffett

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:31.240
went about structuring
the partnership,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:38.270
communicating to his investors,
was sort of high class,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.770
from the very beginning.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.480
There was a lot of
integrity, and it really

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.680
shines through the letters.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.940
That would be one thing.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.350
But from a practical
perspective,

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.250
in terms of what really
changed the way that I think

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:57.270
about investing
as a participant,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:03.350
would be this idea of a
business as a pile of capital.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.240
So look to see where
the assets are.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.170
What's the, sort
of, return that's

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.010
being generated on those assets?

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.390
Are they optimized?

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.070
Right?

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:18.350
Look at the businesses, if
you own the whole thing.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.400
Even though, when
you buy the security,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.270
you buy your proportional share.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.130
What is the whole thing worth?

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.630
Right?

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.170
If you go to Yahoo Finance
to look at a company,

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.020
don't look at the share price.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.500
Look at the market cap.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.000
Right?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.011
What's the whole business worth?

00:32:34.011 --> 00:32:34.510
Right?

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:39.460
And then, if I buy my
fraction of the business,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:45.070
am I getting a discount
or am I overpaying?

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.502
So, you know, the
fungibility of the capital,

00:32:48.502 --> 00:32:54.700
the idea that business
and investing is

00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:00.490
sort of very much-- the
difference between the two

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.552
is sort of false.

00:33:02.552 --> 00:33:03.264
In a way.

00:33:03.264 --> 00:33:04.680
And then, I guess,
the other thing

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.040
would be to think long term.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:07.640
OK?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.850
So compound interest
requires patience.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:15.160
It doesn't really kick in
until, like, six, seven years,

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.320
depending on the rate.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.410
But once it goes, it's the
most powerful force there is.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.360
That's why Buffett used to
joke that his haircuts were

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.420
costing him $200,000 apiece.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.030
Right?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.560
Because if he had
foregone the haircut

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.939
and put the money in the fund--
you know, he said $200,000.

00:33:33.939 --> 00:33:35.980
When I did the math, I
came to, like, $2 million.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.410
But the point's the same.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.249
AUDIENCE: I've found it
very hard to reconcile

00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:42.290
two of Buffett's sayings.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.123
And I think you referred
to one today, which

00:33:44.123 --> 00:33:47.310
is, if I were managing
$10 million or so,

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.210
you know, I think I could make
50%-- oh, never mind, I think

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.530
I can guarantee it, right?

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.240
And then, I think, after he
started Berkshire Hathaway

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.110
as a public company,
he's kept on emphasizing

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.410
it's far better to buy
a wonderful business

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.010
at a fair price than a fair
business at a wonderful price.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:05.510
Right?

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.840
And he goes on to say, there's
never just one cockroach

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.396
in the kitchen.

00:34:09.396 --> 00:34:11.670
And buying Berkshire
as a textile mill

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.969
was one of the worst mistakes
he's ever made in his life.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.530
So I found these
hard to reconcile.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.219
I'm sure you've
thought about this.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:20.139
I'd like your thoughts on this.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:20.972
JEREMY MILLER: Yeah.

00:34:20.972 --> 00:34:26.080
Well, you know, Charlie Munger,
the Vice-chair of Berkshire,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.900
was asked a similar question.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.190
And his answer
was, it turned out

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.420
we could buy great
businesses, and it only

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.210
cost us a couple points
of compounding a year.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.251
And what a better life?

00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:40.750
Right?

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:47.610
So I think about this
Sanborn situation

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.449
all the time, because it
was such a small company.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:50.949
Right?

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:54.219
I mean, you could
almost envision

00:34:54.219 --> 00:35:00.170
a group of individuals getting
a controlling stake in a company

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.200
that had a market cap of
$5 million or $10 million.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.330
I mean, that could happen today.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:06.930
Right?

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.930
That's what he was doing.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.390
So I think if he's
saying, oh, OK,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.140
if I had a couple
million bucks, you know,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.130
I could find these companies.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.620
Maybe they have a $5
million market cap.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.120
Right?

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.600
Maybe they just need
to be shut down,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.495
or maybe they need to
be sold, or maybe they

00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:26.070
need-- but you could engineer
these type of returns.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.910
I think that's what he means.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.850
But for the lifestyle
that he wanted

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:37.910
to live-- if you want to have a
diary with your weekly schedule

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.900
that, you know, is
blank, except for, like,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.831
Thursday at 2:00-- haircut.

00:35:42.831 --> 00:35:43.330
Right?

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.767
Compounders is a really
good way to do it.

00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:48.350
You know, he made a
much better return

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.290
in a company called Dempster
Mill, which he liquidated,

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.890
effectively.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:57.450
And then deincorporated,
to avoid tax.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.860
And he made a great
return on that.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.470
But, you know, the town
of Beatrice, Nebraska,

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:07.000
had headlines about Buffett
the Liquidator all the time.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.080
And that's not any
panacea in terms

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.420
of how you want to live
your life and be seen.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:17.780
So once he was already rich,
I think he sort of latched

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.860
onto this idea, even though
it wasn't maybe the optimal,

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.007
from a return perspective.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:32.160
AUDIENCE: I saw a paper, a quote
that Buffett [INAUDIBLE], which

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.270
attributed, like, a part of
Buffett [INAUDIBLE] return

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.340
to his leveraging
in his portfolio.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.680
Maybe he [INAUDIBLE]
like an insurance float.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.360
I wonder, do you know,
like, how much leverage

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.437
in his early portfolio?

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.270
JEREMY MILLER: Yeah.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:53.010
So the leverage that he used
was only in the Workouts.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:57.110
So within the
merger arb business,

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:00.180
right-- Company A buys
Company B. If it goes through,

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.550
there's this spread-- usually
it's a couple percentage

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.420
points, but, you know,
the window is short.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.900
So if you annualize that, it
gets to, like, six or seven.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.970
But then if you put three
turns of leverage on it,

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.250
then you're looking
at 18 or whatever,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.576
something along those lines.

00:37:18.576 --> 00:37:23.070
So when he was doing
those types of things

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:27.350
and had high degree of certainty
that they would actually

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.740
close-- and you know, he did
them sort of sporadically.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.190
A lot of these merger arb
shops do a ton of these deals.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.340
But he did a few years,
something like that.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.580
He was highly confident.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.470
And, you know, he
would leverage those.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.155
But the rest of the
portfolio was unlevered.

00:37:45.155 --> 00:37:46.530
AUDIENCE: You
spent a lot of time

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.400
or alluded to
Buffett's skill sort

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.180
of as a manager, whether it's
through special situations,

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.730
sort of like debt workouts, and
you can gain outsized returns

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:55.530
from that.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.071
But I was wondering
how you'd respond

00:37:57.071 --> 00:37:59.980
to Andrea Frazzini and some
of the other people at AQR

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.200
who wrote a paper a few years
ago, discussing, sort of, where

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.440
does Buffett's
performance come from?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.520
Like, why he had a 0.76 alpha?

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.440
Why, exactly, was he able
to gain such high returns

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.380
at a relatively low volatility?

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.900
And so they had
done the analysis.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.780
And so they looked,
one, at his skill

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.400
as, like, stock selection.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.510
And two, his skill
as, like, a manager

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.140
in these type of situations.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.060
And he concluded that it
was due to-- it was actually

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.350
the former-- his stock
selection ability, whether it

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:35.520
was being able to pick low
beta stocks, companies who

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.260
had a high quality, his very
consistent growth, high payout

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.900
ratios-- rather than
his ability as a manager

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.120
to manage private
companies, to navigate

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.430
corporate
restructuring and such.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.460
And I even believe they
also attributed it partly

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.290
to his high leverage.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.932
So they had leverage
of 1.6 to 1.

00:38:52.932 --> 00:38:54.390
And so this is
calculating leverage

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.210
as assets minus excess
cash divided by equity,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.930
rather than how you
did it, with-- I

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.096
think you were mentioning,
like, three turns, right?

00:39:01.096 --> 00:39:04.070
And that's using
EBITDA as a multiple.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.560
So basically, the
central point is

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.480
that they did a
statistical analysis,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.630
and they were able to account
for his high alpha due

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.960
to his ability as
a stock selection,

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.640
rather than his ability to
actually have somebody use debt

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.860
workouts, merger arb, or
any of these other, I guess,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.640
more exclusive methods.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.500
JEREMY MILLER: Yeah.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.380
Great question.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.910
And just to be clear, when
we talk about leverage,

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.280
we're talking about it
on the same basis, right?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.960
So the amount of assets
that's being controlled

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.250
by a given amount of equity.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.749
Right?

00:39:34.749 --> 00:39:38.960
So if we've got a 6% return
and we lever it three times,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.820
that means we're controlling
three times as much assets

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.700
with a given amount of equity.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.400
And that's what
gives you your 18%.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.490
And there wasn't a lot of risk
arb in the Berkshire years.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.650
There was some.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.850
And he wrote about
it in the '70s.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.810
But the main thrust of your
point is absolutely accurate.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:08.950
The qualities of the businesses
that he has been involved in

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.570
have been rather
consistent over time.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:16.010
It's financials, it's branded,
it's consumer companies,

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.770
and others where
he feels like he

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.240
has a view on what
the business is

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.290
likely to earn 10 years from
now, with not a lot of--

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.540
or I should say,
with what he thinks

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.985
is a high degree of certainty.

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:33.110
That he can know what the
business is going to look

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.070
like in the future.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:39.500
And so those kind of things have
factors associated with them.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:46.200
So whether it's volatility,
or the actual underlying

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.170
volatility of the business
itself, et cetera.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:55.100
And then the leverage
factor is a huge piece.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.990
Because not only
did he have leverage

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.600
from the float of the insurance
company-- which, by the way,

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.740
was purchased for Berkshire
while it was a portfolio

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.250
holding of the
partnership-- but also

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.530
through the leverage
of the deferred tax

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.660
liability associated with
the unrealized capital gains

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.460
on the securities portfolio.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:25.660
So we can talk about Buffett
and avoiding leverage.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.570
But really what
he's talking about

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.770
is leverage that has a
due date, or leverage

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.470
that has a coupon
associated with it--

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.130
a principal payment, an interest
payment associated with it.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:42.200
So, you know, float, when
underwritten properly,

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.620
tends to come for Berkshire
at a near free cost.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.140
And of course the
deferred tax liabilities

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.830
don't bear interest either.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.530
So I think you're right.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:58.480
But I would also
say that I think

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.460
it's easy-- it's
not easy, but you

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.640
can do the statistical analysis,
and run the regressions

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.686
and see what the factors
were that led to the success.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.230
There's a reason why
there's one Warren Buffett.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.730
Right?

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.810
So I don't know if
I would necessarily

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:23.400
think that we could just do a
[? comp ?] model and replicate

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.966
Buffett if we started today
with the same factors.

00:42:25.966 --> 00:42:28.920
AUDIENCE: Well, so
part of the argument

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.981
is, it's not like the
private companies are--

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.480
JEREMY MILLER: Oh,
oh, sorry, sorry.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.140
Let me address that.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.640
OK.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.350
So I agree with
you there as well,

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.434
and I don't think Buffett
wanted to ever get active.

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:41.600
Nor did he think it was his
skill set to get active.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.680
I don't think today
he wants to be active.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.530
The managers don't
call in to Buffett

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:51.475
once a month to give
the numbers and say,

00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:53.600
you know, here's what I'm
doing, what do you think?

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.225
And Buffett says, OK, well, you
should get your working capital

00:42:56.225 --> 00:42:58.820
down, or you've got too many
fixed assets, or whatever.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.200
He says, give me great
managers, and then

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.820
let them run their business.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.850
Right?

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.940
And that's sort of his MO now.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.960
So he's not really claiming
to be a great cast iron

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.370
forger, so he's going to buy
precision cast parts-- you

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.300
know, the most recent
deal he did, $40 billion

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.080
or so-- you know.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.890
It's not that-- he bought
the manager and the company.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.600
So I think he has
a lot more to say

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.690
about how the capital
gets allocated

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.300
than how the business is run.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.710
And that's really where
he adds the value.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:37.950
AUDIENCE: If you look from
the '60s to the late '90s,

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.780
the majority of the returns came
from a handful of businesses.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.390
American Express in the
'60s, and then See's

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.142
Candies, Coca-Cola,
American Express again.

00:43:48.142 --> 00:43:52.410
And primarily the
reason being that he

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.410
had a very concentrated bet.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.350
American Express
was some 30%, 40%,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:03.720
and Coke was, I think,
over 20% of the capital.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.360
And GEICO also was a
pretty significant bet.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.880
So when he made
these investments,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.390
they were out of favor, and
he had a differentiated view.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.670
And the differentiated view
came from he doing scuttlebutt

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.810
on these companies that
gave him these kind

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.390
of differentiated point of view.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.690
You know, the security
I like the best,

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.400
and American Express
he went around

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.780
and did all the scuttlebutt.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.170
So my point being is,
from those lessons,

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.940
seems like concentration,
scuttlebutt,

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.136
if I am going to be a stock
picker, are important.

00:44:39.136 --> 00:44:41.520
What are lessons
from there that we

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.750
can do today apply if I am
an active investing picking

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.526
stocks, and I-- if
concentrated is the way to go?

00:44:48.526 --> 00:44:50.830
The counter-- just to
complete the sentence-- is,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:53.940
the counter being
lots of hedge funds

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.430
thought that they had a
differentiated point of view,

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.910
and they were all in Valeant.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:59.680
And it was a concentrated bet.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.450
It could always go
the other way and kill

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.420
decades of compounding.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.490
JEREMY MILLER: Yeah.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:05.990
Absolutely.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.073
Love that question, right?

00:45:07.073 --> 00:45:09.550
So Sequoia Funds, right?

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.360
Taken down,
effectively, reputation

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.980
was dismantled by
Valeant, was created

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.890
because Buffett's
partnership closed.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:19.224
The investors who wanted
to maintain their exposure

00:45:19.224 --> 00:45:21.640
to the equity market, even
though Buffett was recommending

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.930
that they didn't do that,
he gave them the option.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.730
Bill Ruane was there.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:32.250
Started Sequoia for
the partnership,

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.310
so that people who
wanted to stay in, could.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.460
Basically following
this same strategy,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:44.596
which is sort of like a-- it's
like an Icarus strategy, right?

00:45:44.596 --> 00:45:46.470
I mean, you're flying
awful close to the sun.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.810
It improves the returns.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.060
Your question sort of
framed it very well.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.980
Part of the reason
for the success

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:58.380
was he was concentrated
in the right stuff.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.610
Right?

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:04.520
Part of the reason for the
downfall of the Sequoia Funds

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.390
was that they were concentrated
in the wrong stuff.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.470
Right?

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:14.180
So it works really well as long
as you don't make a mistake,

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.130
I guess is the point.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:21.190
So the degree to which you have
the confidence in what you're

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.760
doing should determine the
degree of concentration

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.130
that you're willing to accept.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.630
Because if it goes
wrong, it's going

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.590
to go horribly wrong
if you're concentrated,

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:33.150
and it's recoverable.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.190
SORAB: Jeremy, when
I was asking you,

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.970
alluding to the
same issue earlier,

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.300
you mentioned a brilliant
Ben Graham quote

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.060
about Warren Buffett.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.420
JEREMY MILLER: Oh, right, yeah.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:50.850
So Graham was asked
about what Buffett

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:55.390
had become in terms of his
quality compounder strategy.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:47:00.080
And he said, I can understand
why you're doing it.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.700
But it's harder.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.350
Right?

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:07.510
So I think that's for everybody
to decide on their own,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:12.920
whether they find it to be
in their nature to be more

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:18.740
like Buffett of 25, 26,
27 years old, or more

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:24.472
like Buffett at age 40, or
age 84, like he is today.

00:47:24.472 --> 00:47:26.680
SORAB: Thank you so much
once again for being with us

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.180
here today.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.800
This was amazing.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.650
JEREMY MILLER: Thank you.
