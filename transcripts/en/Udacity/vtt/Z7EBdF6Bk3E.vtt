00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You're changing the way you're
doing locking, however. &gt;&gt;Right.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For the same reason a single node failing means
that we lose the entire site because of the locking.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Moving locking into something called Zookeeper,
which implements a tree system

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
with guaranteed order of operations on
those and with that, you build locking.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.169
And the main advantage of Zookeeper
is that it has much higher availabilities.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.000
If we lose a Zookeeper node, we should be
able to come back within 200 milliseconds,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as opposed to whenever somebody notices
the cache is down and replaces it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes. In generally, an engineer cannot
respond at 200 milliseconds. &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Even the best. Zookeeper is a new system,
and this is a separate system? &gt;&gt;Right.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Yeah. It's an Apache project, like Cassandra is.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is there one Zookeeper box, is there
a bunch of Zookeeper boxes?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So they form an ensemble and the way it works
is there's a master and the others are sort of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
read replicants and if the master fails,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it'll automatically elect a new
leader among the ensemble.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Okay. So do all the request go
to one machine? &gt;&gt;No.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You write to any of them so your client could
reconnect to any one of them. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And they automatically figure out
who to talk to. &gt;&gt;Cool.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now is Zookeeper just for locking or does it do--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We're also going to be moving dynamic
configuration type stuff in the Zookeeper

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and the Zookeeper provides watches on the
nodes so the apps can actually get notification

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.169
when something changes in the Zookeeper. We can
say we're going to change the add on the front page.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:46.569
We just set something in Zookeeper
and all the apps update themselves.

00:01:46.584 --> 00:01:50.584
That reminds me of one thing that was
always a challenge, and I don't know

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:54.000
the answer to this one already is
when we had all these app servers,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the app servers had all the configuration. A lot of
the configuration was basically part of the code.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
One example would be how many memcache
boxes you have, because the memcache

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
library would exist on the app servers and that's
where the hashing would happen, for example.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.461
If you're deploying a new configuration, once
you have more than a couple app servers

00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.000
often deploys take time--where I think
still happen at the same time.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.523
Right! &gt;&gt;And so all of a sudden, you've got half
your app servers with a different configuration.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:25.646
That gets weird--let's say you're adding a new
memcache and all of a sudden you've got

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:30.000
half your machines accessing one set of machines
and half of the machines accessing another

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
set of machines, static files hashed--
like everything is weird.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Have you guys improved that at all?
&gt;&gt;No. That will be the Zookeeper.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Zookeeper will help? &gt;&gt;Yeah. You can put like what database is there and all that kind of stuff.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And the reason you don't want to just
do that in like memcache, for example,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is that you would need to fetch that
from memcache on every request

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.107
because there's no way to know that it changed.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:54.000
Because memcache is--all the queries
are initiated from the apps. &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Set this, get this--Zookeeper will actually
push that ability. &gt;&gt;Yes. &gt;&gt;That's cool.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I never look at Zookeeper, so may be it's
something I should get smart about.
