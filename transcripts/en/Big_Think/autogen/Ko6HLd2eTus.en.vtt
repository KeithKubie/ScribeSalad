the trends that I'm seeing today well

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490
the trends that I'm seeing today well
 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.740
the trends that I'm seeing today well
first of all I think it's absolutely

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750
first of all I think it's absolutely
 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.459
first of all I think it's absolutely
fascinating how the word

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469
fascinating how the word
 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.080
fascinating how the word
environmentalist and the the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090
environmentalist and the the
 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.400
environmentalist and the the
environmental movement let's say has

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410
environmental movement let's say has
 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.540
environmental movement let's say has
gone from something really ghetto wised

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550
gone from something really ghetto wised
 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.139
gone from something really ghetto wised
even 10 years ago I think it was easily

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149
even 10 years ago I think it was easily
 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.600
even 10 years ago I think it was easily
demonized and you could say

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610
demonized and you could say
 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.530
demonized and you could say
environmentalist and you could really

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540
environmentalist and you could really
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.830
environmentalist and you could really
dismiss someone pretty easily to today

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840
dismiss someone pretty easily to today
 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.849
dismiss someone pretty easily to today
where I mean every multinational

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859
where I mean every multinational
 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.380
where I mean every multinational
corporation is figuring out how to to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390
corporation is figuring out how to to
 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.119
corporation is figuring out how to to
market themselves as green or

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129
market themselves as green or
 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.720
market themselves as green or
sustainable or environmental and you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
sustainable or environmental and you
 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.279
sustainable or environmental and you
know you could argue that it's being

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289
know you could argue that it's being
 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.069
know you could argue that it's being
co-opted and commercialized in such a

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079
co-opted and commercialized in such a
 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.239
co-opted and commercialized in such a
way that doesn't even have meaning

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249
way that doesn't even have meaning
 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.959
way that doesn't even have meaning
anymore and the effect of it is of these

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969
anymore and the effect of it is of these
 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.600
anymore and the effect of it is of these
kind of green or sustainable like acts

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610
kind of green or sustainable like acts
 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.870
kind of green or sustainable like acts
are really meaningless because they have

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
are really meaningless because they have
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.149
are really meaningless because they have
so little effect or they're so minimal

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159
so little effect or they're so minimal
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.770
so little effect or they're so minimal
in comparison to the crisis that we're

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780
in comparison to the crisis that we're
 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.740
in comparison to the crisis that we're
facing but I think it's a positive thing

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750
facing but I think it's a positive thing
 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.900
facing but I think it's a positive thing
that that people are taking it seriously

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910
that that people are taking it seriously
 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.820
that that people are taking it seriously
and but it if you if you just just

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830
and but it if you if you just just
 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.770
and but it if you if you just just
looked at that cultural shift I think

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780
looked at that cultural shift I think
 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.030
looked at that cultural shift I think
it's pretty phenomenal how quickly

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040
it's pretty phenomenal how quickly
 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.030
it's pretty phenomenal how quickly
people's mindsets can change given the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040
people's mindsets can change given the
 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.920
people's mindsets can change given the
circumstances that we live in so I think

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
circumstances that we live in so I think
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.440
circumstances that we live in so I think
that's one thing for sure in terms of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
that's one thing for sure in terms of
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.390
that's one thing for sure in terms of
architecture and an art I'm I'm I'm

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400
architecture and an art I'm I'm I'm
 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.060

amazed at how far we've come from 20

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
amazed at how far we've come from 20
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.440
amazed at how far we've come from 20
years ago when i was in architecture

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
years ago when i was in architecture
 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.270
years ago when i was in architecture
school to this time of kind of these

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
school to this time of kind of these
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.880
school to this time of kind of these
superstar architects and this I think

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890
superstar architects and this I think
 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.270
superstar architects and this I think
these a lot of empty formalism which

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
these a lot of empty formalism which
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.370
these a lot of empty formalism which
maybe I referred to previously about

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380
maybe I referred to previously about
 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.860
maybe I referred to previously about
just beauty and aesthetics to I think I

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870
just beauty and aesthetics to I think I
 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.110

think we're living in a moving towards a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120
think we're living in a moving towards a
 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.910
think we're living in a moving towards a
very sophisticated time in architecture

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920
very sophisticated time in architecture
 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.490
very sophisticated time in architecture
and design specifically where I am

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500
and design specifically where I am
 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.979
and design specifically where I am
amazed to see even how how architecture

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989
amazed to see even how how architecture
 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.740
amazed to see even how how architecture
and design are talked about in the press

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750
and design are talked about in the press
 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.540
and design are talked about in the press
where we think we expect a lot more from

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550
where we think we expect a lot more from
 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.070
where we think we expect a lot more from
architecture and design than we did in

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
architecture and design than we did in
 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.199
architecture and design than we did in
the 70s and 80s and I think people are

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209
the 70s and 80s and I think people are
 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.300
the 70s and 80s and I think people are
more savvy about it and and they're more

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
more savvy about it and and they're more
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.580
more savvy about it and and they're more
critical and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
critical and
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.290
critical and
people feel more comfortable talking

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300
people feel more comfortable talking
 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.110
people feel more comfortable talking
about it and demanding more from the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
about it and demanding more from the
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.460
about it and demanding more from the
world that we live in in terms of the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470
world that we live in in terms of the
 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.780
world that we live in in terms of the
architecture and design we're creating

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
architecture and design we're creating
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.600
architecture and design we're creating
the world of art I think it's it's a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
the world of art I think it's it's a
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.280
the world of art I think it's it's a
very different world it's a it's a very

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
very different world it's a it's a very
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.570
very different world it's a it's a very
different discourse that's happening

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580
different discourse that's happening
 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.770
different discourse that's happening
there and I think I I I guess my biggest

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
there and I think I I I guess my biggest
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.449
there and I think I I I guess my biggest
disappointment in in the art world

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459
disappointment in in the art world
 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.839
disappointment in in the art world
today's is the commercial system that

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849
today's is the commercial system that
 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.470
today's is the commercial system that
props it up and I think I think we're

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
props it up and I think I think we're
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.880
props it up and I think I think we're
we're all suffering from from it in some

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890
we're all suffering from from it in some
 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.559
we're all suffering from from it in some
ways I think I think a more critical

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569
ways I think I think a more critical
 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.780
ways I think I think a more critical
thoughtful and powerful art would would

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
thoughtful and powerful art would would
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.410
thoughtful and powerful art would would
emerge if if the is the contemporary

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420
emerge if if the is the contemporary

opened up or if the artist started to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620
opened up or if the artist started to
 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.990
opened up or if the artist started to
question it more or find other ways to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000
question it more or find other ways to
 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.500
question it more or find other ways to
practice I think I think today more than

practice I think I think today more than
 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.330
practice I think I think today more than
ever we need artists and we need

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340
ever we need artists and we need
 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.119
ever we need artists and we need
architects who are really powerful

the little boxes that are made for them
 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.370
the little boxes that are made for them
or given to them when they go into

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380
or given to them when they go into
 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.699
or given to them when they go into
school or indoctrinated into and take

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709
school or indoctrinated into and take
 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.259
school or indoctrinated into and take
charge of their practices and take

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269
charge of their practices and take
 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.550
charge of their practices and take
charge of the way there they're

operating in the world and I think I

think today in in the art world I was

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230
think today in in the art world I was
 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.420
think today in in the art world I was
starting to see that open up and I do

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
starting to see that open up and I do
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.099
starting to see that open up and I do
think actually with with this whitney

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109
think actually with with this whitney
 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.479
think actually with with this whitney
biennial we're starting to see it open

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489
biennial we're starting to see it open
 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.150
biennial we're starting to see it open
up we're starting to see you know a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
up we're starting to see you know a
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.710
up we're starting to see you know a
large percentage of the artists in the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720
large percentage of the artists in the
 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.120
large percentage of the artists in the
show aren't roads that represented

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130
show aren't roads that represented
 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.770
show aren't roads that represented
commercially and don't show at galleries

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
commercially and don't show at galleries
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.379
commercially and don't show at galleries
but have really complicated practices

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389
but have really complicated practices
 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.580
but have really complicated practices
that take them out into the real world

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
that take them out into the real world
 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.280
that take them out into the real world
in ways that we haven't seen as much

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290
in ways that we haven't seen as much
 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.060
in ways that we haven't seen as much
before which i think is very exciting
