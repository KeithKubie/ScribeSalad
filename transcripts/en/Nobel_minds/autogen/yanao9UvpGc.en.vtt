so I guess everybody knew before they

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
so I guess everybody knew before they
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.700
so I guess everybody knew before they
were here today that this is a very long

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710
were here today that this is a very long
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.860
were here today that this is a very long
story and we're now to the beginning of

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870
story and we're now to the beginning of
 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.200
story and we're now to the beginning of
the next part of the long story I'm

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
the next part of the long story I'm
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.550
the next part of the long story I'm
gonna try hard to stay on time

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560
gonna try hard to stay on time
 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.970
gonna try hard to stay on time
there's 21 years more to go after after

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
there's 21 years more to go after after
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.650
there's 21 years more to go after after
the story that you just heard which took

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
the story that you just heard which took
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.990
the story that you just heard which took
a long time so I'm gonna pick up the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
a long time so I'm gonna pick up the
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.550
a long time so I'm gonna pick up the
story in 1994 and in 1994 was when we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
story in 1994 and in 1994 was when we
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.400
story in 1994 and in 1994 was when we
received for the first time project

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
received for the first time project
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.930
received for the first time project
funding to actually build something

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
funding to actually build something
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.290
funding to actually build something
which is the LIGO detector with all the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
which is the LIGO detector with all the
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150
which is the LIGO detector with all the
responsibility of getting tens of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
responsibility of getting tens of
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
responsibility of getting tens of
millions of dollars a year for 20 years

millions of dollars a year for 20 years
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.729
millions of dollars a year for 20 years
and defending it during a period where

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739
and defending it during a period where
 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.069
and defending it during a period where
we saw nothing during that whole time so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
we saw nothing during that whole time so
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319
we saw nothing during that whole time so
the first thing that people should

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
the first thing that people should
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.110
the first thing that people should
realize is that the National Science

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
realize is that the National Science
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.529
realize is that the National Science
Foundation not only took the risk that

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539
Foundation not only took the risk that
 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.740
Foundation not only took the risk that
ray mentioned in taking on this project

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
ray mentioned in taking on this project
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810
ray mentioned in taking on this project
doing the R&amp;D and so forth

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
doing the R&amp;D and so forth
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570
doing the R&amp;D and so forth
but after it was taken on they had to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
but after it was taken on they had to
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.359
but after it was taken on they had to
defend a project with all the risks that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
defend a project with all the risks that
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969
defend a project with all the risks that
it had for 20 years with essentially no

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
it had for 20 years with essentially no
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.149
it had for 20 years with essentially no
results we basically set various limits

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
results we basically set various limits
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670
results we basically set various limits
because we didn't see anything but for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
because we didn't see anything but for
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649
because we didn't see anything but for
no results and so we're probably

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
no results and so we're probably
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.100
no results and so we're probably
indebted more to the NSF and one can

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
indebted more to the NSF and one can
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.910
indebted more to the NSF and one can
imagine and taking on such a project we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
imagine and taking on such a project we
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.630
imagine and taking on such a project we
organized it by a collaboration between

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
organized it by a collaboration between
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850
organized it by a collaboration between
Caltech and MIT and that shouldn't be

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
Caltech and MIT and that shouldn't be
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710
Caltech and MIT and that shouldn't be
lost in the story because we now have a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
lost in the story because we now have a
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170
lost in the story because we now have a
thousand scientists around the world but

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
thousand scientists around the world but
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.899

during the crucial period when we took

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
during the crucial period when we took
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:33.170
during the crucial period when we took
on advanced LIGO next in about 1997 we

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
on advanced LIGO next in about 1997 we
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.810
on advanced LIGO next in about 1997 we
realized that the Caltech and MIT

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820
realized that the Caltech and MIT
 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.740
realized that the Caltech and MIT
collaboration didn't bring all the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
collaboration didn't bring all the
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.090
collaboration didn't bring all the
elements we were going to need to

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
elements we were going to need to
 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.760
elements we were going to need to
succeed at this project and certainly

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
succeed at this project and certainly
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.470
succeed at this project and certainly
not all the scientific ones so we

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
not all the scientific ones so we
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.270
not all the scientific ones so we
created what people have heard about

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
created what people have heard about
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.820
created what people have heard about
today and that is the LIGO scientific

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
today and that is the LIGO scientific
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220

sure how to do it so we as much as
 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.330

possible we asked the NSF for more

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340

1999 we had it built and then we started
 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.190
1999 we had it built and then we started
making it work and this picture kind of

the plot it's the same scale that Ray
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.279
the plot it's the same scale that Ray
showed and this is the frequency band

showed and this is the frequency band
 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.930

so our strategy basically was to turn

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169
so our strategy basically was to turn
 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.829
so our strategy basically was to turn

it was this isn't very sensitive look

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139
it was this isn't very sensitive look

it was this isn't very sensitive look
our wounds look at what we did wrong

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909
our wounds look at what we did wrong
 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.069
our wounds look at what we did wrong
what was limiting it take time off run

is about the first five years of the

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:11.419
is about the first five years of the
 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.969
is about the first five years of the
detector we kept doing this for ten

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979
detector we kept doing this for ten
 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.689
detector we kept doing this for ten
years at each at each time we would

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699
years at each at each time we would
 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.749
years at each at each time we would
search for gravitational waves each time

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759
search for gravitational waves each time
 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.959
search for gravitational waves each time
we wouldn't find gravitational waves

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:22.969
we wouldn't find gravitational waves
 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:25.729
we wouldn't find gravitational waves
each time we would have a better limit

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:25.739
each time we would have a better limit
 

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:28.909
each time we would have a better limit
because this was better on how well we

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919
because this was better on how well we
 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.759
because this was better on how well we
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:31.769
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote
 

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:33.289
knew they didn't appear and so we wrote
a series of papers but they basically

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:33.299
a series of papers but they basically
 

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:37.179
a series of papers but they basically
were null papers during that period

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:37.189
were null papers during that period
 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:40.479
were null papers during that period
along the way we got to the point where

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:40.489
along the way we got to the point where
 

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:43.609
along the way we got to the point where
we were as good as we had proposed

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:43.619
we were as good as we had proposed
 

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:45.649
we were as good as we had proposed
except maybe a little bit at the low

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:45.659
except maybe a little bit at the low
 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.839
except maybe a little bit at the low
frequencies and this that's this curve

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:47.849
frequencies and this that's this curve
 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:50.839
frequencies and this that's this curve
here so this is the initial detector

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:50.849
here so this is the initial detector
 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.749
here so this is the initial detector
that we were funded for by the National

early as Ray had indicated that we
wanted to do this in two stages that we

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:03.959
wanted to do this in two stages that we
 

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:06.350
wanted to do this in two stages that we
can incrementally improve things but

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360
can incrementally improve things but
 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.109
can incrementally improve things but
only so far without making some major

only so far without making some major
 

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.459
only so far without making some major
changes so we had done the detailed Rd

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:13.469
changes so we had done the detailed Rd
 

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:17.929

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:25.799
generation detector and that was what we
 

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:27.919
generation detector and that was what we
called advanced LIGO interestingly we

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:27.929
called advanced LIGO interestingly we
 

00:08:27.929 --> 00:08:31.189
called advanced LIGO interestingly we
called it like o2 but the NSF in their

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199
called it like o2 but the NSF in their
 

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.649
called it like o2 but the NSF in their
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:33.659
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly
 

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.709
wisdom decided that we were sneaky ly
talking about LIGO one two three four so

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
talking about LIGO one two three four so
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.480
talking about LIGO one two three four so
they asked us to change the name and it

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.490
they asked us to change the name and it
 

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.589
they asked us to change the name and it
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO
 

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.429
became advanced LIGO with advanced LIGO
we then build it between nineteen twenty

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:46.439
we then build it between nineteen twenty
 

00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:48.699
we then build it between nineteen twenty
ten and twenty thirteen or so and

00:08:48.699 --> 00:08:48.709
ten and twenty thirteen or so and
 

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.889
ten and twenty thirteen or so and
started turning it on we could we

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899
started turning it on we could we
 

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.689
started turning it on we could we
basically had learned a lot so we turned

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:53.699
basically had learned a lot so we turned
 

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:54.440
basically had learned a lot so we turned
it on a lot

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:54.450
it on a lot
 

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.570
it on a lot
faster than we had the initial I go

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580
faster than we had the initial I go
 

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:03.970
faster than we had the initial I go
getting nearer designed sensitivity by

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.400
2015 it started to work well enough so

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:07.410
2015 it started to work well enough so
 

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.530
2015 it started to work well enough so
that it was better than what we had

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540
that it was better than what we had
 

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.640
that it was better than what we had
built for initial LIGO and that is shown

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.650

two people one in each laboratory who

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540
two people one in each laboratory who
 

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.650
two people one in each laboratory who
have been the most responsible for the

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:53.660
have been the most responsible for the
 

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.210
have been the most responsible for the
making this thing actually work in the

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220
making this thing actually work in the
 

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.010
making this thing actually work in the
field and so we started to make it work

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.020
field and so we started to make it work
 

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.750
field and so we started to make it work
and the two detectors are in the two

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760
and the two detectors are in the two
 

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.430
and the two detectors are in the two
different colors here and what they

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440
different colors here and what they
 

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.440
different colors here and what they
indicate is that despite the fact that

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.450
indicate is that despite the fact that
 

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.600
indicate is that despite the fact that
they're physically in very different

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:08.610
they're physically in very different
 

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.290
they're physically in very different
locations so basically in design and as

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300
locations so basically in design and as
 

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.210
locations so basically in design and as
long as we do the same thing at the same

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220
long as we do the same thing at the same
 

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.460
long as we do the same thing at the same
time they were essentially identically

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.470
time they were essentially identically
 

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.250
time they were essentially identically
to each other at this point

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260
to each other at this point
 

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.620
to each other at this point
this had improved about a factor of

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:21.630
this had improved about a factor of
 

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.600
this had improved about a factor of
three beyond where we were in in initial

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:26.610
three beyond where we were in in initial
 

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.420
three beyond where we were in in initial
LIGO our goal was to improve things a

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:29.430
LIGO our goal was to improve things a
 

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.120
LIGO our goal was to improve things a
factor of 10 this is improving the

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.130
factor of 10 this is improving the
 

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.940
factor of 10 this is improving the
sensitivity a factor of 3 and what to

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:34.950
sensitivity a factor of 3 and what to
 

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.690
sensitivity a factor of 3 and what to
realize is that the sensitivity tells

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700
realize is that the sensitivity tells
 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.640
realize is that the sensitivity tells
you how far out you look in the universe

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.650
you how far out you look in the universe
 

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.040
you how far out you look in the universe
so if we increase the sensitivity a

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.050
so if we increase the sensitivity a
 

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.440
so if we increase the sensitivity a
factor of 3 we actually improve how much

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.450
factor of 3 we actually improve how much
 

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.450
factor of 3 we actually improve how much
of the universe we're looking at by the

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:50.460
of the universe we're looking at by the
 

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.520
of the universe we're looking at by the
cube of that because that's the volume

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.530
cube of that because that's the volume
 

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.450
cube of that because that's the volume
that's scanned so an improvement of a

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:56.460
that's scanned so an improvement of a
 

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.580
that's scanned so an improvement of a
factor of 3 basically gave us the

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.590
factor of 3 basically gave us the
 

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.340
factor of 3 basically gave us the
ability to do what we had done in

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.350
ability to do what we had done in
 

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.090
ability to do what we had done in
initial LIGO or more in one year what we

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100
initial LIGO or more in one year what we
 

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.310
initial LIGO or more in one year what we
could have done in 27 years with initial

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320
could have done in 27 years with initial
 

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.270
could have done in 27 years with initial
I go

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.280
I go
 

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.820
I go
so we decided not to go all the way to

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:10.830
so we decided not to go all the way to
 

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.310
so we decided not to go all the way to
here but have a similar strategy to what

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320
here but have a similar strategy to what
 

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.340
here but have a similar strategy to what
we had an initial LIGO and use this as

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.350
we had an initial LIGO and use this as
 

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.040
we had an initial LIGO and use this as
the first search because we had improved

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.050
the first search because we had improved
 

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.320
the first search because we had improved
the concept for how we treat low

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.330
the concept for how we treat low
 

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.510
the concept for how we treat low
frequencies which was described by Ray

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.520
frequencies which was described by Ray
 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.610
frequencies which was described by Ray
the improvement as say 40 Hertz was

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620
the improvement as say 40 Hertz was
 

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.850
the improvement as say 40 Hertz was
actually a factor of a hundred shown

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860
actually a factor of a hundred shown
 

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.790
actually a factor of a hundred shown
here a factor of a hundred is cubed in

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800
here a factor of a hundred is cubed in
 

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.070
here a factor of a hundred is cubed in
terms of the sensitivity we get so we

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.080
terms of the sensitivity we get so we
 

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.840
terms of the sensitivity we get so we
were really a million times better than

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:41.850
were really a million times better than
 

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.330
were really a million times better than
we were an initial I go and that answers

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:44.340
we were an initial I go and that answers
 

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.070
we were an initial I go and that answers
a question that's often asked to us how

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:46.080
a question that's often asked to us how
 

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.350
a question that's often asked to us how
could we turn this thing on and after a

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360
could we turn this thing on and after a
 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.750
could we turn this thing on and after a
few days which is what happened make a

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760
few days which is what happened make a
 

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.670
few days which is what happened make a
discovery when we had run it for ten

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680
discovery when we had run it for ten
 

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.530
discovery when we had run it for ten
years before that are almost ten years

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540
years before that are almost ten years
 

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.400
years before that are almost ten years
and it's really this factor of a million

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.410
and it's really this factor of a million
 

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.810
and it's really this factor of a million
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made
 

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.640
so we turned on advanced LIGO and made
that improvement again this is just a

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:04.650
that improvement again this is just a
 

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.160
that improvement again this is just a
picture to emphasize that the big

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.170
picture to emphasize that the big
 

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.800
picture to emphasize that the big
improvement that made this detection may

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:09.810
improvement that made this detection may
 

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.020
improvement that made this detection may
be the take-home message if you want to

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.030
be the take-home message if you want to
 

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.000
be the take-home message if you want to
tell anybody why and how we made the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
tell anybody why and how we made the
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.020
tell anybody why and how we made the
detection was the improvement in this

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.030
detection was the improvement in this
 

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:21.620
detection was the improvement in this

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759
other or rotate them by 45 degrees the
 

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.669

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:31.679
reason you would rotate them by 45
 

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:34.400
reason you would rotate them by 45
degrees is it gives you the ability to

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.360
order to test that you have to run it
for some period of time we calculated

00:16:59.360 --> 00:16:59.370
for some period of time we calculated
 

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.190
for some period of time we calculated
how long that had to be and it was

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.200
how long that had to be and it was
 

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.170
how long that had to be and it was
basically a month in a month's time we

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180
basically a month in a month's time we
 

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.810
basically a month in a month's time we
could look at all the bins of time in

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:05.820
could look at all the bins of time in
 

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.710
could look at all the bins of time in
the to correlate them together and see

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720
the to correlate them together and see
 

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.230
the to correlate them together and see
what the probability is that you could

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240
what the probability is that you could
 

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.980
what the probability is that you could
get any sort of signal like this in the

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:15.990
get any sort of signal like this in the
 

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.800
get any sort of signal like this in the
detector and that's calculated to be a

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:18.810
detector and that's calculated to be a
 

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.020
detector and that's calculated to be a
magic number in physics when you believe

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.030
magic number in physics when you believe
 

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.720
magic number in physics when you believe
something which we call five Sigma or

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:23.730
something which we call five Sigma or
 

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.660
something which we call five Sigma or
the probabilities less than one in some

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:26.670
the probabilities less than one in some
 

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.120
the probabilities less than one in some
hundreds of thousands of years so

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.130
hundreds of thousands of years so
 

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.490
hundreds of thousands of years so
basically that was the first thing the

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500
basically that was the first thing the
 

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.810
basically that was the first thing the
second problem was maybe somehow we were

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820
second problem was maybe somehow we were
 

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.350
second problem was maybe somehow we were
being fooled by some mischievous people

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360
being fooled by some mischievous people
 

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.350
being fooled by some mischievous people

the data and we just looked at the data

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:45.180
the data and we just looked at the data
 

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.050
the data and we just looked at the data
and it really wasn't there that again

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:48.060
and it really wasn't there that again
 

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.820

that we have to take it back to the

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:18.049
that we have to take it back to the
 

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:20.049
that we have to take it back to the
laboratories where we had traced the

laboratories where we had traced the
 

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:22.509
laboratories where we had traced the
signals and what they recorded along the

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:22.519
signals and what they recorded along the
 

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.700
signals and what they recorded along the
way and that required another study

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:24.710
way and that required another study
 

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.430

which adjectives to use in the paper and
at that point Physical Review Letters

who had agreed that they would allow us

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559
who had agreed that they would allow us
 

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.379
who had agreed that they would allow us
to make the article longer than the

to make the article longer than the
 

00:19:26.389 --> 00:19:28.240
to make the article longer than the
standard article and that they would

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:28.250
standard article and that they would
 

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.330
standard article and that they would
review it especially both very secretly

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:31.340
review it especially both very secretly
 

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.310
review it especially both very secretly
and quickly informed us that we were now

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320
and quickly informed us that we were now
 

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.409
and quickly informed us that we were now
too close to Christmas and they couldn't

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:38.419
too close to Christmas and they couldn't
 

00:19:38.419 --> 00:19:39.659
too close to Christmas and they couldn't
do it

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:39.669
do it
 

00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:42.669
do it
so we held the article until January and

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679
so we held the article until January and
 

00:19:42.679 --> 00:19:45.610
so we held the article until January and
interestingly our second event which I

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:45.620
interestingly our second event which I
 

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.389
interestingly our second event which I
show now came on December 26th so when

00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:49.399
show now came on December 26th so when
 

00:19:49.399 --> 00:19:51.639
show now came on December 26th so when
we announced this event on February of

00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:51.649
we announced this event on February of
 

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:56.860
we announced this event on February of
20 2016 we knew but we didn't yet bring

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:56.870
20 2016 we knew but we didn't yet bring
 

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.539
20 2016 we knew but we didn't yet bring
that to the public that we also had a

00:19:58.539 --> 00:19:58.549
that to the public that we also had a
 

00:19:58.549 --> 00:20:00.519
that to the public that we also had a
second event so as convincing as the

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:00.529
second event so as convincing as the
 

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:02.330
second event so as convincing as the
first of that was

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340
first of that was
 

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.399
first of that was
we all have a second event it looks very

00:20:04.399 --> 00:20:04.409
we all have a second event it looks very
 

00:20:04.409 --> 00:20:06.560
we all have a second event it looks very
different you can see this has many many

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:06.570
different you can see this has many many
 

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:11.000
different you can see this has many many
oscillations it's smaller but we detect

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.010
oscillations it's smaller but we detect
 

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.409
oscillations it's smaller but we detect
it as well because there's so many

00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419
it as well because there's so many
 

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:15.049
it as well because there's so many
oscillations that's a reflection of the

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059
oscillations that's a reflection of the
 

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:17.060
oscillations that's a reflection of the
fact that they are lighter the two black

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.070
fact that they are lighter the two black
 

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.129
fact that they are lighter the two black
holes that are colliding it's also black

00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:19.139
holes that are colliding it's also black
 

00:20:19.139 --> 00:20:23.779
holes that are colliding it's also black
hole collisions this graph here just

way frequency going this way it gets

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:32.779
way frequency going this way it gets
 

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:37.100
way frequency going this way it gets
louder as the frequency goes up and just

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.110
louder as the frequency goes up and just
 

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.779
louder as the frequency goes up and just
get this so-called chirp that we

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:40.789
get this so-called chirp that we
 

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:43.310

which is weaker but in there longer so
we are able to pull out the signal is

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:48.269
we are able to pull out the signal is
 

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:50.870
we are able to pull out the signal is
down here but if we look at basically

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880
down here but if we look at basically
 

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.580
down here but if we look at basically
the low frequencies that weren't

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:52.590
the low frequencies that weren't
 

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.159
the low frequencies that weren't
available to us until we made the big

00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:55.169
available to us until we made the big
 

00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:57.019
available to us until we made the big
improvement in the suspension and the

00:20:57.019 --> 00:20:57.029
improvement in the suspension and the
 

00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:59.779
improvement in the suspension and the
isolation system both of these signals

isolation system both of these signals
 

00:20:59.789 --> 00:21:02.299
isolation system both of these signals
were enabled by making those

I'll show you in the second data run I
 

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:46.070
I'll show you in the second data run I
show here that we haven't analyzed all

today we basically have reported five
 

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:55.700

otherwise it appears to be like the

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:08.399
otherwise it appears to be like the
 

00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:10.940
otherwise it appears to be like the
others so we have a set of events which

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:10.950
others so we have a set of events which
 

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.519
others so we have a set of events which
start to let us look at distributions of

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:13.529
start to let us look at distributions of

start to let us look at distributions of
the alignments of spin

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:15.820
the alignments of spin
 

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.180

the masses of them and the difference in

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.190
the masses of them and the difference in
 

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.249
the masses of them and the difference in
how long they are is the difference in

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:20.259
how long they are is the difference in
 

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:23.299
how long they are is the difference in
how much their masses are and so forth

00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.909
so the fifth one here actually has a
different significance that's this one

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500
frequencies we're going underground
 

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.950

the detectors you have less thermal

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760
the detectors you have less thermal
 

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.120

noise this is a concept that's been

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.130
noise this is a concept that's been
 

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.370
noise this is a concept that's been
developed in Europe and it's called the

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380
developed in Europe and it's called the
 

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.350

Einstein telescope and they've been

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:33.360
Einstein telescope and they've been
 

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.960
Einstein telescope and they've been
working on it for about five to five or

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:35.970
working on it for about five to five or
 

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.350
working on it for about five to five or
so years and it's pretty firmly design

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:39.360
so years and it's pretty firmly design
 

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.720

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.030
we've been looking at another approach
which is to make basically a LIGO like

which is to make basically a LIGO like
 

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.760
which is to make basically a LIGO like
