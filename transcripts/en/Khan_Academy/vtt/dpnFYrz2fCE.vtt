00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.290
In the last video, we talked
about how the Serbians were

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.562
able to hold back
the Austro-Hungarians

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:07.520
at the beginning of World
War I. But eventually

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.070
they had to give in.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.810
They couldn't hold up
against the combined forces

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.630
of the Bulgarians,
the Austro-Hungarians,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.350
and the Germans.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.960
And they were able to
roll through in 1915.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.760
And then we wait until
1918 for the Allies

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.140
to essentially recapture Serbia.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.486
Now what is noteworthy-- there's
many noteworthy things in World

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.880
War I and obviously we
can't cover all of them--

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.070
is just what a
huge loss World War

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.640
I was to the Serbian people.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.420
Just as a little bit of
context, very small country--

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.630
we're talking 4.5 million people
as we enter into World War I--

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.060
with a reasonably,
I guess relative

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.110
to the size of the country,
it was a decent-sized army.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.700
But with an army we're
talking on the order

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.404
of 400,000 soldiers.

00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:58.570
And this was pretty much
everyone in the country who

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.880
could be in the army was
essentially in the army.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.860
Over the course of
the Serbian campaign

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.470
and the Macedonian
front, you essentially

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.000
have the Serbian army
getting decimated.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.940
You have 60% of the
Serbian army dies.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.240
Roughly 60% of the
Serbian army is killed.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.620
And even from a
population point of view,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.740
the Serbian population
is reduced by 16%.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.940
16% of the Serbian population,
civilian and military,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.495
is dead by the end
of World War I.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.030
So a lot of countries
suffered horribly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.990
during World War I. There's
many notable ones, France,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.900
the Russian Empire.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.770
We could go on and on and on.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.660
But it would be hard to argue
that any country suffered

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.670
more than what the Serbians did.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.597
60% of their military dead,
16% of their population.
