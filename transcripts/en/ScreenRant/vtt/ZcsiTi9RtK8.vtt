00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.060
Behind the scenes

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.800
of every movie you love

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.080
years of planning have gone into making sure that

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.300
every line, prop and camera angle are exactly what the film makers want.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.899
The crazy thing about movie making though,

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:17.040
is that sometimes, even when with all the planning

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.600
the film makers and actors decide to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.820
toss out the script and improvise instead.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.800
Sometimes this can be disastrous, but other times these unplanned moments turn out to be seriously awesome.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.540
For this video, we're taking a look at some of the best,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.600
for our list of ten improvised movie scenes that made actors react out of nowhere.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.800
...key to success in this racket is this little baby right here, it's called cocaine

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.200
The Wolf of Wall Street

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.940
Matthew McConaughey had himself a pretty good 2013.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.960
Not only did he take home the Best Actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.840
he also delivered a quick but quality performance in The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.440
Fans loved the scene where McConaughey was banging his chest.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.940
[humming and thumps]

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.540
And as it turns out, this is something the actor made up on the spot.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.180
The ritual was actually something McConaughey would do before shooting,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.500
and he decided that he would bring it into the scene.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.220
Leonardo DiCaprio is a world-class actor, but you can totally see him cracking up,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.120
and even looking over to the camera crew as McConaughey's chest beating and humming escalates.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.480
Zoolander

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.160
While 2016's Zoolander sequel was an absolute travesty,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.360
the original film is actually quite hilarious,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.140
and is jam-packed with fun, unscripted moments.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.400
-I guess so.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.920
In one scene involving David Duchovny and leading man Ben Stiller,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.700
Duchovny's character is explaining how the fashion industry has been behind every high-profile political

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.900
assassination of the last hundred years.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.740
Stiller's Zoolander asks "Why male models?", which prompts Duchovny to give a  long and clear explanation.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.380
Stiller then stares right at him, and again asks,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.740
"But why male models?"

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.100
"You serious? I just..."

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.440
"I just told you that a moment ago."

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.220
As it turns out, this moment happened because Stiller actually forgot his line,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.480
and just opted to repeat his previous one.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.340
The scene was totally unplanned, but thanks to Duchovny's great reaction, it ends up fitting in perfectly.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.080
The Dark Knight

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.600
The Dark Knight is still regarded as  one of the best superhero movies of all time,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.000
and Heath Ledger's Joker performance has become even more iconic as the years have gone on.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.840
[Wham!]

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.020
Ta-da! It's- ahh, it's gone.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.600
It's well known that Ledger threw himself deep into the role,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.360
and this led to some pretty amazing unscripted moments.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.820
"Do I really look like a guy with a plan?"

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.520
A lot of people already know about the improvisation in the scene where the Joker blows up the hospital,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.160
but there was also a great unscripted moment from when the Clown Prince of Crime

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.580
is locked up behind bars.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.200
As the officers in the room applaud Commissioner Gordon's promotion,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.120
Ledger begins, totally off-script, to slowly clap,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.600
and staring through the prison bars with a truly terrifying look.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.580
It was just a simple improvisation, but it totally changed the vibe of the scene,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.060
and has become an iconic moment  from the film.
