00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back; now, it’s time to talk about 2-dimensional motion

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is where things get really interesting.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So far, we’ve only talked about 1-dimensional motion and that motion in a straight line

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
either purely up and down motion or purely left and right motion.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But what happens when we have some combination?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, then we get the motion with—this is the sort of motion that describes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a cricket ball as it bounces towards the batsman or an arrow as it sails towards it’s target

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or a parachutist who has just jumped out of a plane.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, before we talk about our modern day understanding of 2-dimensional motion

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and in fact Galileo’s understanding, let’s talk about what Aristotle thought of 2-dimensional motion.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In Aristotle’s mind--and this is Aristotle over here of course--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
objects, for example, a ball thrown into the sky moving in a straight line

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
until they ran out of what he called impetus.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At that point, after the fall straight down and land somewhere on the ground.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, before I continue, why don’t you try this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Throw a small object like a coin or a pencil in front your field of view, and look at what you see.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It’s actually really difficult to see what’s going on.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In fact, it wasn’t until Galileo came around that the true path of an object

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in 2-dimensional motion was known.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That path is what called a parabola. So, we know that 2-dimensional motion is parabolic.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And so what? Parabolic is just a word. What does that mean?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In fact, can we use this word to somehow describe 2-dimensional motion mathematically?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In physics, prediction is power, and what I mean by prediction is, can we develop

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
our understanding of motion in such a way that we can explain and predict mathematically?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
How an object will move before we actually throw that object, let's say?

00:01:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We can and that’s what we will do in the rest of this unit.
