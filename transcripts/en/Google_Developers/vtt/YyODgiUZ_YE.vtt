00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.020
SPEAKER: Shhh.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.420
Welcome to release eight
of Google Play services.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.190
Look at this little
fellow resting

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.046
and getting ready for that
big event later this fall.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.760
In this video, we'll
tell you everything

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.065
you need to do in
Google Play services

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:19.190
to be ready for that event.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.840
We'll also have some
other big announcements.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.575
And we'll have some fun as well.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:27.390
So see you in the studio.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.850
You're so cute.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.380
Welcome to release eight
of Google Play services.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.274
You are here because you
want to build better apps.

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:39.940
And that's exactly
what you will do when

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.397
you use Google Play services.

00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:43.230
Let's look at the
highlights of this release

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.270
starting it off with--

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.060
[HORNS BLOWING]

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.960
That's right.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.130
We've got a new API.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.780
Let's welcome the Play
Games Player Stats

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.473
API with a round of applause.

00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:53.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.910
Data, data, data.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.670
We all love data.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.740
It helps us understand the world
and make informed decisions.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.319
And you, game developers,
data gives you insight

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.260
into what your
players are doing.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
But wouldn't it be nice to
take action on those insights

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.860
right there in your game?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.880
That's what the Player
Stats API is all about.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.430
Because the Player Stats
API will automatically

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.720
categorize your players
according to three segments--

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.700
how much they spend in your
game, their engagement,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.810
and their progression
in their game.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.630
This allows you to
take real time action

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.080
when it matters the most.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.410
For example, you can give
gifts and free upgrades

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.430
to the players that spend
the most money in your game.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.530
And for highly
engaged players, you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410
could give them
stuff as a reward

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.420
for recruiting new players.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.920
And for players that get stuck
and can't make any progress,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.880
you should really give them
a hand and provide a hint.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220
So start turning all
of this information

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.350
that it gives you to actions.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.820
Because this is not
only valuable to you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.700
as the developers, it's also a
great thing for your players.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.310
And now over to the
Nearby Messaging API

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.490
that was introduced
in the last release.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.220
You know the one that
allows nearby devices

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.789
to exchange messages.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.550
And it's also used by beacons
to send the information

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.150
to nearby devices.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.960
And that can use Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth signals

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.980
to connect and exchange data.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.590
But even cooler than that,
since it's also using the device

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.770
speakers to transmit
high frequency sounds,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.200
sounds we humans cannot hear,
you know the sounds used

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.110
for navigation and
communication by bats.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.600
Yeah, that's how cool the
Nearby Messaging API is.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.440
And in this release,
we've made it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.310
even cooler by allowing
your app to be notified

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.130
about important events.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.010
For example, the Nearby
Messages API uses the publish

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.660
and subscribe architecture.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.670
And now you can be notified if
a publication or subscription

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.010
times out.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280
And you can also get
notified if Nearby is enabled

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.170
or disabled for your app.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.570
So great new features for you
to use with the Nearby Messaging

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.430
API.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.420
And remember the newly
launched App Invites API?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.480
You know the one that allows
your users to invite and engage

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.390
their friends to
also use your app?

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.590
Well, in this release, it's
now possible to put a custom

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.710
image on the invite so it looks
more relevant and engaging.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.630
And now, back to
where we started.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.160
Let's talk about
Android Marshmallow.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.560
As you may know,
Marshmallow introduces

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.650
a dynamic permissions
model where

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.810
the app asks the
user for permission

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.715
to do something the first
time it requires it.

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:45.410
So as a developer, you
need to request permissions

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.940
before your code calls
anything that uses them.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.500
So it's extra important to
catch connection failures

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.450
and initiate a
resolution for failures.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.720
Should the user
revoke permissions

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.330
from Google Play services,
then the resolution user flow

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.200
could fix this.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.060
Be sure to check out
the samples for details.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.050
And that's it.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.530
For the M stuff.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.810
These are really, really good.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.940
ROBOT: Do you know how
much sugar those contain?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.680
SPEAKER: No.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.610
60%!

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.640
Good golly!

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.540
Sugar rush.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.890
And that's it for this release
of Google Play services.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.910
But be sure to check out
these resources as well.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.310
Now it's your turn
to build better apps

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.990
using Google Play services.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.960
So go out there and
create some great apps.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.240
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
