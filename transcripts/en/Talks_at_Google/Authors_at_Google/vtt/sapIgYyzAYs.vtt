00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.430
SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.770
I guess I'm the one who gets
to do the introduction here,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.750
so we were just
talking a little while

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.560
ago about how science
fiction, in particular, is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.860
a genre with a couple of
competing qualities about it.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.690
On one hand, good
science fiction

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.820
is about the time and
place it's written,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.900
thousands of years
in the future.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.630
But on the other
hand, you're not

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.020
supposed to think so
while you're reading it.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.950
And the author that you're
here to see today, Ann Leckie,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.475
is extremely good at
both sides of that coin.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.867
And so let's hear her
talk about her new book.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.720
ANN LECKIE: Hello.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.990
It's good to see everybody here.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.710
Look at you all.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.810
This is wonderful.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.240
I guess I'll start, if
everybody is agreeable,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.820
with reading a little
bit from the new book.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.380
Yeah?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.930
So this book is,
in a lot of ways,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.850
it's set in the same
universe as the trilogy,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.820
but it's rather different
from the trilogy.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.700
I felt like I needed kind of
a break from that intensity,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460
and so I wanted to
write something,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.010
a little more of a romp,
something a little more

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.240
relaxing after that.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.770
So I'm going to start now
at the very beginning,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.060
but a little in.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.980
And what's happening is the
main character, Ingray--

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.460
she has spent literally
every space penny

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.380
she has trying to spring
a notorious criminal

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.250
from the euphemistically named
prison, Compassionate Release.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.280
Compassionate Removal--
please excuse me.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.520
And she's done this,
and this person

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.610
has been delivered
to her in a crate,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.510
in a suspension pod, which in
some ways, is a relief to her,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.400
because she doesn't
have to explain what

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.350
she's doing to them quite yet.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.740
And she's taken the
crate to the ship

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.960
that she has booked
to take her back home,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.520
and the captain is
having none of it.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.180
He does not want to
take anyone aboard who

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.254
is not, like, conscious
and able to say,

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:13.420
yes, I want to go somewhere.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.740
Right?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.980
"Captain Uisine stared
at her over the crate.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.610
'I am on the very
edge,' he said, finally,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.620
'of refunding your passage,
both of the berths you've paid

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.530
for, and asking you
to leave this bay.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.620
I haven't made up my mind yet,
but I'll tell you one thing.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.130
There's no way you're
bringing that person--

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.760
Pahlad Budrakim you said--

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.610
aboard my ship still
in that suspension pod.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.120
And considering you expected
to meet him awake and unfrozen,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.580
you won't have any objection
to thawing him out now,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.470
I presume.'

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.170
'Will you take us aboard, then?'

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.800
'I'll consider taking
you aboard, then.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.570
Pahlad Budrakim can
do as he likes.'

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.190
A moment's thought.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.870
'If he doesn't want
to come aboard,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.340
I'll refund you airfare.'

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.590
It could have been
worse, Ingray supposed.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.050
It was some sort
of chance, anyway.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.870
Captain Uisine put his
other hand on the crate.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.370
'Step back, Excellency.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.770
You don't want your
foot caught under this.'

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.110
Ingray stepped back, and the
crate settled to the floor

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.909
with a thunk.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.200
'Do you know if this person
has ever been in suspension

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.030
before?'

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.710
Ingray picked up
her jacket and bag

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.820
and sandals off the crate lid.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.500
'No, why?' Captain Uisine
touched the crate's latches

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.080
and carefully slid
the lid aside.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.690
'He might panic if he
doesn't know what to expect.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.360
A little help would be nice.'

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.179
Ingray dropped her
sandals and bag,

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.720
pulled her jacket
on, and then helped

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.910
brace the lid as
Captain Uisine tilted it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.994
and let it slide down to
rest against the crate.

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:43.410
Captain Uisine
looked for a moment

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.720
at the smooth, black
surface of the pod,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.270
then slid open the
pod's control panel.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.800
'Everything looks
good,' he said,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.470
as a giant black spider
scuttled out of the airlock,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.980
nearly a meter high, a rolled
up blanket clutched in one hairy

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.060
appendage.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.550
Weirdly, disturbingly
graceful, it skittered up

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.530
to Captain Uisine
and stopped, turned

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.830
one of its far too many
stalked eyes toward Ingray--

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.690
no, it wasn't a spider.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.800
It was something else.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.380
'Um,' said Ingray.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.380
'That's-- is that a spider?'

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.810
She didn't know why the back
of her neck was prickling.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.430
She didn't mind spiders, but
this thing was so unsettling.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.740
Its legs were jointed
wrong, she realized,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.130
and its eyestalk sprouted right
out of its blob of a body.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.040
There was no waist, no
head, and something else

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.070
was wrong, though she
couldn't quite say what.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.650
'Of course, it's not a spider,'
replied Captain Uisine,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.900
still frowning at
the suspension pod.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.090
'You don't get spiders
with half-meter bodies

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.140
or two-meter legspans or not,
you know, unaugmented ones.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.940
But this isn't a spider.'

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.170
He looked up.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.970
'But it's kind of like a spider.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.560
I'll grant you that.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.530
Do you have a problem
with spiders, Excellency?'

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.020
The not-spider's body
trembled gelatinously,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.210
stretched to become
oblong rather than round,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.090
and four extra legs slid
out to touch the bay floor.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.790
Does that help?

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.710
Seeing the thing change
shape was somehow

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.680
even more disturbing, but
she refused to step back,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.570
even though she wanted to.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.690
'Not really, and I don't
mind spiders at all.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.190
It's just this looks so so
organic, except in a wrong,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.800
squishy, itchy sort of way.'

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.540
'Well, yes,' said
Captain Uisine,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.240
standing square and
stolid by the open crate,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.180
entirely unbothered by the
spidery thing beside him.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.380
'A lot of it is.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.630
Some people find it unsettling,
and apparently, you're

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.260
one of them.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.726
But it's just a biomech.

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.350
You'll get used to
it after a few days,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.990
or if you don't I'll,
keep it out of your way.'

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.330
He touched the control
panel, and the smooth surface

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.300
of the pod broke open with
a click and slid aside.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.030
For just an instant, Ingray
saw a person lying naked

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.150
and motionless, submerged
in a pool of blue fluid,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.520
unevenly cut hair a
tangled mass over half

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.220
of her sharp-featured
face, thin, thinner

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.050
than she remembered
pictures of Pahlad

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.800
Budrakim, the long welt of a
scar along their right flank.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.530
Then, the smooth, glassy
surface of the preserving medium

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.020
rippled and billowed as the
person opened their eyes

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.300
and sat convulsively
up, choking,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.330
one outthrust arm
smacking hard into Ingray.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.550
Captain Uisine
grabbed her other arm.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.030
'It's all right,' he said,
voice still calm and serious.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.670
The person continued to choke
as blue fluid poured out

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.130
of their mouth and nose,
sheeted away from their body

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.540
back into the pod.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.590
'It's all right.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.670
Everything's fine.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.930
You're all right.'

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.420
The last of the
fluid drained away

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.940
from the person's
mouth and nose,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.620
and he gave a
breathy, shaking moan.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.480
'First time?' asked
Captain Uisine,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.640
reaching down for the
blanket the spider mech still

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.050
proffered.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.630
The naked person in the
pod closed their eyes,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.560
gasped a few times, and
then her breathing settled.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.620
'Are you all right?' asked
Ingray, in Bantia this time,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.260
the most commonly spoken
language in Hwae System,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.420
though she was fairly
sure Pahlad Budrakim

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.880
would've understood Yiir,
which Captain Uisine had used.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.530
Captain Uisine shook
the blanket out

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.090
and laid it around the
naked person's shoulders.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.580
'Where am I?' he
asked in Bantia,

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.490
voice rough with cold or
fear or something else.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.180
'We're on tour Tyr Siilas
Station in Tyr System,' said

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.480
Ingray, and then to Captain
Uisine, 'He asked where he is,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.720
and I told him we're
on Tyr Siilas.'

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.550
'How did I get here?'

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.850
asked the person sitting in
the suspension pod in Bantia.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.130
By now, the blue fluid
had all drained away

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.130
to some reservoir
in the pod itself.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.650
'I paid someone to bring
you out,' said Ingray.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.920
'I'm Ingray Aughskold.'

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.240
The person opened
their eyes, then.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.840
'Who?' Well, Ingray had never
really met Pahlad Budrakim

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.120
in person, and he was 10 or
more years older than she was

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.600
and not likely to have
noticed a very young Aughskold

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.420
foster-daughter, not likely to
have known her name when she

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.150
had still been a child,
let alone her adult name,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.160
which she'd taken only
months before he'd gone

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.470
to Compassionate Removal.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.260
'I'm one of Netano Aughskold's
children,' said Ingray.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.380
'Why?' he asked, a
voice gaining strength,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.350
'would one of Representative
Aughskold's children bring me

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.380
anywhere?'

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.750
Ingray tried to think of
a simple way to explain

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.730
and settled, finally, for,
'You're Pahlad Budrakim.'

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.860
He gave a little shake
of their head, a frown.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.681
'Who?'

00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:23.310
Ingray suppressed a start
as another spider mech came

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.990
skittering out of the airlock.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.270
This one held a large
cup of steaming liquid,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.680
which it passed
to Captain Uisine

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.140
before it spun and
returned to the ship.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.299
'Here, Excellency,'
he said in Yiir,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.700
offering it to the person
still sitting in the pod.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.130
'Can you hold this?'

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.789
'Here," said the
first spider mech

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.860
in a thin, thready
voice in Bantia.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.559
'Can you hold this?'

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.290
'Aren't you Pahlad
Budrakim?' asked Ingray,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.140
feeling strangely numb,
except maybe for an unpleasant

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.350
sensation in her gut, as though
she was not capable of feeling

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.830
any more despair or fear
than she already had today.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.680
The facilitator had
said this was Pahlad.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.010
No, it said it examined the
payment and the merchandise,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.900
and both were what
they should have been.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.050
But surely, that
was the same thing.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.050
'No,' said the person sitting
in the suspension pod.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.390
'I don't even know who that is.'

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.850
He noticed the cup Captain
Uisine was proffering.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.710
'Thank you,' he
said, and took it,

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.960
cupped it in their hands
as Captain Uisine stopped

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.570
the blanket from sliding
off their shoulders.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.940
'Drink some,' said Captain
Uisine, still in Yiir.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.780
'It's serbat.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.160
It'll do you good.'

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.240
'Drink it,' said the
spider mech in Bantia.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.010
'It's serbat.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.890
It's good and nutritious.'

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.870
What if there had
been a mistake?

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.440
This person looked like Pahlad
Budrakim, but also, in a way,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.520
he didn't.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.710
He was thinner certainly,
and Ingray had only

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.520
seen him in person once or
twice, and that was years ago.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.950
'You're not Pahlad Budrakim?'

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.140
'No,' said the person who
was not Pahlad Budrakim.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.980
'I already said that.'

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.770
He took a drink of the serbat.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.310
'Oh, that's good.'

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.900
Really, it didn't matter.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.840
Even if this person was
Pahlad, if he was lying to her,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.160
it made no difference.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.990
She couldn't compel
him to go with her back

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.660
to her Hwae and not just
because Captain Uisine would

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.420
refuse to take him
unless he wanted to go.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.520
Her plan had always
depended on Pahlad

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.310
being willing to go along.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.070
'You look a lot like Pahlad
Budrakim,' Ingray said,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.690
still hoping.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.930
'Do I?' he asked, and took
another drink of serbat.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.216
'I guess someone
made a mistake.'

00:10:24.216 --> 00:10:25.590
He looked straight
at Ingray then

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.950
and said, 'So when a Budrakim
goes to Compassionate Removal,

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.570
it's only for show, is it?

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.800
They send someone to fish
them out behind the scenes?'

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.660
Her expression didn't change,
but her voice was bitter.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.260
Ingray drew breath
to say indignantly,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.320
'No, of course not,' but found
herself struck speechless

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.900
by the fact that she had
herself gotten a Budrakim out

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.120
of Compassionate Removal.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.161
'No,' she managed, finally.

00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:50.660
'No.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.150
I-- you're really
not Pahlad Budrakim?'

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.670
'I'm really not,' he said.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.620
'Then who are you?'
asked the spider mech,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.002
though Captain Uisine
hadn't said anything aloud.

00:11:02.002 --> 00:11:04.210
The person sitting in the
suspension pod took another

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.560
drink of serbat, then said,
'You said we're on Tyr Siilas.'

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.300
'Yes,' said the spider mech.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.240
Ingray found she
couldn't speak at all.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.880
'I think I'd rather
not tell you who I am.'

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.460
He looked around at the
suspension pod he sat in,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.400
the crate still surrounding
it, and Captain Uisine

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.950
at the spider mech beside
the captain around the bay.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.880
'I think I'd like to visit
the incomer's office.'

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.260
'Why?' asked Ingray,
almost a cry,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.600
unable to keep her confusion and
her despair out of her voice.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.090
'Unless you have financial
resources we're unaware

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.940
of,' said the spider mech, 'you
won't be able to do more than

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.440
apply for an indenture.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.410
You may or may not get one, and
unless you have contacts here,

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.200
you very probably won't like
what you get if you do.'

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.470
'I'll like it better than
Compassionate Removal.'

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.830
He drained the last
of their beverage.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.660
'Look on the bright side,'
Captain Uisine said himself

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.859
to Ingray in Yiir as he took
the cup from Not Pahlad.

00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:01.150
'I'll refund you our passage,
and you'll be able to eat

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.656
actual food for the
next couple of days.'"

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:08.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.290
So usually, at this
stage, I take questions.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.900
Sometimes I say I could
maybe sing and dance,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.950
but I'm very bad
at those things.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.060
So if anyone has
any questions, I

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.870
know there are mics
in the aisles there.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.450
And I will be happy to
answer questions or talk

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.252
about whatever people would
like me to talk about.

00:12:25.252 --> 00:12:27.460
AUDIENCE: All right, this
kind of a generic question,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.820
but what does your like
writing setup look like?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.940
And what do you do when
you find it hard to write

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.330
or are kind of stuck creatively?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.670
ANN LECKIE: So my--

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.800
I have a couple of places
that I tend to write.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.780
I have a nice little
office in the basement

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.790
that my husband put
together for me.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.800
I have two nice big monitors,
which are the best for editing,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.130
and a nice ergonomic
keyboard, which

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.290
I love my ergonomic keyboard.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.750
Sometimes that
doesn't suit where

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.620
I'm at, so I will take a
laptop out to the back porch

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.440
or to a coffee shop or whatever.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.260
When I'm stuck, very often,
I will spend an hour or two

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.930
basically banging my
head on the desk trying

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.450
to figure out where the
sentences are that need

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.230
to come.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.110
And then very often, I'll
give up and go upstairs

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.060
to take a shower.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.810
And there's something
in the shower water.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.380
Usually, that's when I realized
what I needed to have written.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.990
If that doesn't work,
I will go for a walk.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.330
And if the walk doesn't
work, I know it's time

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.970
to go to the library, where I
will just walk down the history

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.620
and anthropology
shelves and pull off

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.880
anything that seems appealing.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.220
And nine times out of 10,
that first stack of books

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.045
will have something in it that
was what I was looking for.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:39.670
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.760
Take care.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.966
Could you talk
about your decision

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:47.570
to use the Spivak pronouns,
rather than the female pronoun?

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.690
ANN LECKIE: Ah
well, I do use "she"

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:55.240
in this book, but not default,
as I do in the trilogy.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.810
I'm very proud about my
choice in the trilogy.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.170
I'm really pleased with
the effect that it had.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.720
But I also, listening
to conversations

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.510
about that among other
people, some folks

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.270
pointed out that that usage,
while it does cool things,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.284
also sort of erases a bunch
of different identities.

00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:14.950
And I said, that's
an interesting point,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.110
and maybe I want to think
some more about that.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.570
So when it came
to this book, it's

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.751
very much like the trilogy.

00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:22.500
It's very much not
what the book is about.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.270
But I said, what if
I had a society that

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.180
doesn't think of gender as
being obviously a binary the way

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.010
our culture tends
to think of it?

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.460
This society thinks, obviously,
there are three genders, right?

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.350
There are men, women, and neman.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.290
And it's he and she and e.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.060
And I chose the Spivak
pronouns in particular,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.030
because there are
lots to choose from.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.100
There are just many that folks
have suggested and come up

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.020
with.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.230
But as it happens, I
actually know some folks, who

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.997
use those as their pronouns.

00:14:53.997 --> 00:14:55.830
And I thought, well,
that'll be kind of fun,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.538
because then they'll
get to open the book

00:14:57.538 --> 00:14:59.640
and say, oh, look, there's
my pronouns being used.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.015
There's people
there, who I could

00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:02.297
think of are like me in a way.

00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:04.380
I mean, I probably don't
capture their identities,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.400
because that's a
complicated thing.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.052
But it's kind of-- it's
so rewarding and important

00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:10.510
to be able to see
that on the page.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.510
So that's why I made that
specific choice, yeah.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.570
AUDIENCE: I know that lots of--

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.070
some authors have
talked about how

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.430
they write very out
of order, while I've

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.470
heard some who were able
to write more in line.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.310
And I was curious how
that goes for you.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.670
Are you in line
with the timeline,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.295
or is it all over the place?

00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:34.420
ANN LECKIE: I pretty much
can't write out of order.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.000
I haven't been able
to write out of order,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.370
partly because I don't outline.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.290
And very often,
although I do have

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.250
an idea of where I'm
going with a story,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.090
I know where I want to end up,
I often know some signposts.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.530
But the specifics of
how a scene works,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.350
I can't envision
until I've got what

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:54.100
comes before it, because
so many tiny little nuances

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.580
of conversation or action
will inform that next scene.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.660
So then, I don't have any ground
to write the next scene from.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.050
So I have never been able to
write very much out of order

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.620
at all.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.245
I'm very envious of my friends
who outline very, very--

00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:10.840
at a very detailed level.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.290
They write so much faster than
I do, and one of these days,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.190
maybe I'll manage it.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.035
But I've never
been able to do it.

00:16:17.035 --> 00:16:18.410
AUDIENCE: To what
extent, if any,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.790
did Iain M. Banks's "Culture"
series and their ascensionship

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.580
sort of influence your choice
to sort of feature an ascension

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.666
ship as a protagonist in
the Ancillary trilogy?

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:30.040
ANN LECKIE:
Actually, not at all,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.950
because I had not read
Banks until I was very far

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.930
along in "Ancillary Justice."

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.420
When I did read Banks, I
was like, this is awesome.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.870
And I love that there's actually
somebody who buy stories

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.140
with ascensionships, right?

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.870
But my work frequently
gets compared

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.560
to Banks, which is a
tremendous compliment, but not

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.870
a particularly accurate
assessment of my influences,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.854
yeah.

00:16:53.854 --> 00:16:55.270
AUDIENCE: Every
writer will choose

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.340
some parts of their
world to focus on and pay

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.130
less attention to other parts.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.870
In your work, I noticed you
use a lot of off the shelf

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.697
sci-fi technology.

00:17:04.697 --> 00:17:07.030
Shuttle will get you reliably
from one place to another,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.160
but you don't really
dwell on how it works.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.230
[INAUDIBLE] will
heal any injury.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.495
Was that a conscious decision
to focus less on attack,

00:17:15.495 --> 00:17:17.119
more on the social
aspects or wherever?

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.270
Can you talk about your
thought process there?

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.099
ANN LECKIE: It very much
was a conscious decision.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.310
In some cases, actually,
I've worked out

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.190
for myself what my
rationalization is for some

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.160
of the sort of magic tech.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.360
But I feel like that's not the
focus of the stories as such.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.250
I like working with
the implications of it

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.260
more than with the actual
details of the tech.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.480
So yeah, that was definitely
a conscious choice.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.520
AUDIENCE: How fast do you write?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.770
ANN LECKIE: It really depends.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.030
Ideally, in theory, in theory,
I write at least 1,000 words

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.570
a day.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.150
That's ideally.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.020
Some days, I can do
much more than that.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.180
Some days, I'm lucky
to get five words.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.240
Some days, I'm in the
stage of creating,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.399
where actually what I need
to do is read and think,

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:05.690
and no words are coming at all.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.867
And those days are very
scary and frustrating,

00:18:07.867 --> 00:18:09.950
but I've discovered that
they're an important part

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.960
of the process, because
it doesn't move forward

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.957
without those days.

00:18:13.957 --> 00:18:15.540
AUDIENCE: So is it
radically different

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.830
when you're actively working
on a book versus breaks

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.386
in between?

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:21.510
ANN LECKIE: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.110
Very, very different.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.170
And I can-- when I'm
between large projects,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.390
I will go a month or two without
having written anything at all.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.910
And then I'll get super paranoid
and have to remind myself

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.224
that, actually, it'll be OK.

00:18:32.224 --> 00:18:34.140
Yeah, I'm actually still
working on something,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.210
even if there aren't words.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.310
AUDIENCE: So I'm delighted to
be back in the same universe

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.110
and especially in a
different part of it.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.542
I haven't read the book yet.

00:18:42.542 --> 00:18:44.250
But when I got to the
end of the trilogy,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.440
I was a little
distraught at the idea

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.060
that I might never
actually find out

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.240
what's going on inside
the Dyson sphere that's

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.230
in the middle of everything.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.590
And I'm wondering,
do you know how much

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.865
of the map of this
universe you're eventually

00:18:57.865 --> 00:18:58.740
going to write about?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.160
And will we see the inside
of that Dyson sphere

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.519
with gloves off at some
point in the future?

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.435
ANN LECKIE: Gloves off--
that's very improper.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.080
I, obviously, know a lot
more about the Dyson sphere

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.630
than ever ended up on the page.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.010
As to whether or not I'll
write about it, I might.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.960
I have to admit I'm easily
bored, and I'm in a place

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.600
right now, where I'm fortunate
to be able to just take off

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.220
after whatever's shiny.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.899
And so if that feels
shiny to me, I might.

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:29.940
So I don't know for sure.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.620
There aren't concrete
plans to do it,

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.328
but there aren't
concrete plans not to as

00:19:33.328 --> 00:19:35.490
well, so I make no promises.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.190
AUDIENCE: So in terms of
your influences in fiction,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.784
what are your influences
outside of science fiction?

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.450
ANN LECKIE: Outside
of science fiction--

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.824
oh, the inside of
science fiction

00:19:46.824 --> 00:19:50.520
is much easier to
answer, isn't it?

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.930
I honestly don't know.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.670
Well, I do read quite a lot
of history and anthropology

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.260
almost at random.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.250
I find that real
human cultures are

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.920
more varied and
nuanced than anything

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.120
I could ever put on the page.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.430
And if I want to create
something realistic,

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.640
I can't go wrong by looking
at what already exists.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.550
And history, of course, is full
of amazing stories that often

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.329
don't end up in school,
because there's--

00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:21.870
you don't hear about them when
you're taking your Western civ

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.220
course or whatever.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.010
And there's just some
amazing stuff to use there,

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.250
so I will read things like that.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.840
I also find I really
enjoy historical fiction

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.940
for some similar reasons.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.600
When I'm not working on
a project in particular,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.690
often, I will go and read some
very light historical romances

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.640
just as kind of a mental break.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.120
I don't know how much
those influence my writing.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.080
I do know when the second
book in the trilogy came out,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.840
and a bunch of people were
like, wow, this is really weird.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.506
It's very different
from the first book,

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.050
and it was one
person in particular,

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.510
who DMed me and said, you
know what this really reminds

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.850
me of is Patrick O'Brien.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.760
And I said, actually, I
mainlined that entire series

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.800
right before I sat
down to write this.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.870
So influences come
in odd places, yeah.

00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:17.240
AUDIENCE: So if influences
within science fiction

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.740
is easier, what
are your influence

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.520
within science fiction?

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.220
ANN LECKIE: So the
obvious answers

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.280
to influences within science
fiction would be as a child,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.070
I read way more Andre
Norton than could possibly

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.170
be healthy for a single person.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.020
I suspect that Norton is a
writer, who she doesn't yet

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.150
talked about very
much critically,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.700
but I suspect she's had a
profound impact on the field,

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.640
because a lot of us grew
up reading her work.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.120
And I couldn't point
to where, but I

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.140
don't doubt that her work has
influenced mine very strongly.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.330
Also, especially in the
past 10 or 15 years,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.140
I have become a huge
CJ Cherry fan girl.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.300
Those of you-- who's
another writer, who's

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.670
a major figure in the
field, and maybe doesn't get

00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.900
talked about as much.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.430
I mention her at
every opportunity,

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.860
because I think that
should probably change.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.904
Those of you who have read her
Foreigner series, which I love,

00:22:07.904 --> 00:22:08.570
it's up to what?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.100
18 books now-- will probably
have noticed there are actually

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.940
some deliberate Easter eggs in
the trilogy that are deliberate

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.790
hat tips to CJ Cherry.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.230
I just-- I love
her work so much.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.760
I also-- when I was first
starting out seriously writing,

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.460
and I realized my visuals
left something to be desired,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.100
I went back and
re-read a large amount

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.070
of Jack Vance, whose work
I just admire tremendously.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.250
On a sentence level,
just beautiful writing,

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.460
really gorgeous visuals,
and a real, almost sort

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.970
of anthropological
knack for creating

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.070
tiny little sort of
thumbnail sketches

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.087
of bizarre human cultures that
feel absolutely real, where you

00:22:50.087 --> 00:22:51.920
say, wow, that's really
weird, and I totally

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.586
believe that human
beings would do that.

00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:56.510
And these are just little sort
of decorations along the way,

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.370
just sort of ornamental stuff.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.554
His work is really fabulous.

00:23:00.554 --> 00:23:01.720
AUDIENCE: You talked about--

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.845
you just mentioned when
you first started seriously

00:23:03.845 --> 00:23:07.360
writing, and so was there--

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.910
when you're writing
a first book,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.494
is there a moment that
you sort of go from,

00:23:12.494 --> 00:23:14.410
this is something I'm
doing, to, this is going

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.380
to be a trilogy in a universe?

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.220
How do you get from
not writer to writer?

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.320
What was that transition like?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.350
But what was that
transition like for you?

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.677
ANN LECKIE: It's almost
one of those things, where

00:23:29.677 --> 00:23:31.510
you suddenly look up
and realize that you've

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.640
passed a transition.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.416
And I'm going to be flip
and also not flip and say,

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.290
the way that you become
a writer is to write.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.270
That's how-- it's
not a helpful answer,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.042
and when I was at the stage
where I was a beginning writer,

00:23:43.042 --> 00:23:44.500
and a writer would
say, the way you

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.250
become a writer is to write,
I'd be like, oh, thanks.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.230
I didn't know that.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.640
But it actually does.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.040
What happened with
me, and I think

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.860
is fairly typical, is I have
actually written two or three

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.060
other novels that no one
in this room will ever see,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.040
because they are dreadful.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.080
And they're put
away in a drawer,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.450
but that was part of the
process so that by the time

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.700
I came to "Ancillary
Justice," I had already

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.340
built up a level of
skill and confidence

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.610
that I was able to say, oh,
this is going to be a trilogy,

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.630
before I started to write.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.270
I didn't say that
about my first novel,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.895
partly because it
was a NaNoWriMo novel

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.240
and partly because I was just--

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.840
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.140
And it just kind of comes with
time and continuing to do it.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.090
If you're going to be
a writer, you kind of

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.730
have to be sort of
bloody minded about it,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.060
because you're not going to
get validation from outside.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.470
You're not going to get--

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.060
barring certain
special circumstances

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.060
you're not going to get
a certificate that says,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.480
"Now you're a writer."

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.610
And you can do everything
right and write

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.320
the most beautiful,
gorgeous work

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.600
and never have much
in the way of success.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.660
There's no-- so
it's just-- you just

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.800
have to sit down and do it.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.466
And after a while,
you do it long enough

00:24:58.466 --> 00:25:00.400
that it's sort of part
of what you're doing.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.290
And you say, oh,
now I'm a writer.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.670
Yeah.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:09.650
AUDIENCE: So you said earlier
that you don't plot or outline

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.560
too far ahead.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.990
So then how do
you know that this

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.180
is going to be a trilogy
and not two books

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.340
or four books or 10 books?

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.920
ANN LECKIE: I knew where the
trilogy was going to end up.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.480
I knew where the
trilogy was headed,

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.450
and I knew I couldn't
do that in one novel.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:28.100
But the only specific signposts
I had were for the first novel,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.384
like a couple of scenes
that I knew I wanted to hit.

00:25:31.384 --> 00:25:33.050
If I looked too far
ahead, it would just

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.260
become way too daunting.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.060
It's like you're up outside
a 100-story building,

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.410
like don't look down, right?

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.120
You can't do that.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.950
So that's basically--
I can't start writing,

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.890
unless I know where
I want to end up.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.675
So that was how that happened.

00:25:47.675 --> 00:25:50.060
AUDIENCE: So was it kind
of like you hit some point,

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.540
and you're like, OK, this is
enough words for a first book

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.310
or enough progression
in the plot?

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.440
Somewhere in between?

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.570
ANN LECKIE: It's a
little bit more--

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.080
once I say to myself, this
is a trilogy, then I'd say--

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.020
then I said to
myself, then I need

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.490
to make each book have its
own arc, because I think this

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.780
should be illegal, actually.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.580
You know when you pick up
a book, and you read it,

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.121
and it's the first in a series,
and it ends on a cliffhanger,

00:26:16.121 --> 00:26:18.170
and the next book's not
out until next year?

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.390
That should be
illegal, straight up.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.380
Yeah.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.590
And I understand why
it happens, especially

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.034
when you've got a
really big work,

00:26:26.034 --> 00:26:28.700
and the publisher is like, yeah,
this is too big for one volume.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.030
Let's split it in half.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.000
It should still be illegal.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.284
So I said, well, I
know it's a trilogy,

00:26:35.284 --> 00:26:37.700
but I also know that I can
write and write and maybe never

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.910
even sell the first volume.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.280
So I'm going to carve out
a story that's itself,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.982
that's complete, but
also that can go on

00:26:45.982 --> 00:26:47.690
to the rest of the
trilogy that I wanted.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.407
And that was what I aimed at.

00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:51.990
AUDIENCE: So something
I was wondering

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.294
about earlier when you were
talking about how many--

00:26:54.294 --> 00:26:56.710
how much you write in a day
or how many words or whatever,

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.160
how much do those words sort of
evolve between the first time

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.740
you put them down on a
digital page and the book's

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.430
publication?

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.436
And do you ever
go back and change

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:07.060
how the details of
something worked out

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.317
after you write the next parts?

00:27:09.317 --> 00:27:10.150
ANN LECKIE: Oh, yes.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.810
Almost always.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.500
I will often start my days
writing with going back

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.990
over what I wrote the day
before, if nothing else,

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.630
to get kind of a running
start on what I did.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:23.560
But I'll always be adjusting
sentences and changing things.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.430
And of course, it also happens
that I'll be in the shower

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.060
and go, oh, my gosh.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.780
Five chapters ago, I need
to change this detail.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.771
And then I'll have to
run downstairs and change

00:27:33.771 --> 00:27:35.770
the thing, and hopefully,
I didn't drip too much

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.670
on the keyboard.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.210
So there is a fair amount
of changing, but I also--

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.590
I do work very
slowly moving ahead.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.220
So I don't do quite as much
ripping out and completely

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.906
changing things as I did
when I first started out.

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:52.780
When I first started
out, I was NaNoWriMoing,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.290
so it was like,
plunge right ahead.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:54.800
Don't stop.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.300
Don't think.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.350
Just keep typing.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.270
And that made for
a lot of, yeah,

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.120
that whole 60 pages has to go.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.420
So I'm a lot more careful, but
there's always lots of tweaking

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.370
and adjusting and
deleting and adding.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.828
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about sense and nonsense, maybe

00:28:08.828 --> 00:28:12.160
pseudosense, mainly the Presger
Translators and the Geck

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.900
ambassador.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.764
Is that hard to write,
fun to write, both?

00:28:16.764 --> 00:28:17.680
ANN LECKIE: It's both.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.820
It's both.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.080
They were so fun to write.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.980
I loved writing them.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.770
I knew that they were
going to be kind of absurd,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.020
but when translator
[INAUDIBLE] came on stage

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.410
and uttered her
first couple lines.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.320
And then I was like, oh, this
is going somewhere really weird.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.611
And I was like, yeah, I'm
just going to lean into that.

00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:37.030
And it was a lot of fun.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.680
And actually, I guess this
has potential spoilers.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.520
When I realized how brief a time
she was going to be on stage,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.672
I was very unhappy.

00:28:46.672 --> 00:28:48.880
And I said, well, I'm just
going have to change this.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.640
And I tried to change it, and
it was going to break the book.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.910
And I said, I can't do it.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.640
So I said, well,
in the third book,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.410
I know Translator
Zeiat's coming,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.960
so I'm going to have her
on stage every minute I can

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.300
and get all the fun
I can out of her.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.880
So they turned out to be
such a delight to write.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.340
But it was also very
difficult, because that's

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.084
the kind of thing that you can
kind of get wrong, if you--

00:29:09.084 --> 00:29:10.000
it's like a tightrope.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.760
You step to either
side, and it falls flat.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.410
AUDIENCE: Did you find yourself
having to get into a particular

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.430
mindspace to write them?

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.940
ANN LECKIE: Yeah, kind of, yeah.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.660
Yeah.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.962
It was kind of an
odd space, yeah.

00:29:22.962 --> 00:29:23.920
They were a lot of fun.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.836
They were-- I really--

00:29:24.836 --> 00:29:26.804
I miss them of all the-- yeah.

00:29:26.804 --> 00:29:27.720
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.707
And were there any specific
inspirations for those?

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:32.290
ANN LECKIE: I didn't
think there were,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.120
but somebody messaged
me at one point

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.100
and said, did you
read Lloyd Alexander's

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.290
"Prydain Chronicles?"

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.220
I see you all nodding.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.937
You know exactly.

00:29:39.937 --> 00:29:41.770
You're thinking of
Orddu, Orwen, and Orgoch.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.720
And I said, oh, I did.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.460
I loved those books.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.590
I read them so many times,
I have them practically

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.940
memorized, when I was a kid.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.999
So it's probably that.

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.540
That's probably
where this came from.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.190
But I was not conscious
of that at all,

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.830
which is-- that's
kind of the funny way

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.732
that the things that
you read kind of

00:29:58.732 --> 00:30:00.190
influence you
without your knowing.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.200
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
they were CJ Cherry's Methane

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.950
Breathers, but.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.760
ANN LECKIE: There was that, too.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.920
Yeah, CJ Cherry's Methane
Breathers are fabulous.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.420
Yeah.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.170
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.655
Thanks.

00:30:09.655 --> 00:30:12.030
AUDIENCE: So who sees your
stuff while you're writing it?

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.680
Do you have a writer's
group that you work with?

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.000
Do you have beta readers?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.300
ANN LECKIE: I used to have
a writers group in town,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.490
and then a couple of
people moved out of town.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.470
Now, I have a couple
of friends who

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.650
live in town, who, when I'm
feeling super insecure, which

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.470
totally happens like the first
couple chapters, and I'm like,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.640
is this even worth writing?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.001
This is just a thing
that writers have.

00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:34.500
Sometimes new writers are like,
this means I'm not any good.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.620
No, it means you're a writer.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.844
And so then I go
to them, and I go,

00:30:38.844 --> 00:30:40.260
these are my first
three chapters.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.980
Is this any good?

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.950
And they're like, yeah,
just go finish it,

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.330
which is what I need to hear.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.640
And then I will give
them the manuscript,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.410
and they'll make comments.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.520
I don't always-- and any of
y'all who are aspiring fiction

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.790
writers, people who
give you comments,

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.290
they're worth thinking about
and trying to think about where

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.465
those comments came from.

00:30:59.465 --> 00:31:01.590
But do not just take the
advice that they give you,

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.750
because nine times out
of 10, they're wrong.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.300
When they say, oh,
this isn't working.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.050
You need to explain this more.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.600
Actually, nine
times out of 10, you

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.058
need to take away
the sentence that

00:31:11.058 --> 00:31:12.900
makes them ask the question.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.020
Or this character is not
realistic, and you're like,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.010
but they should be.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.800
There's one tiny sentence
like two chapters back

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.840
that is leading the
reader astray somewhere.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.870
So don't just delete things
when your commenters say

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.700
delete something or whatever.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.950
But I find that
fairly important,

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.720
but I don't rely on
it as much as I did

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.248
when I was just starting out.

00:31:32.248 --> 00:31:33.184
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.130
AUDIENCE: I wonder, so as a
fairly inexperienced parent,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.810
I'm wondering how you carve
out time and the ability

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:47.449
to have complex thoughts,
and how do you do it,

00:31:47.449 --> 00:31:49.740
while there's a tiny human
throwing blueberries at you?

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.281
ANN LECKIE: It's
difficult, isn't it?

00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:53.880
Or my son had a thing for
pushing buttons and plugging

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.325
and unplugging things.

00:31:55.325 --> 00:31:58.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.730
I learned to save
frequently, yes.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.070
It's much easier when
they go to school,

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.110
which I knew it was kind
of a cop-out answer.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.250
But also to a certain extent,
I started writing seriously

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.000
in earnest, partly because I was
home with the children, who--

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.490
my children, probably
like your children,

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.140
were the most adorable
small children

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.670
in the history of
small children.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.350
I will fight anybody who
tells me to the contrary.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.600
And it was great to
be home with them,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.150
but they did not provide very
intellectually stimulating

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.060
conversation.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.030
I could talk all I
wanted about Teletubbies.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.850
Teletubbies were big
in my house, Barney.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.880
But eventually, I felt like
my brains were leaking out

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.490
my ears, and so to
a certain extent,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.980
that kind of thinking
about stories--

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.010
excuse me-- was sort of
self-defense to begin with.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.160
I didn't actually do much
in the way of writing,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.010
until my daughter was away
at school during the day,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.900
and my son could take naps.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.130
My husband worked
nights at the time,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.620
and so I would lay my toddler
son in bed next to his dad.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.540
And then I would
go to Starbucks,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.820
and then, eventually,
I came back

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.490
to consistently discover my
son playing in the living room

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.380
by himself.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.420
And then I enrolled
him in preschool

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.860
so that I could continue to
write just a couple of hours

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.390
in the morning.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.694
But I'm not going to lie.

00:33:23.694 --> 00:33:26.110
It's really hard when you've
got the little folks at home,

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.590
because you're lucky to
have a shower by yourself.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.930
And you can't give full
attention to other things,

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.960
because those little kids get
in a lot of trouble, right?

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.450
Yeah, there was also the keys
in the outlet the one day.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.310
I mean, yeah.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.660
The whole house went dark.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.890
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.460
And my kids were
pretty good kids,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.070
but you have to kind
of keep track of them.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.185
So it's the most amazing thing
when your youngest finally

00:33:51.185 --> 00:33:52.060
goes to kindergarten.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.050
You're like, I'm free.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.270
I can actually think about
things and do things.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.310
So my advice would be
while they're little,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.567
store up all the thoughts,
the random little thoughts

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:01.150
that you have.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.150
Keep them in a notebook.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.940
Keep them in the
back of your mind.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.100
And then, when you
do get to the point

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.856
where the kiddos are at
school or daycare or whatever,

00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:10.230
then take advantage
of that time.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:15.502
Don't worry about the freaking
laundry, anything like that.

00:34:15.502 --> 00:34:16.960
The clothes aren't
going to explode

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.000
if you don't wash them today.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.449
So just walk out of the
house, and sit down,

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.810
and work on whatever,
because that's important.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.120
You need to get your
brains working back again.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.605
Yeah.

00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.480
AUDIENCE: So I haven't
read the new book yet,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.909
but I'm kind of curious,
what percentage of the book

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.330
is sort of dedicated to
discussion, preparation,

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.590
and consumption of tea?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.360
ANN LECKIE: I would say 0%,
except there's one character,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.179
who does arrive and complains
that she cannot find a good cup

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.250
of tea.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.940
But I wanted very much--

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.390
the other night at a bookstore
event, a person said to me,

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.810
this main character is almost
like the complete opposite

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.070
of Breq.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.110
How much of that
was just you wanted

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.060
to write something that was
totally unlike the trilogy?

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.150
And I said, pretty
much all of it.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.770
So I just-- I was
like, all right,

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.650
this is going to be
different, so no tea.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.205
Protagonist is going
to be very different.

00:35:17.205 --> 00:35:17.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.080
Is tea something you drink a
lot of while you're writing?

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.913
ANN LECKIE: Oh, yes.

00:35:20.913 --> 00:35:23.560
Tea is something
I drink a lot of.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.742
One of the-- I love
traveling and meeting people,

00:35:25.742 --> 00:35:27.700
but one of the downsides
is it's very difficult

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.825
to find a good cup of tea
while you're on the road,

00:35:29.825 --> 00:35:32.200
because it's not a thing that
Americans typically-- it's

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.612
becoming more, which is awesome.

00:35:33.612 --> 00:35:35.320
Tea is kind of becoming
more fashionable,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.450
and you can find more
places that serve it.

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.129
But hotel rooms
do not necessarily

00:35:39.129 --> 00:35:41.170
provide you with good tea,
so I'm looking forward

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.294
to getting home and being
able to sit down and have

00:35:43.294 --> 00:35:44.507
a cup, yeah.

00:35:44.507 --> 00:35:46.840
AUDIENCE: So I haven't read,
actually, any of your work,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.160
and I'm looking
forward to it now.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.534
I'm going to read
this one first,

00:35:49.534 --> 00:35:51.490
because it's what's in my hands.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.060
So given what you
were just saying

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.060
about how this is the
opposite, or you were sort

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.400
of trying to lean
the other direction

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.500
from the previous trilogy,
when I finish this one,

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.041
if I go to pick up
your trilogy, what

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:02.650
would you say to prepare me?

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.760
ANN LECKIE: Oh, that's-- so the
trilogy is much more serious

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.950
and intense, particularly
the first book.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.590
The mood is very different,
and the protagonist

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:17.410
is very different and presents
in a far more grim way.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.490
So that would probably be
the biggest difference.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.820
But other than that, I think
if you enjoy this, which

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.797
is meant to be a standalone
for precisely that reason,

00:36:27.797 --> 00:36:30.130
you could probably enter into
the trilogy pretty easily,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:30.847
I would imagine.

00:36:30.847 --> 00:36:33.430
AUDIENCE: So you're not going
to warn me off of it completely?

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.890
ANN LECKIE: Oh, no.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.900
Buy and read all
my books, please.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.270
Yeah.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.160
AUDIENCE: So what are
you working on next?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.740
ANN LECKIE: Oh, I am
working on a thing,

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.250
but I'm not at the point where
I really can talk about it yet.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.708
But I will as soon as I can.

00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:50.666
AUDIENCE: So something.

00:36:50.666 --> 00:36:51.720
ANN LECKIE: Something, yeah.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.810
I am working on another book.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:53.770
Let me put it that
way, because if I

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.070
say I'm working on something,
it sounds like I've got--

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.300
I'm working on a movie.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.410
I'm writing comic books.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.036
No, it's nothing that
earth-shattering.

00:37:00.036 --> 00:37:01.243
I am working on another book.

00:37:01.243 --> 00:37:02.830
It's just too early
to talk about yet.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.780
Yeah.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.236
AUDIENCE: What is serbat?

00:37:06.236 --> 00:37:07.360
ANN LECKIE: What is serbat?

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.175
So it's not tea.

00:37:08.175 --> 00:37:09.550
AUDIENCE: Is it
a tea substitute?

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.665
ANN LECKIE: It's not tea.

00:37:10.665 --> 00:37:12.540
AUDIENCE: Almost but
not entirely unlike tea?

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.498
ANN LECKIE: Almost but
not entirely unlike tea.

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:17.690
There's actually a real
world drink I named it after.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.900
There's a drink.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.280
I found it in the
international grocery at home

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.530
called Serbat Wangi.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.250
And it's an instant thing,
comes in little packets,

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.750
and it's got sugar and cloves
and black pepper and ginger,

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.700
and it makes a nice,
little hot drink.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.890
And I said, well,
OK, it's not tea,

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.117
and I'll use that, because it's
actually kind of good tasting.

00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:42.700
AUDIENCE: And do you survive by
bringing your own tea with you

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.332
on tour?

00:37:43.332 --> 00:37:44.290
ANN LECKIE: I often do.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.500
I haven't this time around.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.291
I actually have a little
travel tea kettle.

00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:49.090
That's how desperate I am.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.510
But I did not bring it on this
tour, because it's so long.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.339
And I packed with
extreme efficiency,

00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:56.880
and there was no way that little
kettle was getting in there.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.970
AUDIENCE: Because if
you're looking for some,

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.847
there's a tea bar just
through back there.

00:37:59.847 --> 00:38:00.930
ANN LECKIE: Oh, thank you.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.840
Thank you very much.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.257
I think we have time
for another question.

00:38:08.257 --> 00:38:09.090
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.660
So you have a book, your first
book with, literally, "justice"

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.840
in the title and are fairly
active about social issues

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.340
on Twitter.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.640
How does that kind of
affect both your writing

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.290
and your professional life?

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.879
AUDIENCE: So I actually--

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:27.420
you're right.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.995
I am active with social
issues and stuff on Twitter.

00:38:29.995 --> 00:38:31.620
Lately, it's a lot
of angry retweeting,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.540
but I don't generally
start out saying,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.480
I want to write a book
about this social issue.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.550
I always start
out saying, I want

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.520
to write a book with this fun
thing, with spider mechs in it,

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.506
with ships that take over human
bodies, with space battles,

00:38:49.506 --> 00:38:51.130
because who doesn't
love space battles?

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:56.460
And then, because I am,
frankly, easily bored,

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.579
I need to have something
to really think about

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:00.870
while I'm working on a project.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.550
I get very unsatisfied
with things

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.315
that are just lots of noise.

00:39:04.315 --> 00:39:05.940
Sometimes that's what
you want to read,

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.890
but if I'm going
to write a book,

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.720
I need to have more
to think about.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.480
And then, at that
point, I start digging

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.240
into the motifs and the
things that I'm writing about,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.530
and it's difficult for me not
to think about my politics,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.500
how that intersects with
what the story is saying.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.190
I personally believe
that narrative

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.550
is extraordinarily
powerful, because it's

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:30.900
a basic mode of human thought.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.910
It's how we analyze
the world around us.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.070
And the narratives that
we have in our inventory

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.530
influence how we're going
to respond to the world.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.970
We see a thing,
and we're like, we

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.200
need to make a
pattern out of that.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:40.908
Here's a pattern.

00:39:40.908 --> 00:39:41.790
Here's a template.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.060
All right, everything fits, and
then you act according to that.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.760
And sometimes you
can pick a template

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.240
that can literally end up
with somebody getting killed.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.300
And I would never
tell writers to write

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.660
particular kinds of stories,
but I feel that as a writer,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.795
it's very important to
think about the stories

00:39:59.795 --> 00:40:01.920
that I'm putting out,
because those are potentially

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.120
people's templates.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.760
And I don't want to be
saying something that I

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.890
would regret having said.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.050
So I do think very
hard about those things

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.970
when I write the story,
but I don't sit down

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.934
to write a story
that tells somebody

00:40:13.934 --> 00:40:16.600
about my political beliefs about
something, if that makes sense.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.225
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:18.140
Thank you.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.920
ANN LECKIE: Thank you.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.770
Thank you.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.420
