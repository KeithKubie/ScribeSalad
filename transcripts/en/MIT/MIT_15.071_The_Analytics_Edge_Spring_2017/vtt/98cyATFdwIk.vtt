00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.780
Now, let's take a look at
a full example of a case.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.160
This is a head and neck
example, and the CT scans

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980
are shown on the right.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.280
There are a total
of 132,878 voxels.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.680
The target, or tumor,
has 9,777 voxels.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.680
There are five
critical structures

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.400
that we want to minimize the
dose to-- the spinal cord,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.540
the brain, the brain
stem, the parotid glands,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.350
and the mandible or jaw.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.130
We're using five
beams, and each beam

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.110
is composed of
about 60 beamlets.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.990
In total, there
are 328 beamlets.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.660
In this example, we want
the dose to the whole tumor

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.310
to be between 70 and 77 gray.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.400
The spinal cord dose should
be no more than 45 gray,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.200
since significant damage to
any voxel in the spinal cord

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.100
will result in loss of function.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.240
The brain stem dose should
be no more than 54 gray,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.150
and the mandible dose should
be no more than 70 gray.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.160
The average parotid gland dose
should be at most 26 gray.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.940
This constraint is
a little different,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.960
since the parotid gland
is a parallel structure.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.920
Significant damage
to any one voxel

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.729
does not jeopardize function
of the entire organ.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.700
So what is our
optimization problem now?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.080
Again, our decisions are the
intensities of the beamlets.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.100
Our objective is to minimize the
total dose to healthy tissue.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.259
Our constraints are
limits on the tumor dose

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.690
and upper bounds for the spinal
cord, brain stem, and mandible.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.420
We also have a constraint to
limit the average parotid dose

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.470
to 26 gray.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.220
Lastly, all of our intensities,
or decision variables,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.640
should be non-negative.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.329
We solved this
optimization problem,

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.800
and this plot shows the results.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.270
On the x-axis is the
dose, in gray, and on

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.010
the y-axis is the
fraction of voxels

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.070
that received that
dose or higher.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.730
Each line corresponds to
a different structure.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.079
We can see that for the tumor,
which is shown as the red line,

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.270
100% of the voxels get a dose
of 70 gray, and 0% of the voxels

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.460
get a dose of more than 77 gray.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.410
This is what our
constraint specified.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.400
While none of the
critical structures

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.840
are getting very
high doses, it looks

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.710
like the mandible, which
is shown as the blue line,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.420
is receiving the highest
dose of the healthy organs.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.950
In the next video, we'll
explore different solutions

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.200
and the shadow prices
of our constraints.
