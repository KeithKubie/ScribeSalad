00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things I've wondered
 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.660 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things I've wondered
here's<00:00:42.239><c> something</c><00:00:42.540><c> to</c><00:00:42.570><c> think</c><00:00:42.629><c> about</c><00:00:43.340><c> it</c><00:00:44.340><c> might</c>

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 align:start position:0%
here's something to think about it might
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 align:start position:0%
here's something to think about it might
be<00:00:44.910><c> that</c><00:00:45.120><c> the</c><00:00:45.629><c> sense</c><00:00:45.930><c> of</c><00:00:46.140><c> meaning</c><00:00:46.530><c> that</c><00:00:47.160><c> life</c>
