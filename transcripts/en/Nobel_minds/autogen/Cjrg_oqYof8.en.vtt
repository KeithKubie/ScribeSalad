we make a line of pencil pencil line

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110
we make a line of pencil pencil line
 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.049
we make a line of pencil pencil line
like that they have probably produce

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
like that they have probably produce
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.440
like that they have probably produce
graphene without knowing it because the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
graphene without knowing it because the
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450
graphene without knowing it because the
fein is the single mono layer of carbon

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
fein is the single mono layer of carbon
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.870
fein is the single mono layer of carbon
atoms and part of this pencil line would

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
atoms and part of this pencil line would
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.710
atoms and part of this pencil line would
actually also contain a single monolayer

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720
actually also contain a single monolayer
 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.160
actually also contain a single monolayer
so graphite exists as stats layers is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
so graphite exists as stats layers is
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620
so graphite exists as stats layers is
that what you're saying they yes it does

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
that what you're saying they yes it does
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870
that what you're saying they yes it does
yeah it's like and graphene is one of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
yeah it's like and graphene is one of
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.139
yeah it's like and graphene is one of
those layers you're correctly yeah and

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149
those layers you're correctly yeah and
 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.279
those layers you're correctly yeah and
you have another nice property show us

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289
you have another nice property show us
 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.830
you have another nice property show us
to show how graphene is that the if you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
to show how graphene is that the if you
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600
to show how graphene is that the if you
like to get a feeling for what graphene

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
like to get a feeling for what graphene
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.130
like to get a feeling for what graphene
is you can actually increase its lateral

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140
is you can actually increase its lateral
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.499
is you can actually increase its lateral
dimensions with 100 million times and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
dimensions with 100 million times and
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.380
dimensions with 100 million times and
then you will get the honey come or a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
then you will get the honey come or a
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990
then you will get the honey come or a
chicken wire like structure which would

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
chicken wire like structure which would
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230
chicken wire like structure which would
be of this size 100 million times larger

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
be of this size 100 million times larger
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.249
be of this size 100 million times larger
than graphene and actually if you could

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
than graphene and actually if you could
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.380
than graphene and actually if you could
show that this line would be about only

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
show that this line would be about only
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080
show that this line would be about only
three percent above the size of the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
three percent above the size of the
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.940
three percent above the size of the
thickness of the this chicken bayonet

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
thickness of the this chicken bayonet
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.819
thickness of the this chicken bayonet
and what is interesting is that the the

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829
and what is interesting is that the the
 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.609
and what is interesting is that the the
two researchers and the co-workers they

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
two researchers and the co-workers they
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.280
two researchers and the co-workers they
started not to use graphene flakes which

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290
started not to use graphene flakes which
 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.589
started not to use graphene flakes which
are not bigger than the draft you have

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599
are not bigger than the draft you have
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.589
are not bigger than the draft you have
in your hair but today you can produce

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599
in your hair but today you can produce
 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.100
in your hair but today you can produce
on plastic for use graphene sheets which

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110
on plastic for use graphene sheets which
 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.309
on plastic for use graphene sheets which
is the same width as this net so it

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319
is the same width as this net so it
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.440
is the same width as this net so it
isn't tremendous development which has

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
isn't tremendous development which has
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.110
isn't tremendous development which has
occurred in six years because I didn't

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
occurred in six years because I didn't
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.850
occurred in six years because I didn't
tell you that the the groundbreaking

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860
tell you that the the groundbreaking
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.210
tell you that the the groundbreaking
discovery was made in october two

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
discovery was made in october two
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.400
discovery was made in october two
thousand four so if we focus on that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410
thousand four so if we focus on that
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.190
thousand four so if we focus on that
discovery in october 2004 could you tell

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
discovery in october 2004 could you tell
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.559
discovery in october 2004 could you tell
us about how the researchers Isaac and I

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569
us about how the researchers Isaac and I
 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.789
us about how the researchers Isaac and I
could you tell us more about how

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799
could you tell us more about how
 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.729
could you tell us more about how
graphene was actually isolated yes it's

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739
graphene was actually isolated yes it's
 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.190
graphene was actually isolated yes it's
a very interesting story if I had their

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
a very interesting story if I had their
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.050
a very interesting story if I had their
piece of scotch tape it I could have

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
piece of scotch tape it I could have
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420
piece of scotch tape it I could have
demonstrated it to you but what they did

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
demonstrated it to you but what they did
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.069
demonstrated it to you but what they did
was actually that they took a piece of

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079
was actually that they took a piece of
 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.009
was actually that they took a piece of
graphite a piece of carbon they put the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019
graphite a piece of carbon they put the
 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.699
graphite a piece of carbon they put the
scotch tape on the on the carbon and

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
scotch tape on the on the carbon and
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.620
scotch tape on the on the carbon and
since graphite can be easily cleaved

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630
since graphite can be easily cleaved
 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.650
since graphite can be easily cleaved
they got graphite on the scotch tape and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660
they got graphite on the scotch tape and
 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.890
they got graphite on the scotch tape and
then they except by by making this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
then they except by by making this
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.259
then they except by by making this
procedure many times open and close the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
procedure many times open and close the
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.210
procedure many times open and close the
tape they they got thinner and thinner

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
tape they they got thinner and thinner
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.970
tape they they got thinner and thinner
layers which I placed on an other

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980
layers which I placed on an other
 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.160
layers which I placed on an other

silicon crystal and what's the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480
silicon crystal and what's the
 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.729
silicon crystal and what's the
importance of the oxidized silicon

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
importance of the oxidized silicon
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.710
importance of the oxidized silicon
crystal that that was the other other

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
crystal that that was the other other
 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.750
crystal that that was the other other
invention they may they found out that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
invention they may they found out that
 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.199
invention they may they found out that
50 they oxidize the silicon to certain

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209
50 they oxidize the silicon to certain
 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.930
50 they oxidize the silicon to certain
thickness of oxide they could actually

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940
thickness of oxide they could actually
 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.099
thickness of oxide they could actually
see seeing a layer of carbon due to

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109
see seeing a layer of carbon due to
 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.199
see seeing a layer of carbon due to
interference changes in the interference

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
interference changes in the interference
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.590
interference changes in the interference
color so it was a very very ingenious

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600
color so it was a very very ingenious
 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.629
color so it was a very very ingenious
way of actually spotting a single layer

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639
way of actually spotting a single layer
 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.580
way of actually spotting a single layer
of graphene which made it possible for

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590
of graphene which made it possible for
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.309
of graphene which made it possible for
them to isolate it and characterize it

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319
them to isolate it and characterize it
 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.280
them to isolate it and characterize it
and so what makes graphene such a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
and so what makes graphene such a
 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.520
and so what makes graphene such a

the idea is that you could differentiate

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470
the idea is that you could differentiate
 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.070

between different base pairs because

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
between different base pairs because
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.730
between different base pairs because
they only be one base by forcing the the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740
they only be one base by forcing the the
 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.550
they only be one base by forcing the the
same hole at the same time so it acts as

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560
same hole at the same time so it acts as
 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.450
same hole at the same time so it acts as
a sort of filter it acts as a filter

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460
a sort of filter it acts as a filter
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.029
a sort of filter it acts as a filter
which also gives an electronic signature

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039
which also gives an electronic signature
 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.260
which also gives an electronic signature
and so how far are we with these these

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270
and so how far are we with these these
 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.029
and so how far are we with these these
applications are there any applications

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039
applications are there any applications
 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.200
applications are there any applications
on the market or are these just

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210
on the market or are these just
 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.270
on the market or are these just
potential applications I would say that

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280
potential applications I would say that
 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.800
potential applications I would say that
they are still has potential

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810
they are still has potential
 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.080
they are still has potential
applications i guessing i think the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090
applications i guessing i think the
 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.450
applications i guessing i think the

touch screen application has comforters
 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.640
touch screen application has comforters
but they are still not only in the

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650
but they are still not only in the
 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.969
but they are still not only in the
laboratories so we so we have discovery

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979
laboratories so we so we have discovery
 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.320
laboratories so we so we have discovery

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.270
of graphene and it has all these
potential tremendous applications but

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280
potential tremendous applications but
 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.100
potential tremendous applications but
there's still potential applications at

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110
there's still potential applications at
 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.409
there's still potential applications at

is normally I think there are longer

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000
is normally I think there are longer
 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.420
is normally I think there are longer
periods but if you go back in the in the

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430
periods but if you go back in the in the
 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.820

history you can find other prices which

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830
history you can find other prices which
 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.790
