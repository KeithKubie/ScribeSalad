00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.690
When Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.750
he declared that one of the missions of the
modern Olympiad would be “to reunite in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.510
the bonds of legitimate wedlock a long-divorced
couple — Muscle and Mind.”

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.630
To the Baron, Olympic competition wasn’t
just going to be about physical athletics,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.980
but sports of the mind as well – and there
are fewer greater “sports of the mind”

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.090
than the arts.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.170
From 1912 to 1948, in seven Olympiads, over
151 Olympic medals were awarded in artistic

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.800
competitions.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.239
Growing up in the French autocracy, Coubertin
valued a classical education.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.260
He loved sports, especially rugby, but there
is little evidence he was particularly athletic

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.270
himself.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.840
As his career as an educator gained steam,
he pressed for more physical education in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840
schools.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.840
He believed sports to be democratic, blurring
class lines, but he also thought of physical

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.570
education as a way to prepare the youth for
the rigors of war.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.500
After all, when he was but a boy, he saw his
beloved country humiliated in the Franco-Prussian

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.979
War (or “War of 1870”).

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.299
Coubertin always admired how the ancient Greeks
were able to combine classical and physical

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.899
education, the epitome of this being the ancient
Olympiad.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.889
So, he made an announcement to a Parisian
sporting association in November 1892 that

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:30.390
he was going to bring back the Olympic Games
and make them an international competition.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.319
In April 1896, the first modern, international
Olympic Games commenced in Athens, Greece.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.729
While 43 events encompassing 9 sports took
place that first year, there were no art competitions.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520
That was supposed to change in 1908.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.249
With Coubertin pushing for the inclusion of
art competitions into the Games, there was

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.149
a plan in place to make that happen.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.139
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out due to
several factors that were out of the Baron’s

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:55.139
control.

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:00.021
Early in 1907, only 18 months before the 1908
Olympiad, the IOC (which Coubertin was the

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:04.899
head of) changed the location of the Games
from Rome, Italy to London.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.970
The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906 and
a struggling economy made the Games infeasible

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.970
in Rome.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.709
The rushed preparation in London caused several
events to be cancelled, including the art

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.769
competitions.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.540
At the Stockholm, Sweden Games in 1912, art
competitions officially became part of the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.540
Olympiad.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.819
This happened despite several prominent organizations,
including the Stockholm Organizing Committee,

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.340
being against attaching art competitions to
the Olympics.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.629
They thought it was “meaningless” and
logistically challenging.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.540
Nonetheless, the Baron had made up his mind
and he pushed it through.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.500
Art was to become an official Olympic “sport.”

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.950
In September 1911, ten months prior to the
1912 Opening Ceremonies, a call for submissions

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.310
was published with a list of rules and regulations.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.280
There were to be five categories of submissions:
architecture, music, painting, sculpture and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
literature.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.400
All the works submitted “must be original
and directly inspired by the idea of sport.”

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.290
Additionally, the announcement contained a
promise:

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.439
“Each of the laureates of the five contests
will receive the medals of the Vth Olympiad.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:17.069
The winning works will be as much as possible
displayed, published, or executed in the course

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.159
of the Games.”

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.720
The 1912 Olympics only received 33 submissions
(nearly all from Europeans), but still gave

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.099
away five gold medals.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.999
However, because of the small number and the
underwhelming quality of the entries, silver

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.470
and bronze were not awarded in four of the
five categories.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.859
The gold medal winners included a building
plan for a “modern” stadium by two Swiss

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.249
architects, a sculpture of a horse pulling
a chariot by an American sculptor who had

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:46.719
already won two athletic gold medals for sharpshooting,
and an “Ode to Sport” penned by Germans

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.670
“George Hohrod and Martin Eschbach.”

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.950
As it turns out, Hohrod and Eschbach were
pseudonyms for the person who really wrote

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.200
the ode – the Baron himself.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.379
Understandably fearful they wouldn’t have
enough entries, he took it upon himself to

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.540
help the cause.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.569
Rather suspiciously, his ode won gold.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.231
Though the 1916 Olympic Games were cancelled
due to World War I, art was again on the Olympic

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:14.639
program in the 1920 Berlin Olympics and the
1924 Games in Paris, where they received submission

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.060
from 193 artists.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.959
At the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics, over 1100
works of art were submitted and put on display

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.750
at the Municipal Museum.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.370
The Olympic art competition was now big enough
that it was attracting real talent, including

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.099
Italian sculptor Rembrandt Bugatti, American
cartoonist Percy Crosby, and Dutch painter

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.710
Isaac Israëls.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.870
Despite this bringing legitimacy to the competition,
it brought up the question of amateurism.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.419
Technically, all Olympic participants were
supposed to be amateurs, but many artists

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.440
used their well-regarded skills to make money,
particularly the architects and musicians

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.780
who almost universally were employed in those
professions.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.860
How do you have a valid art competition with
highly skilled artists if those entering weren’t

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.099
allowed to make a living off their art?

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.240
Nevertheless, the art competitions were a
hit.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.160
For instance, at the 1932 Olympics in Los
Angeles, nearly 400,000 visitors went to check

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.720
out the art entries at the Los Angeles Museum
of History.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.569
The 1936 Olympics in Berlin are infamous for
several reasons, many of which were related

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.210
to the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in
Germany.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.710
The Third Reich’s Minister of Propaganda,
Joseph Goebbels, felt the need to remind the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.139
German people that work entered into the competition
needed to have been created within the last

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.819
four years, i.e. when the Nazi party came
into power.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.900
Not surprisingly, Germans won more than half
of the gold medals given out in artistic competitions

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.889
in 1936.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.460
As for the Baron Pierre de Coubertin, he had
stepped down as IOC president in 1925 and

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.259
was in failing health in 1936 (he would pass
away in 1937) and didn’t even attend the

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.069
Olympics in 1936.

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.781
Despite being French, he was greatly respected
in Germany for his revival of the Olympic

00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:55.240
Games, which very much played into the hands
of the Aryan masculinity mystique that the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.270
Nazi party promoted.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.190
With no Olympics in 1944 due to World War
II, the London Olympics in 1948 would be the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.479
last time an art competition would be officially
part of the Olympic Games.

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.580
The amateur question played a major factor
in its removal after a report was presented

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.960
demonstrating that virtually all of the artists
submitting their works for their respective

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.690
art competitions were also making money on
their art.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.409
A later report stated that it was, “illogical
that professionals should compete at such

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.800
exhibitions and be awarded Olympic medals.”

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.819
With the question of amateur and professionals
hanging over the competition, it diluted the

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:38.120
entry pool and by 1952, medals were no longer
awarded on submissions of art to the Olympics.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.820
Leni Riefenstahl filmed the 1936 Olympics,
at the behest of Hitler, and turned it into

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.289
a Nazi propaganda film called “Olympia.”

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.240
While, overwhelmingly, it showed Germans looking
and performing like superior athletes, it

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.250
did capture the greatness of Jesse Owens.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.030
In fact, the film clip the public often sees
of Owens running during the 1936 Olympics

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.060
is from this film.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.280
There is a story that Hitler snubbed 4 time
gold medal winner Jesse Owens by leaving the

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.659
Olympic Stadium when he was supposed to be
congratulating medal winners, including Owens.

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:14.240
Owens denied the claim that Hitler snubbed
him during the games, “Hitler had a certain

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.229
time to come to the stadium and a certain
time to leave.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.810
It happened he had to leave before the victory
ceremony after the 100 meters.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.800
But before he left, I was on my way to a broadcast
and passed near his box.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.199
He waved at me and I waved back.”

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.240
Hitler also later sent Owens an inscribed
commemorative photograph of himself.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.820
Owens further went on to say, “Hitler didn’t
snub me – it was FDR who snubbed me.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.960
The President didn’t even send me a telegram…

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.930
When I came back to my native country, after
all the stories about Hitler, I couldn’t

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.180
ride in the front of the bus.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.069
I had to go to the back door.

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:46.180
I couldn’t live where I wanted.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.020
I wasn’t invited to shake hands with Hitler
but I wasn’t invited to the White House

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.389
to shake hands with the President either.”

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.180
To make matters worse, when Owens arrived
at his own reception party at the Waldorf

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.870
hotel after a parade, he was not allowed to
enter via the main doors and also was not

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.740
allowed to use the normal elevators, once
inside.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:28.340
Instead, he had to use a freight elevator
to get to his own party.
