representation, for enabling common sense reasoning. But what is common

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.720
sense reasoning? You can do it, I can do it. How do we make a machine do it?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.260
To illustrate common sense reasoning, let us consider a simple sentence.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.200
Ashok ate a frog. All right, you understand the sentence. You

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.610
understand the meaning of the sentence. But, what is the meaning of the meaning?

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.259
What did you just understand? Try to answer the questions on the right.
