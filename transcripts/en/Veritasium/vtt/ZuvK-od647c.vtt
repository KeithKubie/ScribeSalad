00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:07.089
- In the 1930s, Albert Einstein was upset
with quantum mechanics. He proposed a thought

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.760
experiment where, according to the theory,
an event at one point in the universe could

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.079
instantaneously affect another event arbitrarily
far away. He called this "spooky action at

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:24.519
a distance" because he thought it was absurd.
It seemed to imply faster than light communication,

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.500
something his theory of relativity ruled out.
But nowadays, we can do this experiment, and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.230
what we find is, indeed, spooky. But in order
to understand it, we must first understand

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.010
spin. All fundamental particles have a property
called spin. No, they're not actually spinning,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.210
but the analogy is appropriate. They have
angular momentum, and they have an orientation

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.030
in space. Now, we can measure the spin of
a particle, but we have to choose the direction

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380
in which to measure it, and this measurement
can have only one of two outcomes. Either

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.240
the particleâ€™s spin is aligned with the
direction of measurement, which we'll call

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.850
spin up, or, it is opposite the measurement,
which we'll call spin down. Now, what happens

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.940
if the particle spin is vertical, but we measure
it's spin horizontally? Well then, it has

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.250
a 50% chance of being spin up, and a 50% chance
of being spin down, and after the measurement,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.990
the particle maintains this spin, so measuring
its spin actually changes the spin of the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.500
particle. What if we measure spin at an angle
60 degrees from the vertical? Well now, since

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.470
the spin of the particle is more aligned to
this measurement, it will be spin up 3/4 of

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.880
the time, and spin down 1/4 of the time. The
probability depends on the square of the cosine

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.390
of half the angle. Now, an experiment like
the one Einstein proposed can be performed

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.200
using two of these particles, but they must
be prepared in a particular way. For example,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.700
formed spontaneously out of energy. Now, since
the total angular momentum of the universe

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.170
must stay constant, you know that if one particle
is measured to have spin up, the other, measured

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.479
in the same direction, must have spin down.
I should point out, it's only if the two particles

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.120
are measured in the same direction that their
spins must be opposite. Now here's where things

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.120
start to get a little weird. You might imagine
that each particle is created with a definite

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.010
well-defined spin, but that won't work, and
here's why. Imagine their spins were vertical

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.670
and opposite. Now, if they're both measured
in a horizontal direction, each one has a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.540
50/50 chance of being spin up. So, there's
actually a 50% chance that both measurements

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.090
will yield the same spin outcome, and this
would violate the law of conservation of angular

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.420
momentum. According to quantum mechanics,
these particles don't have a well-defined

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.531
spin at all. They are entangled, which means
their spin is simply opposite that of the

00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:56.160
other particle. So, when one particle is measured,
and its spin determined, you immediately know

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.709
what the same measurement of the other particle
will be. This has been rigorously and repeatedly

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.720
tested experimentally. It doesn't matter at
which angle the detectors are set, or how

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.959
far apart they are, they always measure opposite
spins. Now just stop for a minute, and think

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.750
about how crazy this is. Both particles have
undefined spins, and then you measure one,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.780
and immediately you know the spin of the other
particle, which could be light-years away.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.050
It's as though the choice of the first measurement
has influenced the result of the second faster

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.040
than the speed of light, which is, indeed,
how some theorists interpret the result. But

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.800
not Einstein. Einstein was really bothered
by this. He preferred an alternate explanation,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.660
that all along the particles contained hidden
information about which spin they would have

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.879
if measured in any direction. It's just that
we didn't know this information until we measured

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.330
them. Now, since that information was within
the particles from the moment they formed

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.769
at the same point in space, no signal would
ever have to travel between the two particles

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.240
faster than light. Now, for a time, scientists
accepted this view that there were just some

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.770
things about the particles we couldn't know
before we measured them. But then along came

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.629
John Bell with a way to test this idea. This
experiment can determine whether the particles

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.870
contain hidden information all along, or not,
and this is how it works. There are two spin

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.449
detectors, each capable of measuring spin
in one of three directions. These measurement

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.050
directions will be selected randomly, and
independent of each other. Now, pairs of entangled

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.400
particles will be sent to the two detectors,
and we record whether the measured spins are

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.560
the same, both up, or both down, or different.
We'll repeat this procedure over and over,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.229
randomly varying those measurement directions,
to find the percentage of the time the two

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.600
detectors give different results, and this
is the key, because that percentage depends

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.070
on whether the particles contain hidden information
all along, or if they don't. Now, to see why

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.420
this is the case, let's calculate the expected
frequency of different readings if the particles

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.259
do contain hidden information. Now, you can
think of this hidden information like a secret

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.590
plan the particles agree to, and the only
criterion that plan must satisfy is that if

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.229
the particles are ever measured in the same
direction, they must give opposite spins.

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.430
So, for example, one plan could be that one
particle will give spin up for every measurement

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.170
direction, and its pair would give spin down
for every measurement direction. Or another

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.160
plan, plan two, could be that one particle
could give spin up for the first direction,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.070
spin down for the second direction, and spin
up for the third direction, whereas its partner

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.639
would give spin down for the first direction,
spin up for the second direction, and spin

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.810
down for the third direction. All other plans
are mathematically equivalent, so we can work

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.700
out the expected frequency of different results
using these two plans. Here, I'm visually

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.840
representing the particles by their plans,
their hidden information. With plan one, the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.560
results will obviously be different 100% of
the time. It doesn't matter which measurement

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.361
directions are selected, but it does for particles
using the second plan. For example, if both

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.400
detectors measure in the first direction,
particle A gives spin up, while particle B

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.520
gives spin down. The results are different.
But if instead, detector B measured in the

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.000
second direction, the result would be spin
up, so the spins are the same. We can continue

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.240
doing this for all the possible measurement
combinations, and what we find, is the results

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.930
are different five out of nine times. So,
using the second plan, the results should

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.070
be different 5/9 of the time, and using the
first plan, the results should be different

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.660
100% of the time, so overall, if the particles
contain hidden information, you should see

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.060
different results more than 5/9 of the time.
So what do we actually see in experiment?

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:49.110
Well, the results are different only 50% of
the time. It doesn't work, so the experiment

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.740
rules out the idea that all along, these particles
contain hidden information about which spin

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.380
they will give in the different directions.
So, how does quantum mechanics account for

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.300
this result? Well, let's imagine detector
A measures spin in the first direction, and

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.710
the result is spin up. Now, immediately you
know that the other particle is spin down

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.250
if measured in the first direction, which
would happen randomly 1/3 of the time. However,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.100
if particle B is measured in one of the other
two directions, it makes an angle of 60 degrees

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.479
with these measurement directions, and recall,
from the beginning of this video, the resulting

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.420
measurement should be spin up 3/4 of the time.
Since these measurement directions will be

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:36.389
randomly selected 2/3 of the time, particle
B will give spin up 2/3 times 3/4 equals half

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.569
of the time. So both detectors should give
the same results half of the time, and different

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:47.020
results half of the time, which is exactly
what we see in the experiment. So quantum

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.540
mechanics works. But there is debate over
how to interpret these results. Some physicists

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.570
see them as evidence that there is no hidden
information in quantum particles, and it only

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.080
makes sense to talk about spins once they've
been measured, whereas other physicists believe

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.630
that entangled particles can signal each other
faster than light to update their hidden information

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:14.110
when one is measured. So, does this mean that
we can use entangled particles to communicate

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:20.660
faster than light? Well, everyone agrees that
we can't. And that is because the results

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.231
that you find at either detector are random.
It doesn't matter which measurement direction

00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:30.919
you select, or what's happening at the other
detector, there's a 50/50 probability of obtaining

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:36.119
spin up or spin down. Only if these observers
later met up and compared notebooks, would

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:42.039
they realize that when they selected the same
direction, they always got opposite spins.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:48.329
Both sets of data would be random, just the
opposite random from the other observer. That

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:53.619
is, indeed, spooky, but it doesn't allow for
the communication, the sending of information

00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:59.519
from one point to another, faster than light,
so it doesn't violate the theory of relativity.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:05.010
And that, at the very least, would make Einstein
happy.
