00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.609
What did you write down, David?

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; So going down the outside we
have alternating L and W junctions.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.340
An L in the bottom left,
a W, an L and so on.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.830
Right in the center we have a Y.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.440
So we can differentiate a Y junction and
a W junction, by saying that for

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.050
a W junction one of the three
angles has to be over 180 degrees.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.248
Whereas in a Y junction,
all three are less than 180 degrees.

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:26.270
A T junction happens when one of
the angles is exactly 180 degrees.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.260
&gt;&gt; This sounds good.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.130
And now let us look at how
we'll apply these constraints

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.520
to identify the surfaces.
