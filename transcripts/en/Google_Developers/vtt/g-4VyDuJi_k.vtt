00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.300
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everybody. My name is
Thor Mitchell, I am Product Manager for the

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.420
Google Maps API. Welcome to Google IO. I hope
you're enjoying it so far. We have today a

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.859
bunch of The Geo API luminaries on stage;
here to give you a brief overview of the kind

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.099
of things we're doing right now, and answer
questions you might have that have been festering

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.679
in your brain for the last year. Um, so let
me just do a quick round of introductions.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.940
Um this is Ben. Ben is the techno manager
for the Maps API.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.440
&gt;&gt;Ben: Hey everyone. I'm the engineering manager
for the Maps API. I work in Sydney.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.380
&gt;&gt;Bart: I'm Bart Locanthi, I'm in Mountainview.
I work on the um, Maps Data API and also My

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.380
Maps.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.469
&gt;&gt;Matt: Hi, my name is Matt and I'm a product
manager in Mountainview, working on the Data

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.079
Maps API team

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.089
&gt;&gt;Peter: I'm Peter Birch, I'm Product Manager
for Google Earth API as well as the rest of

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.460
the Google Earth family.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.490
&gt;&gt;Thatcher: Hi, I'm Thatcher Ulrich. I am
the Tech lead of the Earth API, [coughs] excuse

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.260
me, and plug in.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.710
&gt;&gt;Thor: Great, so what we thought we'd do
is, um, just take a couple of minutes each

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.540
to talk about, um recent developments or developments
in these various APIs over the last year and

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.720
just kind of remind some of you where we're
at and uh, and then we'll open it up to questions.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720
So on the subject of the Maps API, I'm not
sure how many of you were in our session that

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.810
we finished just 15 minutes ago. Um, but you'll
uh, you may not have heard that, as some of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.760
you may be aware we have a couple of different
Map APIs. Uh we have the V2 JavaScript’s

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.720
Maps API, which is the most heavily used Maps
API and often the one that people think of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.900
when you hear someone saying Maps API, and
that's been around for almost five years now.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.820
It's a very popular used, actively used on
over 350,000 websites worldwide. At this time

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.850
last year at Google IO we launched a new JavaScript’s
Maps API, the Maps API V3, which is primarily

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.150
motivated by desire to cater better to the
sort of new breed of mobile web-enabled devices

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.172
like the iPhone and the Android and such like.
And that launched in Labs at Google IO last

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:27.740
year. And over the course of the last year,
we've been gradually adding more and more

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.210
features to that API and trying to build it
up to be a credible successor to the Maps

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.450
API V2. So, uh we are very happy to announce
just an hour ago, that the Maps API V3 is

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.000
graduating from Google Code Labs today and
from here on will be the principle Google

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.180
Maps JavaScript’s API. And you'll find that
all of the Maps API-related content at this

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.560
year's Google IO is focused on the Maps API
V3.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.959
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, so on the Maps Data API side
we announced the API last year at Where 2.0

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.090
and the idea behind the API, if you're not
familiar with it is that you can store geographic

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.400
content on Google's clouds so it can be kind
of a pain when your, when you want to make

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.460
a maps mash up to run your own server, or
you're on geospatial database and so the idea

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.850
is you should be able to focus on just creating
like a really cool client you know mash up

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.900
and we'll take care of the storage and hosting
and bandwidth issues for you. Um, so this

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.260
was launched last year, and then one of the
things that we were pretty excited about,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.740
we launched just at the end of the year was
Search. So that, you know it's one thing to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.099
just be able to just upload geographic content
to the cloud and then get it back and update

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.120
it, but you also often want to be able to
search over it. So, now you should be able

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.360
to upload, say you know 4,000 hotels for example,
in the United States and then do both spatial

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.530
and attribute queries on it. So you can say,
you know, give me all of the hotels within

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.209
20 miles of San Francisco, and I want only
the ones that have a pool and Wi-Fi. So you

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.709
can sort of decide what attributes, they're
just custom attributes, you can add to features,

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.730
then you can control what you get back there.
And, then we also added map access controls,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.540
so you can say exactly, sort of who has access
to your map. Do you want it to be private

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.090
or public or open to the world? Share it just
with specific collaborators? And, uh, you

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.310
can also think of this API as basically giving
you programmatic access to Google My Maps.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.389
So you can, if you want to write like a My
Maps client on a mobile phone for example,

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.490
you can basically use it to create and update
and retrieve Google My Maps.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.740
&gt;&gt;Peter: So, it's been a pretty exciting year
for us for Earth API. This is our second year

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.249
anniversary of when we announced it. Last
couple of years we've been spending a lot

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:43.599
of time working on, you know general stability,
performance, platforms getting onto more browsers,

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.949
more OS's. Probably the most interesting recent
development is that Google itself has become

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.360
one of the largest Maps, Earth API user with
the introduction of the Earth View in our

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.880
maps. If you go to Google Maps, right now,
you actually click on an Earth button, it

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.509
brings up, you know, an earth view right there.
You can switch back and forth between other

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.069
views. You can do the things that you would
normally do in Google Maps, but now immediately

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:13.409
switch over and get an interactive high-performance
fluid 3-D view as well. That's using all of

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.009
our public APIs. That's using the same plug
in, the same JavaScript, everything like that.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.849
That's basically the product that we built
for you guys two years ago and have been,

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.300
and continuing to develop. But now, it's actually,
you know, an integral part of one of our core

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.240
properties and I think that's a testament
to sort of, how we've progressed and, and

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.689
this, you know how that has grown as a platform.
Um, I'm not going to talk a lot about what's

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.550
coming up next because I don't want to steal
Josh's thunder, who's actually back in the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.409
back there. And tomorrow, at 2:15 there's
going to be a talk that he and Mano, who's

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.710
in front here, are going to talk a little
bit about Earth API and KML and kind of what's

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.330
new. So I'm not going to tell you anything.
So you go to that talk, tomorrow at 2:15.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.189
The one thing I will steal from their thunder
a little bit, is one of the exciting things

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:07.520
has been just over all adoption of the plug-in.
I think that's always been a concern about,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.000
you know how many people, you know plug-in's
are kind of a pain, we'd love to not have

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.029
them, we'd love it if, you know, the browsers
could do great 3D all the time. That's not

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.419
quite where we are just now, but we've had
a great adoption and penetration with Earth

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:28.800
API and we are now over 100 million installs
of the plug-in, which is uh, you know a very

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.999
impressive number in end user base. As developers
you're thinking about actually creating an

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:42.860
Earth API application that there's a, you
know, a broad base of users out there who

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.490
use it. Um, and I think that's about it.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.389
&gt;&gt;Thor: Great, thank you for that. Okay, so
um, we uh, we have a wave. If you would like

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.999
to submit questions through that. We also
have a microphone. Um, it's great for us,

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:05.599
Google IO is always a good opportunity for
us to meet developers and understand our community.

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.559
We also have a couple of other means by which
you can engage with us over the course of

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:16.479
the year outside of Google IO which I just
want to also remind you of. It's always really

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:22.869
helpful for us to hear from developers. All
of the products on stage here and many other

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:29.729
Google APIs have a dedicated Google group,
and many of us spend time reading posts on

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:34.059
that, responding to posts on those groups.
There are a number for the Maps API and for

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:39.400
other APIs, so I'd encourage you to take a
look at those, join them. They are a fantastic

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:48.629
repository of information about, about these
APIs. We also have a issue tracker on code.Google.com,

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.279
which is a place where you as a developer
can go and report any problems you are having

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:58.449
with the API, or make suggestions for features
you might like to see introduced in the API.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:02.990
And, in addition, you can see what problems
or features other people have reported and

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.940
essentially vote on those features by starring
them. And if you do that, you'll be notified

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.569
of any updates that occur on those issues,
and it also helps us to understand the demand

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:16.809
for various features and we take that very
seriously and we do listen to that. That having

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:21.559
been said, um, I was looking on Maps API issue
tracker today, and there's one feature on

00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:25.960
there that is dramatically way out in front
in terms of it's, the demand for it, so what

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960
do you think? Any idea what that is?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960
&gt;&gt;Ben: Uh the redirections, right?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah, a web service for driving directions.
So, it doesn't sound hard.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.390
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well, we already have it for JavaScript’s,
so we could probably write that tonight.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:40.620
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah? Done by the end of the day?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.620
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:47.790
&gt;&gt;Thor: All right. Done by the end of the
day. So, there we go. If you uh, if you have

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.922
a similar, similar idea that you'd like to
see us implement, just pop it on there and

00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:56.310
then get your friends around and have them
star it, then you never know, we might just,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.880
we might just make it happen. So, with that,
um, I'll open up to questions. [pause] [Thor

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880
makes ticking noises with tongue] Yay.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:14.029
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: I don't know if this is
a question for you guys or not but I'll give

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:20.680
it a shot. I work at an environmental non-profit
across the bay here and uh, we use Google

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.980
Maps API, um, to display environmental data
with great background imagery and so forth

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:33.139
that you guys provide. At one time in the
past, you know we had our own [imagery] server

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:37.829
and we putting our own government imagery
up and doing it all ourselves. But, it's been

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:41.110
wonderful to be able to use Google Maps API
for those kind of things. And in talking to

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:47.140
my director, you know, we'll talk and I'll
say yeah look, look at what we can do here

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.540
and the different, you know we can have terrain,
we can have satellite imagery and so on and

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.550
so forth. And he's like wow, this is, this
is all free! Yes, this is all free. Um, is

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:01.279
it always going to be free? You know, how,
how many eggs should we put into this basket,

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:08.190
you know there's always that kind of background
concern that um, you know what, how many eggs

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:14.990
should we put into the Google Maps API basket.
Um, is there anything you guys could say that

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:19.170
would, in my next conversation with my director
to say don't worry or?

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:24.149
&gt;&gt;Thor: So if you're worrying about it being
free, you're welcome to pay for it. [Laughter].

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:29.721
Um, uh we have a product called Maps, Google
Maps API Premier. And Google Maps API Premier

00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:36.829
is essentially the existing Google Maps API,
but with a bunch of other considerations wrapped

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:41.230
around it, are wrapped around it for these
sort of situations. Um, one that's particularly

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.320
pertinent here is that when you purchase Google
Maps API Premier, obviously you purchase a

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.519
one, or two, or three year license and in
doing so, you know, we commit to you this

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:54.779
service will continue to exist and continue
to be maintained and supported for that period

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:59.050
of time. On top of that, you get access to
technical support, you get a service level

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:04.970
agreement, you get a few additional features,
such as access to the API over https. Your

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.459
quotas for various services such as geocoding
and directions increase substantially and

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:13.350
you can purchase more if you need to. Um,
and uh, you know we have a few other things

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.519
in the pipeline, so it sounds like you, uh,
you just want to pitch that product and we'll

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:20.760
be really happy for you to do that.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.209
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: Do you have any kind of
non-profit pricing at this stage?

00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:30.069
&gt;&gt;Thor: Um, actually, yes. I should have mentioned
that. So if you do a search on your selection

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:36.790
of choice for, um, I believe it's Google Earth
Outreach and Google Maps Outreach, is that

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:37.790
right?

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.870
&gt;&gt;Peter: Earth Outreach. Go talk to him.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.649
&gt;&gt;Thor: Oh, go talk to him. So yes.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:41.850
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: Okay.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:48.649
&gt;&gt;Thor: And essentially, you can apply for
a free Premier license, basically. Oh I should

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:52.160
also mention that the premier licenses also
have slightly modified terms of service, that

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.330
you're allowed to do some things that you
can't normally do with the Maps APIs, such

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.060
as use it in an application that you sell
for money, and use it in environments where,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.949
internet environments or environments where
their user base is restricted in some way.

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:05.370
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 1: Thanks.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:11.870
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Hi, how are you?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.870
&gt;&gt;Thor: Good.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:19.270
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Excellent. Um, I'm not
sure if this is like uh, again I'll see if

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.840
this is a Geo Team question, but do you guys
plan on opening up an IP to Geo location API?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.920
&gt;&gt;Thor: Oh, this is the ability to determine
someone's location approximately based on

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920
their IP address?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.950
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Yeah, I mean I know you
guys are kind of doing a lot of that under

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.580
the scenes, like similar to like a Max Mind
or a Queue Remote?

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.120
&gt;&gt;Thor: So, um, the, it's not part of Maps
APIs, but there is an API called the AJAX

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.689
Search API, I think, has a client location
object which can do this. Um, it's not a kind

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:52.350
of a paste, sort of a rest service it's just
a JS-based API but it does already exists.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.779
So just do a search for client location, all
one word.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:55.779
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Okay

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:57.130
&gt;&gt;Thor: you'll find information about that.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.459
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Okay.

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:03.579
&gt;&gt;Ben: It's fairly course though, the best
we get is sort of city level, like.

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:07.660
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 2: Okay. Check. All right,
thanks.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.670
&gt;&gt;Peter: So we're waiting for the uh, next
lucky questioner, um I just want to encourage

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.910
everyone who hasn't had a chance yet, to make
sure you get out to the sandbox area and check

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.129
out some of the different applications being
shown. There's a lot of great examples of

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:25.459
partners who are doing great things with Maps
API and Earth API and others, so if you hadn't

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:29.389
gotten a chance yet, I encourage you definitely,
go out there and take a look at what people

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:31.040
have been doing. It's really impressive.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.139
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 3: [Strong Danish accent]
Hi. Can I have a question? About pricing of

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:40.950
Google Maps Premier edition. Because of, how
much is it, approximately, and what can you

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:47.370
use it for, because what we did in the past
was application for like watching cars moving

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:54.689
around the world. It's paid apps so we were
unable to use Google Maps; the free version.

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:59.009
And as we look to Premier Edition, it was
so expensive that it's like impossible to

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:06.199
use for a small startup, just to try for a
while. So, we had to switch to Open Layers,

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:07.199
unfortunately.

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:12.990
&gt;&gt;Thor: Is Dan here? No, it doesn't look like
it. There are a lot of different Google, Googler's

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:18.029
at the conference, as you are aware and um
many, many different people in the room and

00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:22.569
um there are a couple of people here from
the Maps API Premier Team, including, as in

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:27.850
my counter part, and it might be easier for
me just to connect you with him.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:33.249
I'm happy to do that afterwards. Um, I don't
believe the pricing has changed dramatically,

00:14:33.249 --> 00:14:35.070
is all I'll say to that, right now.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.060
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 3: So, uh, was it right, that
it's really so expensive that it, like, doesn't

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.360
start with some small money, and grows, but
it's very expensive from, from very beginning

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360
for paid apps?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:55.740
&gt;&gt;Thor: Right, so the, the difficulty right
now is that the way in which we manage Google

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.731
Maps API Premier accounts is a fairly manual
process. It's sort of, you know many of these

00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:06.120
kind of large enterprises expect a good hands
on, you know a good customer relationship,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.259
sort of direct access to people. And so, um,
we don't really have that middle ground right

00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:15.790
now in terms of just automated purchasing,
at you know, which would allow us to keep

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.790
the prices down. But it's certainly something
that, you know, we're very conscious of and

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.790
that we are working on.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.829
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 3: Okay, thank you.

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:31.379
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 4: So, this question may not
be relevant to you guys either, but um

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:32.379
[Laughter].

00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:34.100
&gt;&gt;Thor: You do know what session this is,
right.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.660
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 4: Yeah. I do, uh so uh we
all know the power of um, localization data,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.680
in particular um, I'm thinking of apps like
Latitude. I'd kind of like to hear how you

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.730
guys plan on protecting that data, because
in particular, um, tying location data into

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:56.899
a telephone, can um, you know, open up a whole
bunch of privacy concerns. So.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:02.879
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yeah, you might want to go try to
find the mobile folks to specifically ask

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:07.499
that, I mean, as a general answer, obviously
privacy is a really key part of everything

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:13.199
we do and in terms of the, you know, access
to that information, um, there are multiple

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:17.189
levels of control to make sure that, you know,
whatever information we gather is information

00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:23.019
that you're approving of and that you can
control who has access to that. In terms of,

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:29.709
you know, assurance and specifics about more
detail, it's definitely out of my realm. So,

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:32.360
I would encourage you to track down someone
on the mobile team and Latitude team. I don't

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.870
know if Steve Lee is here or not.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:42.980
&gt;&gt;Thor: One thing I would mention is there
is a session at, I think it's 3:00 today,

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.550
that relates, relates amongst other things,
to Latitude and there will be some Latitude

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.360
folks speaking at that session. So if you
have particular questions around Latitude

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.389
or around, sort of, the way that privacy is
managed within Latitude, um they would definitely

00:16:56.389 --> 00:17:02.100
be the right people to talk to. Um, I think
it, you know, it's not surprise to anybody

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.510
that it's a concern that's top of our minds
and something that we're very conscious of.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.680
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: Hi guys, this is definitely
a question for you.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680
[Laughter]

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yay.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.420
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: [Strong Finnish accent]
But might be a bit newbie question. I have,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:28.950
I'm not, I don't know about KLM or KML service
is it? Nothing but well, I'm from Finland

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:36.810
and I work in a non-profit organization that
collects spatial data for, for free usage

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:48.550
and anyone can send us data. We provide VFS,
W-V-F-S, services for it and um, we're interested

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:57.902
in, is it possible for us to share that data
also as a KML service, and if it is, what

00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:00.450
would be the best way? Does it have a, some
sort of server software for it or something

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.190
like that? By the way they use POSCI database,
all the data.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:15.440
&gt;&gt;Peter: You want to come up here? Get up
here! Why not?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.570
[Inaudible answer from audience / off microphone]

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:32.360
&gt;&gt;Peter: We're just going to make this interactive
here, go right into the audience. Mano Marks

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.470
is one of our key KML advocates.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.930
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Hi, um yeah, in general there
are a number of products that you can, open

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.380
source projects that you can use that would
allow you to serve things out. One that comes

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.950
to mind particularly is GeoServer, which just
allows you to take your data and push it out

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:56.700
in a whole range of formats; one of which
is KML. Uh so there's, there's a few other

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.600
things like that that you can use. You can
talk to myself or Christian or Josh Livni,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.780
who's in the back, we can tell you a lot more
about that. That's if you're wanting to do

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:12.300
sort of live stuff. If you want to just do
data conversion, it's a whole, there's even

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300
a broader range of things it can use.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.300
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: Live stuff was the thing
that we're looking for.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.790
&gt;&gt;Mano Marks: Live stuff, so GeoServer's a
really good thing, or you can create your

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.870
own service, using something like Go GR, which
is another open source project.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.870
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: Thank you.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:27.410
&gt;&gt;Matt: A couple of things I'll add too is
that we have a Google Earth gallery, which

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:32.600
is if you have some interesting KMLs that
you'd like to share with other Google Earth

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.110
users, we have an Earth Gallery website, and
there's an interface there for you to actually

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:46.971
upload a KML and you know assign it a category
and then people can, you know, star it, a

00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:54.510
lot of people can find it and download it.
And then finally also the Maps Data API. If

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.600
you already kind of have data in KML, uh,
that's the format that we use to upload features

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.320
to the Maps Data API so depending on what
you are trying to do, you can take a KML and

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.710
essentially upload it to Google's Cloud and
then you'll have API access to search over

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.300
it, or you know, retrieve it on different
devices. We have different client libraries

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.500
to let you kind of access it in lots of different
languages so, that's another possibility.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:18.170
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: What if you have websites
that will generate KMLs in response to user

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:25.060
choices, say from the census or some other
government-based data or public data? In other

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.330
words, putting up a, I wouldn't be putting
up a KML, I'd be putting up a service, that,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.240
you know that's free and open and all that.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.220
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yeah, so from a service standpoint,
you can always use a network link, right so

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.590
there's a couple of different ways.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.780
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 5: So I could put a link up.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.020
&gt;&gt;Peter: To get information. Right, so one
is if you have your own site you can always

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.370
host your own data and make it available.
You can either visualize it in situ with either

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:52.140
Google Maps or Google Earth API. If you want
to have, say a download that is a static file

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.300
but generated based on user input, you could
have your own forum and submit that to your

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.050
server and have it produce back a static KML
and then, finally, if you want to have something

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:06.770
that's truly dynamic, you could have just
a network link that refreshes, and potentially

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.340
you could have different flavors of network
links based on different parameters and then

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.500
users could download that, and that will continually
query the server. And there's a lot of things

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.980
within KML that allows you to, you know, using
regions and other triggering mechanisms to

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.650
you know, sort of an alternate to a WMS kind
of a server.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:31.720
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6. I have a very specific
geeky kind of question. Um, I do a lot in

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:39.390
Flex and I was wondering what is the preferred
swick for KML parsing? I currently use Google

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:45.510
Maps API utility library 426 2009.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:52.540
[Laughter] [inaudible comment from audience]

00:21:52.540 --> 00:22:02.830
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: The reason I ask is that
particularly, if you got out utility library

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.390
now, it just says it's been deprecated, but
I don't know where to go from there.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.220
&gt;&gt;Thor: Is this the Google Maps utility library
specifically for Flex?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.220
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: Yeah.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.810
&gt;&gt;Thor: Or is it that that particular library
in the utility library has been deprecated.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:19.290
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6:. It's, it's the API utility
library for KML parsing that you had up for

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.290
Flex.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:26.920
&gt;&gt;Thor: Okay, um off the top of my head, I'm
not sure but um, if you come and grab me afterwards,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.760
we'll take a look and we'll figure it out.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.840
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 6: Okay.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:36.600
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 7: Hi, I guess I have a similar
question um, it's about the Earth API utility

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:43.570
library. So it's the JavaScript utility library
for the Earth API. Um, is that still being

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:50.140
like worked on? Like it's in version 0.2 or
something like that? Is there any, are there

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.070
any plan to add to that or anything like that?

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:58.370
Peter. So that's a good question. So the question's
about the Earth utility library, um and a

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.780
lot of that work was actually done by Roman
Nurik who was our developer advocate. He's

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.171
actually now working on, on Android. Um, so
I think it's an open question and I think

00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:12.860
part of it is based on feedback in terms of
what would be useful to developers, right?

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.960
And as we think about new API, there's always
a question of should this live, you know in,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.810
within the plug in as an API or does it make
more sense for us to put a lower level API

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.591
in and then include some code in the utility
library. So I think that that utility library

00:23:27.591 --> 00:23:32.850
is something that's always an option for us
that if we feel like, you know, this is code

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:37.140
that's useful, but probably doesn't make sense
to live within the, you know, the plug-in

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:43.640
itself, um then, you know we absolutely would
want to do that. I don't know Thatch if have

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.370
any more? Yeah and then Josh who's back over
here is the guy who's probably going to write

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:55.290
anything that if uh, [laughs] so um, if you
have any specific suggestions or things where

00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:00.510
it's like hey, I you know, I'm, I really wanna
be able to do this one function and it's a

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.490
real, you know inconvenience for me, or I
have a great piece of code that I think, you

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.600
know would be great to share out with other
developers, um Josh is your man.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.120
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 7: OK, thanks.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.660
&gt;&gt;Thor: I just want to um take I'm sorry I
don't want to keep you standing around too

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.390
long, but um I just want to take a couple,
one of the, one or two of the questions off

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.640
of Google wave as well while we're here. So,
we'll just take one right now. Um, one of

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.350
the questions I can see on there relates to
um, the correct way to add or modify building

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:30.230
labels on Google Maps. I think this is specifically
relating to cases where the, uh the information

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.950
on the base map is, is, is incorrect. Matt,
do you want to speak to that?

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.410
&gt;&gt;Matt: Uh sure, so what you'd like to do,
so there's actually two questions there; one

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:42.810
is about how to change building labels and
the example here is case Western Reserve University

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:47.000
I think has some missing building labels they're
saying. And the other is about, you know uh,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.060
sidewalks or paths being not quite right so
if you, in general, when you notice things

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.340
on, uh, Google Maps, um in the U.S, there's
a small link in the bottom right corner that

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.610
says report a problem, and you can go there
and it lets you report a problem, say about

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.910
a street or an address that might be wrong,
something that's missing, a label in the wrong

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:07.110
place, and you can select a number of options
and kind of move the little marker near where

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:11.570
the problem is occurring and you know, our
turn around time is generally pretty good

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.110
so we're able to kind of review those and
determine what needs to be fixed and we are

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.560
actively fixing things, um, you know, all
the time, so that's, the bottom right corner

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.300
you'll see a little report a problem link
and that's the recommended way to do it.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:30.781
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8: Hi, I have a question about
a aerial oblique imagery. Um, I wonder what

00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:36.590
you can tell me about it's appearance and
growth in V3? Uh, I think it's not available

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:44.380
in V3 now. Hoping to see it some day. I wonder
what's in between aerial and other higher

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.670
priority features that I would expect to see
before that, and also just the acquisition

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.930
of more imagery; anything you can tell me
at all, maybe nothing.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:26:00.270
&gt;&gt;Thor: So back in January we posted a roadmap
for V3 on the on the Google group. Um, and

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:05.390
it basically laid out all the features that
we planned to introduce in V3, um at that

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.920
point, and we've now ticked off every one
of those features, with the exception of aerial

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:16.450
imagery. Uh, the um, we basically just had
to decide, we had to prioritize essentially

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.670
based on what we could see the, the usage
was in V2. That was the approach we took,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:28.610
so, in, in order to um, be able to graduate
the Maps API V3, we felt we needed to reach

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.540
a certain level of, you know a sufficient
level of feature parity with V2 that the majority

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:42.250
of V2 applications would be able to migrate
to V3. And, uh as you probably know, aerial

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.940
imagery has not, is not um, is not being used
in a lot of API sites yet, for a number of

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:52.040
reasons. Coverage is, is clearly one of them.
Discoverability is another. And also, just

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.840
general awareness of the feature, you know
to a large extent, the Maps API has relied

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.330
in the past on feature awareness being driven
by the Google Maps application rather than

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:05.030
you know on the Maps API itself, so as aerial
imagery isn't currently launched on Google

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.190
Maps, I think a lot of developers don't realize
we have it in the API. So the decision we

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:14.230
came to essentially was that we needed to
um, focus on Street View first, because Street

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.840
View is definitely uh leading on...

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.542
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8. [Talks over Thor] It's
a good choice.

00:27:18.542 --> 00:27:21.340
&gt;&gt;Thor: [continues] many API sites. And Street
View was a fairly challenging um feature,

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:27.060
because uh in V2 and on Google Maps it has
a dependency on flash and the Maps API V3

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.000
is, you know has been pitched from the start
and was motivated by the desire to cater better

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.670
to mobile devices, many of which don't support
flash right now. So, um, we knew that was

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.360
a big challenge and one we needed to just
crack on with and that we would revisit aerial

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.820
once that was done. We didn't think it was
necessary to have aerial ready before we graduated

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.230
because of the low levels of use. And we're
also keen to see um, it's probably no great

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.680
surprise that there are discussions going
on about, you know ways of bringing aerial

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.200
to Google Maps as well and how that might
be done um, and uh you know we want to make

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.430
sure that we, we are, that the implementation
and the API is consistent with whatever happens

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.390
there. So, um the short answer is it's on
the roadmap. We've committed to doing it in

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:12.060
writing, it's got my name on it and I've sworn
in blood that we will do this, um, but uh,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.000
I can't give you a commitment right now as
to exactly when that might happen.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.080
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8.: Did I hear in that the
sort of well, I'm not even really sure if

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.190
aerial matters all that much? That, it seems
like, oh, you know we're not really using

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.320
it, people aren't consuming it.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.490
&gt;&gt;Thor: No. You did not hear that.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:29.490
[Laughter]

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.490
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8: Oh, fine

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.620
&gt;&gt;Thor: I mean, let me expand on that. No,
I do think it's very useful, and I know that

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.200
um, you know, in the places where we have
it, it's certainly much, much easier to orientate

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.540
yourself within that environment, particularly
if you know it well, when you have the aerial

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.530
imagery. Um, and you know we just need to
have, you know a reasonably comprehensive

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.470
level of coverage and we need to have a good
user experience such that users know it's

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:57.560
there, understand how to integrate with it.
Also, um, do not get disorientated by it as

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.450
they switch in and out of aerial imagery which
is rotatable compared to non-aerial imagery,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:06.130
which is not. So it's actually a fairly complex
UI problem as well to do right. Um, but if

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.290
we can get it right, I think it will be very
compelling. And I think it, it's also worth

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.600
saying that it bridges the gap very well between
the Maps, the Street View and also Earth as

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.600
well.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.520
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think for the Real Estate in this
case in particular I think it's really compelling

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.710
if I'm looking for apartments, or looking
for a house if you don't want to see the obliques

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:26.530
it kind of adds a lot so you can kind of get
a sense of what's it's. Okay. [laughter].

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.530
That's kind of how I think about it.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.910
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8: And if you can say anything
at all about coverage, how it may expand.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.910
Maybe not.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.280
&gt;&gt;Thor: Um, none of, none of the people here
are really you know heavily involved in the

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:42.330
collection side of things. Um, you know coverage
is clearly important and uh we continue to,

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:47.220
to acquire, you know, more imagery, there
is a you know, a processing delay involved

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:52.850
in the, in getting that imagery into shape
and suitable for use, but all I can say is,

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.430
you know that effort continues and you know
we hope to see more and more coverage. One

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:02.410
thing, um, that um, that is also a bit of
a problem right now is that it's not completely

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.110
clear where the coverage is and, and as new
coverage comes online, you know we try and

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.900
post to the group about it or something like
that. But it often gets sort of lost in the

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.430
noise and so um, you know we need to do a
better job of discoverability generally, I

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.430
think.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.430
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 8: Thank you.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.390
&gt;&gt;Peter: While we wait for the next question,
whoever had the question about Maps API Premier

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.140
pricing, Dan Chu is now in the house.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.380
&gt;&gt;Thor: Wave Dan.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.780
&gt;&gt;Peter: Raise your hand. So uh, if you can
track down Dan afterwards he'll be happy to

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.470
answer all of your Maps API Premier questions.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:35.760
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 9: [Strong eastern European
accent] Okay, my question is in V3 for Maps,

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:42.090
are we able to have all our layers a complex
KML that we exported to Google Earth? You

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.770
know with all the polygons, lines and see
a different altitudes? Are we going to be

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:54.030
able to get that experience with a 2D except
for the third dimension? Load, you know, complex

00:30:54.030 --> 00:31:00.850
super-overlays into maps without having to
do any tweaks and just use the same KML or

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.850
the network link.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:06.790
&gt;&gt;Ben: So we support markers, polylines, polygons
and large numbers of markers and polylines

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:15.822
and polygons as well as complex polylines
and polygons. We, the parser for the KML in

00:31:15.822 --> 00:31:19.960
maps is a different parser, Google Apps parser.
There is some old KML that does not make the

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.320
KML spec that you might need to modify a little
bit. But there are schema checkers that will

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.440
help you find the bugs.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.340
&gt;&gt;Peter: Okay, so I'll add a little bit to
that too. So, I mean, it's a known issue that

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.500
what is viewable within Maps, from a KML standpoint
is not on par with what's viewable within

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:43.400
Earth and that's a known issue and we know
that's a pain point for developers. You know,

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.270
things are a little bit better now in the
sense that you can have you know Earth API

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.740
and be able to view a full KML in that context,
but that's still not a, a complete answer.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:58.790
So um, a lot has improved, you know, since
last year in terms of what our maps based

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:03.970
KML parser can do, in terms of what it will
accept. Um, it's a, you know, taken many steps

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.050
forward from before when it would not even
be able to parse certain types of things.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:14.310
But we still have work to do. So, we're continuing
to work on that and trying to kind of bring

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.980
that up to a level where it will be able to
uh, understand and accurately render uh, the

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980
full set of KML.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:25.270
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 9: And it's able to, if I
have a network link to my super-overlays on

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:34.670
my server, it's able to respect all the conditions
for when to show layer at which altitude and

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.410
turn off, turn on all those things?

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:42.250
&gt;&gt;Peter: So again, at the moment, um, not
everything is supported. So network links

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:50.720
are supported. Super-overlays I believe are
sort of iffy. Um, you know and again if there's

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.920
a specific question you have about some feature,
you can come and talk to myself or Mano or

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.230
some of the other folks over here. But, but
there definitely will be things you can find

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:04.480
that will not behave in the same manner and,
and, we know about that and we still have

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480
work to do there.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.500
&gt;&gt;Matt: There's a pretty helpful table on
one of the help sites. I'm not sure which,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.430
if you, it kind of shows exactly what subset
of KML is currently supported and that's been

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.220
growing over time. But if you wanna know exactly
which features are supported or not there's

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.510
a table, and I can help you find it afterward
if you want.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.640
&gt;&gt;Thor: It's uh, it's linked from one of the
FAQs on the Maps API documentation, so if

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.920
you just look for the Maps API FAQ and there's
a FAQ in there along the lines of what features

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.530
are supported for KML.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:45.530
[Mano - off microphone / inaudible comment
to questioner]

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:52.820
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, definitely
um, you know, the issue tracker is there for

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.570
a reason and we do take it seriously, so um,
so please do, do use it. Um, on that subject

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:02.030
actually there's a related question on the
wave, which is how can I make my own tile

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.300
layer, like a Wikipedia layer. I have the
tiles, but how can I make the points on the

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.440
tiles clickable? Um, so.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:13.250
&gt;&gt;Peter: What was the question? I'm sorry,
I can't understand your accent so.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.510
&gt;&gt;Thor: [laughter] The question,

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.710
&gt;&gt;Peter: I'm just gonna walk over here.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.180
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah, you do that.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.460
&gt;&gt;Peter: I have this technology.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.420
&gt;&gt;Thor: Is the rest of the room not understanding
me? Am I just, you know. [laughs] Okay, good.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.040
&gt;&gt;Peter: How can I make the points on the
tiles clickable?

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.940
&gt;&gt;Peter: [reading to himself quietly] Ah how
can I make my one tile layer...[into microphone

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.409
now] Um so is this a question about Earth
API or Maps API?

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:41.631
&gt;&gt;Thor: I think it's, it relates to the Maps,
so in the maps API V2 we have, um, a couple

00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:46.570
of layers that overlay icons that tell you
whether they're related to Wikipedia articles

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:52.890
or icons that tell you whether they're related
panoramia photos and those icons, you can

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:57.160
click on them and info windows arrive. But
I was thinking that KML might be a good solution

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160
to this.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.640
&gt;&gt;Peter: Yeah, so there's really, in general
there's two solutions. One is you have KML,

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.630
in which case the content associated with
the balloon is encapsulated in the data. And

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:10.500
so, when you click on it then the info window
is displayed. The other option is to use an

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:19.880
event, a click event so if you just want to
display a marker on the map and you get a

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.990
click event and then do something based on
that.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.990
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 10: I didn't write that question,
but do you think maybe they're asking about

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.940
kind of like, kind of like when you can choose
your layers, or when you can choose like your

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.530
tile layers like, I think there's like a Wikipedia
click like show it or not show it. Is that

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.530
what, maybe that's what they're asking?

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.360
&gt;&gt;Thor: I think, I think the core of the question
is that if you have a very, very large number

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.000
of points you want to render on a map, there
comes a point where your browser begins to

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.820
struggle. And the recommended solution to
this is to render a tile set that has those

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.420
point on. That works very well, except that
those tiles are not, the individual points

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.940
are no longer clickable because they're just
imagery tiles. Um, and uh, so um, you know

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.380
the, the person who wrote this question has
noticed that we return imagery tiles for the

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.810
Wikipedia layers and the panoramia layers
and yet somehow they're also clickable. So

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:03.940
I think the question is how, how can you do
that? Um, and uh there are a couple of things

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:12.350
I can think of. One is the service that serves
up these clickable layers is also, can, it's

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:17.830
the same service we use for KML rendering
in V3, so if you have, if you can represent

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:22.960
this data as a KML file rather than rendering
your own tiles, then you can attach descriptions

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.770
to each object which will appear in the info
windows when they're clicked. Um, if you are

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:31.681
worried about serving up a large KML file,
then you can upload that data to the maps

00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:37.870
data API and it can be served from there very,
very quickly as well.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.840
&gt;&gt;Matt: So, for example, if you have 10,000
points, you know you can just render what's

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.280
in the info window but you can say just give
me back what's in this bounding box and every

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.720
time I pan my my map, you know give me you
know it's, it's very fast so you can, it will

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.270
return the new results in the bounty box and
see if you can get those nice corian pan effect,

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.130
which is this very large data sent, but you're
only having to render sort of what's in the

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.500
bounding box.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:02.950
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 10: Um, well the question
I was going to ask was uh, regarding to the

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.500
uh, the Geocoding. Uh, can you give, can you
give some insight on, kind of the roadmap

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:11.000
for like what new countries are going to be
supported and kind of, or insight into like

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.440
how process improvement of accuracy of Geocoding
as that evolves. Like if I have an address

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.620
at like, are you guys improving the existing
countries?

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:29.060
&gt;&gt;Thor: So, um, so the Geocoder essentially
relies on the same data set from which we

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:35.220
render the base map tiles. Um, and uh this
is obviously deliberate so that everything's

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:40.950
consistent and in sync. And we're constantly
acquiring new data. Um, and we're also constantly

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.740
collecting corrections and refinements to
our existing data, both from users and from

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:50.480
other, other places. Um, so coverage is, you
know, it's also obviously important to us,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.470
and we are always looking to, to extend our
coverage for a number of different means,

00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.660
sometimes we, we find data that we can license
for a particular area that we don't have good

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:06.120
coverage, but also we have Map Maker now,
which um, is, has rolled out in a number of

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.120
countries you can probably.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.690
&gt;&gt;Matt: The total number of 100 something
countries, that's a lot of countries.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:15.200
&gt;&gt;Thor: Yeah, um and Map Maker has proved
very useful in countries where we don't have

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.120
any existing data or limited data sets, um
and there are some fascinating videos on YouTube

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:24.710
of the way in which the maps for those regions
have evolved rapidly as a result of launch

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:30.140
of Map Maker, which essentially allows you
to actually draw roads and features and such

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.290
like on the map. So, um, I mean I can't comment
specifically on, you know we expect to get

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:42.040
more data here and here and here. Um, but
we're not done in improving our data and never

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040
will be.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:47.400
&gt;&gt;Matt: I'd also encourage everyone to you
know take an active role in fixing things

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.180
that you see are wrong I mean a lot of people,
you know a lot of times you're the local experts,

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.680
really, you know you neighborhoods better
than we do and so on Google Maps a lot of

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.070
people don't realize you can actually fix
problems that you see so if you call a phone

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.430
number and you find out that a place is closed
or that something is, you know a phone number's

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:06.370
changed, you can actually say a place page,
there a link at this place and you can go

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.210
in and you can you know, update the phone
number, fix a bad category, you can drag the

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:15.100
marker, if the marker seems to be in the wrong
location. And, uh, or if you don't know there's

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.580
a problem you can just, there's a way to report
a problem. So maybe you found the phone number

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.300
is wrong, you're not really sure what the
right phone number is you can just essentially

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.580
say, hey Google this phone number's wrong
and write us a little comment. And then we'll

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.670
sort of look into the details and figure out
what the phone number should be so you know,

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:31.640
we really would like to kind of empower users
to be the experts for their, their neighborhoods

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.300
and help us kind of fix problems that they
find.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:42.380
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 11: So uh, first of all thank
you for the work that you do. I know my livelihood

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.420
is at least partially dependent on your success,
so well done, thank you. My question is uh,

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.070
in regards to the elevation service, um which
is awesome. Uh, are you thinking about expanding

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:56.510
it in any way? I have two specific applications.
One; can I request elevation for an area instead

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:00.910
of just along a line or a path? And two, something
that would really benefit from the computing

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:06.290
power that you guys have in the cloud is given
a point and an area around it, calculate a

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:09.010
view shed? Like what can I see, you know what
you know uh, make mountains or whatever or

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:17.560
impeding the line of sight and maybe supplement
the line of sight algorithm with an RF line

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.619
of sight, for instance, and that would definitely
[not be me 40:18], but um even just a view

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:32.320
shed would be, would be useful for that application
so, this is just an expansion of the elevation

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320
service, I guess.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.500
&gt;&gt;Thor: So, do you want an answer to the first
part of the question, what are our plans for

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500
the service?

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.500
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 11: Yes.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.740
&gt;&gt;Thor: I would say um we don't have any,
any immediate plans for kind of dramatic changes

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.280
to the service. The one thing that we have
been asked for that we're looking into is

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:50.110
a way of obtaining um, information about the
accuracy of the underlying data or at least

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:53.610
sort of the granularity I suppose is a better
word, for the underlying data in other words

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.610
what the sampling, base sampling distance
was.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.150
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 11: Is it DTED or SRTM data
that you're using?

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:02.710
&gt;&gt;Thor: Um I it varies, yeah it's, it's. As
with many Google services, we'll license data

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.200
from wherever we can and obtain data any way
we can and then you know we'll figure out

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.460
a way to blend it all together and make it
seamless. Um, so that's something that we

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.640
are looking into. Um in terms of sort of new
features we could build on top of that, uh

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.180
you know we're certainly open to ideas and
you know again I suggest you put them on the

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.000
issue tracker. Um, what we tend to find a
lot on the issue tracker is that we get a

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.801
lot of requests for, you know you have feature
X in API A can we have it in API B? Um, and

00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:37.020
uh and such like. It would be great to have
more kind of, you know ideas that genuinely

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.020
novel. Exactly, yes.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.020
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 11: Okay. Thank you.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:47.420
&gt;&gt;Audience Female: Hi, so um, I'm one of the
organizers of the new National Robotics Week

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.820
in the US and we've been trying to use Google
Maps to show affiliated events across the

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.369
country. For the first year we kind of had
a really hackie solution that went through

00:41:55.369 --> 00:41:59.380
like a Yahoo pipe and it didn't work very
well. So if you guys can you give me any suggestions

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:10.500
in terms of how to integrate a Google calendar
and get that onto a Google Map I'd appreciate

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.500
it.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.500
[group discussion on stage / off mic]

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.090
&gt;&gt;Matt: So Google has a family of API's called
the GData; the Google Data APIs or GData for

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:20.810
short. Um and you know, so calendar, um you
know, contacts, like Maps Data API is an example

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:27.220
of one of these, so I would imagine you can
kind of pull information out from calendar

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:31.150
through the GData API and then render it using
the Maps API on the map, but um.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.270
&gt;&gt;Thor: It's also worth mentioning that um
you know in the last year our primary focus

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:40.869
in the Maps team at least has been to work
on V3 and uh bring V3 up to scratch. Um, but

00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:45.680
now that we've graduated obviously we have
an opportunity now to start doing some new

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.350
and interesting things and one of the things
that's particularly interesting to me personally

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.881
um that I think that we haven't done necessarily
as good a job of in the past as I would have

00:42:53.881 --> 00:42:57.480
liked is improving the ease with which you
can integrate the Maps API with other services

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.490
that Google offers. Um, so that's something
that I think we'll be taking a more active

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:07.170
interest in trying to help people to do. Google
has a lot of fantastic things to offer um,

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.890
and you know it's one of our, the strengths
that we have and so, you know I'd like to

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.560
see us make more of that.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.200
&gt;&gt;Audience Female: Great. Thank you very much.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:21.251
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 12: Hi guys. Our company has
a number of Google Earth pro licenses and

00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:30.040
uh we have managers using these tools in order
to contribute place marks and data and we

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.010
collect all those KMLs and then we apply tool
sets in Google Maps. There's, there's two

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:40.140
issues that I have, and they've been ongoing
for about two to three years now, um since

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.760
we've purchased the pro licenses. Number one
was when we used the import function to import

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:52.580
spreadsheets, we find that sometimes the,
when it comes to the Geocoding, the uh the

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:58.900
addresses aren't correctly Geocoded because
there's issues with um the array. So, it spits

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:04.380
out a report, a little square that says, please
validate these, these addresses. I can't copy

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:12.650
and paste that list, I can't even save that
list, I can't then save that list separately

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.520
so that I can go through and uh manually validate
it. What's the story there?

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.010
&gt;&gt;Peter: So, um, couple things. A question
about uh Earth Pro and some of the import

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:23.200
capabilities in there. Um, so one this is
we are working on making some improvements,

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:29.820
um to the overall import capabilities of the
product. In terms of the specifics of the

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.380
Geocoder, um I would probably need to look
to see, I mean especially if you have a sample

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.990
file or something, um come talk to me afterwards,
I'd love to kind of get a little bit more

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:44.300
into the specifics of what some of those issues
might be, um because we're using the same

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.510
Geocoding service, so um, I don't know of
exactly what error you might be running into,

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.590
but I'd like to see what, what case you have
and see what we can do to improve it.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.230
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 12: No worries. And a follow
up to that was using a style template function

00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:02.180
in Google Earth Pro as well, um when we save
KML files and we try to open them in version

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:10.150
two of Google Maps um, it doesn't work. They're
all grouped and I take it there must be some

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:15.460
sort of issue with style template. Given that
our organization and we have literally hundreds

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:20.690
of people using these tools, um, that's a
pretty significant issue. Can you talk about

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.610
style template and compatibility between Earth
and Maps?

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:30.190
&gt;&gt;Peter: So, I don't know but my guess would
be due to the fact that the current version

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:37.590
of Earth Pro at exporting in schema data and
that isn't understood by Maps. That problems

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:44.330
will be addressed shortly. So, there are some
known issues with basically the version of

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:49.500
KML that Earth writes out in, which is a valid
version of KML but it's an older format that

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.680
isn't understood by the Maps adjuster, um
so there's a couple of ways of addressing

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.500
that. One is to make sure the maps adjuster
can understand all previous versions and the

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.740
other one is to write out in the most recent
version, so we're definitely working on addressing

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.740
that.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.620
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 12: So does that mean that
I need to, because we're doing maps development

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:10.730
alongside Earth, uh that I need to switch
to V3 with Maps in order for this uh when

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:15.690
this function is correct or will you be changing
Earth?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:21.100
Peter. Um, we're going to change Earth so
that it outputs in extended data.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.160
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 12: Okay. Thank you.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:27.460
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 13: [French accent] Hi, two
really quick questions. The first one. There

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.881
was a question about elevation, do you guys
plan to add elevation services to Google maps,

00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:38.350
so basically height. And the second question
would be um with Android and you know Smart

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.660
Phones there was all these new sensors like
those like pressure sensors and all the old

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.600
type of sensor; do you plan to actually add
or use these sensors for Google Maps and localization

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.500
and so on?

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:54.440
&gt;&gt;Thor. Sorry, I didn't catch the last part
of the question? What type of sensor?

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.160
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 13: A pressure sensor, like
altimeter.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:03.560
&gt;&gt;Thor: Oh, I see, so I think the, the um,
the main technical restriction there is exactly,

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.840
you know which sensors are exposed to the
browser or to application running in the browser.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:15.280
So now, you know there is a um, a W3C Standard
for example for GeoLocation, um which includes

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:22.100
both position and um heading, if you like,
and we see on the GeoLocation side the location

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:27.890
based side of that implemented fairly well
now and the headings support is coming along,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.830
so you know, we'll add that. I think inevitably
there's going to be a continued expansion

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:39.160
in the capabilities of those phones. And as
that happens, the various sort of web standards

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.369
will follow. And as they do, you know we can
look into integrating them. Um, one thing

00:47:43.369 --> 00:47:52.760
I would say though is we don't currently want
to go too far down the road of sort of wrapping

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:59.670
existing standards based APIs in a thin Google
Maps API layer. We understand that there are

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:05.190
um, for example, lets take GeoLocation. You
know we understand that there is a benefit

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.170
for us for example, for providing a GeoLocation
class in the Maps API because you'll see it

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:13.790
in the Maps API documentation. It'll be front
and center, but, on the other hand, if the

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:18.330
W3C GeoLocation API, it's very well established,
it's well documented um and it works across

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:24.890
devices and, to an extent, we want to encourage
people to be familiar with these standards

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:29.640
and build applications that rely on them and
we want to be delivering new additional value

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.812
rather than just you know um, essentially
putting our name on an existing service. So

00:48:33.812 --> 00:48:38.320
I, you know I would hope that those sensors
become available to other applications more

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.190
broadly and as soon as they do, you know any,
any existing Maps API application will be

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.190
able to use them.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.480
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 13: Okay, thank you.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:50.730
&gt;&gt;Ben: I would add to that. The GeoLocation
API, the W3C GeoLocation API includes altitude,

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:51.980
so were you able to use that?

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:57.130
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 13: Yeah, okay, so you are
not pushing to use new sensors so you basically

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.930
wait for the phones and the services to provide
it and then, okay, understood.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.310
&gt;&gt;Ben: Okay, yep.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.520
&gt;&gt;Thor: So, we're out of time, I think it's
only fair we have one more question from the

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.930
floor and one more question from the wave.
Can I get away with that? Okay, I'm not being

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.150
told I can't so let's do that.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:17.470
&gt;&gt;Audience Male 12: Okay so I was just looking
at the Google Earth Application on the Android

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.100
phones that we got and I just noticed that
you can't like open KML files or like read

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:27.310
that in, are there any plans to update that
to uh support that?

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:31.540
&gt;&gt;Peter: Um, so the question is about Earth
on Android and you can't open KML files right

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:36.390
now. Um, so if you've actually used Earth
on iPhone, you'll notice that you can actually

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.860
go into My Maps and view documents that you
might have uploaded.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.390
&gt;&gt;Matt: Using the Maps Data API.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:46.580
&gt;&gt;Peter: Using the Maps Data API actually
or a customer Maps Data API. Um that, so the

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:51.110
same engine is running on both, so um you
might imagine that at some point in the near

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.960
future we'll be adding capability like that.
So it's, it's really just a matter of, you

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.310
know as we've been developing for Android,
we wanted to get the engine up and running

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:03.890
and get the basic application, but I think
you'll see, over time, across all of the mobile

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:09.720
space that we're going to be continuing to
invest in and grow the capabilities of you

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.670
know Earth and Maps on those coz the mobile
space is uh, obviously a very critical part

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.020
to us.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.790
&gt;&gt;Thor: So, um, to wrap up, one last question
from the wave. There is a question here which

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.300
is how can I integrate Google Maps API with
ESRI's ArcGIS software? So, ESRI do actually

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:33.020
publish a um, a class four displaying overlays
generated by ESRI or by ArcGIS on Google Maps

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:39.600
API Maps. If you do a search for ArcGIS ESRI
Google JavaScript’s Maps API um, you will

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.400
find that they have a class that does support
this and various examples as well. Um, so

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.761
I think that's all we have time for. Um, we'll
uh, I certainly I think most of us will be

00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:54.391
here the rest of the day and tomorrow as well.
So, if you see us, please feel free to come

00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:57.690
and say Hi, and if you have any questions
we'll be happy to help you. Um, I don't want

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:02.190
to, to um squat in this room too long, I know
there's another session to follow, so we'll

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:06.470
probably move outside fairly quickly, but
we'll mill around and uh be happy to discuss

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.470
more. So thank you very much.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.250
&gt;&gt;Matt: Thanks for coming.
