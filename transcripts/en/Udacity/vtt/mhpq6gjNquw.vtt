The dot and cross products are key for object transforms, lighting

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:07.469
calculations, and camera frame creation. Here are some statements. You decide

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.351
whether each is true or false. The dot product of a vector and itself is always

00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:17.635
1. The dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always 0. The cross product

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:22.443
of two normalized vectors always has a length of 1. The cross product of vector

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:26.744
with itself always has a length of 0. Fair warning, don't assume a vector is

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:28.620
normalized unless it says so.
