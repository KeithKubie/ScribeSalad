00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:03.480
ROMAN NURIK: Hello and
welcome once again to

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.020
Android Design in Action.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.380
Today's episode is actually a
slightly different format.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.520
This is a prerecorded version of
the show, because we have a

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.230
special guest here today.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.060
So before we introduce
everybody, my name is Roman

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.960
Nurik I'm your host.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.195
We're also joined by Nick
Butcher over in London.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:20.960
NICK BUTCHER: Hello.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.550
ROMAN NURIK: And like we
mentioned before, we're joined

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.790
today by a special guest.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.060
ALEX FAABORG: Hi, I'm Alex
Faaborg, a designer on the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.180
Android team.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.020
Very happy to be here.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.750
ROMAN NURIK: And today we're
going to be talking about

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.840
notifications and the design
process and Alex will be

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.230
leading the way with
a bunch of slides.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.740
Before we jump in,
Alex, do you want

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.530
to introduce yourself?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.010
Say a few words about
what you're doing?

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.310
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah,
sure thing.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.290
So I work on the Android
system and platforms.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.750
So things like notifications,
obviously the topic of this

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.220
show today, intents, launcher,
just sort of the base

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.090
interface of the OS itself.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.880
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.510
And do you focus primarily on
interaction design, visual

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.990
design, or where would
you say you have a

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.110
specialty in any of those?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.230
ALEX FAABORG: Primarily
interaction.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.820
Some visual direction, but
mostly interactive designer.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.900
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome, OK.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.920
NICK BUTCHER: Hopefully a lot
of people are seeing the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.050
excellent Google I/O
presentation that you gave

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.300
with Christian Robertson as well
on Design for Engineers.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.590
I've particularly enjoyed that,
and have cribbed a lot

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.425
of your lines that you use in
many of my presentations.

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:21.980
ALEX FAABORG: Thanks.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.920
To plug my other video.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.890
Keep watching this.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.780
And then when you're done
watching this, be sure to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.135
check out Advanced Design for
Engineering from I/O 2012.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:35.290
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so with that
should we jump into the slides

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.290
about notifications?

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.490
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah,
definitely.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.600
So notifications and view.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.280
Let's dive into this.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.800
The first thing I want to talk
about is the psychology

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.780
concept of flow.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.570
The flows, basically it's hard
to describe-- you can read the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.490
Wikipedia article about
it, if that helps.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.310
But it's best to just
think about times

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.390
you've experienced it.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.560
So it's when everything fades
away and you're just really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.410
focused intently on something
you're creating.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.090
So like if you're a musician,
you're not thinking about the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.199
musical instrument that
you're playing.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.150
Or even playing video games,
you don't think about the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.550
controller that you're
holding.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.900
The controller just sort
of fades away.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.770
And you also get into this state
with computing a lot,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.430
where you're engaged in
what you're doing.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.210
Or with a mobile device,
you're out

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.520
in the world engaged.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.170
And what can destroy flow
is interruptions.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.220
And notifications are kind of
fundamentally interruptive.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.900
So flow's a really good state
for people to be in.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.770
And it's a little bit dangerous
to be constantly

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.540
pulling them out of that.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.970
The main problem there is that
they're just not going to be

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.070
as effective.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.100
So flow was proposed by the
psychologist Csikszentmihalyi,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.100
and it's characterized by this
complete absorption of what

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.620
you're doing.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.400
ROMAN NURIK: Is this kind
of like a feeling

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.410
of I'm in the zone?

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.420
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, it's like
exactly what it is.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.830
So I think what's important to
think about is the user's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.270
attention stream is this
precious resource that needs

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.520
to be protected.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.220
Especially on tablets, these
larger format devices, they're

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.820
possibly reading a book.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.600
Although, effectively, a lot
of full screen apps are now

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.060
going in lights-out mode where
people aren't going to be as

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.750
visually interrupted.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.480
ROMAN NURIK: It's almost
like a feeling of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.650
immersiveness, right?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.820
Like, you're immersed in the
content of what you're doing.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.210
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.540
So I think it's really important
to think about.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.510
Assuming the user is immersed,
is it worthwhile to interrupt

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.550
them with the notification that
your application's about

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.440
to generate?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.500
Sometimes it is.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.150
So to use a developer analogy,
basically what you're doing is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.160
you're blocking the
user thread--

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.310
like, literally the
user's brain.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.050
Like you are blocking their
cognitive flow momentarily to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.960
deliver your notification.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.220
So do you want to block
that thread?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.200
So three rules for creating
notification.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.550
The first one is does it
involve another person?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.785
So like a real time chat,
is there someone or

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:09.550
a Hangout or something?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.400
Is there someone sitting
there waiting for you?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.110
So you need to get that person's
attention because

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.410
this other person's actually
waiting on them.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.880
ROMAN NURIK: It's kind of like
is another thread waiting on

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.740
you to complete.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.149
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.650
Another very important
human thread is

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.090
like waiting for you.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.240
So that's the first one.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.940
Is it time sensitive?

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.290
You'd block something on your
calendar, that event's going

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.100
to end, you need to get to it.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.590
And that's one of the reasons
why you'd want to deliver an

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.500
notification.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.030
And then finally, is it
something that the user

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.910
specifically requested?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.770
So like an alarm doesn't
involve another person.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.090
It is time sensitive and it's
something the user set.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.750
So is this something
that the user set?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.410
Please remind me at this moment,
or if this happens.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.930
Then, of course, it's totally
OK to barge in.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.050
A lot of notifications on
Android don't follow these

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.200
three rules.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.130
And that's not good.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.120
We would love to see
applications put more thought

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.910
and care and planning into
if a notification's

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.290
worthwhile or not.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.230
And we have new capabilities.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.150
Especially with the low priority
notifications, where

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.960
your application can generate
notification and

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.460
put it in the shade.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.080
So a user goes in there,
they see it.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.720
But it's not something that's
going to cause the phone to

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.560
vibrate and buzz, or the
LED to illuminate.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.070
So it's not going to actively
grab the user's attention.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.310
It's just going to be there
in case they go and check.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.800
So that notification's kind
of along for the ride when

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.600
another notification does
actually ping you.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600
Then they can consume
all of them by

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.370
clustering them together.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.600
ROMAN NURIK: And we've
talked about this a

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.380
little bit on the show.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.930
I think we've called them
opportunistic notifications.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.230
If you have the opportunity, if
the user's already in the

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.450
process of checking what's going
on, then give them that

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.200
information.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.330
An example of this would be
Google Now's Weather.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.040
I think the default weather is
a low priority notification,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.535
so it only shows up if
you already expanded

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:02.340
the notation chain.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.050
ALEX FAABORG: Right.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.560
So actually, all of Google Now's
notifications are low

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.760
priority, with the exception
of time to leave.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.100
So if we are monitoring traffic
and realize that you

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.140
really need to leave soon
because the traffic's heavy

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.950
and the only way you're going
to arrive on time is if you

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.150
take off right now, then we
go ahead and interrupt.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.180
But that's actually the only
case of Google Now doing

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.660
interrupted notification.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.830
And all of the others, we were
calling them ambient

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.200
notifications-- this notion
of they're just there.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.380
But yeah, I think low priority's
the official name

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.660
of the API?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.470
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.470
So if you're a developer and
you're figuring out how to do

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.120
this, it's actually extremely
easy, luckily.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.550
If you're using the notification
compat class, all

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.660
you need to do is just pass in
a priority of, I think is

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.930
priority.low or there's a
constant value for it.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.980
And the good thing is that
this actually is only

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.280
supported on Jelly
Bean and above.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.950
But if you're on earlier
versions of the platform,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.230
you'll actually see an
interrupted notification.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.530
It's kind of like there's no way
to show a notification in

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.660
the expanded state that's not
also in the collapsed state in

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.540
earlier versions.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.770
But you will benefit from the
new, better, more correct

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.220
behavior on newer devices
without having to do any sort

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.095
of backward compatibility
code since it's

00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:15.880
already done for you.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.490
NICK BUTCHER: And it's worth
saying that there's other

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.490
priorities other than low.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.590
While low is the only one that
will not interrupt the user, I

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.060
do believe we use the priority
to order the list of

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.860
notifications, right?

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.650
So I think if they have
something which is extremely

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.250
high priority, or you can
recognize that your

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.650
notification just qualified by
the rules but isn't the most

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.880
important thing in the user's
world, then you can set

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.695
something between low and max.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:36.920
There's some intermediate
levels.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.960
So you can really hint to the
user so that they find that

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.346
list more useful when
it's sorted.

00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:43.170
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.330
ALEX FAABORG: And don't just set
it to max because you want

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.790
your notifications to be above
all of the other applications.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.210
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.500
I think the one major takeaway
so far is just be mindful of

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.760
what the user wants.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.620
Your application--

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.830
and I think Adam Powell on the
framework team uses an analogy

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.290
really well-- you're a guest
in the user's house.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.350
The user's house, the device,
you're a guest there.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.710
If you're an application that's
installed on their

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.050
device, be mindful and
be respectful.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.340
You don't want to barge them
and bombard them with--

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.090
ALEX FAABORG: Imagine your
notification is an air horn.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.130
And after the user's suddenly
startled by it, then you have

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.500
to back that up with interesting
information that

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.910
they care about and
find relevant.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.320
And they say thank you
for sounding that

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.425
air horn right then.

00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:28.360
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe when you're
a developer you can set

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.080
a custom notification ringtone
of an air horn just to test

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.120
whether you really think
you are interrupting

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.280
at the right time.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.500
ALEX FAABORG: Or we should just
change the API to name it

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.225
interrupt the user, and then
people will be more mindful.

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:43.900
ROMAN NURIK: Like
notificationmanager.interrupt

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.570
and potentially piss
off the user.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.810
ALEX FAABORG: And it is worth
noting that users can silence

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.600
their application from
generating any notifications.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.830
They can also uninstall your
application if it's becoming

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.400
really annoying.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.600
So beyond it being the right
thing to do though, are good

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.430
reasons to not annoy the user
through notifications.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.560
And it's especially true of
notifications that are trying

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.930
to solicit positive reviews
in the store.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.620
I would love to see a study if
that actually results in more

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.500
negative reviews online.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.370
I would assume that that could
be a likely scenario.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.690
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we definitely
have some best

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.170
practices on when to solicit
views and what not to do.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.920
Especially not to ask
for five-star

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.240
reviews, things like that.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.880
But certainly, notifications,
they're really something

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.660
that's more timely.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.490
Like, if you want to ask the
user for a review, if there's

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.415
any place to put it, it's not
going to be in a notification.

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.580
It's probably going to be
somewhere deep within your app

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.960
and either a help or somewhere
that they're already exploring

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.440
more about your app
and potentially

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.135
want to give you feedback.

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:54.480
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.650
NICK BUTCHER: And normally
after they've had a good

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.760
outcome, I find, as well.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.270
Don't just do it first
launch or whatever.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.940
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, they should
have at least had a

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.690
chance to use it.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.840
I would say probably you should
never ask for a review.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.880
But if you are going to, at
least do it inside your

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.180
application, not while they're
using another application.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.190
I guess another important
thing to note is

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.960
correct usage of toast.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.700
So a toast should be a direct
response to a user action.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.260
Usually it's a nice little
confirmation, like message

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.980
sent, or item archived,
these types of things.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.870
Where you're hitting a button
and then it's immediately

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.420
mirroring back like,
yep, got it.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.130
Do not generate a toast
when your application

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.936
doesn't have focus.

00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.930
ROMAN NURIK: I remember we
talked about this when we were

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.140
working on the style
guide a while ago.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.970
And this is one of the big
things, one of your biggest

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.980
pet peeves, right--

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.690
ALEX FAABORG: It is.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.125
ROMAN NURIK: --when
toasts pop up.

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:44.900
ALEX FAABORG: So I have a
couple different banking

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.830
applications installed
on my phone.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.210
I'll be using something else,
and just in the middle of

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.670
nowhere I'll get a toast
that says your

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.010
banking session has ended.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.300
And I don't even know which
application is responsible.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.055
ROMAN NURIK: Is it
bank A or bank B?

00:10:57.055 --> 00:10:58.130
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, because
I tend to open

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.750
them at the same time.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.450
So I can't even contact them to
be like guys, what's wrong?

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.720
So really not helpful to show
a toast out of nowhere.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.220
The reason we have a whole
notification shade, and

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.440
notification manager, and all
this is to have that nice

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.770
place for your message.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.150
Also, important not to treat
notifications as a

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.000
kind of error log.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.220
I know there's some note
applications where it'll

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.100
generate notification
that says note was

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.530
saved to the cloud.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.210
It's like, great--

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.380
ROMAN NURIK: Right, that's
the accepted behavior.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.910
ALEX FAABORG: --I'm
so happy for you.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.630
I was actually off doing
something else.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.350
I just left, but I'm glad you
took care of that and then

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.850
told me about it.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.610
So obviously anything that's
just sort of your app managing

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.060
itself, I would even say take
this as far as we shouldn't be

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.570
notifying people about
software updates.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.260
It's something we're
working on.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.120
Which is Android itself not
following that rule.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.800
But yeah, it should involve
other people, it should be

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.400
time sensitive, or it should
be something the user

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.305
specifically requested.

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.610
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.300
Yeah, very good general
advice.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.600
And just on the top of the
notifications while we're on

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.080
it, we also have a design
pattern documented on

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.390
developer.android.com/design
that talks about lots of

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.440
different situations where you
shouldn't show notifications.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.770
And in addition, we touched
a little bit on health and

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.220
things like that.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.670
There's also a pattern
that talks

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.420
about health and tutorials.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.210
Not exactly related to
notifications, but still

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.571
definitely stuff that
you should read.

00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:33.530
ALEX FAABORG: All right, should
we move on to the

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.255
design process?

00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:35.120
ROMAN NURIK: Let's do it.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.670
ALEX FAABORG: All right,
design workflow.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.190
So we thought this would be
a fun topic to go into.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.680
To sort of talk about some of
the ways that design teams at

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.950
Google have their workflow,
which is likely almost the

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.530
same as everyone else.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.920
Usually this stuff is
pretty standard.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.920
But talk about the various
artifacts that we create, the

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.020
reasons we create them.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.880
What purpose they serve at each
state of the process.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.970
Start running through that.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.490
So the example we use
is Google Now.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.930
I got a chance to be one of the
designers on Google Now.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.950
ROMAN NURIK: Which is very
widely recognized as really,

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.920
really awesome design overall.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.110
And a lot of folks have been
looking at that as kind of

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.790
inspiration, taking inspiration
from it.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.590
So just personally, I want to
applaud you guys on the design

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.135
team for building an
awesome product.

00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:25.680
ALEX FAABORG: Well, thank you.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.230
It was a super talented team
that got to work on it.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.090
So we'll give you kind of a
behind the scenes look.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.470
Sort of like movie special
features of what it looks like

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.720
before it was awesome as
it was being created.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.720
ROMAN NURIK: I don't know, it
kind of always looked awesome

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.670
from what we saw.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.690
ALEX FAABORG: We'll see.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.420
So, here's actually some of
the very first sketches of

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.570
Google Now up on a whiteboard.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.580
And as you can see, not great at
drawing perfect rectangles.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.620
But what's great about sketches
is for soliciting

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.080
really high level feedback.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.760
So when you show someone just
a bunch of markings on a

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.340
whiteboard like this, they're
immediately engaged in the

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.150
idea and coming up with
their own ideas

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.970
and providing feedback.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.700
They feel like it's appropriate
to provide

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.630
feedback at this stage.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.040
Whereas if you show someone this
perfectly rendered, high

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.350
fidelity mockup, they'll start
commenting on really minor

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.280
details but they won't
be like, actually,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.150
that's a bad idea.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.860
Like, you shouldn't be
doing this at all.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.420
Or have you thought about these
other things that are

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.120
slightly related.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.540
So it's important to sort of
scale the fidelity of the

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.250
mockups you're creating with
the type of engagement you

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.300
want from the people you're
showing them to.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.960
So obviously at this point we
were just trying to generate

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.300
ideas on if we had this
proactive software that was

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.910
pulling information
for you, what

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.730
information would it pull?

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.240
That'd be interesting.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.570
So we were kind of going through
various actions you

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.510
could have on the cards and
the types of cards.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.376
And actually a lot of the
stuff ended up shipping.

00:15:06.376 --> 00:15:09.780
I think everything on this is
actually in product which is

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.020
pretty awesome.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.190
ROMAN NURIK: At different
stages, right?

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.760
Not everything rolled out in
the very first version.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.460
ALEX FAABORG: No, this was
all in the first version.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.290
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, really?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.920
And you've got the flight
notifications?

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.500
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, we had
flight notifications.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:19.920
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, really?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.350
ALEX FAABORG: We didn't
have boarding passes.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.850
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, OK.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.790
ALEX FAABORG: So there's
your very first

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.720
sketch of Google Now.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.680
From then, we quickly staffed
up the design team and had

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.600
more people working on it.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.650
And here's kind of image of the
sort of war room we had as

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.860
we were quickly posting stuff
up on the wall for review.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.510
So again, it's at that
sort of sketch level.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.060
There's some more higher
fidelity things here that are

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.300
exploring visual design.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.070
But the purpose here is to go as
broad as possible, instead

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.330
of as deep as possible.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.725
Explore as many ideas
as you can.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.240
You're trying to solicit
feedback from

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.650
people and be creative.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:08.610
So not being overly critical
of any ideas to shut

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.450
brainstorming down.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.170
But saying oh, that's cool,
but have you tried this?

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.010
And I was kind of redirecting
if you're trying to steer

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.050
things in a particular
direction.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.610
ROMAN NURIK: Quick question.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.550
At this stage are you thinking
about layout?

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.620
In the earlier stage, you were
probably thinking a little bit

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.630
about layout, but more about the
functionality, the actual

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.610
product itself.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.710
Like, what will the user be
able to get out of this?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.660
What are their benefits?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.060
What are the different
things they can do?

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.650
But as this stage, are
you starting to think

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.470
about layout yet?

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.490
And potentially even I guess
like the pixels themselves?

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.446
Probably not, right?

00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:41.370
ALEX FAABORG: So I know at
this stage the visual

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.960
designers were starting to think
about oh, what if we

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.840
were doing automatic layout
based on the content?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.010
And kind of taking the overall
spirit of what the application

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.090
was about and applying that to
their space, so that was a

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.140
little bit different
than normal.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.380
The layout is obviously--

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.820
you can't not have a layout.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.920
It's kind of one of
these mockups.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.580
ROMAN NURIK: I guess what I'm
trying to get at is are you

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.270
thinking about all the different
situations for that?

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.710
Because as an Android developer,
you have to think

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.740
about how does this
look on a tablet?

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.770
How does this look in
portrait, landscape?

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.490
ALEX FAABORG: No, at this point
we were just purely

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.619
doing phones and we figured we'd
deal with tablet later.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.130
And tablet ended up
just being sort of

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.150
multiple columns of parts.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.720
In some ways we still
kind of dodged that.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.070
I mean, it's an effective layout
for the device, but it

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.320
didn't provide a lot of custom
work for us to do that layout.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.480
So we're still generating
ideas.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.710
Next up would be wire frames.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.780
We were kind of short on time
with Google Now, so we totally

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.420
skipped wire frames.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.970
Here's my approximation
of a wire frame.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.740
This is actually more higher
fidelity than you would have.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.105
So then we did full
fidelity mockups.

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:56.230
These were actually created
for a Larry Page review.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.490
And at that point, you're sort
of presenting the full vision

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.390
of the application
for feedback.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.840
You're saying we've put a lot
of thought into this.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.325
This is sort of how
we imagined it.

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:11.380
And you're trying to get
feedback on fine details and

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.590
also the spirit of the
thing as a whole.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:23.040
As opposed to feedback
specifically on the finer

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.835
things like layout.

00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:25.002
ROMAN NURIK: Right.

00:18:25.002 --> 00:18:28.800
ALEX FAABORG: So you're giving
them what could potentially be

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.930
pixel perfect mocks.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.460
These ended up being very
different from what we

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.670
actually shipped.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.910
But they were, at least at the
time, pixel perfect, to really

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.660
help them visualize what this
thing's going to be about.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.040
ROMAN NURIK: But I guess maybe
because they were this review

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.410
for executives, for somebody
that's higher up, you want to

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.660
make sure that they are fully
seeing the actual vision.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.340
Maybe not like sketches.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.010
You don't want to show sketches
to a C-level person,

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.910
I'm guessing.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.140
ALEX FAABORG: Well, it always
depends on the executive and

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.460
how they're engaged
in the product.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.840
But I think it's often easier
for people to get excited

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.880
about something that
looks real.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:14.620
And also it communicates the
amount of work and thought

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.210
that you've put into it when
you dive to full fidelity

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.380
mockups at that stage.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.890
And it lets you test
certain boundaries.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.490
Like the contextual header in
Google Now was definitely

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.690
something new.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.860
And here we're actually
using photographs.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.180
And we were just sort of
interested what feedback that

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.170
was going to generate.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.790
Even at the time we weren't
super comfortable with

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.360
photographs.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.180
But we wanted to put
those into the

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.080
full fidelity mockups.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.690
Just kind of push that boundary
of what we'd be doing

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.900
with Google brand.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.840
So then obviously, you want to
use full fidelity for visual

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.370
exploration.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.200
So here we have the full range
of photograph with a filter

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.930
applied to it.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:20:00.420
And then some extremely block
imagery, very illustrative.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:00.760
ROMAN NURIK: At the
bottom there?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.400
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, at
the bottom here.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.440
With the most simplistic of
bridges, which was actually

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.040
pretty ridiculous.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.140
We were just trying to
see the range verses

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.140
something more like this.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.630
So we spent a lot of time on
this contextual header.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.480
One of our super talented visual
designers created this

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.200
sort of sequence where
here we have really

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.340
kind of abstract art.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:23.960
I loved these.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.490
I actually kind of like this
direction better than what we

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.450
ultimately decided on.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.785
ROMAN NURIK: I would have
loved these as well.

00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:31.420
ALEX FAABORG: Aren't
these beautiful?

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.110
Very, very talented.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.490
Here it was a mixture of time
and day and weather, as

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.290
opposed to place.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.190
We ended up focusing on place,
because we felt that people

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:45.530
often had this connection to
where they live and this pride

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.520
in their hometown.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.150
So we're kind of [INAUDIBLE]
in that.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.716
Also, when you're traveling it's
really neat to see the

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.120
new headers.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.110
So we dropped just the purely
abstract, but I thought these

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.470
were just absolutely
beautiful.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.252
Even more abstract, we thought
of those-- that

00:20:58.252 --> 00:20:59.145
was going too far.

00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:02.180
Here was sort of a mixture of
more abstract with some items

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.040
in the background of place.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.390
And then we started exploring
this notion of cities--

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:12.820
San Francisco being shown here,
and one of Seattle.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.685
Here's that same style, sort
of a country town.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.280
ROMAN NURIK: So they were just
playing out different

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.380
aesthetics?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.230
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, each one
was kind of triggering the

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.510
next as we would get this
posted up on the wall.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.920
And talk about what it conveys
and how people are going to

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.970
feel as they see it.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:31.990
So then this brought
us a little bit

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.630
closer to where we landed.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.380
It's sort of a little bit
more detailed, but still

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.080
illustrative.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.110
And then we're filming
in New York today.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.750
So I thought I'd show one of
the early New York ones.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.960
And these strong shadows which
we see a lot in a lot of

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.430
Google's design work.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.390
ROMAN NURIK: The 45
degree angles.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.694
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:21:52.694 --> 00:21:54.960
NICK BUTCHER: Is that an
experiment with the hollow

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.740
style text input box as well?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.580
ALEX FAABORG: Oh yeah, it is.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.700
And we ended up dropping that
because it didn't quite have

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.610
the visual hierarchy that
we were looking for.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.350
Especially without controlling
the background,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.410
it was falling out.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.570
But yeah, this was the one
that we settled on as the

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.370
direction we really liked.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.280
And then from there it was
iterating on going out and

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.090
creating all the cities.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.886
Here we have London.

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:23.045
NICK BUTCHER: Hey.

00:22:23.045 --> 00:22:26.130
ALEX FAABORG: New York, there's
San Francisco at all

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.565
the different times of day.

00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:29.810
ROMAN NURIK: I personally
love the color palettes.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.450
I mean, to me if you were to
drop these into something like

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.170
kuler.adobe.com.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.810
Or even Dribbble, they
give you kind of

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.600
like a color range.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.300
Or if you upload a photo or
upload a design, they kind of

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.310
give you the general
color scheme.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.930
I feel like these, if you were
to import those, they would

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.850
result in some of the
best color palettes.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.780
I just personally am
in love with them.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.980
Especially the San
Francisco one.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.530
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah,
the ones at night.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.495
I love this New York one at
night with the airplane.

00:22:57.495 --> 00:23:00.140
NICK BUTCHER: Do you know how
many permutations of headers

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.410
you ended up generating?

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.550
ALEX FAABORG: So there's
actually quite a

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.240
few more than this.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.200
We're doing them over time
and staging out cities.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.200
We were trying to get
all the cities by

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.950
population for a while.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.990
And then we realized we weren't
getting some of the

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.850
tech centers, so those
got kind of

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.550
accelerated to include those.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.280
So over time you'll see
more and more cities.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.345
We also actually do use some
filters on photographs in

00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:30.510
Google Now just so we could have
more coverage at launch.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.250
Because these obviously take
some time to make.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.840
But this was the sort
art style that we--

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.390
NICK BUTCHER: I love the
ambition of it as well.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.300
That, yeah, we're going to
provide a localized header for

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.680
every major city.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.800
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, I know,
which a lot of people were

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.810
kind of critical of.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.080
And I was trying to make
the argument, well,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.930
it's a finite set.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.460
NICK BUTCHER: But I think it
conveys something about the

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:52.970
product, right?

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.550
This is Google and there's
an element of magic.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.300
And Google boils oceans and does
these crazy big tasks.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.840
And I think it resonates with
Google's image and what we're

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.705
trying to do with Now, I
think, very, very well.

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.340
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, it's also
actually important to talk

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.310
about, higher level, why are
we doing all of this?

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.230
We wanted to be sure that when
you went into the application

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.910
you understood that
it was contextual.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.440
And having the header change
over time made every part,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.655
even the artwork, contextual.

00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:21.940
And have it change based
off your location.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.160
So it became this sort of
immediate visual affordance of

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.930
oh, these cards really
are live.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.070
They're about what's happening
right now and right here, so

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.800
it was able to set that tone.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.260
Whereas Google.com, it's white,
it's kind of about the

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.710
infinite possibilities
of finding anything.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.700
Obviously you can still do a
search, but it's also we've

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.300
created the search based off
of your current context.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.890
So we felt that that was sort
of helpful to set the user's

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.320
expectations of what the
application would do right off

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.220
the bat with the header.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.910
Even the motion graphics
design was done

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.440
to convey that though.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.850
The notion of the cards dealing
in, where you see them

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.590
deal immediately, helps
establish this mental model of

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:08.250
these were just created for
you based on what's

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.090
happening right now.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.030
Also, one of the reasons I was
focusing on a card metaphor

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.160
was it can kind of help with
expectations of when you're

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.760
playing cards, this may or
may not be a good hand.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.670
Thankfully the quality has
been great now-- in the

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.170
beginning it wasn't.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.215
ROMAN NURIK: Managing
expectations.

00:25:28.215 --> 00:25:29.870
ALEX FAABORG: Managing
expectations, yeah.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.120
Like, oh, I've got good
cards this time.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.670
But it's worth noting that in
addition to all the visual

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.750
design I'm showing here, there
was a lot of motion graphics

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.980
design that went into
Google Now.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.690
We actually had a dedicated
motion graphics designer who

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:49.650
was working on cards dealing
in, the field expanding.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.460
The microphone radiating and the
circles coming off of the

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.515
microphone as an indication of
if you're speaking too loud or

00:25:57.515 --> 00:25:59.620
not, which I thought was
really interesting.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.570
So one of the problems with
speech recognition is for some

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.270
reason people assume
the accuracy's

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:05.710
not going to be great.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.772
And so they just kind of
naturally start shouting at

00:26:07.772 --> 00:26:08.340
the machine.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.030
ROMAN NURIK: Oh yeah,
my parents are--

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.330
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah,
I think everyone's

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.370
parents, mine as well.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.080
ROMAN NURIK: Pizza
in New York.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.800
And the problem with that is
then you start blowing out the

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.720
microphone.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.290
So actually, the recognitions
are much worse, because you

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.540
can't even get a good signal.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.820
So we wanted something to sort
of show nope, too loud.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.405
So it actually hits this outer
radius and turns red if you--

00:26:29.405 --> 00:26:30.980
or I believe it does.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.850
That was the design at least.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.380
I just need to go back and
make sure we finish that.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.120
But yeah, to have that kind
of immediate feedback and

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.750
have it feel live.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.350
So continuing on with
slides here.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.835
ROMAN NURIK: We'll ask more
about motion graphics then.

00:26:41.835 --> 00:26:43.150
ALEX FAABORG: Oh, sure thing.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.990
Well, motion graphics also comes
into play in the-- this

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.520
is sort of the most static way
of describing motion graphics,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.100
but here's a flow.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.230
You're basically trying
to visualize

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.170
the sequence of steps.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.140
These are useful for knowing
what your key frames are in

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.470
terms of I need to animate from
here to here and I have

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.050
no idea how to do that.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.360
Which is actually not the best
way of framing it to motion

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.610
graphics designers.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.980
ROMAN NURIK: As engineers.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.680
ALEX FAABORG: What sort of
feeling you want to evoke and

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.140
what you're trying to
communicate with the graphics.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.750
But flows are also really useful
for just understanding

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.480
the temporal complexity
of your application.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.980
Which, it's important
to get it up on the

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.700
board and look at it.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.070
And saying is it actually too
difficult to get from this

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.170
location to this
other location?

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.345
There's too many navigation
steps.

00:27:28.345 --> 00:27:31.150
It's going to take the
user too much time.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.660
People often think about
complexity in terms of the

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.730
number of objects on screen.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.430
But if you make things simpler
by introducing navigational

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.680
steps, you've really just kind
of shifted your complexity

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.080
into a different type
of complexity.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.050
So it's really good to look at
the sequences so you can see

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.960
temporal complexity.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.590
We also then, sort of the
final stages, Redlines.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.100
Just sort of communicating
specific values, colors,

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.420
padding, things like this.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.340
Because you want everything
to be pixel perfect and in

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.040
perfect alignment.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.080
This was actually a much earlier
design of Google Now

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.880
for the Redline.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.420
But as we were moving onto
engineering, this was the

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.520
Redline we used right then.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.120
ROMAN NURIK: This is actually
something that's a very

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.170
important tool for designers
to communicate with

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.940
developers.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.620
So as a developer, you
generally look it up.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.300
You may look at a pixel perfect
and say OK, I need to

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.570
roughly approximate this.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.480
So let me just make this three
dips or four dips.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.330
And that looks about
right, and let me

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.360
actually just do this.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.400
So as a designer, if you're
communicating and working with

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.250
developers, make sure to give
them these pieces of

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.140
information.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.780
And another thing I just want to
add in here is make sure to

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.200
note what should stretch, what
should be fixed, what is

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.900
responsive.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.690
Almost put in, if it requires
text, like a text description

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.320
like this should stay fixed
and so on and so forth.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.360
Make sure to include that.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.460
That's one of the most important
tools, I think, for

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.350
communicating between designers
and developers.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.200
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.380
NICK BUTCHER: Do you have any
similar kinds [INAUDIBLE] for

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.160
doing motion?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.990
I don't know how you would
document that you wanted it to

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.670
animate in a certain way.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.930
Would you just use the key
frames type snapshots?

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.330
Or do you have a similar
technique to Redline's for

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.783
saying this should
move like this?

00:29:08.783 --> 00:29:10.390
ALEX FAABORG: You
know, we don't.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.210
We do it all with hand
gestures actually.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:18.070
Which is not nearly as exact
as if we had a Redline.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:24.820
But often the motion graphics
designer, they're generating

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.990
the videos that can then be used
to convert to the final

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.620
animations.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.510
So from those you can extract
timing and things like that.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.560
So it would be similar to
instead of Redline, a

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.450
developer going into Photoshop
and actually

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.420
measuring the senses.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.190
And that you have to view the
properties in Aftereffects.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.310
ROMAN NURIK: And in some cases
if you have the resources, you

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.560
could also probably spend some
time to prototype something.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.130
I don't know if we have any
prototype engineers.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.985
But I know that some companies
actually have folks that don't

00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:56.240
even build the final
shipping software.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.500
But they will build a prototype
that roughly

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.190
approximates the general
behaviors, interactions and

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.290
motion, potentially, using the
actual tools you'll be using

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:07.210
to build the app.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.790
Or using things like processing
that JS, or even

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.850
HTML JavaScript.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.570
Something that's really easy
and lightweight and easy to

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.730
iterate on.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.850
Those tools can be very useful
for communicating that idea.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.420
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, and then

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.500
communicating late in the process.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.480
And communicating early in the
process, you're just focusing

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.370
on how do you want to set the
stage of your application?

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.870
How does it immediately
present itself?

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.870
What do you want the user's
attention to focus on?

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.900
Because much like dinosaurs,
T-Rex's seeing motion, I will

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.940
be drawn to anything
that's animating.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.850
So as you're doing the motion
graphics design, it's again

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.000
about the user's attention.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.020
What you're notifying them of in
that moment in time of what

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.910
on screen you want them
to fixate on.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.030
How you want to draw their
attention to some things.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.820
ROMAN NURIK: That's another
case of don't animate

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.320
needlessly.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.230
Don't animate just
for visual flair.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.690
ALEX FAABORG: Right.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:58.680
Have a purpose.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.280
A story of your animation.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.800
A reason you want users
to focus on something.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.920
Like in Google Now, when you
say Google, it goes into

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.580
microphone mode.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.390
So obviously, you might
just say Google

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.430
while looking at it.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.310
So the search field stretches
down so you can see what you

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.010
acted on as you're going
into that mode.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.980
Obviously when you tap it you
don't need to communicate that

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.070
as much because you literally
touched it.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.970
But for the voice input, I
thought that was a really

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.860
effective way of telling that
story of the search field has

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.650
become the microphone input.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.965
So even though it's not taking
text entry at that point, that

00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:39.582
you're still speaking
to this object.

00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:40.740
ROMAN NURIK: That's awesome.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.080
ALEX FAABORG: That's sort of the
level of analysis you have

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.360
to do in terms of the
motion graphics.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.740
And crafting that story about
how the application behaves.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.940
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:56.790
So, let's move on to some final
social engineering tips

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.602
as you are showing
your mockups.

00:31:59.602 --> 00:32:02.700
ALEX FAABORG: So one of the
first things that I thought is

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.260
really effective is you want
the feeling to be very

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.420
collaborative as you're showing
these to various

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.370
engineers and project managers
and marketing people you're

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:11.780
working with.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.460
So one of the easiest things you
can do is show your work

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.180
live in the application
used to create it.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.330
So as people are generating
feedback, you're adding notes,

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.360
you're making changes.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.110
So it feels like it's
this sort of

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.190
fluid, living document.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.580
As opposed to printing it out
and posting it up on the wall

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.930
and having everyone just
kind of look at it.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.960
Or even just projecting it, but
it's like a flattened PDF

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.100
or something where it feels
more finalized.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.250
ROMAN NURIK: It feels
like progress.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.890
Like actual progress
is being made right

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.480
there in that moment.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.020
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:43.190
And not only are you listening
to them, but their input is

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.210
directly influencing.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.320
So it's a lot like pair
designing in a way instead of

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.810
pair programming.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.870
Or if you do print your work
out, set it flat on the table.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.530
Have both people sitting there
with the pens marking it up so

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.210
it feels like it's very
collaborative.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.390
As you're defending reasons
that you did something, or

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.420
you're trying not to have the
design be changed in a

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.410
particular way.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.500
Don't say oh well,
I'm the designer,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.000
or that's my opinion.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.650
Back it up with specific design
principles with actual

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.540
reasons that are irrefutable
on why it

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.350
needs to be that way.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.270
ROMAN NURIK: It's tough because
some things are so

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.670
very subjective.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.180
Some things are just like, I
have this intuition, I can't

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:22.590
explain it.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.780
But definitely, a big part of
the communication process is

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.900
articulating what
you're thinking.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.610
ALEX FAABORG: Often it's
not subjective.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.490
There are actual reasons
why something should

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.810
be a certain way--

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:39.460
underlying cognitive science
and design principles.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.640
Or even just existing
user studies.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.960
If you have done a user study
yourself, there are previous

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.860
user studies that point to the
same results that you can

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.900
anticipate.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:58.260
So it's very important to make
sure that your take on the

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.210
design is dripping in science.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.120
Because if it's just my opinion
versus your opinion,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.630
then you could just continue
debating forever.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.514
Engineers don't debate
oh, well, I think it

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.630
should crash more.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.880
Or, I think it should
be slower.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.010
Design does have these
fundamental principles.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.469
Various usability heuristics,
things that we've learned

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.515
through years of testing on
how people are going to

00:34:22.515 --> 00:34:24.840
behave, what they're
going to focus on.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.929
If they're going to be annoyed
by how many notifications your

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:28.909
application's creating.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.120
ROMAN NURIK: It's probably a
good moment to say that the

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.739
design guidelines
that we have on

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.750
developer.android.com/design,
a lot of that is taking into

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.949
account all these studies that
we've done, and all these

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:42.480
things that you guys have had in
your minds for a while and

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.670
putting it down on paper.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.295
Not necessarily saying that
these are the only things that

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:46.889
you should be doing.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.560
But a lot of it is
driven by these

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.289
heuristics, as you mentioned.

00:34:50.289 --> 00:34:51.510
ALEX FAABORG: Yeah.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.090
Obviously promotes great
guidance, good plug.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.179
I should have said
that as well.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.510
So let's move on to
questions quickly.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.080
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.070
And before we move on to
questions, we're running a

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.850
little low on time.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.950
But I just wanted to say thanks
for sharing all that

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.520
information.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.410
That's a lot of enlightening
stuff.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.470
I definitely learned a lot in
the past 20 or 30 minutes.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:13.610
All right, so that was a
whopping 30+ minute episode.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.750
Thanks again, Alex,
for joining.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.150
ALEX FAABORG: No problem.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.015
Thanks for having me.

00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:18.440
ROMAN NURIK: All right, so we'll
see you guys next time

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.610
here on Android Design
in Action.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.680
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.590
ALEX FAABORG: And
Alex Faaborg.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.710
NICK BUTCHER: Bye from
London from Nick

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.960
Butcher, special guest.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.810
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
see you guys later.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.190
ALEX FAABORG: See you.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.490
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.740
ROMAN NURIK: Adios.
