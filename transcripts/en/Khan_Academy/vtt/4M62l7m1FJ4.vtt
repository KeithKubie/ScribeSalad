00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.260
Use your calculator to find
the angle to the nearest

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.214
degree, whose tangent
value is 0.875.

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:11.880
So what do you think
that's going to be?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.430
The angle to the nearest degree,
whose tangent value is 0.875.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.400
Well, the first thing
is to be careful.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.350
They are not asking for
the tangent of 0.875.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.020
They're not saying
that 0.875 is an angle

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.850
and we want to find
the tangent of it.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.510
That is not what they're asking.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.070
They're asking
something different.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.650
They're saying that
there's some angle.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.440
Maybe we could call it theta.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.910
There's some angle
that if we were

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.880
to take the tangent
of that angle,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.920
then we are going to get 0.875.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.820
So how do we figure
out this mystery angle

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.470
using our calculator?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.270
Well, the way we
do it is a function

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.420
called the inverse
tangent function.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.640
Or sometimes it's called
the arc tangent function.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.250
And essentially,
if you apply that,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.958
and if you just view
this as an equation,

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.730
you take the inverse
tangent of something.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.820
So if you take the
inverse tangent of this.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.910
And you take the
inverse tangent--

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.560
let me clear this
out a little bit.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.150
I'm just taking the inverse
tangent of both sides.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.360
0.875.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.610
On the left hand side you're
just left with the angle.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.430
The inverse tangent of tangent
is just your original angle.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.130
And on the right hand side
you get the inverse tangent

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.660
of 0.875.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.150
And if you're in
degree mode this

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.467
is going to return
an angle in degrees.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.550
And if you're in radians
mode it will return angle

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.280
in terms of radians.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.350
But let's figure this out
using our calculators.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.900
So we could use the
traditional calculator,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.600
or more traditional calculator.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.290
Let me clear everything out.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.977
Now all I see is a tangent.

00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:01.310
I don't see the inverse tangent.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.684
In order to get that you have
to press the inverse button

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:04.647
right over here.

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.230
And this is not the
reciprocal button.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.650
This is the reciprocal button.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.108
This right over
here is the inverse

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:10.508
to get the inverse functions.

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:13.070
So you press inverse and notice
you saw that this changed.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.595
This would not actually happened
on an actual calculator.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:16.470
But you get the idea.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.553
The actual calculator might
have something up here

00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:20.860
to show that you can
access it that way.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.340
And so now we could say 0.875.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.510
And we're going to take
the inverse tangent of it.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.420
Inverse tangent.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090
So take the inverse
tangent of it.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.840
We already know that
we're in degree mode.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.631
And we want to round
to the nearest degree.

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.020
So it's going to be, if we
round to the nearest degree--

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.610
we get 41 degrees.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.885
So theta is approximately,
it's not exactly--

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:46.930
we're rounding-- 41 degrees.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.420
Let's do the exact same thing
with the graphing calculator.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.810
So let me turn it on.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.440
And let me clear it.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.592
And now we want to take
the inverse tangent.

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.050
If you have this calculator it
will look exactly like this.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.540
You see this tangent.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.440
Inverse tangent.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.200
Tan.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.250
They have it written as
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.860
It looks like that.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.693
But it's not really to
the negative 1 power.

00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:10.160
It's really inverse tangent.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.284
It's right there in yellow.

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:14.230
To access that you press
second and then that function.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.210
Inverse tangent of 0.875.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.370
We get the exact same value.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.780
It's roughly equal
to 41 degrees if we

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.992
round to the nearest degree.
