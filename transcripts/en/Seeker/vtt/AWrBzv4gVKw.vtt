00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.100
If you could steal the heat from the sun-rich
summer and give it to the sun-poor winter,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.030
you could be the Robinhood of the world’s
energy needs.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.200
Hey sunbeams, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.460
Solar recently grabbed headlines when the
Department of Energy found solar power generation

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.849
employs more people than generating electricity
from oil, coal, and gas combined.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.769
In part it’s because of construction, but
also because solar workers do way more than

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.960
just building solar panels… they also work
on thermal energy projects.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.629
The sun provides enough energy in about one
hour to power the entire planet for a whole

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.260
year, and a lot of that is heat!

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.261
We’re actually pretty bad at leveraging
this free energy the universe gives us, but

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.860
scientists are working to capture more of
it!

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.929
For example, researchers from Switzerland
developed a new way to capture summer heat

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.239
and store it all the way until wintertime
by taking advantage of the chemical properties

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.070
of Sodium Hydroxide, or NaOH.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.829
NaOH is a white crystalline odorless solid
that reacts with water.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.740
When you pour water on a mixture containing
concentrated NaOH, it releases heat in what’s

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.720
called an exothermic reaction.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030
To control the exothermic reaction, the researchers
exposed the NaOH steam… allowing it to release

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.860
small amounts of heat at a time, just enough
heat to heat up a metal pipe.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.580
A solar collector can help reverse this reaction
by evaporating the water leaving NaOH behind.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.780
If water is added to the mixture again - heat
will again be released, and this back and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.050
forth can be reversed again and again!

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.720
Right now, the NaOH system is still a prototype,
so we haven’t solved the world’s energy

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.200
needs just yet.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.229
But the researchers are looking for industrial
partners to help commercialize their technology,

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.810
which they think could be used to heat homes
in the winter.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.770
All thanks to chemistry and the sun.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.630
As you know, solar energy isn’t constant.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.860
In the summer, we get more heat than we need,
so we use energy to cool down.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.100
Come wintertime, we don’t have enough heat,
so we use more energy to warm up again.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.829
The most challenging and most important part
of solar energy isn’t just how to create

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.580
it: it’s how do you store it?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.689
Not just because of a cloudy day, but a cloudy
season.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.231
If we repeated this simple chemical reaction
all summer, using the sun to add energy, the

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.871
generated heat could be stored until needed
in the winter -- weaning ourselves off of

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:19.700
dirty fossil fuels… but how?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
Batteries suck.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.760
We’ve talked about this a lot.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.700
They’re actually one of the worst options
for solar energy storage - mostly because

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.650
current batteries are limited in the number
of times you can charge them, they’re fairly

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030
expensive, and the types of batteries you
would need for this application would be huge.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.450
With a bit more chemistry and physics, you
can store the power of the sun in salt!

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.170
Most power generation facilities use heat
to generate steam and turn a system of turbines.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.170
Seriously.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.250
Nuclear, coal, gas, solar.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.250
All of them.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.210
Wind and hydro just turn the turbines with
something else.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.030
The Abengoa Solar's Solana plant in the Arizona
desert uses over 3,000 parabolic mirrors to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.880
heat water and turn their turbines, but they
also can focus the sunlight to heat large

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.110
insulated tanks of salt causing it to melt.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.620
The molten salt stores the energy gathered
during the day, which can later be used to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.730
turn turbines at night!

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.940
Unfortunately, this strategy can only store
energy for 6 hours.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.840
To store energy throughout the year we’ll
have to get more creative -- like by putting

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.760
it underground, which is actually what the
Swiss researchers suggested for their NaOH

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.850
system -- a geothermal probe.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.510
Today, one of the most common strategies for
seasonal solar thermal storage is known as

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.450
borehole heat storage.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.410
This essentially uses the heat capacity of
soil to store large amounts of heat underground

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.620
for months!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.090
It works by drilling an array of boreholes
from about 30 to 200 meters deep into the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.090
Earth.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.440
During hot summer months, the heat is transferred
to water which is then stored deep in the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.730
soil and rock inside the borehole!

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.740
That stored heat can later be extracted when
needed and used for all sorts of things.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.000
Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands
all use these systems, sometimes seemingly

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.110
keeping nest eggs of heat under their houses
like a neighborhood of giant chickens.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.360
The challenge with the borehole strategy,
though, is that you need access to drillable

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.230
land, and for most people, like those who
live in urban areas, that’s simply not an

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.230
option.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.960
Hopefully, someday, with a combination of
solar thermal plants, geothermal and borehole

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.719
facilities, as well as concentrated sodium
hydroxide, we might get close to weaning ourselves

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.479
off of fossil fuels forever.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.219
If solar energy is so great, why aren't we
using more of it?

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.949
