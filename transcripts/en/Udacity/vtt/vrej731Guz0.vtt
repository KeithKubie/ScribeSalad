00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] Here's a quiz question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want you to tell me which of these possible representations for a hand

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
do you think make sense.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Somewhat this is subjective.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You may have different opinions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So tell me all the ones that you think are pretty good

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and not the ones that you think are problematic.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So it could be a list of 2 character strings,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a list of tuples of numbers and strings,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a set that was similar to the list,

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or just a single big string.
