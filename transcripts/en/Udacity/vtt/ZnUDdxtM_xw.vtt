00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now how do you go about finding a solution if you don't have an algorithm for it?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Well, first of all, this edge here costs just 1, so we probably want to take that.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Then we have a lot of edges that just have a weight of 2,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.000
and, of course, they have been arranged in a way that is very beneficial for us here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
because we can actually put them all into the tree,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.000
and we almost have a spanning tree here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There's just one vertex missing, which we still need to connect to that tree here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the cheapest way to do that is to use this one edge down here, of course,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
using 4 instead of this one here which would use 6.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.500
So this is a minimum spanning tree for this graph, and this has a total weight of

00:00:37.500 --> 99:59:59.000
2+2+1+2+2+4, which is a total of 13.
