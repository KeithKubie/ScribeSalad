NANDAN NILEKANI &gt;&gt; Well, definitely I think
in today's economy and the kind of challenges

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.150
that we are facing and the-ah-ethical transgressions
that we are seeing around the world, clearly

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.820
there's a huge premium on trust. And, also
I think it's very important that business

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.150
leaders and corporate executives-ah-commit
themselves to a code of conduct which needs

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.661
to be articulated. And I believe that's a
very important part of ah-restoring trust

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:29.490
in-in business. Ah-I do believe that-ah-that
there are many, many very well-very articulately

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.539
run companies, and we must have a process
by which we-the markets and the regulations

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.969
punish those who don't follow the law and
don't follow ethics and reward those who do.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:41.289
Thank you.
