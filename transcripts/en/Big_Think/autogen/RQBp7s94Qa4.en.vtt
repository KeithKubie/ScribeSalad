something that emerges from brains when

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049
something that emerges from brains when
 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.320
something that emerges from brains when
brains get sufficiently big presumably

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330
brains get sufficiently big presumably
 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.069

as human brains have consciousness seems

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079
as human brains have consciousness seems
 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.030
to emerge as to what it is that's
philosophically a very difficult

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040
philosophically a very difficult
 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.339
philosophically a very difficult
question which biologists are no more

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349
question which biologists are no more
 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.530
question which biologists are no more
equipped to deal with them than anybody

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540
equipped to deal with them than anybody
 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.630
equipped to deal with them than anybody
else

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640
 
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.460
 
Oh nobody knows because we don't know

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470
Oh nobody knows because we don't know
 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.680
Oh nobody knows because we don't know
which animals are conscious we don't

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690
which animals are conscious we don't
 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.630
which animals are conscious we don't
actually technically even know that any

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
actually technically even know that any
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.760
actually technically even know that any
other human being is conscious but just

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770
other human being is conscious but just
 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.350
other human being is conscious but just
each of us know that we ourselves are

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
each of us know that we ourselves are
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.290
each of us know that we ourselves are
conscious we infer on pretty good

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
conscious we infer on pretty good
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.270
conscious we infer on pretty good
grounds that other people are conscious

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280
grounds that other people are conscious
 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.610
grounds that other people are conscious
and it's the same sort of grounds that

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620
and it's the same sort of grounds that
 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.380
and it's the same sort of grounds that
lead us to infer that probably

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390
lead us to infer that probably
 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.000
lead us to infer that probably
chimpanzees a conscience and probably

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010
chimpanzees a conscience and probably
 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.979
chimpanzees a conscience and probably
dogs are conscious but when we come to

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989
dogs are conscious but when we come to
 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.860
dogs are conscious but when we come to
something like earthworms and snails

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870
something like earthworms and snails
 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.030
something like earthworms and snails
it's anybody's guess

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040
 
 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.740
 
well that's a very difficult question

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750
well that's a very difficult question
 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.510
well that's a very difficult question
since we can't actually measure where

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
since we can't actually measure where
 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.520
since we can't actually measure where
the creatures are conscious so I guess

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530
the creatures are conscious so I guess
 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.260
the creatures are conscious so I guess
science has as much insight as any other

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
science has as much insight as any other
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.130
science has as much insight as any other
subject but I don't think I can answer

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140
subject but I don't think I can answer
 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.070
subject but I don't think I can answer
that question directly maybe computer

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080
that question directly maybe computer
 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.719
that question directly maybe computer
science has as much insight into it as

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729
science has as much insight into it as
 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.510
science has as much insight into it as
any other science
