MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
everybody for coming.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.570
I'm very pleased to
introduce Dr. James Robinson,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.170
a university professor at the
Harris School of Public Policy

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.107
at University of Chicago.

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:14.690
Prior to his work in Chicago,
he was a professor of government

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.379
at Harvard University.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.180
He's a distinguished scholar
of comparative economics

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.300
and political development
with a focus on the long run.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.420
His book "Why Nations
Fail" is a summary

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.795
of nearly 20 years of academic
research and publications.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.210
Its central theme is that
the economic fate of nations

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.337
is determined by
their institutions.

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:35.920
Today, when you look
around the world,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.586
there are enormous
differences in income

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:41.290
per capita, development
outcomes, life expectancy,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.820
education, and other measures
of human development.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.670
Professor Robinson
proposes a framework

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.035
for understanding
these differences.

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:49.660
And importantly, this
framework is also

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.730
used to examine
patterns of development

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.640
to better understand the
historical context of today's

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.310
inequality.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.985
So please join me in welcoming
Professor James Robinson.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.120
JAMES ROBINSON: OK,
thanks very much.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.230
So I'm gonna give a half
hour version of the book,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.260
"Why Nations Fail," and then I
think people can ask questions

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.330
and things like that.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.610
So there's lots of different
ways of talking about this.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.660
I'll introduce the
argument in the book.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.400
And in the book,
the first chapter

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.900
is about the long run history
of North America and South

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530
America, and why North
America ended up so different

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.720
from South America.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.980
But that takes a bit of time to
get into to do justice to it.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.820
So I find in a short
talk the easiest way

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.960
to explain everything
that the book is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440
about is to look
at this photograph

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.770
of the Korean
peninsula at night.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.734
And you can see quite a
few things about this.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.900
Because in South Korea,
there's lots of electricity,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.830
and light bulbs.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.160
And it's very bright.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.710
And North Korea is very dark.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.830
You can see a little spot
of light there in Pyongyang.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.930
It's probably the presidential
compound in Pyongyang.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.770
The previous president, he used
to have a big wave machine.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.580
So you probably need
a lot of electricity

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.834
to drive a wave
machine and light bulbs

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:09.750
to light you while you're
surfing or whatever.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.691
So anyway, so you can see that.

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.940
There's a lot of electricity
and light in South Korea,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.850
and not very much
in North Korea.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.180
And this is a very interesting
proxy for economic success.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.460
Most unsuccessful
countries in the world,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.110
economically, if
you look at them

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.940
at night, sub-Saharan
Africa, they're very black.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.180
There's a lot of electricity
and light bulbs in South Korea.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.120
North Korea has
the level of income

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.520
per capita prosperity of a
sub-Saharan African country.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.730
South Korea is one of the
most successful economies

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.050
in the world in the
last 40, 50 years.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.900
It's a member of the OECD.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.430
So what's the difference between
an economically successful

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.450
country, like South Korea, and
an economically unsuccessful

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.250
country, like North Korea?

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.870
So that's what
the book is about.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.860
The book is called
"Why Nations Fail."

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.080
Fail is an ambiguous
word, but it's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.470
really about comparative
economic development,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.080
and trying to propose a
simple way of thinking

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.650
about these differences.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.590
And you could be sitting
there thinking, well,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.160
we know the difference between
North Korea and South Korea.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860
North Korea is a
communist country,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.900
and South Korea is a
capitalist country.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.680
But that's not
the generalization

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.870
we make in the book.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.200
And I don't think it's a
very useful generalization,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.329
actually.

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.870
A country like North
Korea, though it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.990
might be avowedly
communist, actually has

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.210
a lot in common with nearly
every poor country that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.000
doesn't say it's communist or
doesn't claim to be communist.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.260
So that's not going to
be the distinction, OK?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.630
So what is the difference
between North Korea and South

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.130
Korea?

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.660
Well, South Korea has a
lot of technology, OK?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.790
So here you can see it
has electricity and light

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.610
bulbs, not very new technology,
but it has a lot of technology.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.340
And economists have
known since the work

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.310
of Robert Solow in
the 1950s that what

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.760
drives economic development
over the long run is innovation.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.270
So I don't need to say that
to people sitting in Google,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.770
I guess.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.720
It's all about innovation,
about new technologies,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.920
raising living standards,
raising productivity.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.120
So what Solow showed
is that that drove long

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.220
run economic development.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.844
And if you look around
the world today,

00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:19.500
and you say what's
the difference

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.570
in some kind of accounting
sense between poor countries

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.350
and rich countries, it's
that poor countries just

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.960
don't use all of
this technology that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.940
has such incredibly positive
consequences for living

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.440
standards and productivity.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.890
Like, they don't use electricity
and light bulbs in North Korea.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.391
OK?

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:37.890
So

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.780
Why is that?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.630
It's not something mysterious.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.660
I mentioned light
bulbs and electricity

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.830
being around a long time.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.830
It's not that Google
just invented it,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.410
and the North Koreans
haven't heard about it yet.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.740
So this has been around
for a long, long time,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.300
but somehow they
just don't use it.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.620
So why is that?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.900
Well, the book provides a simple
way of thinking about that.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.620
And going back to innovation
and technological change,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.650
what Robert Solow called
total factor productivity,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.460
makes you ask what drives
these differences between North

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.495
Korea and South Korea?

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:18.680
And that's got something
to do with the way

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.520
the economy is organized.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.110
So, yes, I said it's not about
socialism and capitalism,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.380
but it is about the way
these different countries are

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.182
organized.

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:29.890
What's interesting
about the Korean case,

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.630
of course, is that North Korea
and South Korea were pretty

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.760
similar 50, 60 years ago.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.280
So this divergence is
not some deep, long run

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.430
historical thing.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.740
It's something that
happened pretty recently.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.350
And the most obvious reason,
I think, why it happened

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.180
is that North and South
Korea got organized

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.200
in very different ways.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.650
The economy got organized
in very different ways.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.830
And in South Korea,
a society emerged

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.210
where there were incentives
and opportunities for people

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.660
who wanted to
innovate, who wanted

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.320
to create new technologies.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.850
And in North Korea, there
were neither incentives

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.030
nor opportunities
for anyone who wanted

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.140
to do anything like that.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.200
So I think the
communism-socialism captures

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.770
some idea about
opportunities and incentives,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.800
but the whole problem is
much different from that,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.470
and much more general than
communism versus capitalism.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.730
So big differences in
economic development,

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.040
big differences in
the use of technology,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.780
big differences in people's
incentives and opportunities.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.700
I'm gonna come back also to
the last layer of it, which

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.230
is gonna be, how come
North Korea and South

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.800
Korea got organized like that?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.340
How come in South Korea a
society got organized which

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.900
created incentives and
opportunities for people

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.330
to innovate and adopt technology
and North Korea didn't?

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.500
And that's also,
obviously, something

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.280
to do with the politics
of those societies.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.530
So in the book, the book is
about comparative economic

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.780
development.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.880
It says, there's
these layers of trying

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.210
to understand comparative
economic development.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.830
There's the economic
layer, innovation,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.440
technological change,
what induces that?

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.230
What creates very
different patterns

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.150
of that in different countries?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.160
But then lying behind that is a
deeper question in some sense,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.330
which is why is it that
some societies got organized

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.470
in a way that creates
incentives and opportunities,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.250
and other societies
didn't, or don't?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.750
So maybe I shouldn't show who
this gentleman is in Google,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.959
but I couldn't resist
the temptation.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.500
Let me give you
another example which

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.660
does come up in the first book.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.050
So I talked about it
in the first chapter.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.780
I talked about North
Korea, South Korea.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.404
Let me give you
another example we use,

00:07:39.404 --> 00:07:42.030
which has got us into a bit
of trouble, which is the two

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.200
richest men in the world.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.700
I know fortunes go up and down,
but they're usually up there

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.830
in the top three or four--
Bill Gates and Carlos

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.540
Slim in Mexico.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.440
So what we get you to think
about in the first chapter

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.120
of the book is it's very telling
to understand why the United

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.500
States is more economically
successful than Mexico,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.290
say, to think about how
Carlos Slim and Bill

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.260
Gates made their money.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.000
Bill Gates made his
money by innovating.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.910
This picture is
very significant.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.670
I'm gonna come back
to it in a second.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.900
Bill Gates made his
money by innovating.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.280
Carlos Slim made his
money with monopolies.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.010
Bill Gates, he made a
fortune, but he also

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.250
created a lot of wealth
for other people.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.530
He created lots of
positive externalities

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.880
in the computer industry.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.070
So he created a lot
more wealth than he

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.940
himself was able to grab.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.980
Carlos Slim,
according to the OECD,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.850
reduced GDP in Mexico
by about 2% a year.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.240
So this is a very conservative
kind of deadweight.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.610
For the economists in the room,
deadweight losses of monopoly

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.880
reduces the Mexican
GDP by about 2% a year.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.780
So he actually reduced GDP in
Mexico, according to the OECD,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.540
by more than his own fortune.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.000
So it's not just a matter of
taking wealth from Mexicans

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.110
and giving it to him.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.380
It's actually reducing
income in Mexico.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.480
So in the US, innovation,
you make a lot of money.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.200
It has all these spillovers.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.700
In Mexico, the way to make
money is not through innovation.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.230
The way to make money
is to get monopolies,

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.500
and that actually
makes you very rich,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.540
but it actually reduces the
prosperity of the society.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.720
So this is the United
States and Mexico,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.490
but I want you to think
this is really what goes on

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.440
in North Korea and South Korea.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.100
In both cases, you have
economies, some of which

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.040
are designed to create
incentives and opportunities

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.170
for innovation, but
other ones where you have

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.700
very different incentives,
very different opportunities,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.050
with very different
consequences for the economy.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.830
Now, I said Carlos
Slim was a monopolist

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.550
and Bill Gates was an innovator.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.790
But of course, this
is not about people.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.310
This is about systems.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.380
Bill Gates wanted to
be a monopolist too.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.990
Everyone wants to
be a monopolist.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.840
Professors want to be
intellectual monopolists.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.670
Google, heaven forbid,
they'd probably

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.310
like to be a monopolist too,
if they could get away with it.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.010
But this is Bill
Gates giving evidence

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.200
to the US antitrust authorities.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.590
This is, I swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.280
and nothing but the truth.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.000
So here politics starts
seeping in as well.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.610
So it's not just that there's
incentives and opportunities

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.590
in some places and
not in other places,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.400
but there's a
system, what we call

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.190
institutions in social science.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.700
There's a system of institutions
that creates and sustains

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.060
those incentives and
those opportunities.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.865
And that involves, in
this case, the state.

00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:44.260
It involves the implementation
of antitrust policy,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.750
and that's an old
story in the US.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.140
This is a contemporary
cartoon from early

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.840
in the last century, the octopus
of the Standard Oil Company.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.070
So the Standard Oil Company was
one of the big, famous trusts,

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.430
Rockefeller's trust.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.240
And here it is,
with its tentacles

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.790
around Congress and
the White House.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.000
And this was the robber
barons, the first age

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.220
of great monopolization
in the US economy

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.480
in the late 19th century.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.960
And what as the consequence
of the robber barons?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.120
The consequence was
the origin of antitrust

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.240
and indeed, the
Standard Oil Company

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.270
was broken up by US antitrust as
was Bell Telephones, et cetera,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.730
subsequently.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.290
So there's an old history of
fighting against monopolies

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.860
in the US, and sustaining an
institutional environment which

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.080
creates these incentives
and opportunities.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.432
So in the book, I'm
painting a dichotomy here.

00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:42.640
The world's more complicated.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.480
There's lots of
nuances and gray areas.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.630
But just for the
sake of the argument,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:52.140
it's helpful to think of two
different types of societies,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.670
societies where somehow
things get organized,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.610
institutions get
organized in a way

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.130
which creates these
incentives and opportunities.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.400
That creates innovation.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.850
It creates prosperity.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.120
And there's other places
where things work differently.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.320
Maybe it's Mexico.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.460
Maybe it's North Korea.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.430
Maybe it's the
Democratic Republic

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.434
of the Congo, where I
do a lot of research.

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.350
Part of the story with
electricity, of course,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.820
is it's not just the
private sector or innovation

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.950
in the private sector,
but the public sector

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.410
has to be incentivized
to provide

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.850
basic public goods, like roads.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.550
So this is what they call
interstate number one.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.240
This is one of the main highways
in the Democratic Republic

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.824
of Congo.

00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:36.240
Now, the government
doesn't bother

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.080
providing any infrastructure.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.330
You can see what this is like.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.490
This is the dry season.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.250
You have to dig yourself
out every kilometer or so.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.150
If it was the wet season, you
wouldn't be going anywhere.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.780
So this is an even
more dramatic failure

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.890
in terms of provision of basic
public goods and services

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.610
than you'd find in North Korea.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.130
So we put some labels on these
different economic systems.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.450
We say, what is it that South
Korea and the United States

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.370
has in common with
other prosperous places?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.620
It has these economic
institutions,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.680
rules that incentivize people,
and create opportunities.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.340
And we call them inclusive.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.700
So we say if you think about
the economy, what's common

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.350
in these places
is that they have

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.100
inclusive economic institutions.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.110
So why this word inclusive?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.810
So let me go back
to the light bulb.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.790
So here's Edison's patent
for the light bulb.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.220
So I have one thing in
common with Thomas Edison.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.910
He had very bad hearing.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.320
He had very bad hearing as well.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.850
So that's probably
the only thing

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.100
I have in common
with Thomas Edison.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.340
So Edison patented the
light bulb in 1880.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.050
Now, patents are very
interesting things.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:52.810
Patents are very
closely connected

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.890
to incentivizing innovation.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:56.350
Patents have a long history.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.940
Patents were in the
US Constitution.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.450
The first patent
board met in 1790.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.420
It was so important that
Thomas Jefferson was on it.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.910
So what was so important
about the patents

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.950
and giving out
patents and stuff?

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.740
Well, it was about creating
incentives for innovation.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.110
Innovation creates
positive externalities.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.720
So any person thinking
about innovating

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.490
is never gonna benefit
from all the wealth

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.900
that they create because
of these externalities.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.060
So the idea here was, patents
bring the private return

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.910
to innovation closer
to the social return.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.730
Now, what's
particularly interesting

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.300
about patents is if you study
who took out patents in the US,

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.730
historically, like who was
it that took out patents?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.690
And what's interesting about the
social background of patentees

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.330
is that they come from all
over the social spectrum.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.900
So I don't know if people
have an analysis of who

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.550
works for Google, but
economic historians

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.720
did an analysis of 19th
century patenting in the US.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.870
And what they showed was,
who took out patents?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.800
Artisans, farmers,
elites, non-elites,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.420
professional people,
uneducated people.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.010
Thomas Edison hardly had
any formal schooling.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.580
He was basically home
schooled by his mother.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.150
I'm not advocating
lack of schooling

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.910
as a strategy for
innovation, but I'm just

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.970
saying talent,
ideas, creativity,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.850
that's spread out very
broadly in society.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.920
You don't know where that is.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.830
So you need to create a
system which can harness

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.250
all of that latent talent.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.710
And this was part of the system.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.050
And why the word inclusive?

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.900
Well, because you need to
include everybody in this.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.164
Patenting, it didn't
matter who you were.

00:15:39.164 --> 00:15:40.330
You could take out a patent.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.180
You paid a fee, and the
state enforced your patent.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.780
The government
enforced your patent

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.360
like the government
enforced antitrust.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.380
This inspired this word
inclusive in the research

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.530
we do, but that's
the economics of it.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.030
If you want to have innovation,
you want to have prosperity,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.820
you need to have these
inclusive economic institutions.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.070
What's the opposite of that?

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.620
Well, extractive
economic institutions.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.500
That's what they
have in North Korea,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.133
or that's what they
have in Mexico.

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:12.716
You could say, North
Korea and Mexico,

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:14.632
those place are really
different, aren't they?

00:16:14.632 --> 00:16:15.760
Well, yeah, they are.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.140
But what one thing we do
in the book is to say,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.610
if you look at poor
countries in the world today,

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.230
they look terribly different.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.230
Uzbekistan, North
Korea, Sierra Leone,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.840
Columbia, what do those
places have in common?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.950
All the details look
different, but this idea

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.580
of extractive institutions
or inclusive institutions

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.510
is supposed to say, yes,
all these details look very

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.540
different, but actually, from
the economic point of view,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.820
they all have this
consequence of blocking

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.940
talent and creativity.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.760
So that's the economics of it.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.100
But what's more
interesting, I think,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.160
and more innovative, at least
academically, is to say,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.000
but you need to get beyond that.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.306
We need to ask why
was it that in the US

00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:03.680
they were so obsessed with
setting up this patent system?

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.680
Or, why was it they
created a state

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.089
that was able to enforce
antitrust, and drag the richest

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.910
man in the world into a court?

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:17.079
Why was it that the US created
such a political society,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.380
or such a set of
political institutions?

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.990
So we emphasize,
again, something

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.050
which is obvious from
the Korean example, which

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.849
is lying behind these
different economic systems

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.680
are different political
systems somehow.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.900
So what creates inclusive
economic institutions

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.700
are inclusive
political institutions.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.080
And what creates extracting
economic institutions

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.770
are extractive
political institutions.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.650
So we emphasize two dimensions
of political institutions,

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.167
both of which will come up in--
I was gonna say the discussion,

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:51.250
but it's not a discussion.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.160
It's more like a pontification.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.260
So why was it?

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.660
What does it take?

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.660
I'm asking what does it take
to create an inclusive economy?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.240
What does it take to create
a patent system which

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.590
is open to everybody
on the same terms,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.980
with a state which can
come along and enforce

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.480
that system once it's set up?

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.300
Well, we emphasize two
dimensions of that, one,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.430
which is really something
like state capacity,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.540
or we call it political
centralization, which

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.690
is that what happened in
the United States was,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.830
they created a state,
a model state, which

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.220
was able to enforce rules.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.920
So this is a crucial
part of having

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.320
inclusive economic institutions.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.460
A problem in the
Congo, for example,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.010
is the Congo doesn't have
a state, which is actually

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.291
capable of raising resources
or enforcing rules.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.290
The state doesn't exist.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.840
The state is so corrupt and
patrimonial and ineffective,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.240
so that's part of the story.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.160
The other thing we emphasize
is that political power

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.320
has to be broadly
distributed in society.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.910
So the reason that the
patent system got set up

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.390
the way it did in
the United States

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.370
is because the
United States in 1790

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.530
wasn't the modern democracy in
the way political scientists

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.720
would describe it.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.250
But it was a situation
where political power

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.030
was very broadly based
in society, at least

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.940
amongst adult males.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.870
So power was too
broadly distributed

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.960
to create some
oligarchic patent system.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.410
So these are the two elements
of inclusive political

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.520
institutions.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.220
So when those things fail, when
you either have a weak state

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.620
or you lack a state, or
political power is narrowly

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.840
concentrated, that's
a situation where

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.570
we say you have extractive
political institutions.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.670
So here's an example
of extractive political

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.270
institutions.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.590
It's a fun example.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.020
President Mugabe, who's
been President of Zimbabwe

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.800
since 1980, you might know he's
a very successful politician.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.380
He's also a very lucky man.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.400
He won the lottery here.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.220
So that's impressive.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.100
He's the President, and
he wins the lottery.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.600
So here's a situation
where there's

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.160
a very narrow concentration
of political power.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.830
There's a lack of
accountability.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.400
That's not a
circumstance in which

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.270
you're gonna get inclusive
economic institutions.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.160
So if you were gonna put the
whole thesis in a matrix--

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.060
they wouldn't let us
put this in the book.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.250
This was too complicated.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:30.750
No, no.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.220
You can't put that in the book.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.800
But it's very useful
when you give talks.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.690
Again, this dichotomy
is very simplistic,

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.180
and I'm happy to
talk about nuance.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.580
But the idea is to say,
think about the matrix.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.790
Then poor countries,
where are poor countries?

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.840
Poor countries are in
this cell of the matrix

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.130
here, with extractive
economic institutions

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.990
underpinned by extractive
political institutions.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.920
Economically
successful countries

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.400
are in the cell of
the matrix where

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.980
there's inclusive
economic institutions.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.280
That drives innovation,
drives growth.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.100
But they have to be underpinned
by inclusive political

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.970
institutions.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.990
So what about the off diagonals?

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.840
Well, what we say
about the off diagonals

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.450
is that the off
diagonals are unstable.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.610
We emphasize a lot of
the sort of stability

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.430
of extractive-extractive
and the stability

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.400
of inclusive-inclusive.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.230
There's lots of feedback
loops, that once you

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.750
get an extractive
society set up,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.840
it tends to persist over time.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.320
And once you get an
inclusive society set up,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.760
that tends to persist
over time as well.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.660
So those states are
pretty persistent.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.520
But the off diagonals
are unstable.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.010
For example, you think about a
transition from an extractive

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.880
to a more inclusive
society, South Africa.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.090
In 1994, South Africa moved
to a much more inclusive

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.550
political society.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.750
Black people got to vote,
instead of just white people,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.080
and Nelson Mandela
was elected president.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.220
So that's like going
from a situation where

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.700
you had extractive political
institutions to inclusive

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.210
political institutions.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.430
Now, what did the
economy in South Africa

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.030
look like before then?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.900
Well, it was something
called Apartheid.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.660
And Apartheid was
a massive system

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.560
to benefit white people at
the expense of Africans.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.570
There was a labor
market in Apartheid,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.270
and the labor market essentially
massively discriminated

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.140
against black people in
favor of white people.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.730
Until the early 1980s, there was
something called the color bar,

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.097
and the color bar was a
huge list of occupations

00:22:36.097 --> 00:22:38.430
that only white people could
undertake that black people

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.340
couldn't undertake.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.930
But the point is,
imagine you transition

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.200
from extractive
political institutions

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.700
to inclusive political
institutions,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.230
like they did after 1994.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.530
You've got this
extractive economy.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.230
Those two things can't coexist.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.400
You can't have an economy which
is extractive and discriminates

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.900
against black people, when
suddenly black people have

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.990
political power.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.980
So then extractive economy
crumbles, and then you

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.404
move in that direction.

00:23:07.404 --> 00:23:08.820
It's a little bit
more complicated

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.460
than that in South Africa,
but that's the idea.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.540
So what about the
other off diagonal?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.580
Well, you could think
of China, for example.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.700
How does China fit
into this theory?

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.800
Well, in the 1970s,
China was here.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.192
It had extractive
economic institutions.

00:23:25.192 --> 00:23:26.900
It had extractive
political institutions.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.860
It was a poor, technologically
backward place.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.510
Starting in 1978, they started
moving economic institutions

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.490
in a more inclusive direction.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.970
So the whole way you'd think
about Chinese economic growth

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.860
in the context of
this theory would

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.790
be, Chinese economic
growth is exactly

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.370
induced by this movement
towards more inclusive

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.440
economic institutions.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.540
So the whole deregulation
of agriculture,

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.450
the household
responsibility system,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.839
that was about creating
incentives in agriculture.

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:58.880
What was the consequence?

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.240
Massive increase in
agricultural productivity.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.420
That spread to the industrial
sector in the 1980s.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.820
But what does the theory say?

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.760
The theory says,
the Chinese moved

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.790
from having extractive
to inclusive

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.780
economic institutions.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.880
They didn't move the same
way South Africa did.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.740
They moved in this
direction, but they

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.850
maintained their extractive
political institutions.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.410
So we say, well,
that can't happen.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.930
You can't have an
inclusive economy

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.682
underpinned by extractive
political institutions.

00:24:27.682 --> 00:24:29.140
And what we tried
to do in the book

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.300
is to give lots of
historical examples

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.150
to suggest that narrowly
concentrated political power

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.610
always ends up getting abused
at the expense of the economy.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.850
So fundamentally
underpinning things

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.860
like the rule of
law or something

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.690
like a patent system
which is open to everybody

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.430
on the same terms, that's
got to be underpinned

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.280
by inclusive political
institutions.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.970
Otherwise, it can't last.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.330
So that's the basic idea.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.920
And then we used
this matrix-- we

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.170
don't have the matrix in the
book-- we used the matrix

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.000
to basically talk
about what does it

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.430
take to transition from
an extractive society

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.040
to an inclusive society?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.936
So there's no one
way of doing it.

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:13.810
If you look at different
cases, historically,

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.960
different societies have
moved from extractive

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.730
to inclusive in different ways.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.860
But I guess we do emphasize
very much the politics of this,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.300
that this way of thinking
suggests that poverty is really

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.480
a political problem.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.100
It's not an engineering,
technical problem.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.210
The problem in
Congo or North Korea

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.570
is not that people
don't know that if they

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.540
used all this wonderful
technology, et cetera,

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.870
they'd be much richer.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.890
It's that the way
things are organized

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.830
doesn't create
incentives for people

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.440
to use that technology
or opportunity.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.930
There's no incentive to be a
businessman in North Korea.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.230
You can't be a businessman
because businessmen are just

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.330
not tolerated.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.680
In the Congo, you
could be a businessman,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.670
but if you became
a businessman, you

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.675
might get predated
on by the state

00:26:00.675 --> 00:26:02.450
or predated on by other people.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.680
The state doesn't provide
any complementary inputs

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.790
or public goods.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.930
The money gets stolen by the
politicians such as it is.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.690
So there's just many elements
of extractive economic and

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.780
political institutions, which
means if you're in the Congo,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.930
you just can't make money
as a businessperson.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.920
There's just no
way you can do it

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.220
in that institutional
environment.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.830
So how do you
solve that problem?

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.330
Our perspective is, sure
there are cases where somebody

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.240
has come along and said,
like Deng Xiaoping,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.710
let's move the economy.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.510
Let's move the economy
in this direction,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.000
and stuff is going to happen.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.420
And there are examples of that.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.110
But what we try to
argue in the book

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.260
is that the more
enduring path to having

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.950
a really consolidated,
inclusive society,

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.980
and prosperous society, is
that political change precedes

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.200
economic change.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.550
So the story in the
British case, for example,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.350
historically in Britain,
is very much like the story

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:06.040
I gave in South Africa, which
is that political transition,

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.740
political institutions
became much more inclusive,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.560
and that drove
much more inclusion

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.350
in the economic sphere.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.780
So if you are asking,
how do I think

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.870
about solving the economic
problems of a poor country

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.150
like Colombia or the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, I'd say

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.090
you have to focus
on the politics.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.610
You have to think about trying
to make political institutions

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.470
more inclusive.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.450
Of course, that's a
difficult thing to do,

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.980
because there's a good reason
why political institutions are

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.200
extractive.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.680
States tend to be dysfunctional
in poor countries,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.190
because states are used
as a way of organizing

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.310
power and authority.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.510
And obviously, narrowly
based political power

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.400
is not given away,
usually for a good reason.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.360
In the case of South
Africa, why was it

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.060
South Africa became much
more democratic in 1994?

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.270
That was not because
white people woke up one

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.565
day and said, oh my
god, this is terrible.

00:28:01.565 --> 00:28:03.940
We've been discriminating
against all these black people.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.770
It's shocking.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.580
We've got to do
something about it.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.770
They gave away political power,
because they were forced to,

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.520
and because the whole white
society in South Africa

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.320
became unsustainable because
of international pressure,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.390
because of domestic
mobilization by black people.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.030
So we emphasize a
lot of conflict.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.500
There's a lot of conflict
over institutions.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.290
And typically, transition
from extractive to inclusive

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.980
institutions involves
a lot of conflict.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.320
So this is a theory of the world
where poor countries are poor,

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.760
but there's a lot of people who
have interest in that system.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.224
In North Korea, there's a
personalized dictatorship.

00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:42.640
It's the Communist
Party, but it's

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.720
very personalized
as well, which has

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.530
a big interest in that
system, and can't see

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.170
how it could be running a
different type of society.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.070
And that's true in most
poor countries as well.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.370
So there's a lot
of interest in it,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.090
and that's the thing which makes
a transition from extractive

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.230
to inclusive a difficult
problem to solve,

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.160
because it's fundamentally
a political problem, not

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.020
an economic problem.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.950
It's not a matter of
hiring better economists

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.770
from the University of
Chicago or Harvard University

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.410
to come up with some
clever solution.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.500
There's fundamental political
conflicts in society

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.490
that have to be resolved
or overcome in order

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:28.090
to reorganize the economy
to make it more prosperous.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:35.090
AUDIENCE: How do you go from
extractive both political and

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.994
economic institutions?

00:29:37.994 --> 00:29:39.910
I get the sense you can't
just do it stepwise.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.330
You can't start with the
political institutions becoming

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.130
inclusive, and then
economic just follows suit.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.790
I mean, presumably it has to
happen simultaneously, right?

00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:52.830
You're gonna change
some institutions,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.040
and then you bring in
foreign investment,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.550
or there's domestic
innovation, and then

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.290
you start to change
other institutions.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.030
There's a feedback
loop, or is it

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.470
just everything happens
at once politically,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.115
and then the economics follows?

00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:07.990
JAMES ROBINSON: I'm not
sure anything happens

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:12.480
that quickly, but I think
that we emphasize very much

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.310
this idea that if
you can move to more

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.390
inclusive political
institutions,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.460
then the economy will tend
to naturally sort itself out.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.400
So you could
imagine that there's

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.340
feedback from the economy
to political institutions.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.330
But I guess our academic
researchers has always

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.590
led us to be very
skeptical about that.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.140
So for example, one of
the reasons we emphasize

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.270
that in the bottom the bottom
left cell of the matrix, where

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.220
you move to a more inclusive
economy but politics

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.770
stays extractive,
you could say, well,

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.660
moving to an inclusive
economy, doesn't that

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.100
naturally tend to push
more political inclusion?

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.100
But I do think that's
actually true in the data.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.360
So that's something that
political scientists called

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.470
the modernization
hypothesis, this idea

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.929
that economic development
tends to promote democracy,

00:31:00.929 --> 00:31:02.720
or it tends to promote
political inclusion.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.110
But that's actually
not true in the data.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.970
We did a lot of
research on this.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.350
If you look in the
postwar period or even

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.710
the longer period
of time, there's

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.010
no tendency for countries
which grow faster

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.034
to become more democratic.

00:31:17.034 --> 00:31:17.950
We just plot the data.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.620
It's just a cloud.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.320
So we we're very skeptical about
this idea of modernization.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.440
We don't think there's
any natural tendency

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.542
for economic
development on its own

00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:30.250
to promote political
inclusion, so that's

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.370
why I guess we don't emphasize
the feedback that you're

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.460
talking about, and
why we emphasize

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.910
these political dynamics.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.390
What we do emphasize a lot is
that political change, what

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.740
looks like political
change, doesn't necessarily

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.360
lead to a more inclusive
political society.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.420
So we use this terminology
from sociology.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.520
We call it the Iron
Law of Oligarchy,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.530
which is this idea that there
may be political change,

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.830
but political change is
usually just one elite

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.220
replacing another elite.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.060
Think about Egypt.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.660
Think about the Arab
Spring in Egypt.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.410
What did that do?

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.050
Nothing.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.440
It just led to a
rotation of elites,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.180
but the whole system
basically stayed the same.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.040
So think about Latin America.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.795
Latin America, it's like the
continent of revolutions,

00:32:14.795 --> 00:32:17.759
but revolutions
just tend to rotate

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:19.300
who's running the
country rather than

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.770
lead to fundamental
institutional change.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.360
So we talk a lot about
that type of change,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.342
and what sort of things
precipitate real change

00:32:31.342 --> 00:32:33.050
to more inclusive
political institutions.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.530
But we don't emphasize
the feedback you're

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.752
discussing for that reason.

00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:38.460
AUDIENCE: Are there
examples of countries

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.750
that have escaped
from the lower right?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.860
And is a country always the
right level of a generality?

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.770
Is it sometimes
a smaller portion

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:52.130
of a country or a larger region?

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.150
JAMES ROBINSON: Yeah,
so that's a good point.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.737
So the country may
not necessarily

00:32:55.737 --> 00:32:56.820
be the right focus at all.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.400
So in the book,
we talk about lots

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.249
of different sub-regional cases,
like in the US, for example.

00:33:03.249 --> 00:33:05.040
I mean, there's a huge
variation in the US.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.530
Think about the US South.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.520
So we talk about the US
South, and why was it

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.872
the US South was much
poorer, historically,

00:33:11.872 --> 00:33:13.080
than the rest of the country?

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.280
Why did it stay poor
until the 1950s?

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.590
And that's because of
extractive institutions.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.020
And then those extractive
institutions disintegrated.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.569
But probably thinking about
sub-national variations

00:33:23.569 --> 00:33:25.860
is very important for thinking
about how stuff changes.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.850
Because often you can imagine
that some stuff changes.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.250
Like if you think about Brazil
in some sense, parts of Brazil

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.420
changed a lot at a very
local level, Porto Alegre,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.460
and then those things scaled
up to a national level,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.660
and people took the model
that worked in Porto Alegre,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.910
and then they tried to
expand it in other places.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.900
So I think thinking about
sub-national variations

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.820
is interesting
intellectually, but also

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.580
maybe in understanding
transitions it's important,

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.950
because sometimes things
start in a much smaller way,

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.790
and then they spread
through learning,

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.350
or some sort of diffusion.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.890
So I think you're
right about that.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.754
The country is not necessary
the right level to look at.

00:34:03.754 --> 00:34:05.170
And in the book,
we certainly talk

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.770
about lots of examples of
sub-national variation.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.219
It's just that a lot of
the debate in economics

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.909
tends to take place at
this national level,

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:20.440
even though both
things are interesting.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.280
AUDIENCE: So considering
China for a second,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.920
you mentioned how there's
this economic inclusiveness

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.178
with political-- what was it?

00:34:30.178 --> 00:34:31.469
JAMES ROBINSON: Extractiveness.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.960
AUDIENCE: Extractiveness,
so that makes sense.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.359
You have these entrepreneurs
who have made large companies,

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:38.900
have made huge
fortunes, and then you

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.900
have journalists
who get prosecuted

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.290
for commenting on the stock
market or something like that.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.960
So it seems like
you have innovation

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.449
in the private sector,
like building companies,

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:58.680
whereas there's stagnation
imposed by the government.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.690
So to what extent do you
think that innovation

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.590
in one of those areas is
dependent on the other?

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.600
If one is being
suppressed, whereas one

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.480
seems to be performing better?

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.200
JAMES ROBINSON: I mean, I would
say China's been so successful,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.800
because it's able to
borrow or appropriate ideas

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.660
and technologies, which
were created somewhere else.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.690
In the 1970s, it was
just extremely backwards,

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.250
and it's been very
successful at just

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.950
borrowing all of these things.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.100
It's much more difficult
to actually create

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.840
innovation yourself than to
borrow it from somewhere else.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.030
So I guess I would say this
impulse of the Communist Party

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:50.900
to suffocate anything that
looks vaguely threatening

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.160
to it politically
is fundamentally

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.610
inconsistent with having the
kind of innovation in society.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.630
That would be my perspective.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.920
So they're much more
interested in keeping control.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.900
So information is dangerous,
and people talking is dangerous,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.850
and whatever.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.080
And you want to suppress that.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.990
I don't see how that's
consistent with having

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.920
an innovative society.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:21.710
So I think the model they
have only works at some point.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.210
I mean, China's so large, it's
easy to sit there and think,

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.740
oh, that can't be right,
because it's so large,

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.906
and it's just so impressive.

00:36:31.906 --> 00:36:34.750
But in the book, we use the
example of the Soviet Union.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.760
Some people here are
probably as old as I am.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.120
I mean, when I was an
undergraduate in England,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.330
we learned that the one really
big economic success story

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.054
of the century was
the Soviet Union.

00:36:46.054 --> 00:36:48.470
If you wanted to have rapid
economic growth-- I'm serious.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.080
This is the early 1980s.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.810
I'm serious.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.960
If you want to have
rapid economic growth,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.970
you have an economy organized
like the Soviet Union.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:59.730
Now, you're a young guy, so
you'd laugh at that idea now,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.500
but it was actually enshrined
in every economics textbook

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.250
up until the late 1980s.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.310
In Paul Samuelson's
economic textbook,

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.490
there was a graph
showing when the Soviet

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.750
Union was gonna overtake the
US in terms of GDP per capita.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.252
It started in the
late 1950s, and then

00:37:18.252 --> 00:37:20.460
when they rewrote the book,
every subsequent addition

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.960
it would move five
years to the right.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.630
So it was 1975, then
it was '80, then

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.680
it was '85, that it was '90.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.320
And then that graph
disappeared from the book.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.869
And then 10 years
later, it came back

00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:33.535
with the Soviet Union
replaced by China.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.580
So I think there's lots of
differences between China

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.200
and the Soviet Union.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.690
The Soviet Union
never got to export,

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.705
and exporting is a good
constraint on quality

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:47.580
and things like that.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.510
So the Chinese have done
stuff that the Soviets

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.810
didn't manage to do.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.629
But it's worth reminding
ourselves that for 40 years,

00:37:56.629 --> 00:37:58.670
everyone was completely
convinced that the Soviet

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.970
Union had this wonderful
model of economic development

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.616
and success.

00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:04.740
And everyone was convinced.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.810
The CIA was convinced.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:09.530
The Soviet Union, the Soviet
leadership was convinced.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.860
So we use that example
not because it looks just

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.780
like China, but just to
say as a reality check.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.740
because China is so big, and
it's been growing so rapidly,

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.060
so this theory can't be right.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.860
Of course, the
theory at this level

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.920
is way too vague and
imprecise to actually make

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.720
some sort of prediction about--
I wouldn't be stupid enough

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.390
to make some predictions about
when things will go wrong

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.010
in China.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.240
And if you think
about the Arab Spring,

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.230
it's terribly difficult
to predict when

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.450
these things will collapse.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.770
When I was a graduate student,
I had all these friends

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:45.250
who were sovietologists, who
were in their late 20s, who

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.900
were planning a long academic
career studying the Soviet

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.400
Union.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.733
And then suddenly the Soviet
Union didn't exist anymore.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:59.490
So academics are very bad at
predicting stuff like that.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.660
So that's my point
about innovation.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.760
It just seems to
me that the thing

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.920
that the Communist Party
are really interested in

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.400
is keeping power.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.870
And eventually,
that's going to run

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:20.640
into what you need to do to
have economic prosperity.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.776
And I think this issue of
innovation is the crux of it.

00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:26.150
I don't know what's
gonna happen,

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.840
whether China will just
converge to some level of income

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:37.870
per capita and stay there,
but that's beyond my--

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.880
AUDIENCE: I'd also like to
ask about China, but not China

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.150
today, but about ancient China.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.600
Because I believe that up until
the Industrial Revolution,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.720
China one might say was
the technologically most

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.290
advanced place in the world.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.460
And the innovation also didn't
come from somewhere else,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.440
right?

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.050
But at the same time,
China has always

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:11.550
been a place with an emperor.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:17.410
It's not a democratic system
since maybe 4,000 years ago.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:23.210
And so there seems to be a
disagreement there as well.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.390
And I wonder how does
that fit into your theory.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.580
JAMES ROBINSON:
Yeah, so one thing

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.130
that's interesting
about China, one reason

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.550
why China's able
to do what it does

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:39.410
is that they are able
to tap into this very

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:44.830
long history of centralized
authority in China.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.850
As I said, I work
in the DRC a lot,

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:51.890
and I got to know the
prime minister in the DRC.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:56.230
And he keeps on asking me,
what about the Chinese model?

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.757
Couldn't we be using the
Chinese model in the DRC?

00:40:58.757 --> 00:41:00.840
And then I said, why don't
you just get the people

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.714
from the Chinese embassy
to come and tell you

00:41:02.714 --> 00:41:03.600
what that model is?

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.590
And he says oh, they won't.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.839
They just want to do business.

00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:07.340
They won't talk about ideas.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.100
But you tell me.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.040
And I said, well,
here's what they did

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.430
in 1978 in the rural sector.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.470
They reorganized
property rights.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.940
They did all of this stuff.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.930
If you wanted to do that in
Congo, could you do that?

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.682
He said, no.

00:41:22.682 --> 00:41:23.640
No, of course we can't.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.515
How could we do that?

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:25.490
We don't have that.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.850
We could pass a law, but
no one would do anything.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.060
So there's this element
in China that there

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.090
is this history of
state centralization,

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.890
a system of authority,
bureaucracy,

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.650
that can actually move
society in a particular way

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.930
if it wants to.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.860
But I think the
example you give shows

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.210
the limitation of this model.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.940
The consensus amongst
historians, as I understand it,

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:53.160
is that the reason that all this
innovation went into reverse

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.900
after the Song Period in China
is because the state decided

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.740
it was too destabilizing.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.380
They banned
interoceanic shipping.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.860
There was a regress
in favor of stability

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.490
rather than innovation.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.520
There are historians
who disagree with that,

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.360
but one of the standard
explanations for why China

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.160
was so technologically advanced
but then went into reverse

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.700
is that the state turned
against innovation,

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.230
and it turned against mercantile
trade, and other things.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.710
It moved everybody
from the coast.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.710
It preferred political
stability rather than

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:30.930
having a more
innovative society.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.660
So that example would be
consistent with this idea

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.580
that the same thing
is going to happen.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.320
But I do think it's interesting.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.070
Why is it that you have all
this economic development

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.284
in East Asia that you don't
see in sub-Saharan Africa

00:42:44.284 --> 00:42:45.450
or other parts of the world?

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.866
I think that does
have a lot to do

00:42:46.866 --> 00:42:49.320
with the nature of the
state, that South Korea had

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.970
a history, again, of
bureaucracy and state authority

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.500
that allows it to do
stuff that you could never

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.230
achieve in the Congo or
some African country.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.230
AUDIENCE: Which would you
say has a better track

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.275
record among developing
nations, democracy

00:43:03.275 --> 00:43:04.660
or authoritarian government?

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.440
Because there are plenty of
examples of young democracies

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.400
that do poorly, and
authoritarian governments,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.974
like Singapore,
China, and Russia

00:43:10.974 --> 00:43:13.390
for the last 10 years that
have led to substantial growth.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.848
JAMES ROBINSON:
Well, what the data

00:43:14.848 --> 00:43:17.740
says is that, on average,
democracies grow faster.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.560
In the postwar period,
democracies on average

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.500
grow faster than dictatorships.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.930
So that's the data says.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:27.670
You could say there's a lot
of heterogeneity in the data,

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.570
meaning there are some
sorts of dictatorships

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:34.620
that do better than democracies,
or some types of democracies.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.920
But I think Russia is
doing well, because it

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.560
has lots of natural resources.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.310
I don't think there's
any other reason why

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.910
Russia is doing well.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.160
I think there are these
examples from East

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.090
Asia of successful so-called
developmental dictatorships,

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.200
but I think that has a lot to
do with what I'm talking about.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.690
If you look at Africa,
for example, and you say,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.020
what are the parts of Africa
that are doing well today?

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.930
That's Rwanda.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:02.680
Why is that?

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.460
Because Rwanda is more
or less the one country

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:10.530
in sub-Saharan Africa where
a very bureaucratized,

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:15.280
pre-colonial state emerged
as a post-colonial nation.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.790
So if you've been to Rwanda,
anyone's been to Rwanda,

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.800
people obey the rules in Rwanda.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.100
People don't cross except when
the little person is green.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.890
It's not like a normal
African country.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.905
It's a place with a lot
of centralized authority,

00:44:28.905 --> 00:44:31.360
and it has been for a long time.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.040
So that, to me, is like
an East Asian country.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.020
The government in
Rwanda is able to tap

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.770
into this history of political
centralization and authority,

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.770
which is part of what you need
to have economic development.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.820
But they don't have
the other part.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.050
They don't have the
pluralistic part.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.050
it's a very militarized,
autocratic version

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.040
of development.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.700
So I would say that's
not a sustainable

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.750
model of development.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:57.340
So I think if you
look in the data,

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.830
you can find examples
of dictatorships

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:03.830
that do well economically,
at least for some periods.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.950
And that's because
they're in places

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:09.460
where you have some history of
centralization of authority.

00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:17.060
But what I'm saying here is
that's not a sustainable model.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.980
The Singaporean case, that's
a very anomalous case.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:24.061
Most dictatorships don't
look like Singapore.

00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:25.060
Why emphasize Singapore?

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.080
Why not emphasize
the Philippines?

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.580
Why not emphasize Japan?

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.600
Japan was really economically
successful after the Second

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.910
World War when it became
much more inclusive.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:38.160
So there's a lot of
heterogeneity within East Asia.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.300
And I would say the
balance of the evidence

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.410
suggests that in
some circumstances,

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.310
you can have rapid growth
under dictatorial regimes,

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.230
but it's in very
specific circumstances,

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.760
and it doesn't last.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.020
Well, in the Singaporean
case, it did,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.700
but that's constructing a theory
from the [? error ?] term,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.926
it seems to me.

00:45:56.926 --> 00:45:59.050
AUDIENCE: Many of the
institutions you talked about

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:03.380
as being important for the
inclusivity in the United

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.947
States seem to be weakening.

00:46:05.947 --> 00:46:07.780
Like, it's very expensive
now to participate

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.020
in the patent system, both
to file and to defend.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.430
The government doesn't
seem to get involved

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.721
in defending patents very much.

00:46:16.297 --> 00:46:18.130
There were no penalties
imposed on Microsoft

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.814
for acting in a
monopolistic fashion,

00:46:19.814 --> 00:46:21.230
and then you have
other monopolies

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:25.015
like broadband monopolies
that remain well protected.

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:25.890
JAMES ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.400
AUDIENCE: Is there much research
on societies that transition

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.291
from an inclusive to
an extractive state?

00:46:32.291 --> 00:46:32.790
So

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.160
JAMES ROBINSON: We talk
a little bit about that

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.790
historically in the book.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.180
We give this example of Venice.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.580
Venice was probably the
most prosperous part-- maybe

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.977
it wasn't as
innovative as China,

00:46:41.977 --> 00:46:43.810
but at least it was the
most prosperous part

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.610
of Europe in the Middle Ages.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.910
And then Venice became
this economic backwater,

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.380
exactly because of
its institutions.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.590
Basically, it lost all
this inclusiveness.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.380
It put it all into reverse.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.380
So I think in the
book, we emphasize

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.090
that in any inclusive society,
that's always incentives

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.390
to make stuff more extractive.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.020
if you can get away
with it, there's

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.686
always going to be
incentives for people

00:47:07.686 --> 00:47:10.090
to do that-- set up
monopolies, to make connections

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:10.880
and politicians.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.180
And that's what Rockefeller,
and Vanderbilt, and all

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.010
these characters
were trying to do.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.990
But as we just emphasize
there's feedback.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.530
In an inclusive society,
there's feedback

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.400
which tends to stop that.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.240
In the US, there's
a lot of concern

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:30.950
about whether things are
working much less well than they

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:31.851
used to in the past.

00:47:31.851 --> 00:47:33.850
There's very interesting
research at the moment,

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:41.350
actually, by some guys at
Michigan about big investment

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:41.850
funds.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:45.530
The investment funds buy up
shares and lots of different--

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.090
and there's a study
of investment funds,

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:52.180
like BlackRock, who bought
up lots of airline companies,

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.650
showing that when they
started investing in airlines,

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:59.070
multiple airlines, the
airline prices all went up,

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.970
because they could coordinate
collusion between the airlines.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.000
So I don't know how big
in the world that is.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.220
I usually find myself--
it's very difficult for me

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.060
to talk about
questions like that.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.530
I think these are really
legitimate questions.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.660
I find it difficult for
me to talk about it,

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.330
because I spend most of my time
working in Africa and Colombia

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.477
and places like that.

00:48:21.477 --> 00:48:23.310
And after you've been
in Congo for a summer,

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.960
and you come back to
the United States,

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.820
you just think everything
is so functional here.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.840
It's very difficult for me to be
objective about the challenges

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.040
that people face in the US.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.870
So I don't want
to belittle them.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.520
And that's also Raj Chetty,
my former colleague at Harvard

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.170
who just moved to
Stanford, who's

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.930
been looking at this question
of the social background

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.490
of patentees today.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.510
So let's look at who
takes out patents today,

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.500
how rich were they,
where did they

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.100
come from, what was their
social background, et cetera,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.790
et cetera.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.030
So that's a very
interesting project

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.940
to try to revisit this more
historical work in the US,

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.160
and ask the question, with all
these problems about patents

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.620
and stuff now that
you're alluding to,

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.019
if we asked the same
question today in the US,

00:49:09.019 --> 00:49:10.560
what does it look
like, historically,

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.300
or has something really changed
in a more oligarchic way?

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.680
So I don't really know what
the findings of that research

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.184
is, but again, if you saw
something very different,

00:49:19.184 --> 00:49:19.975
you'd be concerned.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:26.806
But I guess the
big picture I see,

00:49:26.806 --> 00:49:28.430
if you talk to Harvard
undergraduates--

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:30.270
I don't know about
Chicago undergraduates,

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.755
but Chicago undergraduates
want to be like Schopenhauer

00:49:32.755 --> 00:49:35.050
or Heidegger or somebody.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.380
But Harvard undergraduates, they
all just want to be innovators.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.910
They want to do some startup.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.490
There's still very
much this focus

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.730
on innovation and creativity.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:49.932
So that seems to be
a good sign, I think.

00:49:49.932 --> 00:49:50.640
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.550
And thanks for the talk and
the nice Q&amp;A. I'm wondering.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.940
I work on international
product analytics myself.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.730
With our team, we try
to understand countries,

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.476
their development
potential, and how

00:50:02.476 --> 00:50:07.270
we can help countries to develop
on a technological front.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:12.610
How would you measure
the political situation

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.290
in a country and the
political setting?

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.180
How would you
recommend to do that?

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.130
And what I wanna say
is that, our offer

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.710
is that it seems
to be relatively

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.540
easy to read economic data.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.550
And then you have
all these numbers,

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.080
and you have percentages.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.050
But it seems to be much
more difficult to read

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.680
the political element here.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.330
And if I was to answer, just to
put us into a simple situation,

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.170
if I was to answer which
countries is more extractive,

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.072
India or Indonesia, how would
you find an answer to that?

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.530
JAMES ROBINSON:
Well, I think you'd

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.055
have to weigh different things.

00:50:46.055 --> 00:50:48.460
So if you're going
to be more practical,

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.090
if you're going to talk
about a particular country,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:57.720
then you have to weight
different things, not just

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.470
in terms of how
democratic you are,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.180
but what's the
quality of democracy,

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.340
and how does democracy work?

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.830
That seems to be
incredibly important.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.990
You can get some political
science data set,

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.960
and they'll say all these
countries are listed

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.010
as democracy, but democracy
works in very different ways

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.250
in different countries, and
it puts much more or much less

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:21.890
pressure.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.250
That's much more accountability
in some contexts,

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:26.830
or there's much more emphasis
on public good provision,

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.040
or there could be
much more vote buying,

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.470
or much more clientelism.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.530
So you need to look at,
I guess, the quality.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.190
We emphasize here this issue
of how political power is

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.170
distributed in society, but
if you look at democracy,

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.680
it's not just about democracy
versus dictatorship.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.250
There's massively varying
quality of democracy.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.820
Even dictatorships vary a lot.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.600
But I guess I would
also emphasize

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.860
the issue of the state, the
state capacity, the capacity

00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.410
of the state.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.340
So India does have at
least this tradition

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:07.670
at the top of immense
bureaucratic capacity.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.290
Of course, at the bottom,
it can be very different,

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.220
but it does have-- so I guess
you'd have to pull apart

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.470
the state, and the strengths
and weaknesses of the state,

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.190
and the strengths and weaknesses
of the democratic system,

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.850
and how those two
things interact.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:25.360
I mean, there are databases.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.730
There's databases on the
effectiveness of the state,

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:30.550
or how bureaucratized
the state is.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:34.890
I don't know how well they
capture any particular case,

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.380
but the devil, I guess, is
in the details of these two

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.030
dimensions and how
they fit together.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.680
The Indonesian case is
an interesting case also,

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:51.110
where there was period of
desire to promote development.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.590
And they brought in
capacity from Berkeley,

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.550
if I remember correctly,
the Berkeley boys.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:57.731
They had the Berkeley
boys in Indonesia,

00:52:57.731 --> 00:52:59.230
where there wasn't
really democracy,

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.310
but there was an impulse
coming from the top

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.140
to push development.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.840
But again, that wasn't
a very sustainable model

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.520
it turned out.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.490
But now they have a different, a
much more open political system

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.200
now.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.110
But I guess, anyway--

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.720
AUDIENCE: It would be nice
for them to measure it right?

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.390
JAMES ROBINSON: Yeah, I
mean, there is work on that,

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.400
but you're right.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.650
It's very little
compared to what work

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:28.150
goes into economic indicators.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:31.630
And it's not a sexy
activity in academia either.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.920
You're creating this
massive public good, which

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.600
everyone is free-riding off.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.230
So it's difficult to
get people to fund that,

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.011
and it's difficult to get people
to put a lot of effort into it.

00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:45.010
I mean, people asked us.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:48.780
I'm equally to blame.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.570
People have asked us.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.820
You should put together some
indices of how inclusive

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.450
and how extractive
countries are.

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:56.940
And I guess we're nervous.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.080
We're nervous about doing that.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.870
But maybe there's no
professional return

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.661
to doing it either.

00:54:01.661 --> 00:54:04.562
I don't know the thinking
why we haven't done it.

00:54:04.562 --> 00:54:06.270
I guess we haven't
done it, because we're

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.175
not-- we're not in the business
of selling some product, Darren

00:54:10.175 --> 00:54:14.380
and I. We're
academic scribblers,

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:19.090
as John Maynard Keynes said.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:22.770
So I'm not interested in running
around the world consulting.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.140
So maybe I'm worried that if
we look like we have a product,

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.160
people will want us
to start providing it.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.790
And that's not
what we do, really.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.850
But I understand
the point that it

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:38.620
would be much better to have--
thinking about the state

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.120
and the way the
state works, there's

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.770
precious little comparative
evidence on stuff like that.

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.730
There's attempts by
sociologists to do it,

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:50.060
but there's a paucity
of data on that.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.330
I agree.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.150
AUDIENCE: I've got this.

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.300
I'm visiting here.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.240
I'm visiting from Papua New
Guinea, where my wife is

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.350
working in development work.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.350
And that's perhaps too
complex and distant

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.750
from your own
experience, but there

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:09.550
are a couple of countries
close to where you've

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:12.730
worked in Africa, and
I'm thinking of Zambia,

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:15.370
and I'm thinking of Botswana.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:17.240
And I'm just
wondering if you feel

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.970
you know enough about
those countries to use them

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:26.030
as examples about how to go
from what is more inclusive now

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:31.310
politically in both to
something which is less poor.

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:35.120
Zambia in particular is
very deeply, deeply poor.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.130
And it's one of the great
challenges of development

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:42.220
in that country, is to
try to develop policies

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:47.555
that will lift more than an
elite out of that deep poverty.

00:55:47.555 --> 00:55:48.430
JAMES ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:50.230
I don't know that
much about Zambia,

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:51.040
but I know a lot about Botswana.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.540
I did a lot of
research in Botswana.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.690
We talk about
Botswana in the book,

00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:00.300
about why is Botswana
different, and why has Botswana

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.280
been so successful?

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.620
And I think that
that has a lot to do

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.040
with historical differences.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.200
Like Rwanda, Botswana is
not a place historically,

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.570
in the 19th century
before colonialism came,

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.260
it didn't have one centralized,
uniform political system,

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.620
but it had a group of political
systems, these Tswana tribes,

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.340
that had the same
types of institutions.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:25.450
There were all culturally
and historically related

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.460
to each other.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.500
And so they had
centralized authority.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.900
They had bureaucracy.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.160
They had accountability, also.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.870
Botswana's very interesting.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:38.870
Botswana hasn't just been
successful since 1965.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.050
It was very successful in
the 19th century, also.

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:45.260
So they had a long
period of innovation.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.670
They understood that
the whites were coming,

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.380
and this was a problem,
and they needed

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:54.090
to start innovating and changing
and all to cope with that.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.460
So I think the story
in Botswana is,

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.940
yeah, it's a very
interesting story of how they

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.770
had these historical
institutions which had elements

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:05.040
of centralization,
of accountability,

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.130
and they modernized those.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:11.645
So if you go to
Gaborone, in Gabarone,

00:57:11.645 --> 00:57:13.270
when they built
Gaborone, they built it

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.200
from scratch at the time
just before independence,

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.090
because the British ruled
them from South Africa,

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:21.060
from Mafeking and Vryburg.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.300
What they did was, they
built this new city,

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.870
but they incorporated all
the traditional elements

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.520
into the city.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.020
So they took these kgotlas,
these traditional meeting

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.019
places and they built
kgotlas in Gaborone.

00:57:32.019 --> 00:57:33.310
And they're still doing it now.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.220
I was just there last
November, actually.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:39.360
And so they modernized
tradition at the same time

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.390
as preserving it.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.880
But I think those
traditional institutions

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.070
they created a lot
of accountability

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.530
on these post-independent
politicians in Botswana.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.170
If you read, like,
Seretse Khama, who

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.160
was the first president,
his biography,

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.772
he'd go around the country
justifying his policies

00:57:54.772 --> 00:57:56.480
and explaining why
they were doing stuff.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.264
What African president did
that after independence?

00:57:59.264 --> 00:58:01.180
They might have gone
around throwing money out

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.110
of the window of
their car or something

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:04.580
like Mobutu used to do.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:06.810
But trying to get
people on board,

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:09.610
and trying to create some
consensus about what they were

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.640
going to do, I think
that's very much

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.420
because of the way authority
worked in traditional Tswana

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:15.980
society.

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.850
But I think what's interesting
about it is the way they

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.280
modernized this tradition.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.071
They kept the best bits of it.

00:58:23.071 --> 00:58:24.320
How were they able to do that?

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.611
Well, they didn't get screwed
up by British colonialism

00:58:26.611 --> 00:58:27.680
for one thing.

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.710
British colonialism messed
up lots of similar types

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:32.200
of institutions all over.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.070
Like in Lozi
Barotse, for example,

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.880
who had very similar
types of institutions.

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:38.520
Or even Lesotho, who
were ethnically related

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.560
to the Tswana, they screwed up.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.780
Lesotho just got
screwed up by becoming--

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.310
can I say that on camera?

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:46.890
They became a labor recruiting
ground for the mines

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.950
in Johannesburg.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.220
So I think colonialism
distorted all of these things.

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.120
But I think that's
the story of Botswana.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.020
I was recently in Abu Dhabi.

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.410
And it's interesting.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.920
In Abu Dhabi, they're
trying to do the same thing.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.720
They're trying to
modernize tradition.

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.920
They had this traditional
organization of the sheikdom,

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.060
and all these tribes,
and et cetera.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.140
And they've taken
that, and they tried

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.500
to map it onto a modern
state, which I thought

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.780
was absolutely fascinating.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.630
So the tribes get
ministries now.

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:21.820
So instead of just getting
handouts from the sheik,

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.095
they've recreated the system.

00:59:25.402 --> 00:59:27.110
I don't know if it's
gonna work, but it's

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:28.170
absolutely fascinating.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:29.870
I mean, it's not so
different-- I mean,

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:32.420
the details are different,
of course, but at some level,

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.310
the spirit of it is
quite similar to what

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.927
they did in Botswana.

00:59:35.927 --> 00:59:37.760
Of course, there's much
less accountability,

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.680
I think, in the traditional
state in Abu Dhabi

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.830
than there was in Botswana.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:48.340
But anyway, I think that sounds
like a very idiosyncratic story

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:51.930
about why Botswana did
well, how they managed

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:55.240
to build inclusive
institutions, how they managed

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.570
to build-- that has a lot to do
with having an effective state,

00:59:58.570 --> 00:59:59.070
also.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:01.460
There's a lot of inequality.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:06.516
If you've been to Botswana,
it's a quite oligarchic place.

01:00:06.516 --> 01:00:08.140
There's a lot of
hierarchy, and there's

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:14.150
a lot of deference towards
elites in Botswana.

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.620
So think that's
still an elements

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:20.430
of these inclusive institutions
that maybe is not there.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:23.790
And maybe that's one reason why
Botswana has done very well.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:24.600
It has a state.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.850
It takes natural resources.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.285
It uses the natural resources
to provide public goods,

01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.660
and there's enough
accountability

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.270
to make that work.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.390
But there's other
elements of inclusion

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.740
that don't work very well.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.640
Chile is like that.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.110
I always say Botswana
is very much like Chile.

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:43.430
Chile has a long history
of state centralization.

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.980
It has a state which is able
to take the natural resource

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.827
wealth and use it to provide
public goods, and build roads,

01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:49.660
and stuff like that.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.680
But also Chile is a
ridiculously oligarchic society.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.880
If you go to Santiago, everyone
is married to everybody else.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.080
They went to four
Catholic boys schools,

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.370
and there's an
enormous impediment

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.300
to broader inclusion.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.635
There's enough accountability
so that the system works,

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:06.010
and the money
doesn't get stolen,

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.210
and public goods get
provided, but there's

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:13.010
a big barrier to going to
the next level of really

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:16.110
not becoming a Latin American,
but becoming something

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:17.450
different.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:19.400
That's very hard, because
it's so oligarghic.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.380
I think Botswana is
a bit like that too.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.474
But Zambia, I don't know
so much about Zambia.

01:01:27.474 --> 01:01:28.890
I mean, that story
about Botswana,

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:30.580
it sounds very idiosyncratic.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.942
And I think the world is
a bit like that, though.

01:01:32.942 --> 01:01:34.650
I think that there's
many different paths

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:37.590
to inclusive institutions
and extractive institutions.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:40.660
If you think historically,
it's difficult to say

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.170
there's some well defined
basin of attraction,

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:45.681
where if you're here, then
you're gonna become inclusive.

01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:47.680
If you're there, you're
gonna become extractive.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.440
Somehow there's a lot
of idiosyncratic ways

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.940
that countries built
inclusive institutions,

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.900
amd how Botswana
did it looks very

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.040
different from the way
Britain did historically,

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.087
or Sweden for that
matter, or even the US.

01:02:00.087 --> 01:02:01.920
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
thank Professor Robinson

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.420
for a great talk.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.170
