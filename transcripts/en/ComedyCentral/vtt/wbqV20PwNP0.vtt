Ilana, I'm not gonna clean
this man's apartment,

No, I can't--
This is gross.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:33.033

I don't want
to hear it, okay.

You're losing your edge and
I wasn't gonna say anything,

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.408
but you're not as fun
as you used to be.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.344

dude's apartment on my own.
