&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.640
&gt;&gt; Paulette Hasier:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.030
Thank you for coming to the
Phillip Lee Phillips lecture

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.710
that we're having today
on World War I.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.010
My name is Paulette Hasier.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.690
I am the Chief of the
Geography and Map Division going

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.420
on four months at the
end of this week.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.280
So, I'm very pleased to introduce
our moderator for the event,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.760
and that will be Mr. Dick
Pflederer and he will come up.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560
Thank you again.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.420
[ Applause ]

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.290
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: We
appreciate that invitation,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.850
and also the reference
to the Phillips Society.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.140
I'm curious to know
if we have any members

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.440
of the Phillips Society
present here.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.080
Raise your hand please?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.630
Wow, good.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.850
Well, before we get into
actually discussing the program,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.090
I wanted to take just a minute
to talk about the society.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.060
If you signed it outside and
you're not a member already,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.510
you may get an email because we
are always looking for members.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.440
A brief history: The
society has been

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.980
in action for more than 20 years.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.580
Our goal is to support the G
and M Division of the library,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.820
both financially and with
programs such as this.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.800
And we hope that you will
take a minute to look

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.630
at the materials we have outside.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.110
I'm just going to hold up one card
which is of particular interest

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
to me because that's the one
you get to put an envelope

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.710
with your check if
you want to do that.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.980
I'll also tell you
that that is optional.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.640
That is not a requirement of
membership to make a donation.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.760
But we want to see as many
people at these lectures.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.800
We want to see as many people
utilizing the facilities.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.490
Okay, with that behind us, I want
to talk about today's program.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.160
And we're really lucky
for a couple of reasons,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.220
mostly that we have
two great speakers.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.400
Before I introduce the speakers,
I wanted to just give a word

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.630
about the subject, World War I.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.810
You may know that the
US officially entered

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.220
that war 100 years ago last month,
so we're looking at an event

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.220
that is, for us who are
maybe a little bit older,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.980
it's not so long ago, but for the
young people it's something like --

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.750
It's like the Civil War
was when I was a kid,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.740
as far as that far
distance in the past.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.290
You probably know that we had the
so-called American Expeditionary

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.720
Force under the leadership
of General John Pershing.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.070
And it took us a while to get,
let's say, fully mobilized.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.790
In fact, it's about a year before
we actually achieved a headcount

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.970
on the ground in Europe
of 1 million people.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.880
But by November 1918, when the war
ended of course, we were pouring,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.690
literally pouring resources
into that Western front,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.980
10,000 new American faces
every day are on the ground.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.730
So, you know, we're going to hear
a speaker later who was British

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.160 position:56%
and we can't even measure the impact
that that war and the sacrifices

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.350
that they made had on Britain.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.100
And of course, France
was probably even worse.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.350
So, I promise to keep
the so-called overhead

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.770
of today's session
as short as I could.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.740 position:56%
And I wanted to start by introducing
our first speaker, Mr. Ryan Moore,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.400
who is a member of the staff
of the G and M Division,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.310
and I want to give a little
bit of background about him.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.590
He's quite active as an author.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.600 position:56%
In fact, there's also a copy of an
occasional paper that he's authored,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.200
which is out there which
is available, I guess,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.880
for anyone who doesn't have
it who wants to take it.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.750
But Ryan's education
is quite interesting.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.560
He has an undergraduate degree
from Cleveland State University

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.470 position:56%
and he has two advanced degrees, one
from Kent State in Library Science

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.820
and the other from Cleveland
State University in History.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.180
Before coming to the
Library of Congress,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.460
he had worked for four years
in the Special Collections

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.890
of the Cleveland Public Library,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.870
which is quite a substantial
library,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.350
and he's been in the
Library of Congress here

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.830
for just about 10 years now.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.230 position:56%
His subject is the maps of World War
I, and he's going to look at the way

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.030
that maps illustrated
the military, yes,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.650
but also the political
facets of the war.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.200
He's also going to discuss
aerial photography, the scouting,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.360
and also an interesting
sideline I hadn't thought of,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.040
and that is how did the
interviews of prisoners --

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.580
German prisoners in this case --
affect the content, the detail,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.570
that was on the US
maps of that period.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.040
So, without any further ado,
we will ask Ryan to come

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.510
up here and give his talk.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:26.070
[ Applause ]

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.050
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: Thank you very
much for the introduction.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.970
And before I begin,
I've always reminded

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.380
to say please and thank you.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.010
I think it's the appropriate
thing to always begin with please

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.910
and end with a thank you.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.800
And so, I'm pleased
to thank all of you.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.260
I want to start by thanking
Dr. Abear who is here.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.520
When I first came to G and M,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.040
encourage me to go
beyond my interest

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.020
in World War II, and
look at World War I.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.170
And his advice was
just to the point.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.800
He said, "That World War
II field is too crowded.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.990
Look at something else."

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.620
And he was right.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.100
It's a great field of
study and it's something

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.490
that I am very interested in,
but broadening one's horizons

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.200
with these great collections
that we have here

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.550
at the library has been a
wonderful experience for me.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.410 position:56%
Ralph Ehrenberg, who is also here --

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.000
When I worked under him when he was
Chief of Division when he returned,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.600
we worked together on
the Phillips Society

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.430
in reenergizing the occasional
papers and getting people to start

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.320
to actively write about
our collections

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.090
and promote them through
that research.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.730
It was a great time to work
with him and a pleasure

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.640
to be part of that process.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.750
And now we have Chief
Hasier who was with us.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.370
She comes from a background NGA,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.210 position:56%
National Geo Special Intelligence
Agency, and she's bringing new ideas

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.080 position:56%
about technology, and it's an
exciting time to be in the division.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.510
I'm glad that all three of these
Chiefs can be here at one time.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.590
It's a great day.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.270
So at that being said, I
would like to begin my talk.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.470
The Library of Congress
intersected with World War I

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.390
with the publication of A List
of Atlases and Maps Applicable

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.990
to World War I (1918) authored
by Phillip Lee Phillips,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.380
the namesake of our organization.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.780
Phillips was the first
superintendent of maps

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.090
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.180
He compiled a list of maps
-- political maps, road maps,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.790
railroad maps were printed
contemporaneous to this event.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.730
So, these were ways that
people could find information

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.590
about what countries looked
like, what the situation

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.120
on the ground may be, because what
media was available at that time?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.840 position:56%
Photographs, maps, the written word.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.320
There was not video, instant video,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.930
Twitter feeds today
that would inform us.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.830
So, this resource was very valuable

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.530
for not only the common
researcher but for policymakers.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:26.780
What I plan to talk about today,
as Mr. Pflederer mentioned,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.570
is I'm going to mention maps that
illustrate the history of the war.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.370
So, the storytelling piece.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.400
When the general public wanted
to know what was going on,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.850
how is this information
conveyed to them?

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.800
A second part of my discussion
will entail an overview

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.450
of the relationship between
maps, intelligence gathering,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.970
primarily photographs but
also prisoners' statements,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.620
and how that affected the use
of weapons, primarily artillery.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.840
And lastly, I'm going to
close was showing some maps

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:10.060
that describe the process of peace
and how that was related to Germany

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:16.220
and how that sort of was
an omen for the next war.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:24.090
So, you're all probably familiar
with this story, this estimation

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.190
of Franz Ferdinand and his
wife Sophia by Gavrilo Princip,

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.890
down there in the lower corner.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.720
They were visiting Sarajevo
and he was essentially there

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.790
to review the maneuvers
of some troops,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.490
and he had taken a
tour through the city.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:52.490
Princip and his associates were
funded and supplied with weapons

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.630
by a group called the Black Hand.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.800
They had a relationship
with Serbian intelligence

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.550
and possibly higher elements
in the Serbian government.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.540
It's still in dispute today
how high up that may have gone.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.340
But nonetheless, they were
given weapons and transported

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.600
into Bosnia-Herzegovina,
which was occupied

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.040
by the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.220 position:56%
Princip and his associates lined
this road here along the [Inaudible]

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:28.850
River, waiting for Ferdinand's
possession to come by.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.360
They fanned out along the road
with the idea being that, "Well,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.550
if you don't have a good
shot at him, let him go by.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.000
The next person will
take a shot at him."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.900
So what happens is the
entourage passes and one

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.390
of the assassins throws
a bomb out onto the road.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.330
It doesn't land under
the Archduke's car,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.940
but one of his secretary's cars,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.540
and those folks are
injured by the blast.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.890
The Archduke goes to the town hall
and protests about the situation.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.430
He is advised to leave because
they say, "Well obviously,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.050
there was an attempt on your life.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.600
You should get out of
here as soon as possible.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.350
We can't ensure your security."

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.420
Well, before leaving they want
to check on the injured parties

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.200
and then depart from the city.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.790
Princip, while this is happening,
he's 19 and 20, it depends.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.130
There was a dispute about
his age as well at the time.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.210
And he is dejected because
he is a very ardent Bosnian

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.430
Serb nationalist.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.510 position:56%
He wants to see the Archduke killed.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.010
The reason being is that this
guy has some liberalizing ideas

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.310
about the Empire.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.750
They want to give their
constituent groups more autonomy.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.560
His group feels, "Well, if you
give Bosnian Serbs more autonomy

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.390
that may steal the thunder
of the Pan-Serbian movement,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.590
and we want people
radicalized, not pacified."

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.860
So he's sitting in a
café feeling dejected.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.240
And then what happens is they
come back down from the City Hall

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.470
to this area here where
this arrow is.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.250
The driver makes a wrong turn.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.940
Princip can't believe his eyes.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.230
There's the Archduke sitting in a
car several feet in front of him.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.420
He immediately gets up, pulls
a pistol out of his jacket,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.070 position:56%
walks up to the side rail and fires,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.750
and hits the Archduke
and his wife Sophia.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.670
The Archduke implores
his wife, "Sophia,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.640
please live for the children."

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.310 position:56%
They have several children together.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.200
Princip, he is supposed
to commit suicide.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.960
All the assassins actually
are supposed to commit suicide

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.370
after they make an attempt.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.510
He has been given a cyanide pill
which he takes and it doesn't work.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.180
He attempts to put
the gun to his head,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.100
and security wrestles
it from his hand.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.990
He will wind up in Austrian
prison and died in 1916.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.210
He has tuberculosis at the time
that he commits this assassination.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.520
He will languish in a
prison cell and die.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.810 position:56%
So the question always is, how do we
go from this event to a world war?

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:33.400
And the stars like Margaret
McMillan, for example,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.390
The Road to War, discusses
at length.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.270
And I encourage anyone
who is very curious

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.300
about all the particular political
details that go into the making

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.800
of the First World War to
dig into books such as that.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:57.620 position:56%
So at the outset of the conflict,
we have a couple of countries lining

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.550
up together because they
have diplomatic agreements.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:07.960
The countries in pink --
France, Russia, and England,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.810
although England is a
slight technicality here

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.960
which I'll mention -- is that they
agreed to a mutual defense pact.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.380
England has agreed in principle,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.200
and their militaries
have discussed plans

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.290
of mutual defense should
it be necessary,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.060
but they are not a signatory
towards any defense pact.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.940
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
also have a mutual defense pact.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:41.600 position:56%
What the Austro-Hungarians wanted
to do is they want to invade Serbia.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.890
Well, Russia says, "If
you invade Serbia --

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.110
" And they consider
Serbia, it's been said,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.700
is the little brother of Russia.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.000
It's not a pejorative term.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.830
It's sort of a very familial
term in that part of the world.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.180
They said, "If you attack
here, we'll attack here."

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.330
The Austro-Hungarians then
turned to the Germans for help.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.340
They said, "We can't defend the
Russians and attack Serbia at once.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.640
We don't have enough troops."

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.140
So, this is where our complication
begins, with the Germans,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.660
and this is how we get a world war.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.140
And I'm going to skip forward
and explain that and come back

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.120 position:56%
to all the belligerents in a second.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.270
There's something called
the von Schlieffen plan.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:34.960
The Germans said, "Our big
enemies are France and Russia."

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.240
Now, if Russia mobilizes
against Austria-Hungary

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.440
over this Serbia issue, that
means France will mobilize too.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.450 position:56%
If they mobilize their troops first,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.230
they have a distinct
advantage of us if we wait.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.360
So we must mobilize.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.040 position:56%
But the problem with mobilization in
Germany is this von Schlieffen plan.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.960
It's been kept a secret since
1905, when it was first conceived

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.700 position:56%
and later revised through the years.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.670
And what it said was Germany
has to strike first to win.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.160
We're fighting two major
powers, France and Russia.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.510
What we want to do is hold the
Russians at bay with a small amount

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:24.040
of forces as possible, put the
bulk of our forces against France

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.090
and to march through
Belgium and to take Paris

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.520 position:56%
and knock the French out of the war.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.470
In six weeks this has to be done.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:37.820
And this is a time when soldiers
primarily move my walking, okay.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.520
So they're going to have
to march 20 miles a day

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.070
to make this happen, if not more.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:49.930
So they tell the Kaiser, they
said, "Russia is angling for war.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.230
We have to mobilize.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.160
And by the way, if we mobilize,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.360
we must fight because that
reveals a secret plan.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.010 position:56%
Because we move troops to the front,
they know what our intentions are.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.780
We have to fight."

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:11.540 position:56%
So to go back here for a second, so
that will expand the war eventually.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.740
By 1917, the United
States will enter the war,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.170
and we see our former
President Wilson here.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.230
And this map was one of the many
educational maps that were printed

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.390
at the time to inform the
public what was going on.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:37.980 position:56%
It compares the area of Europe here
inside the continental United States

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.680
to sort of explain to the
everyday American how big

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.780
and powerful our country
is, it's suggesting,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.410
and all these countries
fit within our borders.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.400
It's telling who are
the Allies, America,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.630
and a lot of people
are surprised to learn

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.140
that the Japanese Empire
was an ally,

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.440
a very important ally
in World War I.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.070
They, in fact, were responsible
for patrolling the Pacific

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:12.690
and protecting commercial and troop
transports moving from Australia,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.360
New Zealand, and India
to the Western front.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.940
The British had stripped most of
their ships as well as the French

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.820
to affect the blockade
against the Germans.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:28.210
So the Japanese were a very key
ally in the First World War,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:34.520
as was Italy, Great Britain, France
who bore the bulk of the fighting

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.320
and suffered the highest level
of casualties, and of course,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.620
Great Britain and Canada.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.500 position:56%
And there were other minor countries
supporting the war effort as well.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.640
The Central Powers were
not as international.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:02.800
These countries were Germany,
Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.050
and the Ottoman Empire --
these countries in black.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.570
These individuals over
here, the Kaiser of Germany,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:21.490
the Kaiser of Austria-Hungary,
the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire,

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.870
and the Czar of Bulgaria.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.710
They believed that their
location in proximity

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:35.450
to one another would allow them to
have a strong common core defense,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.640
and could move troops wherever
they needed them by rail --

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.260
which I'm going to discuss
next -- to fight the Allies.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.570
They were able to mobilize 22.8
million military personnel,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:56.520
and if I can jump back and show you
that the Allies were much stronger,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.990
42.2 million military personnel.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.340
In addition to people
who are fighting,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.580 position:56%
the Allies though also were
materially richer, bigger factories,

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.110
more natural resources,
greater shipping industry

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.590
to move the stuff around.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.270 position:56%
So, it was important for the Central
Powers then got to get involved

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.730
in a long protracted war because
they did not have the resources

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.470
to contend with such might.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.850
So the Germans -- going back
to the von Schlieffen plan --

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:37.320
had a strategic rail network in
the country, and this allowed them

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.510
to rapidly move forces from
here, the Eastern front

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.940 position:56%
of the Western front and vice versa.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:49.940 position:56%
German staff officers were charged
with plotting how long it would take

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.980
for a given troop unit to move
from one front to another,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.240
and they would practice these
and memorize these schedules,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.100
because timing was very important,
the delivery of the troops

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.240
to the front had to be
done at a precise time.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.860
Once the von Schlieffen
plan was given the go-ahead,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.330
they couldn't have some
troops there ready to go,

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.630
waiting around for others.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.810
They had to all be in place.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:19.030
And the Germans built these
mile-long rail platforms

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.890 position:56%
so they could take troops on and off
the trains as rapidly as possible.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.870
And when these things were going
up, the Belgians in particular

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.220
on the border noticed this.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.030
Like their intelligence
service said, "Hey,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:35.880
we're spotting these mile-long
rail platforms and these sort

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.910
of country towns on the border.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.210
What's going on?

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.980
Either big real estate investment
in the future or it smells

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.240
like a possible war is brewing."

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:51.450
And they were very
concerned about that.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:56.810
So, my me to use a pictorial
map to sort of explain

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.280
to you the opening
phases of the war.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.110
This comes from a French
publication,

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:08.360
and we see Falkenhayn giving
the uppercut to Joffre.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:15.450
And the Germans were initially
very successful in marching

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.630
through Belgium and
portions of France.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.010
The Belgians, although they
were a neutral country,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.410
they were very powerful, and
they punched above their weight

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.650
because they had vast resources
coming in from the Congo.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.880
And if you ever heard of the
novel, "The Heart of Darkness,"

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.060
it was about the Belgian Congo.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:46.150
And King Leopold II had a secret
private empire in the Congo

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.110
where he became very
personally wealthy,

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.640
and the entire country
Belgium became very wealthy.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.310
And so therefore, with this money
they were able to erect a series

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.650
of fortifications along
the border with Germany

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:03.340
that they thought would stop
any kind of invasion attempt.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.280 position:56%
The problem was, the Germans
invented these massive railroad guns

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.670
that they would train in on
the fort and just blast it.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.460
So once you build a fort,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.690
the problem with the
fort is it can't move.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.340
Patton said it's a monument
to the stupidity of mankind.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.500
Because once the enemy locates
the fort, surrounds the fort,

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.600
unless you can come to the aid of
a fort, it will be lost eventually.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.350
So the Germans were able
to smash through Belgium.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.180
And as they moved within
reach of Paris,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.620
the Allies rallied their forces.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.660
At the First Battle of the Marne,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.690
they found that the Germans
had exposed their flank,

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.170
and they took advantage of
this gap in the German armies,

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.220
and they temporarily
checked the German advance.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:09.050
There German said, "Okay,
we're going to go around this,

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.020
and started something called
"the race to the sea."

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.070
They weren't literally running
to the sea, but they were trying

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.230
to outflank another, the
Germans and the Allies.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.020
And they went all the way
up to the Belgian coast.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.000
And it culminated with
the Battle of Ypres,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.690
where the Allies were again
able to check the Germans.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.110
And at this time, the war is
very fluid, it's very mobile.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.410
We think trenches, World War I.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.310
At this time, it's
not trench warfare.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.050
They're fighting in open country.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.900
They're trying to get around one
another and secure the best ground.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.890
And the Germans don't want to erect
any kind of temporary fortification

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:48.550
because they want Paris,
they want to knock it out.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.000
And they get their troops
over to the Eastern front

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.940
to fight the Russians
who are mobilizing.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.620
So the question in Germany became,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:06.060
in 1915 after all those
opening moves, what's going on?

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.320 position:56%
Where does our Army stand in France?

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.510
This is a commercial map
published by Dietrich Reimer,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.250
a very famous German
publishing house.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.860
Probably, you could say,
it's akin to a Rand McNally,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.560
that kind of level of popularity.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:28.210 position:56%
And they regularly published maps
to show the situation on the ground.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.310
And these theater maps were
very popular in Germany,

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.750
and other countries had
similar kind of mapping

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.040
that was also very popular.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.790
What I've done here is I pulled
this out over here for everyone,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.300
and I have annotated it here.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.950
This is the blue showing
the German main movements

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.380
through Belgium towards Paris,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:53.290
and also making a side
thrust here into France.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:02.630
These areas in red were
fortifications or major cities

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.130
that they had to go
through or bypass.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:15.360
So what happens is that the front
starts to settle in 1915, in 1916.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.390
And the geography of this land
in France here is that it's sort

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.660
of gently rolling up this way.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:28.540
And the Germans are in a naturally
elevated place over the Allies,

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.810
and they decide that
they're going to dig in here

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.500
because the Russians have
entered the war and they need

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.100
to send some troops
back to do with that.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:47.530
So they start to do trench lines
all the way down to Switzerland,

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:51.500
and the Allies will respond
with their own countering set

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.590
of trench lines along the way.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.840
The British were concerned what
the Americans were thinking,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.690
because they viewed us as a
potential ally to help deal

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.880
with this crisis on
the Western front.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.430
One means to educate Americans,
and you could put that in quotes --

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:24.880
you know, you could use the word
"propaganda" -- was to use a map.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.960
This map is by a publishing house
called Stanford's of London,

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.300
and it's showing the battlefronts
of Europe and comparing it

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.210
with traveling time that
Americans could think,

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.640
"Oh yeah, that makes sense to me.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:47.340 position:56%
If the Western front is some 450
miles long, that's half the distance

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.400
from New York to Chicago."

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.890
So these kinds of maps helped an
American audience digest not only

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.530
what was going on, but
sort of a geographic scale

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.970 position:56%
on which the fighting was occurring.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.500
And it's interesting
what the map says here.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.050
Some of this language
I know you can't see,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.440
but I want to share it with you.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:20.990
This is on the eve of America
sending its troops into Europe.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:26.760
The US has decided to go to war,
and the British mapmaker says this.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.640
It says. "Despite the victories
which have crowned the Allied arms,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.670
their task still remains a heavy
one, and it will need every effort

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:45.320
which they and their American
comrades can put into the struggle

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:51.070
to defeat the sinister aims
of Prussian militarism."

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.580
And we will revisit this term

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.920
"Prussian militarism"
at the end of the talk.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:00.430
But what it alludes to is
before Germany was a country,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.540
there was a very large
state called Prussia.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.600
Frederick the Great, you
may have heard the name --

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.470
They were kind of like a
European ancient Sparta.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.450
They were a military state.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.890
It's been said that, you know,
some countries have an army.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.630
Well, this army has a country.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.950
And that sort of belief was carried

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.160
on into German culture
at the time here.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:34.730
So now, let's have an
overview of military maps.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.750
What they did -- how they
were using the result of them.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.190
I call this a military
mapping revolution.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.400
What do I mean by that?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:53.190
Well, never before was information
about the field of battle,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:59.260
its scope, the particular details
of the train, the obstacles

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:06.290 position:56%
and the enemy formations given to a
junior officer in a map form before.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.900
In World War I, millions
of maps were produced.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.930
The U.S. Army alone produced 3.5
million maps for its own forces,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:20.270
and it was just there from
1917 until November 11, 1918.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:25.240 position:56%
Maps were made every day of the war,
often updated every day of the war,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.410
a very detailed level
of intelligence.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:34.130
So, we're going to talk about,
what were they looking for?

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.100
They were looking for the enemy's
artillery, their trench lines,

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.240
obstacles, routes in and out,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.650
and something called
"the order of battle."

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.740
That means, who are the enemy
troops, how strong are they,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.610
how long have they
been in the battle,

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.960
and what's the overall situation?

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.750
How is that information gathered?

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.350
Through reconnaissance,
direct observation by people

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:00.210
on the ground, and
aerial photographs.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.610
Prisoners, of course, were an
important source of information.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:10.870
Sometimes they willingly gave it
over for a sandwich and a cigar.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.390
Defectors and spies.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.950
And the result of all this was
that tremendous tactical mapping

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.270
at a very scale, high level
of detail, and it allowed

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.880
for massive deployments
of troops and bombardments

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.640
that were beyond what
the eye could see.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.520
As you know in historic battles,
such as the Revolutionary War,

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.740
the Civil War, the Napoleonic
War, the general himself would get

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.410
on a horse and serve
at the battlefield,

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.630
and be able to see everything.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.190
Well, these battles are stretching
for miles and miles and miles.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.640
One general cannot
see what's going on.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.950
He needs a map.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.290
And then, for the subordinates
in the field to understand

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.890 position:56%
and to translate his orders into
action, they need a map that relates

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.610
to their particular situation.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.510
And this resulted in some
of the deadliest battles

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.810
in the history of warfare.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.750
When the war began,
however, in 1914,

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:14.980
they were making all these
great big strategic plans

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.280
like the von Schlieffen plan.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.850
The other countries had their
plans and they were wrapping

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.100
up their militaries with
the latest weaponry.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.510
But the mapping effort was
not on par with that energy.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.810
When both sides went to war,
they were relying on maps

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:37.160
that were printed in the 1880s
that were these large-scale maps.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.970
And when I talk about map scale,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.210
think of it like this
-- one to one is unity.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.510
It's the same.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.730
And the more you move away from
that, you're able to show more

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.350
of the earth, but in less detail.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:53.790
So this is showing
1 to 8000 in France.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:58.670
And this is a great regional
picture, but if you are asked

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.620
to go take the enemy dug out, well,

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.420
where's even the trench
line on this map?

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.100
It would be so small.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.490 position:56%
It's useless for a tactical purpose.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.360
So it took them two
years to get things right

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.560
on both sides on the Western front.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.430
They developed things
called tactical maps,

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.280
which I've talked about.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.450
So for the infantry, the
guy fighting on the ground,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.910
he wants a map at 1 to 10,000.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:31.720
This is going to show you
buildings, trees in some cases

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.870
with the Germans map,
particular trees, wells,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.760
very detailed information.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.310
The artillery want a little
bit of a bigger picture

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.950
because they're shooting
miles down the road.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.500
And for planning, 1 to 40,000,
I'd give me a regional picture

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.290
and then I'll translate that
information into the infantry

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.690
and the artillery planning.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.830
It has to show topography.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:03.060
It has to show waterways,
roads, communication lines,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:08.760
of course buildings and
military information.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.830
And things, although we think,
"Oh, it's a static war --

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.890
they're in trenches,"
what was going on in

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:19.670
and around those trenches
was changing all the time.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.620
And so, that information needed
to be updated daily often.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.180
Even if nothing changed, that might
be a sign of something is going on.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.200
Why is nothing going
on on the German side?

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.500
We don't see anything.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:36.410
Well, maybe they've taken some
guys across the way and moved them

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:38.460
down the line because they
want to attack down the line.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.230
So that information
is also important.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.650
So here's a blowup of
that same tactical map,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.070
and it's a German map, by the way.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:54.670
And it's showing an
Allied trench line.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.620
They don't put their own
information on this map

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.660
because this is given
to a junior officer.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.410
And if he's out in the field and
he's captured or he drops this

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.590 position:56%
and they show their own trench line,

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.450
that's given away intelligence
to the enemy.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:16.100 position:56%
So often, what the folks in the
field had was a one-sided depiction.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.920
So, we see here an Allied trench
line with these X's are here

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.220
in red that I'm tracing along.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.680
That's barbed wire,
and there are many,

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.250
many rows of barbed
wire to inhibit attack.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:32.110
You can't pass through barbed
wire unless you blast it

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.520
with artillery -- it's
that thick and dense.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:44.750 position:56%
Over here, we have a legend that
explains the information on the map.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.890
So the Germans even
went down to the level

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.930
of showing deciduous
verses evergreen trees.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.340
I mean, they plotted this stuff.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.720
It's amazing.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.470
I suppose -- we were joking
about that earlier, Peter and I.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:03.670
But I guess that matters if
you're operating in a time

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.440
when there's leaves on
the tree verses not.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.080
Are your troops concealed
or are they not concealed?

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.490
Town maps -- how to interpret that.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:20.720
How to interpret topography and
various structures on a map,

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.070
because junior officers are
not necessarily map experts.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.020
You've got to lay this out in
a very literal and clear way

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:35.430
so that somebody with a low level
of training can use it effectively.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.500
So maps, as we know,
operate with a grid.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.190
You see that on all these maps,
every sort of maybe not think

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.480
about the intended purpose.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:55.240 position:56%
So it's about subdividing geographic
space and allowing one to point

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.760
to a specific place on earth
and share that information

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.630
in common with someone else.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.320
You don't want to say, "Dr.
Abear, take the platoon

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.810
down the road and take the church."

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.100
"What church are you
asking me to take?"

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.840
Right? If I give you a set

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:16.810
of coordinates then we can agree
upon where is it going to be.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:22.180
And so, the way these grids
worked is that there was one

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:29.640
for the 40,000, which was used
for planning, and one of 10,000.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:37.710
And each one of these squares would
get divided into four sectors,

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.350
and that it would get
sub-divided again into 10,

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.280
so these are 50 yard squares here.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:52.050
So it allows immense precision when
talking about a geographic location

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.600
that should be bombarded
or should be attacked.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.750
And the same holds true
for aerial photography.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.630
It operated on a grid system
and they were given the job

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.670
of mapping a particular
lettered square.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.880
This map here is by the British.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.000
It's in Belgium, of Ypres.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.080
And I'm going to show
you, they were challenged

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.290 position:56%
with mapping letter I -- right here.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.900
As you can see on the map here
showing the town in the river,

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:44.660
and here is the aerial
photograph of this location.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.160
Amazingly accurate, right?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.670
And we're talking, this
is 1916-1917 flyover.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:58.250
And to make this happen, they
would go into enemy territory

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:05.120
on a daily basis, flying at
altitudes 10,000 feet maybe,

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.860
lower sometimes, to get
this kind of clarity.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.990
And that would put them in
range of any anti-aircraft.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:16.670
It was a very dangerous
business doing this.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:21.300
And they were asked to go over
every day because planners

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.130
and analysts wanted to
see if there's any change

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:28.070
in what you captured today,
and how can we compare

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.900 position:56%
that to what's happened in the past.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.560
So we can either have an
indication that they plan to attack

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.080
or if they want to recede
from a certain area.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.380
They want to know that.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.950
So, this stuff is happening
on a daily basis.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.720
And flying in World War I, by the
way, was a very dangerous business.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.980
Most people are killed on takeoff.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.110
These are wooden planes, and if the
engine failed, you're in a plane

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.080
with a heavy camera and
another person who's going

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.400
to take the pictures.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.850
And if you don't get enough
lift and you come down heavy,

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.420
that's the end, generally speaking.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.180
So, what were they
taking photographs of?

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.500
What are you supposed to be
looking for if you're an analyst?

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.240
So I'm going to ask all of you.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.520
Like, say you're an analyst and
this gets returned from a flight,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.430
and they said, "Where is
the machine gun nest?"

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.680
Now, we can't ask Paulette
because she has a background

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.140 position:56%
in this stuff, so she doesn't count.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.460
But some of you, if you
were given this photograph,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.560
where's the machine gun nest?

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.960
It's right here.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.450
See this round secular
running in pairs?

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.370 position:56%
There is two actually in this mound.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.250
What they were taught to
look for were features

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.530
that don't generally
occur in nature.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.270
And human beings have a tendency

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.250
to build things logically,
geometrically.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.840
And when you look at the earth,
the earth doesn't form that way.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.040
In the human mind, it wants to
construct it in this fashion.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.380
So they're taught to look for
what the human would build.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.330
And so, right there is a machine
gun that's on a hill that commands

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.730
over these trenches down here.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.880
And there's a lot more
enemy activity actually

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.180
on this photograph.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.930
Up here is a headquarters.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.480
These buildings, they determined
prisoners were being kept in.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.080
They set up roadblocks here.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:57.250
So, this flyover intelligence
was very important

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.540
to develop tactical knowledge
of what the enemy was doing

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.070
and where he was situated.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:10.220
So the question becomes,
okay, you got a photograph.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.520
You know where it is.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.510
How do you get that to a map?

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:15.810
There are no computers.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.110
There's no GPS.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.120
There is no cut and pasting.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.230
So the process is called
rectification,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:27.720 position:56%
meaning transferring the information
onto a map to have it lined

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.600
up with the coordinates of the map.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.770
It was a very primitive
process, yet very effective.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.880
What mappers were taught
to do was find the point

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.360
that you're interested in that
shows up on a photograph here.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.260
Alignment it with known points.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.990
And they would trace the
photograph using tracing paper.

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:55.990 position:56%
And then, they would take that known
grid which I told you about earlier

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.020
where the plane would fly
over, and they would layer

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:05.180
that upon a topographic map and
they would draw that onto the map.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.800
And that's how intelligence would
get laid over onto existing maps.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:18.330 position:56%
It seems very basic and rudimentary,
but it was miles and miles ahead

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:22.840
with the world had ever done before
in terms of military mapping.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.750
Now, eyes on the ground
also was still important

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.500
for intelligence mapping
in World War I.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.940
This is a patrol map from the
Germans in the Saint-Mihiel sector

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.970
where the Americans launched
our first American-led

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.270
offensive campaign.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.310
All sides sent patrols out, usually
at dawn or dusk to use the cover

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:58.830
of darkness, and to approach
-- go through no man's land --

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:05.270
as quietly as possible, and to
take note of the enemy lines.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.570
What do you see?

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.650
Are they cooking food?

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:17.590
Do you see anything behind the
lines, like trucks or supplies

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.060
that had been recently deposited?

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.040
Do you see artillery?

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.340
When did you see?

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.050
How much did you say?

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:31.800
Patrol leaders in both armies
were required to fill out reports

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.970
about what they had
seen, when, and where.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:38.360
This information would be then
kicked back to their headquarters

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.590
and also used to update maps.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.380
And if they could such a patrol,
they loved to grab a prisoner.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.760
Sometimes they grabbed a
sentry, who was unwilling.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.650 position:56%
Sometimes the guy on the other side,
you know, I mean, was giving himself

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.480
up too quickly without a fight.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:08.380
And this here is an American map
that shows intelligence garnered

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.500
from a prisoner about
the German lines.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.950
We have here showing machine guns.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.760
Prisoner told them -- Here's
the American line, by the way.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.440
Here's the German line, okay.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.170
The Germans often would move
machine guns up close to the line

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.940
to harass the Americans
in their trench.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.490
Should anyone stick their head
up, they would unload a blast

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.790
of machine-gun fire on them.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:44.670
It told about a German
observation balloon here.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.210
Although we had planes, balloons
were still very important

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:52.450
and very effective, but it
was a terrible job to have

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:56.730
because they were very visual
to the enemy and they would go

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.310
after them whenever possible.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.090
And if you're in a balloon that
catches fire and is coming down,

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.830
there's really no way out.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.040
Here the Germans have an airfield.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.390
And behind, deep in their
line, is their artillery,

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.940
their heavy artillery, field
artillery, and their mortars.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.870
So this information from
prisoners is very valuable

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.850
to get a better picture
of the enemy lines.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:29.420
Aerial photography couldn't always
get the stuff because you learn

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.030
to camouflage, you learn
to adapt and overcome.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:35.170
The enemy is spying from above,
so they would throw netting

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:40.720
or do various things to try to
deceive the aerial reconnaissance.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.620
And we see this sort of going
on today in the various wars

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:54.280
in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the
Middle East, in northern Africa.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:00.690
United States and NATO has drones
and airplanes, heat detection.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.860
So, opposition elements are turning
towards tunnels, concealment.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:11.290
It's a cat and mouse game from the
beginning of warfare has occurred,

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.590
and this is part of that.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.950
All of this information
would be used to culminate

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:25.130
in something called "the
enemy order of battle."

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.430
What does that mean?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:33.700
Ideally, you can identify
enemy units by their name.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.000
Who are they?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.730
What's their specialty?

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:39.920 position:56%
What is the quality of those troops?

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.220
Do they have experience?

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.240
Are they very green?

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.740
Also equally important is how
long have they been fighting?

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.660
You know, if they're good
troops, good troops get tired.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:55.760
And the Germans -- because
I mentioned earlier,

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.990
the Central Powers had less
manpower than the allies --

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.900
they could not rotate
their men off the line.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.640
When you're on the line,
you stayed on the line.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.390
And individuals would
maybe go on leave,

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.330
but groups of soldiers would not
be taken off the line together.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.800
The Allies had that luxury.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.460
They could take a whole unit off

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.520
and put a whole new unit
on the line to rest.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.630
Also, when were they last in battle

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.590
and what's their morale
and level of supply?

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:27.660
If they have low morale
and they're not being fed,

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.340
maybe that's where
you want to attack,

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.650
because they're going
to maybe give up easier.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.530
And if you can create a hole in the
enemy line with one of these units

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:38.610
that has low morale or low supply,

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:44.010
you could compromise their
entire defense in a given area.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.290
And so, that opportunity was a kind

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.640
of opportunity the planners
would look to exploit.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.550
And they would present this
information to commanding officers

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.630
to make decisions about operations.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:01.210
The last map I'm going to mention

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.000
of the military kind
here is a planning map.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.210
This is a map from the
Meuse-Argonne, and these kind

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.390
of maps have a particular look.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:15.390
They show something called
jumping off points here,

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.060 position:56%
where units would begin in a battle.

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.920
And they would follow a line
of progress, [inaudible] line.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.130
They were given a sector.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.190
"You stay in your lane
and I stay in my lane,

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.240
and we move forward together,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.250
so that we don't get
salience in our line.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.310
We don't want to have one group
go forward, and a group next

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.850
to it stays behind, because that
protruding salient then becomes

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.500
vulnerable to attack on two sides.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:49.030
We want to move together along
the same axis of advance.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:51.550
And so, this is the beginning
of the Meuse-Argonne offensive,

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.770
all the way up to November
11 on the armistice,

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.260
where we pushed the Germans back.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.630
Now, I mentioned in the
beginning, weapons were important

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.840
to [inaudible], and the greatest
weapon in the most effective weapon

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.170
of the war was artillery,

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:17.010
responsible for some 60 plus
percent of all casualties.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.530
These are some of the various guns
that the American army employed,

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:26.630
from this field artillery
here to this railgun

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.840
which could shoot some 20 miles.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.610
And it would lay waste
to the landscape.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.220
Forested areas would just turn

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.780
into effectively something
looking like a lunar landscape.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:47.050
The amount of devastation that they
could deliver was incredible --

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.710
incredible in a very
dark way, of course.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:55.570
What makes this possible are
maps to direct this fire.

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:56.890
They're not just guessing.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:51:01.470
They're firing at known points.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.710
Towards the end of the war,
the mapping was so accurate

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:10.890
that they felt that they could hit
something that had an air factor

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:14.890
of maybe 50 to 20 yards of being
off if they just used a map

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.160
with no pre-firing, where they
could see the round go down.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.370
And the spotter would call
back and say "Adjust."

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:24.160
They felt that they had mapped
it effectively, they could shoot

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.710
and surprise the enemy and
not give them a chance to move

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.310
and hit the target, and
that's very incredible.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.610
This is all analog.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.090
There's no digital,
GPS guiding this stuff.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.020
Yeah, it was amazing --
again, in a very dark way.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:46.760
This map here comes from one
of our special collections,

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.390
the John Heinz Collection,

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:53.630
and it shows America's first
artillery shock of the war.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:57.500
It's kind of a neat specimen
to have in our archive here.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:02.960
On October 23, 1917 at
approximately 6:30 AM,

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.590
Battery C of the six field
regiment, first field brigade,

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.530
first division -- have to get it
all in -- under Colonel Scott,

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:16.090 position:56%
Major Starkey, and Captain McLendon,

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:20.640
said to Sergeant Alexander
Arch, "Go ahead and shoot."

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:26.730
And Aches' battery is here,
and they take the first shot

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.920
against the Germans in anger.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.220
General Pershing said,
"That's a special gun."

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.490
Pershing is the commander-in-chief
of the American forces.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:44.450
He said, "Send that gun home,"
and that gun is in West Point now.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:48.750 position:56%
And the gun, incidentally, is French
make, 75 millimeter field gun.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:55.130
The United States Army, at
the time of World War I,

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.900
did not have a lot
of heavy ordinance.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:02.290
We were able to bring
bodies to Europe,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.620
but not necessarily
the gear to go with it.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:09.750
We had to use British and
French equipment to fight.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.400
This is very different
in World War I,

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.240
where we're supplying all the
Allies with various armaments,

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.830
like the British with
Sherman tanks and the Russians

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.960
with trucks, for example.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.710
So this is a very interesting
piece of history right here

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:30.000
from the Library of
Congress' collections.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.130
One tactic that made artillery

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.210
so devastating was something
called creeping barrage,

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:47.070
something developed by the British
in the Boer Wars of South Africa.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:53.000
Creeping barrage meant we want to
put the artillery fire in front

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.260
of our troops, and have that fire
move forward while our troops move

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.110
behind it to limit
the enemy's ability

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:03.250
to shoot our troops advancing.

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:07.700
In order to pull off this complex
maneuver, two things are important.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.520
You got to both know
where you're going to be,

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:15.630 position:56%
because you don't want the guys here
when the bombs are falling here.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.480
They want to be behind
these various rings of fire,

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.420
"curtain of fire" they called it,

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.530
and what time that
that would happen.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.720
So the artillery unit and the unit

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:30.760
in the field would share the same
map, and according to a schedule,

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.060
they would move together.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:37.550
And this was very effective
at blasting away barbed wire

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:41.280
and other enemy emplacements
along the way,

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.020
to reach the final objective where
then the infantry could charge

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.970
into the enemy trench
and take it over.

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:53.050
This particular map also
has a unique history.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:59.270
It's from the G and M Collection
by General Charles Summerall.

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:04.920
Summerall ordered an
attack on November 10, 1918.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.770
Does that sound significant to you?

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.950
Because November 11 is the day

00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:12.690
that the armistice is
going to take place.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.860
He ordered an attack,
because he was of the mind

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:20.700
that the Germans were faking,
that this armistice was baloney.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:25.550
They just wanted time to rest
and recover, and that we needed

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:27.070
to keep the heat on them.

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:33.710
So he orders troops to
cross the Meuse River

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:37.360
and to take German
positions on the other side.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.930
In this attack, some
360 plus Marines --

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.440 position:56%
not part of the Army but under their
command and some of the best troops

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:49.970
that we had at the time -- die.

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:52.830
It becomes a scandal
back in Washington.

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:57.840
Why did you send Marines
across a river

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.680
where the Germans had machine
guns on the other side,

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:06.100
to die on the next-to-last
day of the war?

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.800 position:56%
Pershing and other military
leaders came to Summerall's defense.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.910
They said, "We didn't know if
the Germans were going to give up

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.520
or not, and we had to
keep the heat on them."

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.800 position:56%
And Summerall was exonerated for any
wrongdoing, although the families

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:28.060
of the servicemen who died hated
him tremendously for this order.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:32.290
And this, again, is part of
the Summerall papers in the G

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.970
and M Collection that any
one of you want to come in

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:37.270
and review, it's available.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.770
Since artillery was so
dangerous, it's important

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:47.870
to locate the enemy's artillery,

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:50.740
and I talked about aerial
photography was one means,

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.890
patrol was the other.

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:56.790
But often, those methodologies
were insufficient to map

00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:00.800
where the enemy's artillery
might in fact be.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.360
Both sides develop something
called "sound ranging,"

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.240
and the technologies among
the different armies varied

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.100
and I'm going to generalize
what they did here.

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.960
This map by the U.S.
Army, using sound ranging

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:21.360
to detect German batteries
across the front lines.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:27.240
Microphones would be set
up along predefined points.

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.950
And when a gun would fire,
the sound would travel

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:35.130
and reach those microphones
at different times.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:38.720
They would calculate how long the
sound took to reach the vibration,

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:44.580
to reach the microphone, and
triangulate where the gun might be.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:47.880
This was so effective that they
could triangulate an enemy gun

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.780
within about 20 yards
by the end of the war.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:56.490
So what that meant was that if you
shoot, you got to move your gun.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.340
If you got to move your gun, that
means you're exposing your gun

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:05.330
to reconnaissance, so
you better make it count.

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:07.780
So this but the Germans, in
particular, in a predicament

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.470
because when they would shoot,

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:13.080
we would fire a counter
battery barrage right away

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.990
to blast their guns.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.410
They would try to move the
guns to a new hiding place.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:20.650
We would immediately send up
airplanes and look for them,

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.810
and we were hot on their
tail and they knew it.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:34.460
So trenches, of course, then, it
should be stated, is more important

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.490
because artillery was
so devastating.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:39.690
Where could you safely put
troops then on the front line

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.270
if these maps were so accurate,

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:44.640
and 60% of all casualties
are caused by big guns.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.140
How do we keep the troops safe?

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.440
And it was the trench.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.930
The trench was -- we think
of it as a terrible place.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:53.960
It's muddy, it's dirty,
it's got rats,

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.340
all kind of disease
in these trenches.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.010
Who wants to be in a trench?

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:03.350
But on a World War I battlefield,
the trench, generally speaking,

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.250
is the safest place to be.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:09.330
The problem with the
trench is getting out of it.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.910
And when they blow the whistle
and they say you've got to go

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:18.270
over the top to attack the enemy,
men were mowed down within feet

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:22.350
of their own trench line, because
the enemy had it pre-sited,

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:24.780
meaning they knew where
you would come out.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.020
There were snipers, machine
guns, their artillery,

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.970
and they were ready to blast away.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.850
This map here is what
we call a trench map.

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:38.150
It's a German trench map.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:42.650
We have British, American, and
many other versions of trench maps

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:46.770
in the collections of
the Library of Congress.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:52.650 position:56%
Trenches of World War I often were
organized what they call "in depth,"

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:57.160
meaning there was a main line
of defense, a secondary line,

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.550
and finally a third line.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.120
The idea here was that
that the enemy attack.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.530
We have light forces in
the front to screen them.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:12.890
Should we need to, we would
fall back to the second line.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.460
The advantage of this is
they sent men over the top.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.180
They had taken this position.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.480
We fall back here.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.850
Our artillery is back here.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:28.570
We have this all mapped out
very nicely, and we're happy

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:31.760
to blast our own front
line trench to bits,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.100
now that the enemy has occupied it.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.950
And this was a trick that
the Germans would use.

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:39.950
And the Americans, because
we entered the war in 1917,

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.880
we were a little bit
slow to pick up on this,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.800
although our Allies
warned us about it.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.670
And we would occupy
their trenches and stay.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:52.630
And the French were like, "You
need to keep going forward."

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:56.110
And after a few blasts -- and
this happened a few times --

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:59.470
our commanders adjusted
and said, "You can't stay.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:04.140
You need to move to the
second line and to safety."

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:11.280
Incidentally, this map is
from the area of Verdun,

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.620
an important battlefield
of World War I.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:19.320
Verdun was a very political battle.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.030
The Germans said in 1916 when
they were unable to take France

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:27.830
by mobile warfare, that
they would wear the Allies

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.130
out through attrition.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:32.380
And they said, "The French
will defend a very historical

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:37.440
and sacred city of Verdun with
as many troops as it takes.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.710
So we will force them
into this cauldron

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.170
and kill as many as possible."

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:47.910
And the German field
commanders were appalled

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:52.820 position:56%
by this high command decision
because they said, "You're asking me

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.670
to order my men to fight,
not to gain an objective

01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.020
or ground -- something tangible.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.530
You're asking my men
just to go out and fight

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:05.330
and kill until they get killed.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.980
How can we sustain this?"

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.550
Whereas on the French side, they
said, "This is our territory.

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:12.850
This is our land."

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:15.230
It became a sacred battle
for the honor of France,

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:19.360
and they staved off the
German offensive here.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.130
And it was a high cost
of life to both sides.

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:28.820
The ground was virtually just
stagnant -- the trench lines.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.250
One of the last maps I want
to show you of the war here is

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:40.970
of the armistice, 11/11/1918.

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:50.540
This map was initially a secret
map showing the final disposition

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:56.280
of forces as they would stand
when the armistice was to begin.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.800
The Allies had in the field at
this time some 280 plus divisions

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.510
that were well fed, rested,
high morale, good supplies.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:11.730
The Germans had 180
under-strength divisions.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.240
They were called division on paper,

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.930
but maybe they were half
strength, even less.

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.560
They weren't getting food.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.510
Their guns were being worn out.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:24.310
The barrels were so worn that
they couldn't shoot straight.

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:32.040
They realized that the Americans
have now come into the war in 1970

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.550
and advancing against us.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.830
And Americans, incidentally,
put some 2 million troops

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.800
into battle against the Germans.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.100
It was just too much.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.750
They were tired, fighting
since 1914.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.410
The Americans come along,
very fresh, energized.

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:47.900
They bring this new momentum.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.260
The Allies start the hundred days
campaign against the Germans,

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.610
and it culminates with
this armistice on the 11th.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:06.420
So Germany before this happened,
wanted to look for a way out.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.100
They said, "What can we do

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.450
to preserve what we
have taken in this war?"

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:14.560 position:56%
And I know I've been focusing on the
Western front, but I want to bring

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.450
in a map from the Eastern
front because it is important

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:21.790
to understand the German
psychology at the time,

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:24.410
and then leading to World War II.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:32.160
So the map here, this says,
"Our march in the East.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.540
The facts versus the lies."

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:40.920
The Germans took all this
territory on the Eastern front

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.270
from the Russians in this area

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:46.420
that eventually would
become Poland, okay.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.930
They were hugely successful
against the Russians.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.750
And in fact, the allowed
Lenin who was in Switzerland,

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.220
passage to Germany into Russia.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.760
And they gave him money
with the thought being

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.430
that this guy is crazy enough
to bring followers to his side

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:12.430
and to get the Russians
out of the war.

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.220
And he was successful.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.290
The Russians had sent
millions to their deaths

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.300
on the front lines,
lives of casualties.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.600
They didn't want to fight anymore.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.900
There were tired.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.360
The Communists took control.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.060
They negotiated a peace
with the Germans,

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.660
and the Germans took all
this land, the Baltics,

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.450
Ukraine, all this, Poland.

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:33.700
This was all the German
Empire in the East.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.350
And we see that here
also on this map printed

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.390
by the United States Committee
of Public Information.

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:40.690
See all this territory?

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.820
The pink is the land
which the Germans

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.420
and the Austro-Hungarians
extended their empires,

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.550
Belgium, portions of France.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.960
This was in 1917.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:56.620
And the Germans say at this point
in time, they start talking,

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.810
"Let's settle this, Woodrow Wilson.

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:04.320
You're the great negotiator
for peace.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.980
You want us to sit down
and talk about this?

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.820
We're happy to end the war now.

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:14.130
Because the Germans realized,
"We can't push them away.

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.920
We've tried our best.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.220
What can we do?

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.580
So let's negotiate."

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.460
But the Germans had
infuriated the United States.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.180
As you know, they sunk
the Lusitania.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.240
They were sinking other ships
of ours, acts of sabotage

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:36.080
within the United States such as
blowing up the ammunition depot

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.590
at Black Tom Island in New Jersey.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:44.060
Up here in Baltimore, there
is a place called Hansa Haus.

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.560
It still exists, and the
Germans had a legation there.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:55.110
They brought in spies by submarine
to recruit German-Americans

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:59.120
to engage in acts of
spying and sabotage.

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.680
And then, they tried this plan
called the Zimmerman Telegram

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.530 position:56%
which you may have heard about,
where they wanted to enlist the help

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:10.210
of Mexico to occupy
the United States

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.910
so it wouldn't come to Europe.

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:15.720
All this had come to the attention
of the American leadership,

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.070
and when these overtures for
peace started to continue,

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.370
Woodrow Wilson was pushed
beyond his limits and said no,

01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.120
to the relief of the
British and the French.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.240
No, we're not going to
entertain any peace overtures.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.430
If you want peace, you're going
to move back within your borders

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:42.360 position:56%
and you're going to be
responsible for paying for this war.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.860
And this Committee on Public
Information was the American

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.470
propaganda apparatus, and would
put out all these different kind

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:52.560
of publications about teaching
Americans about Prussian militarism

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.200
and the rape of Belgium and
all these kind of things.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.330
And maps were one of the means

01:07:57.330 --> 01:08:02.190
which they communicated why
America ought to be in this war.

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:06.480
As you know, America was
very culturally diverse.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.710
Millions of Germans living
in the United States,

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:14.940
people from the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, Irish.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.330
These folks necessarily
didn't have a vested interest

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:21.310
in seeing England succeed,
for example.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.750
How do we communicate

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:26.730
to our population why
this war is important?

01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:30.970
And these kind of propaganda
maps were used by both sides.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:41.580
Germany, as we know,
eventually gives up its military,

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.380
has over the reins to
a civilian government,

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:50.050
and since them the Versailles
to negotiate for peace.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:54.210
It's a convenient way to blame
them for anything that goes wrong,

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:58.330
because the German military had
held the power of the country

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:02.050
in their hands since 1914
once they went to war,

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:05.750
and it was effectively a
military dictatorship in Germany.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:12.890
Now they send these
civilian diplomats to France,

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:20.930
and the German diplomats are
shocked by the terms of the peace.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:25.850
They said first off, you must
accept total blame for the war.

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:30.610
You must pay reparations.

01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:36.700 position:56%
Your proud Prussian militarism, your
German army, is going to be reduced

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:40.050
to 100,000 men with
no heavy equipment,

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:43.800
essentially a territorial defense.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.100
So that's the heart and soul

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.000
of the Germans is their
army, their military.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.200
It hits at the gut.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.170
And on top of that, you're
going to lose territory.

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:58.470
They're forced to concede
Alsace-Lorraine to the French.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.940
The Rhineland and the
Ruhr Valley here

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.880
in the East is Germany's
industrial heartland.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.480
This is where the big
weapons factories are.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.300
This is going to be occupied --

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.740
this surprises a lot of
folks -- by American troops.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:22.440
In the South -- French,
British, and Belgian.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.710
We're going to occupy
that for several years,

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:27.830
and the French will be
the ones there the longest

01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:31.980
until the early 20s
before they withdraw.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.590
In the East, land is
going to be taken

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:40.550
from Germany and given to Poland.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:46.990
As you may know, during World War I
Poland does not exist as a country.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:52.080
Its historical territory was
divided between the Germans,

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.410
Austro-Hungarian, and the Russians.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:58.970
Woodrow Wilson makes it a point
of war in his famous 14 Points

01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:03.110
that there must be a free
Poland with access to the sea.

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:04.860
How are they going
to make that happen?

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.040
They're going to take
land from the Germans,

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.980
because the Russians are not
going to be giving up any land,

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.790
so the land comes from the Germans.

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:19.060 position:56%
A new country forms, Czechoslovakia,

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.140
and within it is an area
called the Sudeten land

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:28.800
where Germans are living and forced
to live under Czech authority.

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:35.750
So this creates a situation where
millions of Germans are now forced

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.580
to live under the authority
of other governments.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.550
Germans are blamed entirely for
the war, rightly or wrongly,

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.180
and their proud military has
been taken away from them.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.290 position:56%
German soldiers, unlike their Allied
counterparts, when they go home,

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:56.900
they don't take off their uniforms.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.370
They stay together and they
form barracks and cities

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:05.510
and they call themselves Freikorps,
and they act like they're still

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:11.020
in the Army, and they don't want
to be dismissed from their jobs.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:19.090
And among these Freikorps is
a corporal named Adolf Hitler.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:26.500
Hitler had the very dangerous job
in World War I of being a runner.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:30.270
He would leave the safety
of the trench and go back

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:33.360
to the headquarters and
communicate what was going on,

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.310
often in the middle
of artillery barrage.

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:39.920
The folks who did this
didn't live very long often.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.410
It was very dangerous
to expose one's self

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:46.100
out of a trench under fire.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:51.180
He received medals for
his bravery, and he,

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:56.660 position:56%
like many other German military,
were thinking, "Why did we give up?"

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.550
Right? "We have all
this land in the East."

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:03.560
Right now at the time of
Versailles, their army was still

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.520
in situ in these areas, okay.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.460
They didn't want to move out.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.110
They said, "Grant us this land.

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:11.410
We won it.

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:13.870
We paid for with our blood."

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:19.660
And when they were finally forced
to come back home, the notion was,

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.440
"We're stabbed in the back.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.600
We did this for country,
for the Fatherland,

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.550
and now we have been forced to
give it up against our will."

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:35.720
And so, thinking about the next
war, in the minds of Germans,

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.130
people like Hitler, and
veterans of the First World War.

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:42.440
We think, "Oh, it's
crazy to invade Russia."

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.570
But they felt, "We did
it once and we won.

01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:47.510
We can do it again."

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:49.640
Something to think about.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.690
And I think maps tell that
story better than anything else.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:01.820
And lastly, I'm going to
with this illustration

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.880
of saying, "To end all wars."

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:10.780 position:56%
Right? We see that they are going to
bury German militarism and the fires

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:16.010
of hell, and Uncle Sam is within
your gleefully with a shovel,

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.310
and his top hat says, "Lusitania."

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:23.530
This image can be seen online at
the Library of Congress' webpage.

01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:28.200
And Allied powers are happily
depositing German militarism

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:34.490
to the grave, which we know comes
back again in the Second World War.

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:36.290
Thank you very much.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:39.050
[ Applause ]

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:40.850
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: Okay,
let's please take our seats,

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:44.790
and I'd like to introduce
our speaker.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:48.760
I think you'll agree that the first
talk by Ryan had a heavy focus

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.130
on the US, very appropriate.

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.830
We're going to now have a
speaker from Great Britain.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.840 position:56%
Professor Peter Doyle has come over.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.360
He's a PhD, of course, and
he's a visiting professor

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.970 position:56%
at the University College in London.

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:13.290
His topic is Gallipoli
and the physical aspects,

01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:18.210
the geographical aspects
of that battle.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.630
It went on for almost a year.

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:23.820
It was a disaster personally
for the First Lord

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.530 position:56%
of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:33.360
And it has a strategic,
let's say, outlook.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.580
Ryan had described those Central
Powers as being basically four --

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:45.850
Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:50.110
If this Gallipoli campaign
had been successful,

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.850
it would have at least
separated out the Ottomans.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:16:00.960 position:56%
So, Peter Doyle has spoken at West
Point at least twice that I know of.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.390
He's got a very interesting talk.

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.980
Without any further ado,
I will invite him up now.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.680
And also say that the
Q&amp;A will be combined

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.960
with the two speakers immediately
after Professor Doyle's talk.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.760
Peter?

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.060
[ Applause ]

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.360
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Can we
pick up these lights?

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.970
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: Yeah,
he's going to get it right now.

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.420
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Okay, well,
difficult act to follow,

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.660
Ryan's exposition on
the First World War.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.560
So, I'm going to try
to follow that up.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.090
I was going to draw upon a number
of things that Ryan said today.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:40.910
I wanted to concentrate on the
battle which has a great deal

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.600
of mythology associated with it.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.900
I'm also going to be
looking at a map

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:49.190
that that became a
scapegoat for failure.

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:54.290
So, here we have a map which was
used not only to plan a campaign,

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:57.400
but one that was also blamed
for the failure of a campaign.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.230
It's very important.

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:02.600
So obviously from my perspective,
I know where Gallipoli is

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.840
and I know what it's about,
but I'd like to know how many

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.360 position:56%
of you have even heard of Gallipoli?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.160
So, can we get a show of hands?

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.440
Excellent, so I have
an informed audience.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.340
And how many of you think that
it was only the Australians

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.410
that fought at Gallipoli?

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.250 position:56%
Okay, so still an informed audience.

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:20.050
That's good.

01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:22.530
So what I want to do then
today is to take you through

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:27.070
and examine the concept of
Gallipoli, of terrain, of maps,

01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:30.320
on our failure in the
Dardanelles in 1915.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.040
Now, I'm talking about mythology.

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.020
The mythology of Gallipoli is
one of the most important aspects

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:42.850
of the historiography
of the campaign.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:45.290 position:56%
What we're looking at is a pathology

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.960
that makes its way
into popular culture.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.780
We have an American comic book
from the 1960s that summarizes,

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.650
in effect, what the
Gallipoli campaign is about.

01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:59.760
Tens of thousands, it says, who
died and fell on hard beaches there

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.540
at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.040
It was a campaign that
was doomed to fail.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.680
And if you look at this, the
mythology goes that the campaign,

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:14.170
of course, were doomed to
fail because of its geography.

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:20.180
It was also doomed to fail because
of its planner, and the planning

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.020
that went into that campaign.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:28.480
And specifically, it was
also a let down by its maps.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.570
And so, if we follow the mythology
through, was this actually true

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:36.480
as the American comic
book here portrays.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.310
"I say, old chap, this map

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:41.090
of Gallipoli is only
a hundred years old."

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:43.010
"Probably nothing has
changed since then."

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:46.990 position:56%
Is this really the way to run a war?

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.300
So I want to examine
what the truth is.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:53.720
I can say categorically at this
point, that without Gallipoli,

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.350 position:56%
we probably wouldn't have the
success in the invasion of Normandy.

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:06.100
But really, was that something that
we want to portray Gallipoli as?

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:11.900
So let's look at the road to
Gallipoli, the road to the war.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.890
Now, as Ryan has eloquently
put forward to us,

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:18.830
this is a war that
has erupted in Europe.

01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:21.990
A war that has seen all

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.570 position:56%
of the alliances putting
themselves together, and we've heard

01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:27.040
about the Schieffen plan.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.930
We're also bringing in the
personality of one man,

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:35.830
one very important man, and
that man is Winston Churchill.

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:40.130
Winston Churchill, as you
know, is a man who is credited

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:43.770
in the Second World War as being
a great orator and a great leader

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:48.980
and somebody who saved the British
from destruction in many ways.

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.960
But what we're seeing is,
during this great war,

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.440
he was what was known as the
First Lord of the Admiralty,

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.060
typically British, I guess.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.240
The leader, the civilian
leader of the Navy.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.810
And he wasn't happy that
one of these enemies --

01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:10.210
that is, the Ottoman Empire --
had the audacity to have two ships

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:15.950 position:56%
from the Germans, the Goeben and the
Breslau, selling to the straights

01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:19.160
of the Dardanelles, pitching
up at Constantinople,

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.640
which is present day Istanbul.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.100
And this was thumbing
the nose at the British.

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.380
That precipitated perhaps
the alliance

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:28.510
with the war and also
following that.

01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:32.590 position:56%
It probably would be better
without the light, that's all right.

01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:34.520
I don't mind being behind that.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.280
&gt;&gt; Excuse me just one second.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.710
This light has been turned
on because the people

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:42.060
who are filming this say they
just have to have that light

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.530
on for the -- So if
it's possible to move

01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:48.870
so that glare isn't hitting you --

slides that I'm concerned about.

&gt;&gt; Try aiming that light possibly to
the left a little bit then, please.

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.550
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Shall I continue?

01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.850
&gt;&gt; Just wait, just
one second, please.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:01.650
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Certainly.

[ Background Conversations ]

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.340
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer:
Carry on, Peter.

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.640
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Thank you.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.040
Yes, I will, amongst the
arguments in the corridor too.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.340
That's interesting.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.410
Anyway, thank you very much.

01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:34.710 position:56%
So, Winston Churchill, the two chips
have gone through, the Germans,

01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:37.150
their influence over
the Ottoman Turks meant

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:40.320
that the Ottoman Turks
were now an enemy.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.840
And Winston Churchill, a man
who had a Navy at his disposal,

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.210
and let's not put too
fine a point on it --

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:52.670
it was the finest and strongest
Navy in the world at that point.

01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:54.820
So Winston Churchill has this Navy.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.790
He wants to do something with this.

01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:59.380
Not only does he have a
Navy, he creates an army

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.000
out of this [inaudible] sailors.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.160
He was constantly thinking
about how he could take the war.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.110
And one of the ideas was he
could knock the Ottoman Empire

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:09.280
out of the war using a Navy.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.320
So he hopped back a hundred
years or so to the concept

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.660
of forcing the Dardanelles,
the idea of creating a Navy --

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:24.080
see if I can get this to work --
creating a Navy that would be able

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.090
to force its way through
the Dardanelles.

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:27.720
There is the Dardanelles passage.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.780
There is the Gallipoli Peninsula.

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:34.120 position:56%
These are a line of ships that would
literally force their way through,

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.720
bombarding the fortresses
as they went.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.580
Now, that sounds great on paper.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:47.310
The trouble is, is that admirals,
once they start to lose ships,

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:53.170
those ships full of men, thousands
of men, then the admirals taste

01:22:53.170 --> 01:22:57.200
for forcing their way through
started to wane a little bit.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.690
And so, by the 18th of
March 1915, a day which is

01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:04.870
in present-day Turkey
a public holiday,

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:07.000
we see the failure of the campaign.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.290
No longer could they force the
way through the Dardanelles,

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:14.040
pitch up at Constantinople, and
do what the British do best,

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.960 position:56%
which is threaten the city there and
hope that they would be defeated.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.260
Ships were sunk.

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.560
Men were lost.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:27.100 position:56%
The Navy turned back, and it was
relied upon for boots on the ground.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.070
You can imagine when I
give this at West Point,

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.510
that's where I get the
biggest cheer -- for that.

01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:34.410
[ Laughter ]

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:36.380
So, the Navy withdrew.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.240
The Army has to come --
the Army and the Marines.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.450
And landings therefore on a hostile
shore would then be necessary.

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:47.660
And if you look at any of the
doctrines of amphibious landing,

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.720
landing on a hostile shore is
of the most difficult order.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.180
So it was a gamble.

01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:58.410
This look at this gamble.

01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:02.730
Here, we can see the peculiar
shape of the Gallipoli Peninsula.

01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:05.070
We can see the narrowness
of the Dardanelle Straits

01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:08.070
and we can see its location
there in Turkey, in Europe.

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:13.430
Turkey had been shrinking in size
because of various Balkan wars.

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:17.290
The landings weren't there to
actually just take the Peninsula.

01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:23.160
The landings were there to silence
the guns and remove the minefields

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.140
to allow the Navy to do its job.

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:29.730
So they were actually
supporting the Navy.

01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:32.710
There were some possible
landing places.

01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:35.050
These lending places had
been surveyed already.

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:39.260
They had been in place since
the early 19th century.

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:43.830
At this location here to the
neck of the peninsula Bulair,

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:46.250
ironically this was
a fortified zone,

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:50.390
fortified by the Anglo-French
Army during the Crimean War,

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:56.300
when the Ottoman Turks were allies
to the French and the British.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.540
There was also the
possibility of landing

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.900
on the Asiatic shore,
as it was called.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:05.550
Remember, this is the junction of
two continents, Asia and Europe.

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:07.560
So, there's a possibility
of landing there.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.950
But if you land there, you're
going to get lots and lots

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:14.050
of angry Turks on your
back, in effect.

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:19.390
And so, remaining are these
beaches here across the peninsula,

01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:24.180
both at the point here at Cape
Helles to this location here

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:28.840
at Gaba Tepe, or here, an
unknown place in Suvla Bay.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.920
All of those things, landing
places had been surveyed

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.780
and were in position.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:40.330
And by April 25, 1915,
just under a month

01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:45.650
after the Naval attempt had
failed, the British, French,

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:48.110
and Australians landed here.

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.640
Did you know the French
were at Gallipoli?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.920
No? One thing, just the one thing.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:59.330
So we can see Anzac -- Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps --

01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:03.370
the British 29th division --
a strange echo, if you like,

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:05.840 position:56%
of the 29th division at Omaha Beach.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.470
There are comparable issues there.

01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:11.880
And the French Corps de
Orient landing there to take

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.970
on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:18.960
Now, one thing that we have that
they didn't have was any kind

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.420
of satellite imagery, obviously.

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.930
What we can see from this satellite
image is a very peculiarity

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:30.870
of this landscape, the challenge
of the geography of Gallipoli.

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:32.940
Well, first and foremost, you
have the distance you have

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.240
to travel in a straight line.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.300
It's 230 miles from the
entrance to the Dardanelles

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.690
to Istanbul (Constantinople).

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:45.650 position:56%
But getting there means jinking your
way through here and a long way,

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:50.970
and you can see the offset and all
the strange coastline of Gallipoli.

01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:54.470
That's because we have the
junction of two tectonic plates,

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:56.210
and therefore lots
and lots of breaks

01:26:56.210 --> 01:27:00.400
which have created this
parallel coastline and fractures.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.400 position:56%
So we can see how we get these
lines of fractures which are picking

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.760
out for us the landscape
of Gallipoli.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.600
That was going to cause real
problems for the British

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.660
and Anzac troops and
French who landed there.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.130
It also means that we have a rugged
terrain because as the faults

01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:22.970
and fractures operate, so
they uplift the landscape.

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:27.510 position:56%
So just like the bad land topography
that we have in your Southwest,

01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:30.270
similar kind of situations
and uplifting landscape

01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:32.460
and down cutting, we
have exactly the same

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:36.490
in miniature here in Gallipoli.

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:40.370
And so, understanding this terrain
was essential to military success.

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:42.950
If you look at the doctrine
of amphibious landing

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:44.920
from your own United
States military,

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.390
you will see that that is written
large in understanding that.

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:51.780
Because those men, with
their boots on the ground,

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.130
have to fight not only
against the enemy

01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:56.000
but also against the topography.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.140
And how are they going to know
what the topography is about?

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.550
Well, they do that through maps.

01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:07.590
So, this is where the
map myth comes in.

01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:11.630
Here we have General Sir Ian
Hamilton, ramrod straight

01:28:11.630 --> 01:28:15.720
as you can see in typical
British fashion.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:17.490
He was the most senior general

01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:19.910
that was not directly
employed at that time.

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:25.260
In Kitchener, who was Secretary of
State for War, was his superior.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.240
Hamilton looked up to
Kitchener and a great way.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.230
Kitchener was a man
who took no fools

01:28:31.230 --> 01:28:34.850
and listened to no kind of excuses.

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:37.050
Yet, Hamilton made those excuses.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.490
Hamilton was put in charge
of the Gallipoli campaign.

01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:40.790
He was really experienced.

01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:43.140
He fought in the Anglo Boer
War, and yet he wrote --

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:48.770
he was a very literary general --
he wrote after the war these words.

01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:53.250
"Ten long years of General Staff
created after the Boer war.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:56.880
Where are your plans for
an amphibious landing?"

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.180
None, he is saying.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.450
"And it may have well been
the moon that I'm invading

01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:05.680
because I just don't
have any information."

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.830
Now, one has to ask
oneself, is this true?

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:11.390
Written in 1920.

01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:15.190
Remember that after the failure
of the Dardanelles of Gallipoli,

01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:22.180
Hamilton's career, esteemed and
distinguished, was in tatters.

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:24.640
What we do know is
what he has written

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.560
down about how he was
instructed to invade.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.610
The problem is, who is it
that's writing about this?

01:29:32.610 --> 01:29:33.930
So we can see here,

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:39.150
Brigadier-General Aspinall-Oglander
was a colonel,

01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:43.920
senior staff officer,
with Hamilton in 1915.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.210
And so, when he's writing here,
he's defending his old chief.

01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:49.770
And what he's saying is that
Hamilton, when he was briefed

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:53.530
by Kitchener, very, very brief

01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:57.600
because Kitchener didn't mince
words, he got some instructions.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.400
In essence, go and
take the Dardanelles.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.540
A handbook of the Army
-- Well, that's okay.

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.540
That's only a couple
of years out of date.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.740
Everything like this will
ultimately be out of date.

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:11.020
But two other elements
-- a prewar report

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:14.930
of the Dardanelles defenses kind of
implying that it was substandard,

01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:19.360
and a map which is specifically
considered to be inaccurate.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.950 position:56%
In other words, their setting up the
mythology that the map is at fault,

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:30.890
trying to hide perhaps that
Hamilton might have been at fault.

01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:34.340
So, what did they actually get?

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:40.420
Well, we have the War Office
Handbooks that were provided.

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:46.870
But we also have a whole range of
other reports, 1905, 1909, 1908.

01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:49.140
All of these things
had been prepared

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:53.500
because Britain was cautious
about the Ottoman Empire.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.950
Remember that Great
Britain was involved in many

01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:59.260
of the Middle Eastern
states and Egypt

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.920
in particular with the Suez Canal.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.070
Oh, and there was that map, the
map which creates the mythology.

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:14.670
This map of two sheets of 1 inch to
1 mile map, 1 to 63,360 scale map.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:20.590
So, the corrective
to this is one man,

01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:22.950
another general, General Callwell.

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.950
Callwell, cautious in
his British speech,

01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:30.920
director of military operations
in the British War Office,

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.670
and a man who had been
involved in military planning

01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.070
and had actually been
involved in the preparation

01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:41.390
of those military reports in the
early part of the 20th century.

01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:46.230
So, if we try and unpack this,
Hamilton had been informed

01:31:46.230 --> 01:31:49.620
with information as to the
various possible landing points.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:53.000
He's saying Hamilton knew
about this information

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.820
which was fairly correct
information,

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:58.510
and that fairly correct
information about the interior.

01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:02.740
So again, he's saying,
"Yes, I'm being cautious."

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:06.170 position:56%
But he's also talking about the map.

01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:09.580
He's saying that in the
absence of regular surveys,

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:12.960
the maps supplied were
necessarily untrustworthy.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.930
What he means is the only maps
that were available were yes,

01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:21.230
inaccurate, but that's all we had.

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:26.110
That's the necessary inaccuracy
here with respect to the ground.

01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:31.120
So Callwell is saying, "Hamilton,
you're overstating this."

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.050
Let's see whether what's
being said is true.

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:39.110
Okay, so let's examine to the
components of the briefing.

01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:44.010
The War Office secret report on
certain many places in Turkey.

01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:47.320
Remember Hamilton saying, you know,
"I didn't have any information.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.620
I didn't know where to go.

01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:52.750 position:56%
I didn't have anything that would
allow me to land in Constantinople."

01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:54.810
Well, what about the map?

01:32:54.810 --> 01:33:01.060 position:56%
The War Office map, the Geographical
Section of the General Staff 2285,

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:06.880
1908 map, the map of the
Peninsula of Gallipoli.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.690
Okay, so let's look at
"Certain Many Places in Turkey."

01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:15.330
This is a fat, big
report with two sections.

01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:19.900
He was drawn up in response to
one of the many, many disputes.

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:23.910
This one the Aqaba Crisis
of 1906, which is a dispute

01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:28.730 position:56%
between drawing the boundary between
Egypt and Syria -- sounds familiar.

01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:34.360
The diplomatic argument between
Britain and the Ottoman Empire,

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:38.150
which meant that they needed
maps to provide information

01:33:38.150 --> 01:33:41.090
for any future boots on the ground.

01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:45.600
A report which has
lots of information

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.800 position:56%
about the Gallipoli Peninsula, about
locations there in the Dardanelles,

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.760
the Dardanelles itself, and
the Buliar lines as mentioned.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:00.450
It's a book that Hamilton is
saying has barely any information,

01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:04.440
and yet we have maps and
plans really valuable,

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.850
lots of detail here.

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.310
And topographical panoramas.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:12.270
You remember this is an amphibious
landing, and for sure what you want

01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:16.040
to see is what you see from
the sea, moving on to the land.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.250
And so, there's topographical
panoramas.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:25.310 position:56%
We also have the very, very detailed
specifics of fortifications.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:31.120
This is Seddel Bahr, at the
entrance to the Dardanelles.

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.420
And panoramic photographs
with annotations,

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.390
once again providing information.

01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:40.450
Let's remember, this is 1914,
1915 that this is being operated.

01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:45.510 position:56%
This had been developed in 1909,
we're not a long way from the detail

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:48.540
that we can provide in
1916 [inaudible], again,

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.280
as Ryan has explained to us.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.750
Okay, so was this information
any good?

01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:56.760
Well, the report gave
all the details

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.960
of the batteries, of the defenses.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.640
So sure, it's good.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.520
It also identified the nature
of the terrain from the sea.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.820
Well, it's an amphibious landing.

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.330
That's what you want.

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:11.120
And for sure, it influenced the
choice of the landing beaches,

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.010
and Hamilton deployed
that information.

01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:16.820
And yet, Hamilton postwar is saying
he didn't have enough information.

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:21.490
Well, he certainly
used that information.

01:35:21.490 --> 01:35:24.480
What about maps?

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.930
Maps that the Phillips Society
and the Library of Congress

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:31.890
who I'm very grateful to for
bringing me here to do this,

01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:33.410
a great honor for me
to talk about it.

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:35.740
Let's look at that map.

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.940
Yet another product of the
Aqaba Crisis, derived though

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:46.550
from an earlier survey, a survey
made by the French in 1854.

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:51.350
I will pronounce this
particularly well,

01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:53.840
but it's the "Carte de la
Presqu'lle de Gallipoli,"

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.200
okay, produced in 1854.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:59.820
We've heard again from Ryan about
what was available to the allies

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:05.210
in 1914 and '15 in France, a
map of similar quality to this.

01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:09.500
This had been surveyed in
1854 during the Crimean War,

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.620
and this is a 1 to 50,000 scale.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:15.510
So actually, this is a larger
scale map that had been produced

01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:19.970
for the mainland of France,
constructed most likely

01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:22.860
with theodolite and plane
table to give the angles,

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.950
to get the locations, similar

01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:27.300
to domestic survey
that was carried out.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:32.150
And at a scale of 1 to 50,000, it
had contour intervals of 10 meters,

01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:36.820
giving you a map which has
a fair amount of detail.

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.740
So let's look at this map.

01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.110
It's fairly handsome.

01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:44.010
It's black and white.

01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:48.380
Those of you in the audience
who are acquainted with that,

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:51.750
which I would count as
everybody, would understand

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:55.620
that this map is telling you this
is a tough terrain to work on.

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:58.330
Straightaway, you are
identifying the ruggedness

01:36:58.330 --> 01:37:00.490
of the terrain by the
contour interval.

01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:02.150
You're picking out the readings.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:05.260
You're picking out the way in
which the water is flowing.

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:09.870
Across here, you can see the
gray location of high points.

01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:12.190
There are terrain annotations here.

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:14.010
There is a feature
called Gully Ravine

01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:16.960
which became a major
part of the battle.

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.830
And we can see here Achi Baba,

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:25.290
a location which became a British
obsession but never, ever taken.

01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:26.700
I spoke to Turks on the ground.

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.740
They said this would be Verdun.

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.750
The British would never take this.

01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:34.960
It was always going to
be in Ottoman hands.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:39.160
So, at 1 to 50,000 scale,
equivalent in quality.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:42.620
Was this really the map
that has no information

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.240
that Hamilton is talking about?

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.630
Well, to be fair, we're
looking at something

01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:49.670
that the British thought
they could improve on,

01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:52.240
which is probably a bad thing.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.480
That map was regularized.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.810
The British wanted it to
be 1 inch to 1 mile 1 mile.

01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:04.390
You measure an inch, on
your map you've gone a mile.

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:11.550 position:56%
So they make this really strange
adjustment to 1 to 63,360 scale map.

01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:15.110
And they also increase
the contour interval

01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:18.290
to 31 meters, a hundred feet.

01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:22.450
That immediately creates something
which looks much more open,

01:38:22.450 --> 01:38:24.110
perhaps difficult to
see in this light,

01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:26.900
but you can see how there
are fewer contours here.

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.460
Now you, as experienced
individuals, will know full well

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:35.130
that even this map has information
upon it because these contour lines

01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:38.180
at a hundred meters separation
still quite close together,

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.900
still picking out a ravine, still
picking out the major points.

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.200
So this is Gully Ravine.

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.530
This is Achi Baba.

01:38:44.530 --> 01:38:47.530
There are terrain annotations
on the full sheet also,

01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:50.000
so it is giving information.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.660
But the change in scale
does cause problems,

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.400
and those subdue the
terrain features.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.350
So I've talked a lot about
the mythology of the map,

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.880
but maybe now I am erring
towards -- Well, hold on a minute,

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:08.330
maybe this map is not as
good as I had first made out.

01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:10.190
Was it valuable?

01:39:10.190 --> 01:39:13.600
And there's a corrective that I
have to point out to you here.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.000
Well, the map depicted the same
features as the French one before.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.710
The French one was still
available to the British.

01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:23.080
The French map was
the only medium --

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.880
I would call it necessarily a large
scale map -- that was available.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.510
There was no choice but to use it.

01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:29.810
You can't conjure up.

01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:31.280
You can't do a satellite survey.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.640
You can't conjure up an
aerial photographic sweep.

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.030
This was enemy territory.

01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:40.500
And by the way, we're talking about
1914-1915 where your aircraft,

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.450
as Ryan has pointed out,
are very, very flimsy.

01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:46.220
But the problem was
that the redrawing

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.770
of this map created the
mythology of the scapegoat,

01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:53.950
that this had an effect of subduing
the features of the landscape.

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:56.090
Okay, great.

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:59.130 position:56%
I'm thinking, okay, well, why didn't
they just use some other maps?

01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:02.070
You know, if that one's no
good, use something else.

01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:05.730
Maybe the story about
them combing the bookshops

01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:08.250
in Alexandria was correct.

01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:09.940
To be honest, what
map are available?

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.240
Hardly any, if any.

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.520
There are some prewar surveys
carried out by British military

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:24.820
and naval officers, often
surreptitiously, clandestine,

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.730
because of these crises
that I've mentioned.

01:40:28.730 --> 01:40:31.960
There was a single
small-scale location map,

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:39.260
very similar to the image I
showed you of the satellite scale.

01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:45.190
And tellingly, there were
no large-scale Ottoman maps.

01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:48.140
So, not even the Ottomans
had a map, be it to a scale

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.990
that could be used
in a military sense.

01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:57.200 position:56%
The 1 to 25,000 survey, very similar
to the scales used for military maps

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:01.250
that Ryan has referred to, was
completed only on the eve of war.

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:06.770
So that meant that
the British 1 inch map

01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:11.110
and its derivatives was the only
map available to the Allies,

01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:15.830
so bemoaning it is yes, it
is a difficult map to use

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:17.130
but it's the only one you've got.

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:20.650
So if it's the only one
you've got, get on and use it.

01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:21.950
Okay, so here you go.

01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:24.310
This is what's known as
the quarter inch map.

01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:28.860
This is the map that
shows 1 to 250,000 scale.

01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:31.960
It's pretty useful and that
it shows you how Gallipoli

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.130
and the Peninsula works in
the Dardanelle Straights.

01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:39.490
It was printed in 1908, so again,
it's a derivative of those maps

01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:41.600
and its strategic, not tactical.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.070
We've heard this again from Ryan,

01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:47.970
in that different maps
are doing different jobs.

01:41:47.970 --> 01:41:52.610
This was issued to the British
forces because it gave them an idea

01:41:52.610 --> 01:41:56.370 position:56%
of where they were in the world,
and therefore they needed to be able

01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:58.540
to get larger scale
maps to work it out.

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:01.200
It still was used though,
as you can see here,

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.070
with the little red annotations
showing the landing beaches

01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:05.370 position:56%
in the southern part of [Inaudible].

01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:09.860
Okay, what about the older surveys?

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:12.470
These are the ones
surreptitiously carried out

01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:16.310
or done under diplomatic cover.

01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:23.090 position:56%
There was one by Captain Grover of
the British Royal Engineers in 1876.

01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:27.610
Grover was operating under
diplomatic support because, again,

01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:32.340
the British and French were allied
to the Ottomans at this point.

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:36.800
There were also surveys of
the Bulair lines, these very,

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:42.060 position:56%
very important fortifications across
the narrowest part of that location.

01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:43.900
So there was lots of that
information available.

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:47.830
I want to take you to
looking at Grover's survey.

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.360
This is entirely prescient,
because what Grover is talking

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.070
about are some of the
landing beaches,

01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:57.830 position:56%
because those landing beaches which
had appeared in the reports early on

01:42:57.830 --> 01:43:01.900
and the reports in 1909 were
the self-same landing beaches

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.200
that would be used again.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.100
The reason for that is,
they're the only landing beaches

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:08.910
on this rugged terrain.

01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:12.780
So Grover carried out a rapid
reconnaissance of the coastline

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:16.320
between two locations that
will become familiar to you.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:21.230
This place Gaba Tepe here, and this
location here, Fisherman's Hut,

01:43:21.230 --> 01:43:24.430
which still exists
today on this coast.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.510
If you look at this,
we can see something

01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:29.520
which looks fairly impressive.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:36.150
It's a scale of 4 inches to a
mile, 1 to 15,000 plus or minus.

01:43:36.150 --> 01:43:40.620
But what we get is a sense of
the rapidity of the mapping here.

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:42.830
It's a stylized form.

01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:46.820
We don't see very much
the rugged terrain

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.200
that I will demonstrate
to you in a moment.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.140
We're getting really a sense of
this relatively smooth point.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.580
This is the heights to Sari Bair,

01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:59.210
which is a mountain
area in this location.

01:43:59.210 --> 01:44:03.000
So, getting a sense of
stylized, smoothed contours,

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.330
really done in haste, but we do
have topographical annotations.

01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:13.550
Scrub, impossible cliffs, difficult
beaches, precipitous cliffs,

01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:19.740
that kind of thing -- all of
which was available to Hamilton.

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:22.570
So, I've mentioned about the maps

01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:25.100
that were produced
on the eve of war.

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:29.990
And here we have an Ottoman map
with a beautiful Ottoman script --

01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:33.630
Ottoman calligraphy, of course, is
amongst the finest in the world.

01:44:33.630 --> 01:44:37.210
And what we see here is the
map of the Cape Helles area

01:44:37.210 --> 01:44:42.080
that was once reputedly owned
by General Liman von Sanders,

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.530
the German commander of the
Ottoman troops in this location.

01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:49.740
This resides in the National
Archives in the United Kingdom

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.990
and the originals in the
equivalent in Australia.

01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:57.960
This emphasizes the fact that these
maps might have been available

01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.960
to somebody as senior
as Liman von Sanders,

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.050
but they were just not available

01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:06.090
to the British, French,
or other allies.

01:45:06.090 --> 01:45:11.310
The reason for that is, they were
literally surveyed between 1912

01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:18.330
and 1914, and the issue of them
was probably only in 1914 and 1915.

01:45:18.330 --> 01:45:21.620
So, pretty much they're having some
intelligence services that have

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:24.050
to do a lot of hard work
to get a hold of these maps

01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:28.640
if they had not actually yet
been issued to their own troops.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.110
So once again, we have the
only map that's available

01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:40.370
to the Allies is the ill-fated
and godforsaken 1 inch map.

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:44.140 position:56%
Okay, so what I want to do now is to
take you in more detail down to two

01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:48.310
of the main locations of
the Gallipoli Peninsula.

01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:55.240
We're talking about what is now
known as Anzac Day, April 25, 1915,

01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.220
when the landings were made
of the wild colonial boys

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.720
of the Australians
and New Zealanders.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.790
They were the ill-prepared,
unpracticed, untested troops

01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:12.410
with a little bit of
colonial verve sent to fight

01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:15.390
up these really difficult terrain.

01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:21.770
In the South, the British 29th
division, professional troops,

01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:25.210
fought long and hard in
Britain's small wars,

01:46:25.210 --> 01:46:29.000
sent to take the biggest
nut to crack at Cape Helles.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.860
An idea behind them was to rise
up the high ground, join forces,

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:41.230
[inaudible], dispose of the guns
and dispose of the minefields.

01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:42.550
That's the idea behind it.

01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:46.480
The terrain here is
different in both locations.

01:46:48.710 --> 01:46:52.520
So, this wonderful spot -- I had
to Photoshop my son out of this

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.180
to make it look more military,
but he was only a little boy then.

01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:03.050
This wonderful spot, a magnificent
beach, is very similar in many ways

01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:07.160
to the killing beaches of Omaha.

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.540
We have cliffs, we have
narrow slot-like drawers,

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.330
as the Americans would call
them after Omaha Beach.

01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:17.660
And we would imagine here
the men coming ashore,

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:20.560
wading ashore here
into the face of hell.

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:27.340 position:56%
So, what was the plan at Helles,
sending the most experienced troops?

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:29.550
Well, it was to split the force

01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:36.700
because what we have is Hamilton
has a large force of 80,000,

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.820
but not large enough really
to take the Peninsula.

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.120
I'll come into that in a moment.

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.160
He split them according to
these very, very small beaches.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.200
They were narrow, they
were constraining.

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.090
They were that way inclined
because of the drainage each went

01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:56.700
in a rectilinear pattern,
down the line of the Peninsula

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.210
because it's lining
up with the faults,

01:47:58.210 --> 01:48:01.990
the fractures, the
tectonic features.

01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:04.410
We can see an open -- what
we could call a glacis,

01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:07.430
very typical of any fortification.

01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:10.890
And we can see the rising
ground, and the idea here is

01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:14.900
that there are no artillery
pieces being landed at this point.

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.950
It's an amphibious landing.

01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:18.510
There are no tanks.

01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:20.680
There is no chance of
bringing field guns.

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:22.350
You need the Navy to do their job.

01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:25.080
A naval gunnery is low trajectory.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.980
So you've got a low-rising slope.

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:30.800
You can hopefully sweep
that with those guns.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.160
The idea behind it -- to get to the
prize of dominating the narrows,

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:40.850
of allowing those Navy
boys to get through.

01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:45.840
But that's assuming that
nothing is happening on land.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.620
And so, Hamilton is
writing almost begrudgingly,

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.970
how dare they organize for defense?

01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:57.210
"The Peninsula is being fortified
and many Turks work every night

01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:59.120
on trenches, redoubts,
and entanglements."

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.110
How dare they?

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:04.780
Because the Turks and the Germans

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:07.730
who are operating here
knew what they were doing.

01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:11.890
The Turks have fought many wars
before this -- the Balkan wars.

01:49:11.890 --> 01:49:13.780
They had fought against
the Italians.

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:15.100
They fought against the Bulgarians.

01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.660
They fought against everybody, and
they had lost a lot of territory.

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.080 position:56%
So they were fairly battle hardened.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.490
They knew what they were doing.

01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:26.240
The trench lines here were
following the contours.

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:30.300
There were strong points,
machine-gun posts, barbed wire put

01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:33.190
in position to stop the
troops coming ashore.

01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:35.240
There were hillsides.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.140
Again, very, very similar to
the kinds of fortifications

01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:41.750
that were put in place
before Normandy,

01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:48.280
with Rommel placing his defensive
positions on those D-Day beaches.

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.860
So, the Turks were ready.

01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:53.660
They were also capable and
they were able, of course,

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.730
to use the terrain effectively.

01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:01.430
So that meant that the
1 inch map, of course,

01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:04.040
needed extra embellishment.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.980
So there were reconnaissance
sketches.

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:08.490
Here's a reconnaissance sketch
in the National Archives

01:50:08.490 --> 01:50:12.490
in the UK showing some
interpretation

01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:15.490
on the map -- very much sketchy.

01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:19.420
And there were also aerial
interpretations literally

01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:24.880
with an aviator in a very, very
rudimentary aircraft with a map

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.390
on his lap, drawing on the position
of trenches and other things,

01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:31.140
because we're not getting
aerial photography

01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:35.320
at this particular
stage of the campaign.

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.890
Yes, we have panoramic sketches

01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:40.310
because every military
officer today, as then,

01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:43.240
was trained in the art
of panoramic sketching.

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.740
And we can see just how difficult
these individual landing beaches

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.080
would be in the face
of such a terrain.

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:56.040
Now, I want to look at the map.

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.710
I've said about this a mythology.

01:50:57.710 --> 01:50:59.920
I sort of overemphasized that.

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.450
Let's actually now take
a more objective view.

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:04.490
Did the map do its job?

01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:06.770
Well, here's the French one.

01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:08.940
This is at the tip
of the Dardanelles.

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.520
And here's the British one.

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:17.520
And I think as you'll see, there's
a change in the view of that map.

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.980
What we have is a much
more open terrain.

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.900
Doesn't seem to have the same
level of detail as the French one.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.200
That's because of the contouring
and the change in scale.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:36.880 position:56%
We can see one or two hill features,
Hill 114, Hill 138, and Hill 141.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.420 position:56%
These were all named by the British.

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:42.290
On the French, we can
pick out contouring.

01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:44.740
It gives us a sense of
the hills and [inaudible].

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:48.550
On the British, just spot heights.

01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:50.780
I should also point
out that each one

01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:56.380
of the beaches is a concave
situation, and if you look

01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:01.480 position:56%
in any manual of amphibious warfare,
you avoid these like the plague

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:05.770
because they create
[inaudible] fire from two sides.

01:52:07.150 --> 01:52:11.700
There's also just about picked
out on the French one a kind

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.750
of feature known as Guezi Baba,

01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:17.140
which is totally absent
on the British map.

01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:20.040
Why does this matter?

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.200
Well, let's look at one of the
maps that was captured in April

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:27.870
and May 1915 as the
Allies started to land.

01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:31.930
This is an Ottoman map, mapped
to the scale of 1 to 25,000.

01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:34.830
British cartographers looked
at this and said, "Yeah,

01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:39.560
it looks a little bit too good
to be true, but pretty accurate."

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.770
We can see all of the
features on here.

01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:45.090
Hill 114 with nice contouring.

01:52:45.090 --> 01:52:47.990
Hill 138, similar kind
of contouring.

01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:52.430
We see that Hill 138
and Guezi Baba nearby,

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:55.130
part of a similar terrain feature.

01:52:55.130 --> 01:53:00.600
That was completely missed on
the maps and the annotations.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:07.070
But let's not forget these maps
were not available to the Allies.

01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:08.510
So what is this matter?

01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:11.680
Well, this is a map that was
carried out by Commander Douglas.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.260
He was a naval commander
and cartographer.

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:17.240
He did a survey post war --

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:21.410
well, post to the initial landings
during the campaign to give a sense

01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:22.710
of what the British had to face.

01:53:22.710 --> 01:53:25.950
There was a lot of sort of
recrimination and discussion.

01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:28.760
He puts on all of the trench lines.

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:33.330
He shows the point that has the
British land at W and V beaches.

01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:36.460
The intention was that they
would join up and join forces,

01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:40.860
also with men coming ashore here
which I haven't put on -- X beach.

01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:45.980
They would then take the Turks in
the rear there, remove the threat,

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:48.530
and push on up the Peninsula.

01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:52.090
But what's been forgotten
here is the effect

01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:55.120
of that missing fortification.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.180
So yes, the map failed
in this instance.

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.030
So, let's look at that.

01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:07.780
We can see here the concavity
of that, the bowl shape,

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:10.190
the sense that the
trenches built by the Turks.

01:54:10.190 --> 01:54:15.670
Follow the line of that
bowl, with the obvious effect

01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:19.310
that when the British
landed, they thought,

01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:20.610
"Right, there's no fire here.

01:54:20.610 --> 01:54:21.910
Everything's fine."

01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:25.670
As soon as they got on the beach,
the Turks used their [inaudible],

01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:27.750
their knowledge, their experience.

01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:30.350
Held their fire until
the British were ashore,

01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:34.350
and poured fire into those men.

01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:37.040 position:56%
From Guezi Baba over here, Hill 141,

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.560
and from the line of
the Turkish trenches.

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:44.060
The same is true here at W Beach.

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.840
Limestone outcrops.

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.990
This is a line of dunes here.

01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:50.100
We can see here the narrow beach.

01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.670
All of this had barbed wiring.

01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:56.210
All of these trench lines that
followed this concave area.

01:54:56.210 --> 01:55:00.760
All picked out, of course, on
the reconnaissance surveys.

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.630
And we can see the most
effective kill zone.

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:07.190
As the men were struggling
through the barbed wire here,

01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:12.410
they were facing an onslaught
of fire to try and get ashore

01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:14.940
and move and move on its way.

01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:18.900
And you can see now, can't you,
why it was and why it still is

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:21.540
that Gallipoli is studied
by the US Marine Corps

01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.620
in considering amphibious landing,
and why this had an element

01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:28.070
on the doctrine of D-Day.

01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:33.620
Okay, so let's shift
away from Helles.

01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.310
Yes, the map failed a bit there.

01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:38.660
Let's look at the Anzac territory.

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.720
Badlands, okay, a bit like
South Dakota or Arizona,

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:45.780
places I've had the honor to
visit in your beautiful country.

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:49.450
And what we can see here
is the incredible element

01:55:49.450 --> 01:55:51.500
of the landscape here.

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:54.250
This tortuous land --
doesn't look anything

01:55:54.250 --> 01:55:58.640
like Grover's survey of 1876.

01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.940
What was the plan here?

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.240
Difficult to see, I'm afraid,

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.910
but what we can see here is this is
Sari Bair, the range of the hill,

01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:08.710
which is badland topography.

01:56:08.710 --> 01:56:10.040
Another from Gaba Tepe

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:14.770
to the narrows is a
transport corridor, a valley.

01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:16.070
The Turks knew that.

01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:17.400
They fortified that.

01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:20.450
They created a kill
zone of field artillery.

01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:22.810
They defended that
as far as they could.

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:25.470
So, there was no way that
the Allies could lend there.

01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:28.260
Instead, the Anzacs would land --

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:29.890
Remember, they were
the untrained guys

01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:34.640
who felt could be able
to combat the terrain.

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:38.510
Very few Turks here,
relatively unopposed landing.

01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:43.560
Very much more combined with the
terrain, a difficult challenge

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:47.490
for the men to get up into
that challenging environment.

01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:50.690
So the idea was that they would
rise up, go on one of these ridges,

01:56:50.690 --> 01:56:55.370
hit the top of that hill,
rise over the top, get down

01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:58.080
and help the other
guys who had landed

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.650
at Helles and take the narrows.

01:57:00.650 --> 01:57:05.170
Okay, so let's look at
one of the mythologies.

01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:07.080
You speak to any Australian.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.560
They'll tell you how the
British generals failed them.

01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.860
They'll tell you how they
landed in the wrong place.

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:13.410
How the British generals
had no idea.

01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:15.930
Part of the enduring mythology

01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:21.750
of the Australian male
at the current moment.

01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:25.120
So, is there any truth
in that [inaudible]?

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:31.180
The first, second, and third ridges
-- one here, one there, one there.

01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:33.420
These are going to be important.

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.420
General Hamilton, literary man,
a man who swept his arm and said,

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.220
"Right, we will take this area."

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:45.430
He is saying, "Let's go
from Gaba Tepe to Suvla Bay.

01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:49.530 position:56%
So he's saying, "Look, chaps, if you
land here can you take the ridge,

01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:52.380
everything will be fine."

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:58.630
General Braithwaite, his chief of
staff, a bit more constraining.

01:57:58.630 --> 01:58:00.800
"Hold on a minute, Hamilton.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:04.310
Our men need some very small
specific landing locations."

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:07.770
Again, the doctrine of
amphibious landings is you have

01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:10.860
to plan and plan again.

01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:14.000
Now Braithwaite is saying,
"Let's say north of Gaba Tepe,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.080
which is heavily defended,
to the Fisherman's Hut."

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.380
Remember Grover's survey?

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:23.600
That area of the Gaba
Tepe to Fisherman's Hut.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.730
The Admiral, Admiral Thursby,

01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:28.460
on the 10th of April is
saying, "Hold on a minute.

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:30.040
Let's reduce that a bit."

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.770
Now, I know it's the same in
the US as it is in Britain.

01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:35.340
The Navy doesn't speak to the Army,
the Army doesn't speak to the Navy,

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.640
and the Marine Corps in the middle.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.140
It's exactly the same
situation happening here.

01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:43.330
So what we're seeing here is that
Thursby is altering the plan.

01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:45.940
He's saying, "Well, let's reduce
the scale of it a little bit,"

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:49.120
whereas Braithwaite is saying
somewhere between that.

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.790
And Thursby, on the
night of the landings,

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.090
is saying, "I'll tell you what.

01:58:52.090 --> 01:58:53.500
We'll reduce it even further."

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.560
So all of these messages are mixed,

01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:57.910
and nobody is really
getting that message.

01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:00.070
So it means that when
the Anzacs finally land,

01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:01.700
we struggle ashore here in

01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.840
yet another concave
location, largely unopposed.

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:10.080
They then have to fight
their way up the ridges.

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:14.400
And it's that which is the butt of
contention, because some historians

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:18.150
or popular writers are
saying that the map failed.

01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:19.900
The British land them
in the wrong place.

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.810
Not only did the British
land them in the place

01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:26.690
which had been long held, the
map accuracy had very little

01:59:26.690 --> 01:59:28.410
to do with the landing place.

01:59:28.410 --> 01:59:31.430
So we can't blame the map.

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.180 position:56%
This look in more detail at the map.

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:34.880
Let's look at those ridges.

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.180
Okay, there's our French map.

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:39.840
You can see beautifully detailed.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.140
Is it accurate?

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:42.660
Well, that's another question.

01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:47.730
There's our first ridge, second
ridge, and third ridge going

01:59:47.730 --> 01:59:50.710
up [inaudible] to the
ridge top at the Sari Bair.

01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:58.530
The British map in this case, not
massively different to be honest.

01:59:58.530 --> 02:00:03.800
Just a little bit less
detail, but again, first ridge,

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:05.700
second ridge, third ridge.

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:09.840
And those ridges feature in
all the British landing plans

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:13.060
because Australians and New
Zealanders would fight their way

02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:15.410
up these ridges to get to the top.

02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:17.240
Okay, they land here,
get up that ridge.

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:23.730
If they land here, get up
this one, and this one.

02:00:23.730 --> 02:00:26.900
But the problem is that
the maps that the British

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:31.050
and the French had didn't pick
out what the Ottoman maps did

02:00:31.050 --> 02:00:34.770
at a scale of 1 to 25,000.

02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:36.900
This is what subsequently
has become known

02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:39.440 position:56%
as Anzac Cove, as it is still today.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.630
We see the first ridge
there has a plateau,

02:00:41.630 --> 02:00:44.610
now known as Plugges Plateau.

02:00:44.610 --> 02:00:47.000 position:56%
The second ridge also has a plateau.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.870
These plateaus become very
important because as the Anzacs,

02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:53.980
who have not fought a battle
before, are rushing up the slope

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:55.880
in darkness, they get
to a bridge top.

02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.180
What do they do?

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.480
They dig in.

02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:00.240
Once you've done again, the
battle is, in effect, over,

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:03.060
because you have to, as
Ryan has pointed out again,

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:05.910
get out of those trenches and
fight the enemy eventually.

02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:07.220
You can't sit there forever,

02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:10.150
not if you've got a very
precarious beachhead.

02:01:10.150 --> 02:01:13.680
And then, this is the
bone of contention,

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:16.450
because not only do you have
a plateau on the first ridge,

02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:23.340
you have no means of getting
across because that is impassable.

02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.800
There is the razor's edge.

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:29.790
Believe me, that is the literally
centimeters -- inches wide.

02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:33.080
And so, men trying to get across
here stumbling in the darkness.

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.470
No chance.

02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:37.250
The actual opportunity was lost.

02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:42.810
So stuck on those plateau
tops, the Anzacs would stay

02:01:42.810 --> 02:01:48.120
on those plateau tops
throughout the whole campaign.

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.930
But let's remember, those maps
were not available during the war,

02:01:52.930 --> 02:01:56.420
and are in the planning
stage of the war here.

02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:02.190
And also, there were no aerial
photographs that could depict that.

02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:04.330
So, what I'm saying then,

02:02:04.330 --> 02:02:09.160
is that the battle was really
dependent on the mapping and maps.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:11.490
But it was also dependent
on the planning

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:15.310
that was going into that campaign.

02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:17.110
What became known as the
Battle of the Beaches

02:02:17.110 --> 02:02:21.800
in April 1915 was the
battle or battles

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.670
that lost the Gallipoli campaign.

02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:31.520
Because at Helles and at Anzac,
the tenacity of the troops

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.590
that were facing them, the failure
of the troops to get on shore,

02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:40.610
the loss of speed and the
development of inertia

02:02:40.610 --> 02:02:44.790
as they were starting to be held by
the terrain and the Ottomans meant

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:49.140
that the stability of
those situations meant

02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:52.320
that the war was effectively lost.

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.970
So, at Helles and at Anzac,
we have beach has established,

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:59.290
and those beachheads
would have to be supplied.

02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:00.900
They would have to be improved.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:04.570
They would have to be therefore
mapped in more greater detail.

02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:08.120
So we're now looking at
the latter part of 1915,

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.110
when on the Western front,
new techniques were starting

02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:15.240
to be derived, starting to be
considered in terms of mapping.

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:20.190
They had some sense of being
able to capture the maps.

02:03:20.190 --> 02:03:22.510
So, what we have here is the new 1

02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:25.990
to 20,000 scale maps based
on Ottoman originals.

02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:28.490
There was a maps officer
that was associated

02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:33.340
with the Egyptian service,
British Army, name of TE Lawrence.

02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:35.970
You might've heard of him
-- Lawrence of Arabia.

02:03:35.970 --> 02:03:39.580
He was involved in the
production of maps there.

02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:41.420
The British took this
very, very seriously

02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:45.470
and created their own series
of 1 to 20,000 scale maps

02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:50.350
with artillery squaring,
again as explained by Ryan.

02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:55.250
There are also aerial
photographic plans.

02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:57.470
We can see the trenches here.

02:03:57.470 --> 02:04:01.300
We can see how this has
been built into a mosaic.

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.650
Photo rectification is very, very
difficult at this stage in the war,

02:04:04.650 --> 02:04:08.520
but these are being used now to
try and match up with each other,

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.700
and we can start to see the
production of sketch maps.

02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:17.020
We also get the production
of mosaic photographic maps,

02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:19.230
which this was done by the
Royal Naval Air Service.

02:04:19.230 --> 02:04:22.230
The British, at that time,
had a Naval Air Service

02:04:22.230 --> 02:04:24.980
and an Army Air Service, and
they were obviously still

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:26.280
not cooperating.

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.210
But anyway, what we're
seeing here is a production

02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:36.140
of an aerial photographic map from
this service of the Royal Navy.

02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.590
And then we get the
production of trench diagrams.

02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:44.000
We are now going from the broader
scale down to the minutiae.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.450
We need the largest
possible scale of maps.

02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:50.730
And what we have is the production
of so-called trench diagrams,

02:04:50.730 --> 02:04:54.330 position:56%
which are precursors to trench maps.

02:04:54.330 --> 02:04:57.780
These trench diagrams are picked
out by aerial photographic survey

02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:01.020
and by trench raids and by
prisoner taking, all those things

02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:04.700
that again Ryan has helped us
understand, at a scale of 6 inches

02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:10.160
to a mile here, which is 1 inch to
29.3 yards, which is interesting.

02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:13.990
We can see all of the
various trenches here,

02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:19.430
all named after a range of
locations and places in Paris

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:22.700
or wherever it might be, and we
can see the locations of those.

02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:26.750
And that gives rise to the kind of
trench mapping that we start to see

02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:32.310
at this point in the Western
front as the Allies got serious

02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:34.110
about creating trench maps.

02:05:34.110 --> 02:05:38.920
In the trench mapping is actually
a nod towards the realization

02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:41.240
that you are stuck where you are,

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:44.820
and that every small
point in detail matters.

02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:49.880
It doesn't mean they're
going to win you the war.

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:55.510
So, the increased survey effort
were pretty much to no avail.

02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:58.680
Trench warfare, from the failure
of the Battle of the Beaches,

02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.220
became an attritional battle,

02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:02.790
just the same as we had
on the Western front.

02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:04.400
The inertia had said in.

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.550
What Clausewitz called "friction"
had meant that we are no longer

02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:12.030
in a position to be
able to take the front.

02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:16.310
The frontal assaults, both at Anzac
and at Cape Helles, where thousands

02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:19.370
of men were losing their lives,
not necessarily on the beaches

02:06:19.370 --> 02:06:21.610
of Gallipoli as the US
comic book pointed out,

02:06:21.610 --> 02:06:27.470
but actually in the killing
fields of the peninsula.

02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:30.180
And then, there were new landings.

02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:35.560
In August at Suvla Bay, a complete
and utter disaster, a waste of time

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.850 position:56%
with the most inexperienced
general you could possibly think of,

02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:43.110
simply because that
general was most senior.

02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:48.670
The campaign had been lost
in April, not afterwards.

02:06:48.670 --> 02:06:51.910
And once in April, we are
looking at the loss of that.

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:53.870
There was nothing else
that could be done.

02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:58.390
No amount of surveying could
win the war for the Allies.

02:06:58.390 --> 02:07:00.930
So to finish up, did Hamilton
have everything he could?

02:07:00.930 --> 02:07:02.230
Well, yes he did.

02:07:02.230 --> 02:07:03.530
He had the maps and the plans.

02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:04.980
They were the best available.

02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.050
The maps, the plans
were all that he had.

02:07:08.050 --> 02:07:09.620
There were no new surveys.

02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:12.470
The Ottoman Turks had
them -- nobody else.

02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:14.950
And there was no means
of carrying out a survey.

02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:17.270
So yeah, those maps were done
with the best of intentions

02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:20.520
and the capability of these working

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:24.030
in a foreign country
with allies perhaps.

02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:27.490
What we can say is, that the maps
themselves were not themselves

02:07:27.490 --> 02:07:29.270
responsible for failure.

02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:33.420
They contributed to it by things
like the missing [inaudible]

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:35.750
or the location of razor's edge.

02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:39.690
But he can't blame a
map for the failure.

02:07:39.690 --> 02:07:44.330 position:56%
You have to think and be honest, is
that the campaign is not only doomed

02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:47.680
by the geography of this location,

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.700
but it was also failed
by its planners.

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:57.720
You can't send 80,000 men to face
50,000 to 60,000 men on the ground.

02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.420
Normandy, there were three times

02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:03.380
as many Allied troops
as they were German.

02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:06.020
So this was lost for
the want of resources,

02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:11.300
not lost because of a map, and it
was one by its tenacious defenders.

02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:14.540
So it's incumbent upon me to just
say that we must remember all

02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:17.900
of these troops, tenacious
defenders, all of those allies

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.620
who fought in this
beautiful landscape.

02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:23.370
I'd just like again to thank you
very much for inviting me here.

02:08:23.370 --> 02:08:24.670
Great honor for me.

02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:26.080
Great pleasure to talk to you.

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:29.270
And I'd like to thank Ryan and
everybody else, the directors here,

02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:31.940
and the Phillips society for
this great honor bestowed on me.

02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:33.740
And thank you very
much for listening.

02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:41.040
[ Applause ]

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:42.340
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: I'd
like to thank you, Peter.

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:44.180
This is a very high-energy talk.

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:45.480
Thank you very much.

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:46.890
We have some lights
please, and we're going

02:08:46.890 --> 02:08:49.370
to have a few minutes for Q&amp;A.

02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:51.770
So let's get Ryan up here please.

02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:53.630
And I'll tell you what.

02:08:53.630 --> 02:09:01.510
I'm going to stand down here so I
can be out of the killing field.

02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:06.230
[ Laughter ]

02:09:06.230 --> 02:09:09.670
&gt;&gt; Professor Doyle, a
few quick questions.

02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:13.930
Mapping elsewhere in the Ottoman
Empire, for the other options,

02:09:13.930 --> 02:09:18.070
for example, Kitchener was
looking at the [inaudible] option.

02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:21.310
Was there mapping to
support planning there?

02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:24.470
And secondly, at your
conclusion, do you think really,

02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:27.620
even if given very good maps
and all the other things,

02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:30.040
there was really anything
they could have done

02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.480
in 1915 to defeat the Ottoman?

02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.780
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Two very
interesting questions.

02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:36.080
The first one --

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:37.380
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: Excuse me,
[inaudible] behind the microphone.

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:38.680
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Oh,
bigger pardon, yes.

02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:40.130
The first one, I think
very interesting.

02:09:40.130 --> 02:09:42.890
Bear in mind, of course,
that the British were mapping

02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:44.190
in these locations.

02:09:44.190 --> 02:09:45.490
I'm an expert in this.

02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:50.650
I must draw my colleague
into Dr. Peter [Inaudible]

02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:51.950
who has worked on this.

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.950
But I can say that, for example,
Lawrence had been carrying

02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:57.010
out a whole range of
different mapping aspects,

02:09:57.010 --> 02:10:00.210
part of his archaeological
investigations,

02:10:00.210 --> 02:10:02.420
a lot of it clandestine
to try and do mapping.

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:05.090
There was a lot of work, of course,

02:10:05.090 --> 02:10:08.350
in that area because
of the Egyptian survey.

02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:12.230
That was very well
furnished with maps.

02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:14.240
How well, I couldn't comment on,

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:16.830
but certainly there was
a huge British effort,

02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:18.650
bearing in mind the
British involvement

02:10:18.650 --> 02:10:19.950
in that part of the world.

02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:22.850
The second question -- this
is one of those what if's.

02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:25.430
If you're looking for a "what
if" in the First World War,

02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:29.780 position:56%
then the big one is, what if the
Allies had got through in Gallipoli?

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:32.060
The critical thing here is
could the Navy have got through?

02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:33.360
Well, potentially.

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:36.520 position:56%
The Navy could only have got through
if the minefields have been cleared.

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.820
Could the minefields
have been cleared?

02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:39.210
Well, you need to take Gallipoli.

02:10:39.210 --> 02:10:40.870
Could you have taken Gallipoli?

02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:44.410
Well, you could have done if
you of had more men, okay,

02:10:44.410 --> 02:10:47.450
and if you of had more
resources, better planning,

02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:49.130
more opportunity to do that.

02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.000
Because once those men
are punched through,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.320
you're driving the Turks back.

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:55.810
Suvla Bay, when they landed at
Suvla Bay there were no Ottomans

02:10:55.810 --> 02:10:57.750
to speak of in their way.

02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:59.880
They could have driven
those men back.

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:01.460
With the maps have helped?

02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:02.980 position:56%
Well, maps are always going to help.

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:05.750
But bear in mind as soon as
a map is made, it's obsolete,

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:07.290
it's out of date immediately.

02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:09.040
So you can't blame a map.

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:12.030
This is a man who is
scapegoating this map, is Hamilton.

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:14.710
And I would say there's a chance.

02:11:14.710 --> 02:11:17.730
No modern historian would
argue there was a chance.

02:11:17.730 --> 02:11:19.780
Everybody would say it
was doomed to failure.

02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:21.710
But I don't know -- I'm
a bit of an optimist.

02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:25.250
Maybe, just maybe, if we had had
what we know now, if it had learned

02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:29.170
from the Gallipoli campaign
through Normandy and Inchon,

02:11:29.170 --> 02:11:31.260
all the rest of it, and
come back to Gallipoli,

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.560
maybe we would've taken it.

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.300
[ Laughter ]

02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:35.600
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: A
lot of good questions.

02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.430
Thank you very much for the
questions and the answers.

02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:39.480
Other questions?

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.780
Yes ma'am?

02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:44.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; This is out of curiosity, not
just for myself but for other people

02:11:44.130 --> 02:11:48.910
who might not be into war
history and know a lot about that.

02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:52.450
Could you talk about exactly
what you mean by failure?

02:11:52.450 --> 02:11:56.470
Because in my mind, there's
failure of the whole campaign,

02:11:56.470 --> 02:12:02.140
but there's also different levels,
of loss of life or equipment.

02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:07.420
And exactly how do
you define failure?

02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.090
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer:
Who is that addressed to?

02:12:09.090 --> 02:12:10.390
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle.

02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:11.690
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer:
The question is --

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:12.990
everybody else didn't hear it --

02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:14.780
how would you define
failure of this operation?

02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:17.010
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Well, it
depends who's speaking,

02:12:17.010 --> 02:12:19.660
because from the Ottomans,
this is not a failure.

02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:20.990
This is a success.

02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:28.160
This is celebrated as a great
victory over the Western powers.

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:33.960
Coming to your actual point, if we
step aside from Gallipoli a moment,

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.550
an argument last year in the
United Kingdom is, was the Battle

02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:39.180 position:56%
of the Somme a success or a failure?

02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:42.170
And in the Battle of the Somme,
as you may or may not know,

02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:45.150
there were 40,000 men
killed on the first day

02:12:45.150 --> 02:12:48.460
of that battle -- 40,000 men.

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.600
So, what we're considering here
is how do you measure success

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:52.970
and how do you measure failure.

02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:58.480
And in today's military atmosphere,
the loss of 10 men would be seen

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:00.650
as a massive failure in many ways.

02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:05.530 position:56%
We're looking at what become
acceptable losses to these officers.

02:13:05.530 --> 02:13:09.370
Now, in the Gallipoli campaign,
we break it down a little bit.

02:13:09.370 --> 02:13:11.310
The maps failed --
that's the argument --

02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:15.070
because it didn't provide the
information for the planners to go

02:13:15.070 --> 02:13:16.570
on and win that campaign.

02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:20.470
I'm arguing, well, that's
a scapegoating of the maps.

02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:25.360 position:56%
The campaign failed from the British
and French and Anzac perspective

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:27.370
because it didn't deliver
the objectives,

02:13:27.370 --> 02:13:30.260
which is to knock the
Ottoman Empire out of the war.

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.890
But lying on those beaches

02:13:31.890 --> 02:13:35.890
and in those hills were
thousands upon thousands of men,

02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:39.450
not only from the British,
Australians, and New Zealanders,

02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:41.850
etc. Also from the Ottoman Empire,

02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:44.900
who lost incredible numbers
of men at that point.

02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:48.230
So on that basis, could you
ever say that a battle that lost

02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:50.140
that many men was a success?

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:52.900
Possibly not, and maybe I can
bring Ryan into that in relation

02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:59.690 position:56%
to the last battle of the war, where
we see the Americans engaged here.

02:13:59.690 --> 02:14:01.090
Is that a success?

02:14:01.090 --> 02:14:02.390
Did that fail?

02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:03.980
Why was there a commission
to discuss

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:07.840
that where the general involved
was actually exonerated?

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.940
And Hamilton also was exonerated,
but shunned into the environment.

02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:16.120
So I think we have to be careful
putting a 21st century perspective

02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:17.420
on it.

02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:18.900
It failed because they didn't
achieve their objectives.

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:22.250
It failed because the maps didn't
possibly do what they wanted to do.

02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:26.920 position:56%
And in terms of a human tragedy, it
was a complete failure, I would say.

02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:31.530
&gt;&gt; Further to that, had those
losses been as great as they were

02:14:31.530 --> 02:14:37.290
in the objective achieved, it
would've been an expensive victory.

02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:40.470
But it is an expensive failure

02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:43.160
because the objective
was not reached

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:46.000
and the troops were
ultimately [inaudible].

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.180
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: And adding
a sort of a rider to that,

02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:51.690
the very fact that the
British and French thought

02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:55.100
that they could send ships through
-- obsolete is the word they used,

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.820
obsolete ships -- It
dawned on the admirals

02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:00.980
that these obsolete ships were
full of non-obsolete sailors,

02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:04.920
and it was at that point that
the campaign was really doomed.

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.310
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: We've got
time for a couple more questions.

02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:09.690
Are there any specifically
aimed at Ryan?

02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:16.390
&gt;&gt; Ryan, it wasn't part of your
talk, but when we were in Belgium

02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:24.630
in the [Inaudible], one of the
things that came through in terms

02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:31.730
of tourism was the
absolute massive loss

02:15:31.730 --> 02:15:35.510 position:56%
and suffering of the Belgian people.

02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:39.370
And one of the undercurrents
to that was now

02:15:39.370 --> 02:15:42.800
that this was simply
the fortunes of war,

02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:50.140
but that Germany was particularly
brutal in what they did in Belgium.

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:51.890
How do you feel about that?

02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:53.990
Do you think [inaudible]
accurate, or do you feel

02:15:53.990 --> 02:16:00.900
that was a consequence
of the circumstance?

02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:04.290
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: Okay, so
before I answer how I feel,

02:16:04.290 --> 02:16:06.850
I'm required to say
that this is my opinion

02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:10.580
and not the Library of Congress.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:15.130
So, I will venture into
these dangerous waters.

02:16:15.130 --> 02:16:17.430
Thank you for the question.

02:16:18.850 --> 02:16:23.250
One of the reasons that we see
the Germans being, in fact,

02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:28.550
very brutal towards the Belgians
is the von Schlieffen plan required

02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:32.880
them to move so quickly
through Belgium

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:36.310
to their final objective,
which was Paris.

02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:38.980 position:56%
The Belgians put up a tough defense.

02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:41.420
I mentioned some of the forts that
they had and the money they had.

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:44.190 position:56%
They could punch above their weight.

02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:49.880
They were very angry by being
delayed, and that they felt

02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:52.470
that the Belgians should
have just capitulated

02:16:52.470 --> 02:16:55.360
and allowed their troops
to go through.

02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:58.290
And so, this is one of the
reasons that they started

02:16:58.290 --> 02:17:01.420
to exact revenge upon the Belgians.

02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.920
And they were also looking back
to the Franco-Prussian War,

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:11.580
in which the Belgians had irregular
troops, meaning no uniform,

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:15.170
taking pot shots, sniper
shots at German troops.

02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:17.720
German troops before
the invasion were told,

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.530
"The Belgians are probably
going to do this again,"

02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:21.940
which we understand they did not.

02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:23.880
But anytime they would
hear a rifle shot,

02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:26.540
they'd say, "Hey, Belgian sniper."

02:17:26.540 --> 02:17:30.290
They would round up communities
and have summary executions.

02:17:30.290 --> 02:17:33.700
So it was a mix of the
plan and then the mindset

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:35.920
that the German troops
had before going in.

02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.920
I think that's the best way to
answer it, and it was very brutal,

02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:41.450
because war is a brutal thing.

02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:46.660
Also when they were starving from
the blockade, which I mentioned,

02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:49.090
that "We're not going to
get the Belgians food.

02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:51.890
It's going to come to Germany."

02:17:51.890 --> 02:17:53.190
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: Good
question, good answer.

02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:54.590
This is going to be the
last question right here.

02:17:54.590 --> 02:18:00.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how crucial was
that knifelike ridge?

02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:01.740
Which

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.040
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer:
On razor's edge?

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.030
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: The razors
edge was -- How crucial was it?

02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:09.000
Well, one of the problems we have
is, as the Anzacs are coming ashore

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.760
and the argument goes that they
landed too far to the north.

02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:15.230
That means they were
facing that first ridge.

02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:18.730
And as the first ridge breaks
down into the knifelike edge,

02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:22.510 position:56%
that means of course that they
can't progress but it's more complex

02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:25.630
than that because as the Anzacs
came ashore, not only did they get

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.980
up into that Pluggie
Plateau and face the ridge,

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:30.340
they were also swarming up in the
[inaudible] and the [inaudible]

02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:34.450
and all the other elements
of the terrain.

02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:38.670
So the argument is that that did
have the material effect on it,

02:18:38.670 --> 02:18:42.540
but the general argument is that
the terrain creates this inertia,

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:47.040
this friction, that as you are
losing momentum, you're starting

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:50.490
to consider the opportunity
to dig in.

02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:53.340
And because these men
were inexperienced,

02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:55.030
they started to do that.

02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:57.760
And there were also stragglers
-- this is not talked about.

02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.070
I'm not from the Library of
Congress, so I can say it.

02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:03.660
These men straggled back to
the beaches and there was a lot

02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:06.370
of concern from the Commander
Birdwood that they were going

02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:07.830
to completely lose that command.

02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:11.270
And that's where Hamilton
said dig in, dig, dig, dig,

02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:13.840
and dig into you get your security.

02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:16.270
And that's why the Australians
are called diggers in that way.

02:19:16.270 --> 02:19:18.330
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: As a
means of avoiding a retreat.

02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:19.630
&gt;&gt; Peter Doyle: Exactly.

02:19:19.630 --> 02:19:20.930
As a means of holding
on to what that is.

02:19:20.930 --> 02:19:24.800
So the razor's edge did have a role
to play in the terrain had a role

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.910
to play, but you can't blame
the razors' edges the only real

02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:31.120
significant feature
that caused the failure.

02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:34.510
&gt;&gt; Richard Pflederer: I wanted
to remind everyone that all

02:19:34.510 --> 02:19:40.060 position:56%
of us are invited to an open house
in the reading room of G and M. It's

02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.840
on the basement level, right?

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:45.800
I don't know which
one to get off of.

02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.260 position:56%
And it is starting in 10-15 minutes
and it will be going on for an hour,

02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:52.390
a chance to see some
displays and a chance

02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:54.300
to meet some more of the staff.

02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:55.780
I'd like to make a
couple of thank you's.

02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:57.080
Was that Ryan's idea?

02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:59.550
I like to thank the speakers.

02:19:59.550 --> 02:20:02.300
Think of the research that
went into both these talks.

02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:04.040
Thank you both very much.

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:06.470
[ Applause ]

02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:08.920
And I'd also like to thank the
audience for sticking it out.

02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:10.870
I know it's a long afternoon,

02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:14.590
and maybe somebody's lunch
hour was impacted by this.

02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:19.790
But thanks again, and we'll look
forward to another lecture series

02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:23.460
from the Phillips Society
sometime in the late fall.

02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:26.070
Thank you again, and
class dismissed.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.630
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:34.010
