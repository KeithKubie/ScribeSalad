00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.729
PROFESSOR: Before
we get started,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.180
let me ask you guys if
you have any questions,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.630
pragmatic or otherwise,
about the course so far.

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:43.550
Seriously?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.370
To those of you
reading newspapers,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.560
I encourage you to find
a slightly different time

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.230
to do so.

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:00.050
I really encourage you find
a slightly different time

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.810
to do so, thanks.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.065
So far we've done basic
rules of quantum mechanics.

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:11.730
We've done solids.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.355
We understand a lot
about electrons in atoms,

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:21.385
the periodic table, and
why diamond is transparent.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.614
One thing we did along the
way is we talked about spin.

00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:29.780
We found that when we looked
at the angular momentum

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.100
commutation
relations, these guys.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.420
We found that the
commutators are the same.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.630
For these commutators, we can
get total angular momentum, l l

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.900
plus 1 times h bar
squared for l squared.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.730
And h bar m for a constant and
integer m for angular momentum

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.970
in a particular direction, which
we conventionally called z.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.540
But we also found that there
were half integer values

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.250
of the total spin
and of the spin

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.710
in a particular direction
which, for example, with Spin

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.430
s as 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, et cetera.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.330
And we discovered that riding a
wave function on a sphere that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.980
interpreted these
states as states

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.560
with definite probability to
be at a particular position

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.270
on a sphere, a function of
theta and phi, was inconsistent.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.900
In order for the wave function
to satisfy those properties

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.400
that have those eigenvalues
and, in particular, half integer

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.780
eigenvalues, we discovered
that the wave function

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.210
had to be doubly valued.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.940
And thus it would equal to
minus itself, it equaled 0.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.480
So the rest of
today and tomorrow

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.100
is going to be an exploration
of spin, or tomorrow--

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.550
next lecture, is going to
be an exploration of spin

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.260
and the consequences of
these spin 1/2 states.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.917
Exactly what they
are, we already

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.750
saw that they're important
for understanding

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.810
the structure of
the periodic table.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.930
So we know they're there.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.740
And they're present
from the experiment,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.760
the Stern-Gerlach
experiment that we've

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.450
discussed many times.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.030
But before I get
onto that, I want

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.692
to improve on the last
experiment we did.

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:01.400
So in particular, in
this last experiment

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.770
we talked about the effective
mass of an object interacting

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.740
with a fluid or an
object interacting

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.790
with its environment.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.680
And why the mass of the
object that's moving

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.740
is not the same as
the mass of the object

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.440
when you put it on a balance.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.710
And that's this basic
idea of renormalization.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.890
And we demonstrated that.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.450
I demonstrated that
with a beaker of water.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.700
So I had a beaker of water
and pulled a ping pong ball

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.080
under water.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.996
We calculated that it
should accelerate upward

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:30.400
when released at 20 times
the acceleration of gravity,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.870
depending on the numbers
you use, very, very rapidly.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.840
And in fact it went
glug, glug, glug,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.390
but it wasn't a terribly
satisfying experiment

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.348
because it's very hard
to get the timing right.

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:41.070
And the basic issue there is
that the time scales involved

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.990
were very short.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.120
How long did it
take for a ping pong

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.703
ball to drop from
here to the surface?

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:45.540
Not much time.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.110
And to rise through the water,
not a whole lot of time.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.350
So I did that experiment,
it was sort of comical.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.600
But I wanted to improve on it.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.900
So over the weekend, I
went down to my basement

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.800
and tweaked the
experiment a little bit.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.850
And I called up a
couple of my friends,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.615
and we did an improved
version of this experiment.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.136
So this is a diver, I
think this one is Kathy.

00:04:09.136 --> 00:04:10.885
Oh, shoot, we need to
turn off the lights.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.000
Sorry.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.860
I totally forgot.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.100
good You'll never
see this if we don't.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.620
You can do it.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.770
There we go.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.810
All right.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.290
So here you see my friend, I
think this one's, actually,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.910
is it Kathy?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.440
I'm not sure.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.270
It's hard to tell when
they have their marks on.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.570
And we're in the tank at
the New England Aquarium,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.169
and she's going to perform
this experiment for us.

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.960
And we're going to film
it, as you can see,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.334
the bubbles moving
rather slowly,

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:51.520
with a high speed camera filming
at 1,200 frames per second

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.540
with which we'll be able to
analyze the data that results.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.490
The camera cost as
much as a nice house.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.960
And it's not mine, but
it's important to have

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.630
friends who trust you.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.710
OK, so here we are.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.404
You might notice something
in the background.

00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:07.820
Before we get
started, I just want

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.042
to emphasize that one
should never take casually

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:13.500
the dangers of
doing an experiment.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.474
When you plan an experiment
you must, ahead of time,

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:18.890
design the experiment, design
the experimental parameters.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.810
We designed the lighting.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.870
We designed everything.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.310
We set it up, but
there are always

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.320
variables you haven't
accounted for.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.694
And a truly great
experimentalist

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.930
is one who has taken account
of all the variables.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.638
And I just want to
emphasize that I'm not

00:05:28.638 --> 00:05:29.870
a great experimentalist.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.780
So here, for
example, is a moment.

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.650
I probably should have
thanked the sharks,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.590
it just occurred to me.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.540
Anyone who wants to take this
experimental data, which,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.040
as you can probably guess,
filmed for different purposes,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.720
I just manage to get the
ping pong ball into the tank.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.330
Anyone who wants to get this
and actually take the data,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.667
come to me, I'll give
you the raw footage.

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.125
And you can read
off the positions,

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.070
and hopefully for
next lecture we'll

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.130
have the actual plot
of the acceleration

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.990
as a function of time.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:08:00.762
So with that said and done,
the moral of the story

00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:02.470
is you have to account
for all variables.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.190
The other moral of the story is
that you saw this very vividly.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.240
In the motion of the ping pong
ball up, when it was released,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.120
there is that very rapid
moment of acceleration

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.560
when it bursts up
very, very rapidly.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.045
But it quickly slows
in its acceleration.

00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:19.274
Its acceleration slows down.

00:08:19.274 --> 00:08:20.940
In fact, a slightly
funny thing happens.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.671
If you look
carefully, and again,

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.170
anyone who wants
this can get access

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.890
to the video, what you'll
see is that the ping pong

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.092
ball accelerates and then
it sort of slows down.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.550
It literally
decreases in velocity,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.900
accelerates and slows down.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.025
Can anyone think what's
going on in that situation?

00:08:36.802 --> 00:08:38.260
AUDIENCE: Boundary
layer formation.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.644
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:39.919
AUDIENCE: Boundary
layer formation.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.585
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:42.506
Say that in slightly more words.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:44.971
AUDIENCE: It's
starting to pick up

00:08:44.971 --> 00:08:48.284
more and more water [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:48.284 --> 00:08:48.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.283
Exactly. so what's going on
is as this guy starts slowly

00:08:51.283 --> 00:08:53.816
moving along, it's pulling
along more and more water,

00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:55.440
each bit of water
around it is starting

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.310
to drag along the
layers of water nearby,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.930
and it builds up
a sheath of water.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.250
Now that water starts
accelerating, and the ping pong

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.007
ball and the bubble of water
that it's dragging along

00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:08.840
need to come to equilibrium
with each other.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.140
They need to settle down
smoothly to a nice uniform

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.880
velocity.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.710
But it takes a while for
that equilibrium to happen.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.345
And what actually happens
is that the ping pong

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:16.090
ball drives up.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.930
It pulls up the water.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.930
Which then drags with
the ping pong ball.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.860
So you can see that in
the acceleration, which

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.660
is oscillatory with a
slight little oscillation.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.550
So it's a damped but
not overdamped harmonic

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.080
oscillator motion.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.190
Any other questions
about the effective mass

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.120
of an electron and solid
before moving-- Yeah?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.480
AUDIENCE: Why does
it speed up after?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.840
That explains why it
slows down because it's

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.790
forming that sheath--

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.880
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.240
Why it speeds back up is it's
sort of like a slingshot.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.377
As this guy gets going a little
ahead of the pack of water,

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.210
the pack of water has
an extra driving force

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.349
on top of the buoyancy.

00:09:48.349 --> 00:09:50.390
It has the fact that it's
a little bit displaced.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.690
So it catches up, but it's
going slightly greater velocity

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.690
than it would be if there
were uniform velocity.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.710
So this guy catches up
with the ping pong ball.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.310
OK so this is an of course
of course in fluid mechanics,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:13.840
but I guess we don't
actually need this anymore.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.490
Picking up on spin.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.000
So the commutation relations
for spin are these.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.660
And as we saw last time,
we have spin states.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.510
We have we can construct towers
of states because from the sx

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:32.530
and s1 we can build s plus-minus
is equal to sx plus-minus sy.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.700
Sorry.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.630
i, thank you.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.960
So we can build towers of
states using the raising

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.990
and lowering operators
as plus-minus.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.500
And those states need to
end, they need to terminate.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.310
So we find that the spin can
have totalling momentum of s

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:04.730
squared h bar
squared l l plus 1.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.630
And S in some
particular direction,

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.280
which we conventionally
called z, is h bar m.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.250
I don't want to call this l.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.440
I want to call this s.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.430
For orbital angular
momentum this would be l

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.720
and this would be an integer.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.330
But for spinning
angular momentum

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.996
these are all the
states we could build,

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:40.310
all the towers we could build,
which were 2n plus 1 over 2,

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.240
which were not expressible
in terms of wave functions,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.370
functions of a
position on a sphere.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.950
These are all the
1/2 integer states.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.790
So s could be 1/2,
3/2, 5/2, and so on.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.780
And then m sub s is going
to go from minus s to s

00:11:53.780 --> 00:12:00.690
in integer steps, just like
m for the orbital angular

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.450
momentum, l.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.950
So I want to talk
about these states

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.860
in some detail over the rest of
this lecture and the next one.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.645
So the first thing to talk
about is how we describe spin.

00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:14.770
In principle, this is easy.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.020
What we want, is
we want to describe

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.650
the state of a particle that
carries this intrinsic angular

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.860
momentum spin.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.700
So that's easy.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.600
The particle sits at some
point, but the problem

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.670
is it could be sitting at some
point with angular momentum

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:33.640
with spin in the z direction,
say, plus h bar over 2.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.319
And let's focus on the
case s is equal to 1/2.

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:38.860
So I'll be focusing,
for the lecture,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.910
for simplicity on
the case, total spin

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.480
is 1/2, which is the
two-state ladder,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.220
but all of this
generalizes naturally.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.220
In fact, that's a very good
test of your understanding.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.350
So for s as 1/2,
we have two states,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.160
which I will conventionally
call the up in the z direction

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.711
and the down in the z direction.

00:12:57.711 --> 00:12:59.210
And I will often
omit the subscript.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.730
If I omit the subscript
it's usually z

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.830
unless from context you see
that it's something else.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.732
So the wave function tells
us the state of the system.

00:13:10.732 --> 00:13:12.690
But we need to know now
for a spinning particle

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.110
whether it's in the spin 1/2
up or spin 1/2 down state.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.360
And so we could write that
as there's some amplitude

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.370
that it's in the plus 1/2
state of x and at position x.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.920
And there's some amplitude
that it's at position x

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.270
and it's in the minus 1/2
state or the down state.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:43.192
And we again need that the
total probability is one.

00:13:43.192 --> 00:13:45.150
Another way to say this
is that the probability

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:50.234
that we find the particle to be
at x with plus or minus h bar

00:13:50.234 --> 00:13:53.380
upon 2 being the spin
in the z direction.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.660
So at x, spin in the z direction
is h bar upon 2 plus or minus

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:04.145
is equal to norm squared of
psi plus or minus of x squared.

00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:06.020
So this is one way you
could talk about spin,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.630
and you could develop the
theory of spin nicely here.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.632
But it's a somewhat
cumbersome formalism.

00:14:11.632 --> 00:14:13.090
The formulation I
want to introduce

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.900
is one which involves
matrices and which

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.680
presages the study
of matrix mechanics

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.505
which you'll be using in 805.

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:22.505
So instead, I want to
take these two components,

00:14:22.505 --> 00:14:25.420
and what we see already is
that we can't use a single wave

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.870
function to describe a
particle at spin 1/2.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.320
We need to use two functions.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.070
And I want to organize
them in a nice way.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.300
I'm going to write
them as psi is

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.940
equal to-- and I'll call
this capital psi of x--

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.630
is a two component vector,
or so-called spinner,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.115
psi up of x and psi down of x.

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:50.560
So it's a two component object.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.190
It's got a top and
a bottom component.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.720
And notice that its conjugate,
or its adjoint, psi dagger,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.570
is going to be equal
to psi up, complex

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.790
conjugate psi down, a row
vector, or a row spinner.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.860
And for normalization we'll
need that the total probability

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.400
is 1 which says that
psi capital dagger

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:34.000
psi, psi capital with
psi is equal to 1.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.266
But this is going to be
equal to the integral dx.

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:38.432
And now we have to take the
inner product of the two

00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:40.120
vectors.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:49.740
So integral dx of psi up
squared plus psi down squared.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
Cool?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.724
Yep?

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:55.157
AUDIENCE: What's the
coordinate x representing here?

00:15:55.157 --> 00:15:57.740
PROFESSOR: The coordinate x is
just representing the position.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.030
So what I'm saying
here is I have,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.113
again, we're in one dimension
just for simplicity,

00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:05.920
it's saying, look if I have a
particle that carries spin 1/2,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.912
it could be anywhere.

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:08.120
Let's say it's at position x.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.369
So what's the amplitude at
position x and spinning up,

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.500
and I'm not going to
indicate spinning down.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.000
OK?

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.500
I like my coffee.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.090
So that's what the of x
indicates, and I've just

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.145
been dropping the of x.

00:16:25.957 --> 00:16:28.290
So there's some probability
that it's at any given point

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.940
and either spin up or spin down.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.670
Now, again, it's important,
although I'm going to do this,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.930
and we conventionally do
this spin up and down,

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.592
this spin is
pointing in a vector

00:16:35.592 --> 00:16:36.800
space that's two dimensional.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.334
It's either plus 1/2 or
minus 1/2 h bar upon 2 h bar.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.875
So it's not like
the spin is an arrow

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:45.920
in three dimensional
space that points.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.930
Rather, what it is, it's
saying, if I measure

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.090
the spin along some axis, it
can take one of two values.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.520
And that was shown in the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, where

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.970
if we have a gradient of
the magnetic field, dbz,

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:06.220
in the z direction, and this
is our Stern-Gerlach box,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.680
and we send an electron
in, the electron always

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.140
comes out in one
of two positions.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.920
OK.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.020
Now, this is not saying there is
a vector associated with this,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.160
that the electron has a
angular momentum vector that

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.910
points in some
particular direction.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.900
Rather, it's saying that
there are two possible values,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.650
and we're measuring
along the z direction.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.680
Cool?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.430
So it's important not
to make that mistake

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.460
to think of this as some
three dimensional vector.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.760
It's very explicitly a vector in
a two dimensional vector space.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.460
It's not related to
regular rotations.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.433
Yeah?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:43.377
AUDIENCE: Where you write
psi of x equals psi plus 1

00:17:43.377 --> 00:17:44.856
plus psi [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:45.842
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:47.978
AUDIENCE: Do we need a
1 over square root of 2

00:17:47.978 --> 00:17:49.310
in front of that thing?

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I haven't
assumed their normalization,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.050
but each one could be
independently normalized

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.000
appropriately.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.132
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:57.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.900
The whole thing has to
be properly normalized,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.951
and writing it this way,
this is just the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:03.450
Good.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.080
So there's another
nice bit of notation

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.890
for this which is
often used, which

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.230
is probably the most
common notation.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:21.060
Which is to write psi
of x is equal to psi up

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:26.650
at x times the vector 1, 0 plus
psi down of x times the vector

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.150
0, 1.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.550
So this is what I'm going
to refer to as the up

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.052
vector in the z direction.

00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:35.510
And this is what
I'm going to refer

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.840
to as the down in the
z direction vector.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:51.330
And that's going to allow me to
write all the operations we're

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.020
going to need to study
spin in terms of simple two

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.900
by two matrices.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.400
Yeah?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.392
AUDIENCE: Will those two
psi's not be the same?

00:18:57.392 --> 00:18:59.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
general, they're not.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.065
So for example, here's a
situation, a configuration,

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:03.570
a quantum system could be in.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.611
The quantum system could
be in the configuration,

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.361
the particle is here
and it's spinning up.

00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:08.860
And it could be in
the configuration

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.070
the particles over here,
and it's spinning down.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.800
And given that it could be
in those two configurations

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.410
it could also be in
the superposition

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.090
over here and up and
over here and down.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.669
Right?

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:19.710
So that would be different
spatial wave functions

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.330
multiplying the
different spin wave

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
functions, spin part
of the wave function.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.091
Make sense?

00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:24.590
OK.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.267
So these are not
the same function.

00:19:26.267 --> 00:19:27.600
They could be the same function.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.020
It could be that you could be
either spin up or spin down

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.152
at any given point with
some funny distribution,

00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:35.610
but they don't need
to be the same.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.130
That's the crucial thing.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.380
Other questions?

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.734
Yeah.

00:19:40.734 --> 00:19:42.542
AUDIENCE: I know
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:44.285
is a way to call them.

00:19:44.285 --> 00:19:47.930
So like [INAUDIBLE]
something, are they

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.524
anti-parallel, perpendicular,
or are they something?

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:52.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.100
So here's what we can say.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.880
We know that an electron
which carries sz

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.530
is plus h bar upon 2,
and a state corresponding

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.960
to minus h bar upon 2 are
orthogonal because those

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.080
are two different eigenvectors
of the same operator, sz.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.070
So these guys are orthogonal.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.710
Up in the z direction
and down to the z

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.070
directions are orthogonal.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.680
And thank you for
this question, it's

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.264
a good way to think
about how wrong it

00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:17.930
is to think of up and down being
up and down in the z direction.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.100
Are these guys orthogonal?

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.409
These vectors in space?

00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:20.950
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.900
PROFESSOR: No, they happen
to be parallel with a minus 1

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.180
in the overlap, right?

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.830
So sz as up sc as down
are orthogonal vectors,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.850
but this is clearly
not sz as down, right?

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.640
So the direction that they're
pointing, the up and down,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.510
should not be thought
of as a direction

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.143
in three-dimensional space.

00:20:38.143 --> 00:20:38.910
AUDIENCE: It's just [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.535
PROFESSOR: It's just
a different thing.

00:20:40.535 --> 00:20:44.080
What it does tell you, is if
you rotate the system by a given

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.450
amount, how does the phase
of the wave function change.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.950
But what it does tell you is how
the spin operations act on it.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.211
In particular, sz acts with
a plus 1/2 or minus 1/2.

00:20:59.211 --> 00:21:00.460
They're just different states.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.724
Yeah?

00:21:01.724 --> 00:21:03.215
AUDIENCE: Is this
similar to what

00:21:03.215 --> 00:21:05.700
happens when
polarizations [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.380
PROFESSOR: It's similar to
the story of polarizations

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.960
except polarizations are
vectors not spinners.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.324
It's similar in the sense
that they look and smell

00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:15.990
like vectors in
three-dimensional space,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.470
but they mean slightly--
technically-- slightly

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.430
different things.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.737
In the case of
polarizations of light,

00:21:21.737 --> 00:21:23.570
those really are honest
vectors, and there's

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.000
a sharp relationship
between rotations in space.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.270
But that's a sort of quirk.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.640
They're both spin and vectors.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.990
These are not.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.750
OK so here's a notation
I'm going to use.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.550
Just to alert you,
a common notation

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.440
that people use
in Dirac notation

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:49.130
is to say that the wave function
is equal to psi up at x times

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:56.890
the state up plus psi down
at x times the state down.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.370
So for those of you who speak
Dirac notation at this point,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.259
then this means the
same thing as this.

00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:06.300
For those of you who don't,
then this means this.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.690
What I want to do is I want to
develop a theory of the spin

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.340
operators, and I
want to understand

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.595
what it means to be
a spin 1/2 state.

00:22:17.595 --> 00:22:20.220
Now, in particular, what I mean
by develop a theory of the spin

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.980
operators, if I was talking
about four orbital angular

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.730
momentum, say the
orbital angular momentum

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.080
in the z direction, I know
what operator this is.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.860
If you hand me a wave function,
I can act on it with lz

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.239
and tell you what the result is.

00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:33.530
And that means that I can
construct the eigenfunctions.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.790
And that means I can construct
the allowed eigenvalues,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.610
and I can talk
about probabilities.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.194
Right?

00:22:39.194 --> 00:22:40.610
But in order to
do all that I need

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.060
to know how the operator acts.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.800
And we know how
this operator acts.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.790
It acts as h bar upon i dd
phi where phi is the angular

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.580
coordinate around the equator.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.160
And so given any wave function,
a function of x, y, and z

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.640
or r, theta, and phi, I
can act with this operator,

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.870
know how the operator acts.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:08.152
And it's true, that again, lx
with lx is equal to i h bar lz.

00:23:08.152 --> 00:23:10.110
It satisfies the same
time computation relation

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.642
as the spin.

00:23:10.642 --> 00:23:13.100
But we know the spin operators
cannot be expressed in terms

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.569
of derivatives along a sphere.

00:23:15.569 --> 00:23:16.860
I've harped on that many times.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.651
So what I want to know
is what's the analog

00:23:18.651 --> 00:23:20.390
of this equation for spin?

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.330
What is a representation
of the spin operators

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.450
acting on the spinners,
acting on states

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.660
that carry half integer spin?

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.368
We know it's not going
to be derivatives.

00:23:29.368 --> 00:23:30.730
What is it going to be?

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.010
Everyone cool with the goal?

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.670
In order to do that,
we need to first decide

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.620
just some basic definition
of spin in the z direction.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.240
So what do the angular
momentum operators do?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.080
Well whatever else is true of
the spin in the z direction

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:57.100
operator, sz acting on a state
up is equal to h bar upon 2 up.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.620
And sz actually
on a state down is

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.830
equal to h bar
minus upon 2 down.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.780
And similarly s
squared on up or down--

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.510
Oh, by the way, I'm going
to relatively casually

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:25.820
oscillate between the notations
up and plus, up or down,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.095
and plus or minus.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.180
So sometimes I will write plus
for up and minus for down.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.570
So I apologize for
the sin of this.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.750
s squared on plus, this
is the plus 1/2 state,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:45.440
is equal to h bar squared
ss plus 1, but s is 1/2,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:53.330
so 1/2 times 1/2 plus 1 is 3/4
h bar squared times 3 over 4.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.860
And we get the same
thing up, ditto down.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.710
Because s squared acts the same
way on all states in a tower.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.110
Going up and down through
a tower of angular momentum

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.693
states, raising and
lowering, does not

00:25:08.693 --> 00:25:10.410
change the total
angular momentum

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.360
because s plus and s
minus commute with s

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.600
squared because they have
exactly the same commutation

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.330
relations as the
angular momentum.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.197
That's an awesome sound.

00:25:22.197 --> 00:25:23.780
So I want to know
what these look like

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.849
in terms of this vector
space notation, up and down.

00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:28.890
And for the moment I'm
going to dispense entirely

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:29.960
with the spatial dependence.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.190
I'm going to treat
the spatial dependence

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.585
as an overall constant.

00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:35.070
So we're equally likely
to be in all positions.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:41.460
So we can focus just on
the spin part of the state.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:46.680
So again I want to replace
up by 1, 0 and down by 0, 1.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.510
And I want to think
about how this looks.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.995
So what this looks like is
sz acting on [INAUDIBLE] 1,

00:25:51.995 --> 00:25:56.400
0 is equal to h
bar upon 2, 1, 0.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.250
And sz on 0, 1 is
h bar upon 2, 0, 1.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:13.150
And s squared on 1, 0 is equal
to 3 h bar squared on 4, 1, 0.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:18.950
And ditto for 0, 1.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.590
Yeah?

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.840
AUDIENCE: That [INAUDIBLE]
should have a line over it.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.300
PROFESSOR: Oh, thank you.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.240
Yes, it really should.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.955
AUDIENCE: So how do
you get 3/4 there?

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:27.830
PROFESSOR: 3/4, good.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.670
Where that came from
is that remember

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.250
that when we constructed the
eigenfunctions of l squared,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.340
l squared acting
on a state lm was

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.250
equal to h bar
squared l l plus 1.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.654
l plus 1 on [? file m. ?] Now
if we do exactly the same logic,

00:26:45.654 --> 00:26:47.070
which we actually
did at the time.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.460
We did in full generality
whether the total angular

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.040
momentum was an integer
or a half integer.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.486
We found that if
we took, I'm just

00:26:54.486 --> 00:26:56.920
going to use for the half
integer states the symbol s,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.870
but it's exactly the
same calculation.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:03.030
s squared on phi and again
sm sub s is equal to h bar

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:09.730
squared s s plus
1 phi s m sub s.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.660
OK and so for s
equals 1/2 then s,

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:20.160
s plus 1, is equal to 1/2
times 3/2, which is 3/4.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.660
Yeah?

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
s equals [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.160
Isn't that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.780
PROFESSOR: Ah, but remember,
does l go negative?

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.280
Great.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.330
Does s go negative?

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.920
No. s is just
labeling the tower.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.980
So s is 0, it's 1, it's 2.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.960
And so for example, here, these
are states where the s is 1/2

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.850
and the s in the z direction
can be plus 1/2 or minus 1/2.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.330
s is 3/2 and then s in
the z direction can be m

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.820
is 3/2, 1/2, minus
1/2, minus 3/2.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.110
OK.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:52.010
Other questions?

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.798
OK, yeah.

00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:56.280
AUDIENCE: What about the
lowering and raising of those?

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.652
PROFESSOR: Good, we're going
to have to construct them,

00:27:58.652 --> 00:27:59.610
because, what are they?

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.110
Well, they lower
and raise, so we're

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.591
going to have to build the
states that lower and raise.

00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:06.007
AUDIENCE: And would lowering
on the up will give you down,

00:28:06.007 --> 00:28:08.579
but raising on up--?

00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:09.370
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.709
So what did it mean
that we had towers?

00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:12.750
Let me do that back here.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.329
So the question is,
look, we're going

00:28:14.329 --> 00:28:16.370
to have to use the raising
and lowering operators

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.995
at the end of the
day, but what happens

00:28:17.995 --> 00:28:20.790
if I raise the bottom
state-- what if I raise down?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.010
I'll get up.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.940
And what happens if I raise up?

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.670
You get 0.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.270
That's the statement
that the tower ends.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.810
On the other hand, if s is 3/2,
what happens if I raise 1/2?

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:34.800
I get 3/2.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.070
And if I raise 3/2, I get
nothing, I get 0, identically.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.950
And that's the statement
that the tower ends.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.360
So for every tower
labeled by s, we

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.390
have a set of states labeled by
m which goes from minus s to s

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.750
in integer steps.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.430
The raising operator
raises us by 1,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.100
the lowering
operator lowers by 1.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.300
The lowering operator
annihilates the bottom state,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.140
the raising operator
kills the top state.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.510
Cool?

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.254
Yeah.

00:28:59.254 --> 00:29:01.110
AUDIENCE: Do states
like 3/2 and 5/2

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.430
have anything akin
to up and down?

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so-- do they have

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.460
anything akin to up and down.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.097
Up and down is just a name.

00:29:08.097 --> 00:29:09.930
It doesn't really
communicate anything other

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.750
than it's shorthand for
spin in the z direction 1/2.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.300
So the question could
be translated as,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.350
are there convenient
and illuminating names

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.190
for the spin 3/2 states?

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.010
And I don't really know.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.059
I don't know.

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:27.100
I mean, the states exist.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.400
So we can build
nuclear particles that

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.691
have angular momentum 3/2,
or 5/2, all sorts of things.

00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:32.940
But I don't know
of a useful name.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.728
For the most part,
we simplify our life

00:29:34.728 --> 00:29:35.936
by focusing on the 1/2 state.

00:29:35.936 --> 00:29:39.740
And as you'll discover in
8.05, the spin 1/2 states,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.320
if you know them
very, very well,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.611
you can use everything you
know about them to construct

00:29:43.611 --> 00:29:47.700
all of the spin 5/2 8/2--
well, 8/2 is stupid, but-- 9/2,

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.410
all those from the spin 1/2.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.290
So it turns out spin
1/2 is sort of Ur--

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.940
in a way that can be
made very precise,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.010
and that's the theory
of Lie algebras.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.509
Yeah.

00:29:58.089 --> 00:29:59.755
AUDIENCE: Can you
just elaborate on what

00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:02.171
you meant by, you can't really
think of spin as an angular

00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:03.200
momentum vector?

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.030
So OK, good.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.654
So the question is, elaborate a
little bit on what you mean by,

00:30:07.654 --> 00:30:10.160
spin can't be thought of as
an angular momentum vector.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.590
Spin certainly can be thought
of as an angular momentum,

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.620
because the whole point here
was that if you have a charged

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:23.980
particle and it carries spin,
then it has a magnetic moment.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.840
And a magnetic
moment is the charge

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.950
times the angular momentum.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.250
So if it carries spin,
and it carries charge,

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.334
and thus it carries
magnetic moment--

00:30:33.334 --> 00:30:35.500
that's pretty much what we
mean by angular momentum.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.470
That's as good a
diagnostic as any.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.230
Meanwhile, on top of satisfying
that experimental property,

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.300
this, just as a set of
commutation relations,

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.674
these commutation relations
are the commutation relations

00:30:46.674 --> 00:30:47.581
of angular momentum.

00:30:47.581 --> 00:30:50.080
It just turns out that we can
have states with total angular

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.360
momentum little s, which is 1/2
integral-- 1/2, 3/2, et cetera.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.940
Now, the things that I want
to emphasize are twofold.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.390
First off, something I've
harped on over and over again,

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.690
so I'll attempt to limit
my uses of this phrase.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:05.530
But you cannot think of these
states with s is 1/2 as wave

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.564
functions determining
position on a sphere.

00:31:07.564 --> 00:31:08.980
So that's the first
sense in which

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.350
you can't think of it as
equivalent to orbital angular

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.850
momentum.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.800
But there's a
second sense, which

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.169
is that up and down should
not be thought of as spin

00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:17.710
in the z direction being up and
spin in the z direction being

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.152
down meaning a vector in
three dimensions pointing up

00:31:20.152 --> 00:31:22.110
and a vector in three
dimensions pointing down,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.550
because those states
are orthogonal.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.341
Whereas these two
three-dimensional vectors

00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:27.230
are not orthogonal--
they're parallel.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.310
They have a non-zero
inner product.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:34.730
So up and down, the names we
give these spin 1/2 states,

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.310
should not be confused with
pointing up in the z direction

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.070
and down in the z direction.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.710
It's just a formal name we give
to the plus 1/2 and minus 1/2

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.070
angular momentum in
z direction states.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.575
Does that answer your question?

00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:48.952
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so, when you make

00:31:48.952 --> 00:31:50.452
a measurement of
the value of spin--

00:31:50.452 --> 00:31:52.517
so perhaps you do a
Stern-Gerlach experiment--

00:31:52.517 --> 00:31:55.580
and you get what
the spin is, can you

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.895
not then say, all right, this
is spin plus 1/2, spin minus?

00:31:59.895 --> 00:32:04.244
It's as z is positive
1/2 as z is minus 1/2?

00:32:04.244 --> 00:32:05.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.076
So if you do a
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:09.594
you can identify those
electrons that had spin plus 1/2

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.010
and those that had
spin minus 1/2,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.650
and they come out
in different places.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:13.920
That's absolutely true.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.369
I just want to emphasize
that the up vector does not

00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:17.785
mean that they're
somehow attached

00:32:17.785 --> 00:32:21.840
to the electronic vector that's
pointing in the z direction.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.340
Good.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.840
Yeah.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.000
Go ahead, whichever.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.580
AUDIENCE: How do we verify that
uncharged particles have spin?

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an interesting question.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.690
So the question
is, how do we know

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.720
if an uncharged
particle has spin?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.150
And there are many
ways to answer

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.877
this question,
one of which we're

00:32:39.877 --> 00:32:41.960
going to come to later
which has to do with Bell's

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.180
inequality, which is a
sort of slick way to do it.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.640
But a very coarse
way is this way.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.772
We believe, in a deep
and fundamental way,

00:32:48.772 --> 00:32:50.730
that the total angular
momentum of the universe

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.990
is conserved, in
the following sense.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.757
There's no preferred
axis in the universe.

00:32:56.757 --> 00:32:58.340
If you're a cosmologist,
just stay out

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.881
of the room for the
next few minutes.

00:32:59.881 --> 00:33:02.260
So there's no preferred
axis in the universe

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.259
and the law of physics should
be invariant under rotation.

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:07.550
Now, if you take a system
that has a bunch of particles

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.960
with known angular momentum--
let me give you an example.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.215
Take a neutron.

00:33:12.215 --> 00:33:14.990
A neutron has spin 1/2.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.090
Wait, how did I know that?

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.960
We can do that experiment by
doing the following thing.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.610
We can take a neutron
and bind it to a proton

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:27.170
and see that the resulting
object has spin 1.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.910
So let me try to think of a way
that doesn't involve a neutron.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:38.020
Grant me for the moment that
you know that a neutron has

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.610
spin 1/2.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.340
So let's just imagine that we
knew that, by hook or by crook.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.270
We then do the
following experiment.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.420
We wait.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.180
Take a neutron, let
it sit in empty space.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.430
When that neutron decays,
it does a very cool thing.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.340
It decays relatively
quickly into your proton

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.218
and an electron that you see.

00:33:56.218 --> 00:33:58.676
You see them go flying away
the proton has positive charge,

00:33:58.676 --> 00:34:01.359
and the electron has negative
charge and it goes flying away.

00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:02.400
But you've got a problem.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.285
Because you knew that
the neutron had spin 1/2,

00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:07.160
which is [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.219
And then you decay one into
a proton and an electron.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.719
And the total angular
momentum there

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.150
is 1/2 plus 1/2
or 1/2 minus 1/2.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.850
It's either 1 or 0.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.726
And you've got a problem.

00:34:16.726 --> 00:34:18.350
Angular momentum
hasn't been conserved.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.929
So what do you
immediately deduce?

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.560
That another particle must
have also been emitted

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.690
that had 1/2 integer
angular momentum

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.150
to conserve angular momentum.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.107
And it couldn't carry any
charge because the electron

00:34:30.107 --> 00:34:32.440
and the proton were neutral,
and the neutron is neutral.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.497
So things like
this you can always

00:34:34.497 --> 00:34:36.330
deduce from conservation
of angular momentum

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.204
one way or the other.

00:34:37.204 --> 00:34:39.219
But the best way
to do it is going

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.151
to be some version of
addition of angular momentum

00:34:42.151 --> 00:34:44.484
where you have some object
like an electron and a proton

00:34:44.484 --> 00:34:46.670
and you allow them
to stick together

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.380
and you discover it
has total spin 1.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.260
Yeah.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.889
We can talk about that in
more detail afterwards.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.449
That's a particularly nice
way to do the experiment.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:55.949
Yeah.

00:34:58.374 --> 00:35:00.779
AUDIENCE: Angular momentum
[INAUDIBLE] weird vector

00:35:00.779 --> 00:35:07.032
since if you reflect your
system through [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:07.032 --> 00:35:07.977
How does that work?

00:35:07.977 --> 00:35:09.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, good.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.500
I don't want to get into
this in too much detail,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.958
but it's a really good question,
so come to my office hours

00:35:12.958 --> 00:35:14.850
and ask or go to
recitations and ask.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.016
It's a really good question.

00:35:16.016 --> 00:35:18.360
The question is this--
angular momentum

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.790
has a funny property under
parity, under reflection.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.720
So if you look in a mirror this
way, here's angular momentum

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.390
and it's got--
right-hand rule, it's

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.473
got angular momentum up--
if I look in the mirror,

00:35:29.473 --> 00:35:31.270
it's going this way.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.520
So it would appear to have
right angular momentum down.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.110
That's what it looks like
if you reflect in a mirror.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.060
Other direction.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.974
So that's a funny property
of angular momentum.

00:35:41.974 --> 00:35:43.890
It's also a true property
of angular momentum.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.460
It's fine.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.832
And what about spin,
is the question.

00:35:47.832 --> 00:35:50.040
Does spin also have this
funny property under parity,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.160
is that basically the question?

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.380
Yeah, and it does.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.710
And working out exactly
how to show that

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.210
is a sort of
entertaining exercise.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.470
So again, it's beyond
the scope of the lecture,

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.630
so come ask me in office hours
and we can talk about that.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.420
Yeah, one more.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.348
AUDIENCE: For orbital angular
momentum, say for l equals 1,

00:36:06.348 --> 00:36:09.139
we had states like m
equals plus 1 and minus 1.

00:36:09.139 --> 00:36:09.764
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:09.764 --> 00:36:14.400
AUDIENCE: And we did think
of those as angular momentum

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.140
vectors.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:15.495
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:36:15.495 --> 00:36:17.778
AUDIENCE: But those states are
also orthogonal, are they not?

00:36:17.778 --> 00:36:19.195
PROFESSOR: Yeah, those
states are also orthogonal.

00:36:19.195 --> 00:36:21.794
AUDIENCE: So even though
the angular momentum vectors

00:36:21.794 --> 00:36:23.210
aren't orthogonal,
they're still--

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.497
it's just a different sense.

00:36:24.497 --> 00:36:25.830
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.497
So again, even in the case
of integer angular momentum,

00:36:28.497 --> 00:36:30.080
you've got to be
careful about talking

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.440
about the top state
and the bottom state

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.960
corresponding to pointing
in some direction,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.680
because they're
orthogonal states.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.180
However, they do correspond to
a particular angular momentum

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.770
vector in three
dimensional space.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.980
They correspond to a
distribution on the sphere.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.070
So there's a sense in
which they do correspond

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.356
to real rotations, real
eigenfunctions on a sphere,

00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:49.230
and there's also a sense
in which they don't,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.605
because they're
still orthogonal.

00:36:50.605 --> 00:36:51.810
That's exactly right.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:52.580
So let me move on.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.190
I'm going to stop
questions at this point.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:00.150
So good.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.770
So these are the
properties that need

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.140
to be satisfied
by our operators.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.360
And it's pretty easy to
see in this basis what

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.850
these operators must be.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.660
Sz has eigenvectors
1, 0 and 0, 1.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.640
So Sz should be equal to h
bar upon 2 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.480
So let's just check
this on 1, 0 gives me 1,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.550
0, so it gives me the same
thing back times h bar upon 2.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.050
Cool.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.460
And acting on 0, 1,
or the down state,

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.270
we get h bar upon
2 times 0 minus 1.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.410
That could be minus 1.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:40.142
Oh, sorry, 1, 0 gives me 0 and
0 minus 1 on 1 gives me minus 1,

00:37:40.142 --> 00:37:41.350
which is 1 with a minus sign.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.870
That's a minus sign.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.620
So this works out like a champ.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.790
And S squared, meanwhile,
is equal to-- well,

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.810
it's got to give me h
bar squared times 3/4

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.715
for both of these vectors.

00:37:52.715 --> 00:37:54.340
So h bar squared--
and meanwhile, these

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.730
are eigenstates-- h bar squared
times 3/4 times 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:10.240
So we know one other
fact, which was brought up

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.320
just a minute ago, which
was that if we take S plus

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.820
and you act on the state
0, 1, what should you get?

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.150
If you raise your 1-- 1, 0.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.000
Great.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.609
So we also worked out the
normalization coefficient

00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:28.400
on the problem set.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.860
And that normalization
coefficient turns out to be 1.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.600
And let's be careful--
we've got an h

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.020
bar, for dimensional
analysis reasons.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.450
So meanwhile, S minus,
similarly, on 0,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.220
1, is equal to 0.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:50.305
And S plus on 0, 1,
is equal to-- oh,

00:38:50.305 --> 00:38:51.430
sorry, we already did that.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.390
We want S minus on 1, 0.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.660
Let's see-- S minus on--
we want S plus on 1,

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.740
0 is equal to-- right, 0.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:10.560
And S minus on 1, 0 is
equal to h bar 0, 1.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.640
OK, so putting
all this together,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.960
you can pretty quickly
get that S plus

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.870
is equal to-- we
need an h bar and we

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:28.300
need it to raise the lower
one and kill the top state.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.520
So on 1, 0, what does S plus do?

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.880
That gives us 0 that gives us 0.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.920
Good.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.409
And on the lowered
state, 0, 1, that

00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:38.950
gives me a 1 up top
and that gives me

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.810
a 0 downstairs, so it
works out like this.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:41.650
So we've got h bar.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:48.500
Similarly, S minus is equal
to h bar times 0, 0, 1, 0.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.990
So we've got these
guys-- so much

00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:00.606
from just the definitions
of raising and lowering.

00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:01.980
And by taking
inner products, you

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.540
can just derive those
two lines from these.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:16.140
But notice that Sx is equal
to S plus plus S minus upon 2,

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:23.220
and Sy is equal to S plus
minus S minus upon 2i.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:33.470
So this tells us that Sx is
equal to h bar upon 2 times

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.040
S plus-- we're going to
get a 1 here-- plus S

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.930
minus-- we're going to
get a 1 here-- 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:47.125
And Sy is equal to, again,
upon 2i times h bar, h

00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:52.590
bar upon 2i, times S plus, which
is going to give me 1 and minus

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.540
S minus which is going
to give me minus 1, 0, 0.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:01.458
But we can pull this i in,
so 1/i is like minus i.

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:07.160
So minus i times minus
1 is going to give me i

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.580
and minus i times 1
is going to give me i.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.952
So--

00:41:14.952 --> 00:41:16.422
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
it be minus i?

00:41:16.422 --> 00:41:17.130
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.074
Yeah, did I write i?

00:41:18.074 --> 00:41:19.240
That should've been minus i.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:19.739
Thank you.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.850
So now we have a nice
representation of these spin

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:32.380
operations, of the
spin operators.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:42.730
And explicitly we have that
Sx is equal to h bar upon 2 0,

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:50.990
1, 1, 0, Sy is equal to h
bar upon 2 0, minus i, i, 0.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:57.090
And Sz is equal to h bar
upon 2 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.325
So why is Sz the only
one that's diagonal?

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.650
Is it something
special about Sz?

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.670
AUDIENCE: I mean, we've chosen
z as the axis along which

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.370
to project S squared.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.320
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.930
So the thing that's
special about Sz

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.130
is that at the very
beginning of this,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.860
we decided to work in a
basis of eigenstates of Sz,

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.220
with definite values of Sz.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.250
So if they have definite
values, then acting with Sz

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.740
is just going to
give you a number.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.490
That's what it is to
be a diagonal matrix.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.300
You act on a basis vector,
you just get a number out.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:45.300
So we started out by working
in the eigenbasis of Sz.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:55.515
And as a consequence, we
find that Sz is diagonal.

00:42:55.515 --> 00:42:57.140
And this is a general
truth that you'll

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:06.320
discover in matrix
mechanics when

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.830
you work in the
eigenbasis of an operator,

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:11.980
that operator is represented
by a diagonal matrix.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.600
And so we often say, rather
than to work in an eigenbasis,

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.900
we often say, to diagonalize.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.066
Yeah.

00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:19.360
AUDIENCE: Are the
signs right for Sy?

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.206
Because if we had h bar over
2i, and as we initially had a 1

00:43:24.206 --> 00:43:27.045
in the top right and minus
1 in the bottom left,

00:43:27.045 --> 00:43:28.400
shouldn't we just multiply by i?

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.316
PROFESSOR: I'm pretty
sure-- so originally, we

00:43:30.316 --> 00:43:32.369
had a downstairs i, right?

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:34.160
So let's think about
what this looked like.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.161
This was 1 and minus 1, right?

00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:36.660
Agreed?

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.850
So this is minus 1 over i.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:39.760
So we pull in the i.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.230
So that we go from minus
1 to minus 1 over i.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.430
And we go from 1 to 1 over i.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.280
And I claim that one
over i is minus i.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.673
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:43:50.673 --> 00:43:52.400
And minus 1 over i is i.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.003
That cool?

00:43:53.003 --> 00:43:53.830
Good.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:44:00.860
OK, so this is i and minus i.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.380
I always get that
screwy, but it's

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.740
useful to memorize
these matrices.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.210
You might think it's a little
silly to memorize matrices.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.630
But these turn out to
be ridiculously useful

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:10.880
and they come up all the time.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.140
This is called sigma x.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.986
This is called sigma y.

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:16.110
And this is called sigma z.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.820
And different people decide
whether to put the 1/2 in there

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.020
or not, the h bar
does not go in there.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.722
Some people put in the 2, some
people don't put in the 1/2,

00:44:24.722 --> 00:44:25.680
it's a matter of taste.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.150
Just be careful and be
consistent, as usual.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.550
And these are called the
Pauli matrices because A,

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.822
we really like Pauli and
B, Pauli introduced them.

00:44:36.822 --> 00:44:39.480
Although he didn't actually
introduce them in some sense--

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.890
this mathematical
structure was introduced

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.380
ages and ages and ages ago.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.370
But physicists cite
the physicist, not

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.850
the mathematician.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.310
OK I'm not saying that's good.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.600
I'm just saying it happens.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.255
So notice a
consequence of these.

00:44:56.255 --> 00:44:58.380
An important consequence
of these-- the whole point

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.700
here was to build a
representation of the spin

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.620
operators.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.490
Now whatever else the
spin operators do,

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:07.620
they had better satisfy
that computation relation,

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.180
otherwise they're not
really spin operators.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.200
That's what we mean by
being spin operators.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200
So let's check.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.892
Is it true that Sx commutator
with Sy is equal to i h bar Sz?

00:45:17.892 --> 00:45:19.330
So this is a question mark.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:23.270
And let's check.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:24.660
Let's do the commutator.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.900
From the Sx, we're going
to get an h bar upon 2.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.530
From the Sy, from each Sy, we're
going to get a factor of h bar

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.155
upon 2, so I'll just write that
as h bar upon 2 squared-- times

00:45:33.155 --> 00:45:35.690
the commutator of two
matrices-- 0, 1, 1,

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:39.730
0 commutator with
0, minus i, i, 0.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.990
This is equal to h bar
squared upon 4 times--

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.990
let's write this out.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.250
The first term is going to be
this matrix times this matrix.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.690
That's going to be, again,
a matrix-- 0, 1, 0, 1.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.030
So that first one is a 1.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.360
0, 1, minus i-- oh,
sorry, that's an i.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.890
0, 1, that's an i,
that's a minus i.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.056
So 0, 1, 0, i gives me an i.

00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:06.770
0, 1, minus i, 0 gives me a 0.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.380
Second row-- 1, 0,
0, i gives me 0.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:15.180
And 1, 0, minus i,
0 gives me minus i.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.790
And then the second term is
the flipped order, right?

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:18.680
The commutator term.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.680
So we get minus the commutator
term, which is going to be 0,

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.180
minus i, 0, 1.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.500
That gives me minus i.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.620
0, minus i, 1, 0,
that gives me 0.

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.830
Bottom row-- i, 0, 0, 1-- 0.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.430
And i, 0, 1, 0 give me i.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.150
OK, so notice what
we get this is

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.040
equal to h bar squared upon 4.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.650
And both of those matrices
are the same thing.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:52.170
Those matrices are both i, 0,
0, minus i with minus i, 0, 0,

00:46:52.170 --> 00:47:02.190
i, giving us i, 0, 0, minus
i times 2 from the two terms.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.370
The 2's cancel,
and this gives me

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:13.600
h bar squared upon 2
times i, 0, 0, minus i.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:23.050
But this is also known as--
pulling out an i and an h bar--

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:27.520
times h bar upon 2
1, 0, 0, minus 1.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.610
This is equal to i h bar Sz.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.710
So these matrices represent
the angular momentum

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.460
commutators quite nicely.

00:47:42.544 --> 00:47:44.460
And in fact, if you
check, all the commutators

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.510
work out beautifully.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:50.110
So quickly, just
as a reminder, what

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.690
are the possible
measurable values

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.020
of Sz for the spin 1/2 system?

00:47:56.834 --> 00:47:58.250
What possible
values could you get

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:03.050
if you measured Sz,
spin in the z direction?

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.720
Yeah, plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.050
Now what about the eigenvectors?

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.870
What are they-- of Sz?

00:48:14.492 --> 00:48:16.200
In this notation,
there are these states.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.991
There's one eigenvector,
there's the other.

00:48:17.991 --> 00:48:19.970
But let's ask the same
question about Sx.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.150
So for Sx, what are the
allowed eigenvalues?

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.295
Well, we can answer
this in two ways.

00:48:27.295 --> 00:48:29.420
The first way we can answer
this is by saying look,

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.235
there's nothing deep about z.

00:48:30.235 --> 00:48:32.100
It was just the stupid
direction we started with.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.490
We could have started by working
with the eigenbasis of Sx

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.364
and we would've found
exactly the same story.

00:48:36.364 --> 00:48:38.100
So it must be plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.230
But the reason you make
that argument is A,

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.330
it's slick and B,
it's the only one

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.680
you can make without knowing
something else about how

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.330
Sx acts.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.620
But now we know what Sx is.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.220
Sx is that operator.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.570
So now we can ask, what are the
eigenvalues of that operator?

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.920
And if you compute the
eigenvalues of that operator,

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.700
you find that there
are two eigenvalues

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:07.970
Sx is equal to h
bar upon 2 and Sx

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.746
is equal to minus h bar upon 2.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.744
And now I can ask, well,
what are the eigenvectors?

00:49:27.744 --> 00:49:29.160
Now, we know what
the eigenvectors

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.534
are because we
can just construct

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.080
the eigenvectors of Sx plus.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.370
And if you construct the
eigenvectors of Sx plus--

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.560
should I take the time?

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.460
How many people want me to
do the eigenvectors of Sx

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.210
explicitly?

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.880
Yeah, that's kind
of what I figured.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.560
OK, good.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.520
So the eigenvectors of Sx
are, for example, on 1,

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:55.550
1 is equal to-- well, Sx
on 1, 1, the first term,

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:57.547
that 0, 1, is going
to give me a 1, the 1,

00:49:57.547 --> 00:49:58.630
0 is going to give me a 1.

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:03.130
So this is h bar upon 2
coefficient of Sx on 1, 1.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:08.560
And Sx on 1, minus 1 is going
to give me h bar upon 2 minus 1,

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.380
minus 1, because
all Sx does is swap

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.120
the first and second components.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.610
So it gives me minus
1, takes it to the top,

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.200
but that's just an
overall minus sign.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.480
So again, we have the correct
eigenvalues, plus and minus

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.290
h bar upon 2, and now
we know the eigenvector.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.410
So what does this tell us?

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.720
What does it tell us that
up in the x direction

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:32.410
is equal to 1 over root 2 if
I normalize things properly.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.384
Up in the z direction plus
down in the z direction.

00:50:35.384 --> 00:50:36.675
That's what this is telling me.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.720
This vector is equal to up
in the z direction-- that's

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.280
this guy-- plus down
in the z direction.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.307
But this isn't
properly normalized,

00:50:54.307 --> 00:50:56.515
and properly normalizing it
gives us this expression.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.514
So what does this tell us?

00:51:01.514 --> 00:51:03.930
This tells us that if we happen
to know that the system is

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.990
in the state with angular
momentum, or spin,

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.590
angular momentum in the x
direction being plus 1/2, then

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:14.640
the probability to measure
up in the z direction

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.210
in a subsequent
measurement is 1/2.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.610
And the probability to
measure down is 1/2.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.630
If you know it's up
in the x direction,

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.190
the probability of measuring
up in the z or down in the z

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.822
are equal.

00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:27.530
You're at chance.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.299
You're at even odds.

00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:30.340
Everyone agree with that?

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.530
That's the meaning
of this expression.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.580
And similarly, down in the
x direction is equal to 1

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.820
over root 2, up
in the z direction

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.130
minus down in the z direction.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.730
And we get that from here.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:48.810
This state is explicitly, by
construction, the eigenstate

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.200
of Sx as we've constructed Sx.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.940
And we have a natural
expression in terms

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.602
of the z eigenvectors
up and down.

00:51:55.602 --> 00:51:57.310
That's what this
expression is giving us.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:00.910
It gives us an expression
of the Sx eigenvector

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:02.400
in the basis of Sz eigenvectors.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.590
So for example, this tells
you that the probability

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.940
to measure up in the
z direction, given

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.272
that we measured down
in the x direction

00:52:15.272 --> 00:52:17.230
first-- so this is the
conditional probability.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.470
Suppose I first measured
down in the x direction,

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.219
what's the probability
that I subsequently

00:52:21.219 --> 00:52:22.580
measure up in the z direction?

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.450
This is equal to--
well, it's the norm

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.640
squared of the
expansion coefficient.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.910
So first down in the x
direction and the probability

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:37.424
that we're up in the z direction
is 1 upon root 2 squared.

00:52:37.424 --> 00:52:38.840
Usual rules of
quantum mechanics--

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.090
take the expansion coefficient,
take its norm squared,

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.470
that's the probability-- 1/2.

00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:54.090
And we can do exactly
the same thing for Sy.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:01.196
So let's do the
same thing for Sy

00:53:01.196 --> 00:53:03.070
without actually working
out all the details.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:17.920
So doing the same thing for
Sy, up in the y direction

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:24.070
is equal to 1 upon root 2 times
up in the z direction plus i

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:27.460
down in the z direction.

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:32.642
And down in the y direction
is equal to 1 upon root 2

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:38.400
up in the z direction minus
i down in the z direction.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.790
And I encourage you to
check your knowledge

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.339
by deriving these
eigenvectors, which

00:53:43.339 --> 00:53:45.130
you can do given our
representations of Sy.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:51.020
Now here's a nice thing that
we're going to use later.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.160
Consider the following.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.470
Consider the operator
S theta, which

00:53:56.470 --> 00:54:02.984
I'm going to define as cosine
theta Sz plus-- oh, sorry.

00:54:02.984 --> 00:54:04.650
I'm not even going
to write it that way.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:09.800
So what I mean by S
theta is equal to-- take

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:15.380
our spherical directions and
consider an angle in the-- this

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:22.910
is x, let's say, y, x, z--
consider an angle theta down

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:31.700
in the zx plane, and we
can ask, what is the spin

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.330
operator along the
direction theta?

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:37.170
What's the angular momentum
in the direction theta?

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.469
If theta, for example, is
equal to pi/2, this is Sx.

00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:43.010
So I'm just defining
a spin operator,

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.426
which is the angular momentum
along a particular direction

00:54:45.426 --> 00:54:47.610
theta in the xz plane.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.025
Everyone cool with that?

00:54:49.025 --> 00:54:51.150
This is going to turn out
to be very useful for us,

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.389
and I encourage you to
derive the following.

00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:55.180
And if you don't derive
the following, then

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.760
hopefully it will be
done in your recitations.

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.910
Well, I will chat with your
recitation instructors.

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.970
And if you do
this, then what are

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:05.050
we going to get for the
eigenvalues of S theta?

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:10.510
What possible eigenvalues
could S theta have?

00:55:17.915 --> 00:55:18.790
[? AUDIENCE: None. ?]

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:19.022
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:55:19.022 --> 00:55:19.610
Why?

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.960
AUDIENCE: Because it can't
have any other redirection

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.387
[INAUDIBLE] no matter
where you start.

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.220
PROFESSOR: Fabulous.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:25.720
OK.

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.280
So the answer that
was given is that it's

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.690
the same, plus or
minus h bar upon 2

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:33.719
as Sz, or indeed as Sx or
Sy, because it can't possibly

00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:35.760
matter what direction you
chose at the beginning.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.950
I could have called
this direction theta z.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:39.300
How do you stop me?

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.080
We could have done that.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.184
We didn't.

00:55:42.184 --> 00:55:43.600
That was our first
wave answering.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.260
Second wave answering is what?

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.230
Well, construct the
operator S theta

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:52.115
and find its eigenvectors
and eigenvalues.

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.365
So I encourage you to do that.

00:55:53.365 --> 00:55:58.290
And what you find
is that, of course,

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.110
the eigenvalues are plus
or minus h bar upon 2

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:09.140
and up at the angle theta is
equal to cosine of theta upon 2

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:13.020
up in the z direction
plus sine of theta

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.310
upon 2 down in the z direction.

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:21.540
And down theta is
equal to cosine theta

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:27.930
upon 2 up in the z direction
minus sine of theta

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:35.050
over 2 down in the z direction.

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:35.872
Oops, no.

00:56:35.872 --> 00:56:36.580
I got that wrong.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.530
This is sine, and
this is minus cosine.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.624
Good.

00:56:40.624 --> 00:56:41.540
That makes more sense.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.520
OK.

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.822
So let's just sanity check.

00:56:46.822 --> 00:56:48.530
These guys should be
properly normalized.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.190
So if we take the norm
squared of this guy,

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:53.175
the cross terms vanish
because up z and down z

00:56:53.175 --> 00:56:54.366
are orthogonal states.

00:56:54.366 --> 00:56:56.740
So we're going to get a co
squared plus the sine squared.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.240
That's 1.

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.551
So that's properly normalized.

00:56:58.551 --> 00:56:59.550
Same thing for this guy.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:00.570
The minus doesn't
change anything

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:01.569
because we norm squared.

00:57:01.569 --> 00:57:03.271
Now, I'll check that
they're orthogonal.

00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:05.770
If we take this guy dotted into
this guy, everything's real.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:09.700
So we get a cosine
from up up, we're

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.022
going to get a cosine sine.

00:57:11.022 --> 00:57:13.480
And from down down, we're going
to get a minus cosine sine.

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.287
So that gives us 0.

00:57:14.287 --> 00:57:15.870
So these guys are
orthogonal, and they

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.630
satisfy all the nice
properties we want.

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:25.245
So this is a good check--
do this-- of your knowledge.

00:57:25.245 --> 00:57:27.120
And if we had problem
sets allowed this week,

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.080
I would give you this in your
problem set, but we don't.

00:57:35.879 --> 00:57:36.830
Yeah, OK.

00:57:44.737 --> 00:57:45.695
Suppose that I measure.

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:47.880
So I want to use these
states for something.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:58.330
Suppose that I
measure Sz and find

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:02.690
Sz is equal to 1/2 h
bar plus h bar upon 2,

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:06.010
OK, at some moment in time.

00:58:10.232 --> 00:58:11.190
First question is easy.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:14.190
What's the state of the system
subsequent to that measurement?

00:58:17.004 --> 00:58:19.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.777
PROFESSOR: Man, you
all are so quiet today.

00:58:21.777 --> 00:58:24.110
What's the state of the system
subsequent to measurement

00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:26.695
that Sz is plus h bar upon 2?

00:58:26.695 --> 00:58:28.406
AUDIENCE: Up z.

00:58:28.406 --> 00:58:29.080
PROFESSOR: Up z.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.580
Good.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:36.700
So our state psi is
up z upon measurement,

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.915
OK, after measurement.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.805
And I need new chalk.

00:58:50.805 --> 00:58:51.305
OK.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:04.316
Now, if I measure Sx, so 1, 2,
measure Sx, what will I get?

00:59:04.316 --> 00:59:07.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:08.300
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.726
What values will I observe
with what probabilities?

00:59:11.726 --> 00:59:13.600
Well, first off, what
are the possible values

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.607
that you can measure?

00:59:14.607 --> 00:59:16.010
AUDIENCE: Plus or
minus h bar over 2.

00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.801
PROFESSOR: Right, the
possible eigenvalues,

00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:20.760
so which is plus or minus
h bar upon 2, but with what

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.720
probability?

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.595
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:22.595 --> 00:59:23.386
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:59:23.386 --> 00:59:25.200
So we know this from
the eigenstate of Sx.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.040
If we know that we're
in the state up z,

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.400
we can take linear
combinations of this guy

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.810
to show that up z is
equal to 1 over root 2.

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:37.090
So let's just check.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:40.460
If we add these two
together, up x and down x,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.240
if we add them
together, we'll get 1/2,

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:50.810
1/2, 2/2, a root 2 times up
z, is up x plus down x, up x

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:56.060
plus down x, dividing
through by the 1/2.

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.290
So here we've expressed
up in the z direction

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:01.810
in a basis of x and y, which
is what we're supposed to do.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:04.920
So the probability that
I measure a plus 1/2

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:11.016
as x is equal to
plus 1/2 h bar upon 2

01:00:11.016 --> 01:00:14.290
is equal to 1 over
root 2 squared, so 1/2.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:19.780
And ditto, Sx is equal
to minus h bar upon 2.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.271
Same probability.

01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:21.770
OK?

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:22.740
What about Sy?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.310
Again, we get one of two values.

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:33.770
Oops, plus or
minus h bar upon 2.

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.070
But the probability of
measuring plus is equal to 1/2,

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:47.050
and the probability that we
measure minus 1/2 is 1/2.

01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:49.310
That's h bar upon 2.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:49.810
OK?

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.018
So this should look familiar.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.040
Going back to the
very first lecture,

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.260
hardness was spin
in the z direction,

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.624
and color was spin in
the x direction, I guess.

01:01:05.624 --> 01:01:07.290
And we added, at one
point, a third one,

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:09.230
which I think I
called whimsy, which

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.740
is equal to spin
in the y direction.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.240
OK?

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.085
And now all of the
box operation that we

01:01:15.085 --> 01:01:17.210
used in that very first
lecture, you can understand

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.140
is nothing other than
stringing together

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:22.100
chains of Stern-Gerlach
experiments

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.630
doing Sx, Sy, and Sz.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:27.182
So let's be explicit about that.

01:01:27.182 --> 01:01:29.510
Let's make that concrete.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.760
Actually, let's do that here.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.900
So for example, suppose
we put a random electron

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.691
into an Sz color box.

01:01:43.691 --> 01:01:44.190
OK.

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:46.620
Some are going to
come out up, and some

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:51.520
are going to come out
down in the z direction.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.210
And if we send this into
now an Sx color box,

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.610
this is going to give us
either up in the x direction

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:02.070
or down in the x direction.

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:06.200
And what we'll get
out is 50-50, right?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:06.700
OK.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:10.040
So let's take the ones
that came out down.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.450
And if we send those back
into an Sz, what do we get?

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:16.770
AUDIENCE: 50-50.

01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:21.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 50-50,
because down x is 1 over 2 up z

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.091
plus 1 over 2 down z.

01:02:23.091 --> 01:02:25.340
What was going on in that
very first experiment, where

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.200
we did hardness,
color, hardness?

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.650
Superposition.

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:33.680
And what superposition
was a hard electron?

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.320
It was 1 over a 2,
white plus black.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.130
We know precisely which
superposition, and here it is.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.890
OK?

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.990
And now, let's do that
last experiment, where

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:51.510
we take these guys, Sx down, and
I'm turning this upside down,

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.140
beam joiners.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:56.059
We take the up in the x
direction and the down

01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:58.100
in the x direction, and
we combine them together,

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.772
and we put them back
into Sz, what do we get?

01:03:02.772 --> 01:03:03.730
Well, what's the state?

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:09.600
1 over root 2 down x
plus 1 over root 2 up x?

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.580
PROFESSOR: It's up z.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.640
Up z into an Sz
box, what do we get?

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.285
Up z with 100%.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.660
That's white with 100%, or
I'm sorry, hard with 100%.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
down z with a down z.

01:03:27.942 --> 01:03:28.650
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:29.462
AUDIENCE: You put in down.

01:03:29.462 --> 01:03:30.420
PROFESSOR: Oh, I put in down.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.128
Shoot, I'm sorry.

01:03:31.128 --> 01:03:32.910
Well, yeah, indeed,
I meant to put in up.

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.510
Yes, down z with
100% confidence.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:37.230
If we remove the mirror, 50-50.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.932
If we add in the mirror, 100%.

01:03:38.932 --> 01:03:40.390
And the difference
is whether we're

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:42.740
taking one component
of the wave function,

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.054
or whether we're superposing
them back together.

01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:47.010
All right?

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:48.970
Imagine we know we have
a system in this state,

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:52.590
and I say, look, this component
is also coincidentally very far

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.190
away, and I'm going
to not look at them.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.656
So of the ones that I look
at, I have 1 over root 2 up x.

01:03:58.656 --> 01:04:00.030
But if I look at
the full system,

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.370
the superimposed system,
that adds together

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:05.890
to be an eigenstate of Sz.

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:08.498
These are our color boxes.

01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:08.998
Yeah?

01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:09.736
AUDIENCE: But how
do you know, when

01:04:09.736 --> 01:04:11.458
you put the two beams
to the beam joiner,

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:13.545
it serves to add their
two states together?

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:14.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, excellent.

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:15.870
This is a very subtle point.

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.420
So here we have to decide what
we mean by the beam splitter.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.420
And what I'm going to
mean by the beam splitter,

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.510
by the mirrors
and beam joiners--

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.150
so the question is, how do
we know that it does this

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:24.860
without changing
the superposition?

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.600
And what I want to do
is define this thing

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.410
as the object that takes the
two incident wave functions,

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.780
and it just adds them together.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.530
It should give me the
direct superposition

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.570
with the appropriate
phases and coefficients.

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:39.870
So if this was plus up x,
then it stays plus up x.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.470
If it's minus up x, it's
going to be minus up x.

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:46.700
Whatever the phase is of
this state, when it gets here

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.780
it just adds together
the two components.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.570
That's my definition
of that adding box.

01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:54.687
AUDIENCE: So realistically,
what does that look like?

01:04:54.687 --> 01:04:55.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, what?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.895
You think I'm an
experimentalist?

01:04:56.895 --> 01:04:57.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:59.600
Look, every time I
try an experiment,

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.910
I get hit by a shark.

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:01.410
OK?

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:04.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.500
Yeah, no.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.480
How you actually implement
that in real systems

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.890
is a more complicated story.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.330
So you should
direct that question

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.720
to Matt, who's a very
good experimentalist.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.350
OK.

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:19.570
So finally, let's go back to
the Stern-Gerlach experiment,

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:22.080
and let's actually run the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.241
I guess I'll do that here.

01:05:24.241 --> 01:05:26.740
So let's think about what the
Stern-Gerlach experiment looks

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.010
like in this notation, and
not just in this notation,

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:32.590
in the honest language of spin.

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:35.934
And I'm going to do a slightly
abbreviated version of this

01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:37.600
because you guys can
fill in the details

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.981
with your knowledge
of 802 and 803.

01:05:40.981 --> 01:05:41.480
OK.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.104
So here's the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

01:05:43.104 --> 01:05:46.635
We have a gradient in
the magnetic field.

01:05:46.635 --> 01:05:47.635
This is the z direction.

01:05:47.635 --> 01:05:52.516
And we have a gradient
where B in the z direction

01:05:52.516 --> 01:06:01.492
has some B0, a
constant plus beta z.

01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:02.300
OK?

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:06.601
So it's got a constant
piece and a small gradient.

01:06:06.601 --> 01:06:07.600
Everyone cool with that?

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.495
It's just the magnetic field
gets stronger and stronger

01:06:09.495 --> 01:06:11.160
in the z direction,
there's a constant,

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.500
and then there's a rate of
increase in the z direction.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.310
And I'm going to send
my electron through.

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:21.090
Now remember, my electron has
a wave function, psi electron,

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:23.820
is equal to-- well, it's
got some amplitude to be up,

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.500
a up z, plus some amplitude
to be down, b down z.

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.050
And if this is a
random electron,

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:31.120
then its state is
going to be random,

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.120
and a and b are going to
be random numbers whose

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.710
norm squared add up to
1, proper normalization.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:37.247
Cool?

01:06:37.247 --> 01:06:38.705
So here's our random
initial state,

01:06:38.705 --> 01:06:40.250
and we send it into
this region where

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.750
we've got a magnetic
field gradient.

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.690
And what happens?

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:51.720
Well, we know that the
energy of an electron that

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:57.170
carries some angular momentum
is a constant, mu naught,

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.740
times its angular
momentum dotted

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.230
into any ambient magnetic field.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:04.810
Whoops, sorry,
with a minus sign.

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:06.768
This is saying that
magnets want to anti-align.

01:07:09.514 --> 01:07:10.930
Now, in particular,
here we've got

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:13.460
a magnetic field
in the z direction.

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:19.280
So this is minus mu 0 Sz Bz.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:28.210
And Bz was a constant, beta
0-- sorry, B0 plus beta z.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.090
So the energy has two terms.

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.220
It has a constant term,
which just depends on Sz,

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.720
and then there's a
term that depends

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.435
on z as well as depending
on Sz [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:36.435 --> 01:07:42.625
So we can write this as a--
so Sz, remember what Sz is.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:48.520
Sz is equal to h bar
upon 2, 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:57.244
So this is a matrix with
some coefficient up a--

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:58.410
do I want to write this out?

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.830
Yeah, I guess I don't really
need to write this out.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.749
But this is a matrix, and
this is our energy operator.

01:08:08.749 --> 01:08:11.290
And it acts on any given state
to give us another state back.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.676
It's an operator.

01:08:13.676 --> 01:08:14.175
OK.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:19.240
And importantly,
I want this to be

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:25.637
only-- this is in some
region where we're

01:08:25.637 --> 01:08:28.220
doing the experiment, where we
have a magnetic field gradient.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.609
Then outside of this region,
we have no magnetic field

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.160
and no magnetic field gradient.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.979
So it's 0 to the left
and 0 to the right.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:44.470
So as we've talked about
before, the electron

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:47.649
feels a force due to this
gradient to the magnetic field.

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:49.507
The energy depends on
z, so the derivative

01:08:49.507 --> 01:08:51.090
of the energy with
respect to z, which

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:54.279
is the force in the z
direction, is non-zero.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.784
But for the moment that's
a bit of a red herring.

01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:58.950
Instead of worrying about
the center of mass motion,

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:00.899
let's just focus on
the overall phase.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:11.140
So let's take our initial
electron with this initial wave

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:17.750
function a up z plus
b down z, and let's

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:23.069
note that in this time-- so
what does this matrix look like?

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:23.569
OK.

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:26.479
So fine, let's actually
look at this matrix.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:30.910
So Sz is the matrix 1, 0, 0,
minus 1 times h bar upon 2.

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:39.580
So we have h bar
upon 2 minus mu 0.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.465
And then B0 plus beta
z, which I'll just

01:09:41.465 --> 01:09:47.779
write as B, which is equal
to some constant C, 0, 0,

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:54.480
some constant minus C.
Everyone agree with that?

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.630
Where a constant, I
just mean it's a number,

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.696
but it does depend on z,
because the z is in here.

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:05.750
Now, here's the nice thing.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:14.390
When we expand the energy on
up z, this is equal to C of z

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:19.180
up z, because there's
our energy operator.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:26.685
And energy on down z is equal
to minus Cz of z down to z.

01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:28.060
So up and down in
the z direction

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.250
are still eigenfunctions
of the energy operator.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.970
We've chosen an
interaction, we've

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:35.100
chosen a potential which
is already diagonal,

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.390
so the energy is diagonal.

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:39.450
It's already in its eigenbasis.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:44.760
So as a consequence, this is the
energy, energy of the up state

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.270
is equal to, in the z
direction, is equal to plus C.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:53.180
And energy in the down state,
energy of the down state,

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.654
is equal to minus C of z.

01:10:56.654 --> 01:10:58.080
Everyone agree with that?

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.760
So what this magnetic
field does it

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.050
splits the degeneracy of
the up and down states.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.424
The up and down
states originally

01:11:03.424 --> 01:11:04.520
had no energy splitting.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.990
They were both zero energy.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:07.865
We turn on this magnetic
field, and one state

01:11:07.865 --> 01:11:09.531
has positive energy,
and the other state

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.480
has negative energy.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.570
So that degeneracy
has been split.

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:16.410
Where did that original
degeneracy come from?

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.410
Why did we have a degeneracy
in the first place?

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:19.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:20.460
PROFESSOR: Spherical symmetry.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.300
And we turn on the magnetic
field, which picks out

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.049
a direction, and we
break that degeneracy,

01:11:24.049 --> 01:11:26.080
and we lift the splitting.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.090
OK?

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.090
So here we see that the
splitting is lifted.

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.970
And now we want to ask, how
does the wave function evolve

01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:31.260
in time?

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.920
So this was our
initial wave function.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:39.089
But we know from the Schrodinger
equation that psi of t

01:11:39.089 --> 01:11:41.130
is going to be equal to--
well, those are already

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:52.600
eigenvectors-- so a e to the
minus i e up t upon h bar up z

01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:07.009
plus b e to the minus i e
down t upon h bar down z.

01:12:07.009 --> 01:12:07.508
All right?

01:12:07.508 --> 01:12:23.260
But we can write this as equals
a e to the i mu 0 b0 t over 2

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:39.450
plus i mu 0 beta t z upon 2 up
z plus b same e to the minus

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:41.520
i--oops, that should be,
oh, no, that's plus--

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.855
that's e to the i
mu 0 b0 t over 2.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:51.240
And if we write this
as two exponentials,

01:12:51.240 --> 01:13:00.130
e to the minus i mu 0
beta t z upon 2-- oh no,

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:02.081
that's a minus,
good, OK-- down z.

01:13:02.081 --> 01:13:02.580
OK.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.090
So what is this telling us?

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.840
So what this tells us
is that we start off

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.430
in a state, which has
some amplitude to be up

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:13.085
and some amplitude
to be down, a and b.

01:13:13.085 --> 01:13:16.420
And at a later
time t, sine of t,

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.360
what we find after we run
it through this apparatus

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.760
is that this is the amplitude.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760
What do you notice?

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.260
Well, we notice two things.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.200
The first is that
the system evolves

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.190
with some overall energy.

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:32.820
So the phase rotates as usual.

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.700
These are energy
eigenstates, but the amount

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.991
of phase rotation depends on z.

01:13:35.991 --> 01:13:40.640
So in particular, this is e
to the i some number times z.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.550
And what is e to the
i some number times z?

01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:48.870
If you know you have a state
that's of the form e to the i

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:52.101
some number, which I will, I
don't know, call kz times z,

01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:53.850
what is this telling
you about the system?

01:14:00.085 --> 01:14:01.710
This is an eigenstate
of what operator?

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:02.580
AUDIENCE: Momentum.

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.540
PROFESSOR: Momentum
in the z direction.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.800
It carries what momentum?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.591
AUDIENCE: h bar kz.

01:14:05.591 --> 01:14:07.280
PROFESSOR: h bar kz, exactly.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.310
So what about this?

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.319
If I have a system
in this state,

01:14:10.319 --> 01:14:12.610
what can you say about its
momentum in the z direction?

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.660
PROFESSOR: It's non-zero.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.580
Right here's a z.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.871
These are a bunch of constants.

01:14:20.871 --> 01:14:23.450
It's beta, t, mu 0, 2, i.

01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:24.790
So it's non-zero.

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:28.406
In fact, it's got minus
some constant times z.

01:14:28.406 --> 01:14:29.140
Right?

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:32.700
So this is a state
with negative momentum.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.360
Everyone agree?

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.100
It's got momentum z
down in the z direction.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.770
What about this guy?

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:40.440
Momentum up.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.842
So the states that are up in
the z direction get a kick up.

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:45.800
And the states that are
down in the z direction

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.466
get a kick down.

01:14:46.466 --> 01:14:50.000
They pick up some momentum
down in the z direction.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.500
Yeah?

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.870
AUDIENCE: Where did
that big T come from?

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:56.010
PROFESSOR: Big T should
be little t, sorry.

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:58.960
Sorry, just bad
handwriting there.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960
That's just t.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.903
Yeah?

01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:03.801
AUDIENCE: So in this
case, the eigenvalues--

01:15:03.801 --> 01:15:04.767
it's a function of z?

01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:05.733
PROFESSOR: Mhm.

01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:07.864
AUDIENCE: Is that allowable?

01:15:07.864 --> 01:15:08.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:11.840
So that seems bad, but remember
what I started out doing.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.367
Oop, did I erase it?

01:15:13.367 --> 01:15:14.200
Shoot, we erased it.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.540
So we started out saying,
look, the wave function is up

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:19.400
in the z direction, or
really rather here, up

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.274
in the z direction
times some constant.

01:15:21.274 --> 01:15:23.190
Now, in general, this
shouldn't be a constant.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:24.799
It should be some function.

01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:26.840
So this should be a function
of position times up

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.490
in the z direction.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.770
This is a function position
times down in the z direction.

01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:32.145
So what we've done here is we
said, under time evolution,

01:15:32.145 --> 01:15:36.330
that function changes
in time, but it

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.020
stays some linear
combination up and down.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.100
So you can reorganize this as--
the time evolution equation

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.455
here is an equation for
the coefficients of up z

01:15:44.455 --> 01:15:46.189
and the coefficient of down z.

01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.100
PROFESSOR: Other questions?

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:52.620
OK.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.160
So the upshot of all this is
that we run this experiment,

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.810
and what we discover is that
this component of the state

01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:03.370
that was up z gets a kick
in the plus z direction.

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:06.580
And any electron that
came from this term

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.860
in the superposition
will be kicked up up z.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:13.930
And any electron that came
from the superposition down z

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.274
will have down.

01:16:15.274 --> 01:16:17.690
Now, what we really mean is
not that an electron does this

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:19.900
or does that, but rather
that the initial stage

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.360
of an electron that's here,
with the superposition of z

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.610
up and down, ends up in the
state as a superposition of up

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:31.874
z being up here and
down z being down here.

01:16:31.874 --> 01:16:32.417
OK?

01:16:32.417 --> 01:16:34.500
An electron didn't do one,
it didn't do the other.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.950
It ends up in a superposition,
so the state at the end.

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.170
So what the Stern-Gerlach
experiment has done,

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:41.530
apparatus has done,
is it's correlated

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:45.540
the position of the
electron with its spin.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:50.590
So if you find the amplitude,
to find it up here and down

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:51.270
is very small.

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:53.820
The amplitude to find it up
here and up is very large.

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.500
Similarly, the amplitude, to
find it down here and up is 0.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:02.710
And the amplitude, to find it
down here and down is large.

01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:03.390
Cool?

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.610
So this is exactly what
we wanted from the boxes.

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.250
We wanted not to do
something funny to the spins,

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:11.690
we just wanted to correlate
the position with the spin.

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.480
And so the final state is a
superposition of these guys.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480
And which superposition?

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.450
It's exactly this superposition.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.575
So these calculations are
gone through in the notes

01:17:19.575 --> 01:17:20.930
that are going to be posted.

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.520
OK.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.930
So questions at this point?

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:25.430
Yeah?

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.179
AUDIENCE: And so when
you put the electron

01:17:27.179 --> 01:17:28.559
through the
Stern-Gerlach device,

01:17:28.559 --> 01:17:30.975
does that count as a measurement
of the particle's angular

01:17:30.975 --> 01:17:31.450
momentum?

01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:32.325
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

01:17:32.325 --> 01:17:34.760
When I put the electrons through
the Stern-Gerlach device,

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.660
do they come out with
a definite position?

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:37.560
AUDIENCE: No.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:37.690
PROFESSOR: No.

01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:39.070
At the end of the
experiment, they're

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:41.160
in a superposition of either
being here or being here.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.826
And they're in a
superposition of either

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:44.140
being up spin or down spin.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.270
Have we determined the
spin through putting it

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.530
through this apparatus?

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.030
No.

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:50.310
We haven't done any measurement.

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:52.434
The measurement comes when
we now do the following.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.800
We put a detector here
that absorbs an electron.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.185
We say, ah, yeah, it got hit.

01:17:56.185 --> 01:17:58.060
And then you've measured
the angular momentum

01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.740
by measuring where it came out.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.740
If it comes out down here,
it will be in the positive.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.805
So this is a nice example of
something called entanglement.

01:18:05.805 --> 01:18:07.930
And this is where we're
going to pick up next time.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:09.600
Entanglement says the following.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.230
Suppose I know one
property of a particle,

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:19.870
for example, that it's up here,
or suppose I'm in the state psi

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:30.430
is equal to up, so up here
and up in the z direction plus

01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:36.280
down there and down
in the z direction.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.482
OK?

01:18:37.482 --> 01:18:39.940
This means that, at the moment,
initially, if I said, look,

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:42.273
is it going to be up or down
with equal probabilities, 1

01:18:42.273 --> 01:18:44.800
over root 2 with
equal amplitudes,

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.560
if I measure spin in
the z direction, what

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.325
value will I get?

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.430
What values could
I get if I measure

01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.241
spin in the z direction?

01:18:54.241 --> 01:18:54.990
Plus or minus 1/2.

01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:56.531
And what are the
probabilities that I

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:58.170
measure plus 1/2 or minus 1/2?

01:18:58.170 --> 01:18:59.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:01.280
PROFESSOR: Even odds, right?

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.330
We've done that experiment.

01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:06.300
On the other hand, if
I tell you that I've

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.360
measured it to be up
here, what will you then

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.980
deduce about what its spin is?

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:14.946
AUDIENCE: Plus.

01:19:14.946 --> 01:19:16.070
PROFESSOR: Always plus 1/2.

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:17.600
Did I have to do the
measurement to determine

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.391
that it's plus 1/2.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.760
No, because I already
know the state,

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.920
so I know exactly what I will
get if I do the experiment.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.940
I measure up here, and
then the wave function

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:29.290
is this without the 1 over
root 2, upon measurement.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.498
But as a consequence, if I
subsequently measure up z,

01:19:31.498 --> 01:19:34.820
the only possible value
is up in the z direction.

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.346
Yeah?

01:19:36.346 --> 01:19:38.660
And this is called entanglement.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:46.809
And here it's entanglement of
the position with the spin.

01:19:46.809 --> 01:19:48.350
And next time, what
we'll do is we'll

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.710
study the EPR experiment,
which says the following thing.

01:19:51.710 --> 01:19:54.220
Suppose I take two electrons,
OK, take two electrons,

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.720
and I put them in the state one
is up and the other is down,

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.840
or the first is up and
the second is down.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.530
All right?

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:03.610
So up, down plus down, up.

01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:04.120
OK?

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.890
I now take my two electrons, and
I send them to distant places.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:12.150
Suppose I measure one of them
to be up in the x direction.

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:13.570
Yeah?

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:16.451
Then I know that the other
one is down in that direction.

01:20:16.451 --> 01:20:16.950
Sorry.

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.010
If I measure up in
the z direction,

01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:19.590
I determine the other one
is down in the z direction.

01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:22.449
But suppose someone over here
who's causally disconnected

01:20:22.449 --> 01:20:23.990
measures not spin
in the z direction,

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:25.940
but spin in the x direction.

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.890
They'll measure one of two
things, either plus or minus.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.670
Now, knowing what we know,
that it's in the z eigenstate,

01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:36.690
it will be either plus 1/2 in
the x direction or minus 1/2

01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:38.210
in the x direction.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:40.270
Suppose I get both measurements.

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:42.630
The distant person over here
does the measurement of z

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:46.180
and says, aha, mine is up, so
the other one must be down.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.830
But the person over here doesn't
measure Sz, they measure Sx,

01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:51.254
and they get that it's plus Sx.

01:20:51.254 --> 01:20:53.170
And what they've done
as a result of these two

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:55.340
experiments, Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen say,

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:58.460
is this electron has been
measured by the distant guy

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:05.500
to be spin z down, but by this
guy to be measured spin x up.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.139
So I know Sx and Sz definitely.

01:21:10.139 --> 01:21:12.680
But that flies in the face of
the uncertainty relation, which

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.250
tells us we can't have spin
z and spin x definitely.

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:18.122
Einstein and Podolsky
and Rosen say

01:21:18.122 --> 01:21:20.080
there's something missing
in quantum mechanics,

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.496
because I can do
these experiments

01:21:21.496 --> 01:21:26.440
and determine that this
particle is Sz down and Sx up.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.840
But what quantum
mechanics says is

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.202
that I may have done
the measurement of Sz,

01:21:35.202 --> 01:21:36.660
but that hasn't
determined anything

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.850
about the state over here.

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:39.600
There is no predetermined value.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.620
What we need to do is
we need to tease out,

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:45.130
we need an experimental
version of this tension.

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:47.444
The experimental
version of this tension,

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.860
fleshed out in the
EPR experiment,

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.010
is called Bell's inequality.

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:51.670
We studied it in the
very first lecture,

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:54.211
and we're going to show it's a
violation in the next lecture.

01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:55.470
See you guys next time.

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:57.020
[APPLAUSE]
