00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:15.496
&gt;&gt;Aaron: Adopting a flipped
classroom model requires

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:18.216
creating a new culture of
learning and like anything

00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:20.656
that disrupts the status quo,
that changes takes some time.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.986
&gt;&gt;Jon: Here are some strategies
to engage key stakeholders,

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.996
including students,
administrators and parents.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:32.216
&gt;&gt;Aaron: So I once had a
student say to me, "Mister Sams,

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:33.976
you just like this
flipped classroom model

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:36.226
because the students are
doing all the work in class."

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.446
And I said, "Yes, that's
exactly what I like it.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:42.046
I want my students to be the
most engaged participants

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.046
in the learning process.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:44.266
I want their minds active."

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:47.266
So if you start hearing from
your students that this is hard

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.576
and it's unlike anything
I've ever experienced,

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:50.586
that's a good sign.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:52.906
That's a sign that they're
engaged and you're transferring

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:54.226
that ownership to the students.

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:56.406
&gt;&gt;Jon: With those students,
if you stick with it,

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:59.846
they will learn to take more
ownership for their learning.

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:04.666
&gt;&gt;Aaron: A lot of teachers
are often surprised

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.056
that their administrators
are excited

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:07.446
about flipped classrooms
already.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.816
They've read the articles,

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:11.116
they've seen the emerging
research indicating

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:13.536
that flipped classrooms are
a viable teaching strategy.

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:14.706
&gt;&gt;Jon: But if you
have administrators

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:15.596
who are a little hesitant

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:17.926
about bringing a flipped
classroom model into the school,

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.126
then we have a couple of
strategies that you could employ

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:22.276
as you bring them
into the conversation.

00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:25.086
&gt;&gt;Aaron: In fact, open and
honest conversation is one

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.126
of the great starting points
with your administrators.

00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:30.566
Talk to them about how this will
increase the student engagement

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.206
in your classroom and be
very communicative about some

00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:35.156
of the changes that you'll
be making in your classroom

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:36.456
as you start to adopt this.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:39.036
&gt;&gt;Jon: Or just simply take
them to a flipped class.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.866
There's nothing like seeing the
flipped classroom in action.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:46.336
Parents generally love the
flipped classroom model

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:47.406
for two reasons.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.726
Number one, their student
gets more individual attention

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:50.416
from their teacher.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:51.836
Number two, the parent
doesn't have

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:53.806
to be the content
expert at home anymore.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:55.866
That role stays with
the teacher.

00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:58.126
&gt;&gt;Aaron: However, if you
find yourself in a situation

00:01:58.126 --> 00:01:59.526
where some parents are reluctant

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:01.696
to adopt an instructional
model that's different

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:04.376
than the one they grew up with,
you could try teaching them

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.796
about a flipped classroom using
a flipped classroom approach.

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:09.116
You could make a video for
your back to school night,

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.236
your curriculum night
or your open house,

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:13.556
in which you explain
how the class works

00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:15.396
and then the parents could
view that ahead of time

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.356
and bring questions to
ask you when they show up.

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:19.746
&gt;&gt;Jon: What better
way to teach parents

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:21.106
about the flipped
classroom model

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.306
than to flip the
back to school night?

00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.296
&gt;&gt;Aaron: So let's recap, your
students will probably love this

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.856
but if you're getting
a resistance, remember,

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.146
the transferring the
ownership of the learning

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.546
to the students is worth it
for them in the long run.

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:34.776
&gt;&gt;Jon: And if your
administrators are hesitant,

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.186
take them on a visit so they
can see the flipped classroom

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:37.666
in action.

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:38.906
&gt;&gt;Aaron: And for your parents,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.376
teach them about the flipped
classroom using the flipped

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:42.196
classroom approach.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.906
&gt;&gt;Jon: Remember, transforming a
culture of learning takes time

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:45.946
and support from
everybody involved.
