Alright, unless you had a fantastic memory,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.620
you probably had to check out the genetic

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.780
code found in the instructor's notes on this page. And if you did that you'd

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.640
find that the CGA would code for an arginine and that TGA or UGA would actually

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.580
code for a stop codon. And this is best characterized as a nonsense mutation.
