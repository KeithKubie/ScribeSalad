00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.080
You've learned a lot about visual encodings and visual perception.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.360
Now hear from Johnathan as he breaks down a very complex graphic

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.880
from The New York Times.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; Thanks Chris.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.600
The visualization that I'm going to be focusing on comes from

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.600
The New York Times, and was created by Jeremy Eskinouse, Matthew Block,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.020
Shan Carter, and Amanda Cox.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.190
This entire visualization was built in D3 and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.220
can be found in at the URL in my browser at the top here, and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.680
all you need to play with the graphic is simply any modern web browser.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.630
I really suggest that you go to the page to play with the interactive graphic.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.430
I'm just going to talk through a few visual encodings and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.410
elements of why I think this is a very effective visualization, but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.270
you do not really get the full effect until you experience it yourself.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.690
As you can see here, if you hover over each circle,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.420
you should get more information about each company.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.630
And at the top here, are next bud ins to progress through the animation and

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.040
the narrative of this visualization.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.379
One of the quickest, easiest, and clearest ways to communicate with your

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.460
reader and audience is through the effective use of a title.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
As you can see here, the visualization is very obviously trying to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.260
communicate how Facebook's IPO compares to the IPOs of

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.690
every other tech company in recent if not all of history.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.080
Of the visual encodings we talked about earlier, this visualization uses size,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.780
shape, x and y position, and color to encode its information.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.040
Though this visualization uses five visual encodings to convey its

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.340
information and data, not all these encodings I would say are equal.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.100
Two of these encode the same information and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.680
was typically referred to in visualizations as double encoding.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.700
In this case, the y axis, representing company value,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.130
is encoded both in the y coordinate or

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.420
y position of its circle, but also in the size or radius of that circle.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.800
The greater a company's value,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.000
the larger its circle will be, and the higher it will be placed on the y-axis.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
This double encoding of the company value,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.010
really emphasizes its importance in this visualization, especially since,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.540
as Chris just covered, positional encodings are the most accurate encoding.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.630
Also in this case, the x axis, or x position, encodes the year of the IPO,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.050
but also color, at the far left, is encoded by the brightness of the red and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.310
at the far right we have the bluest blues.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.480
So, in this case, color and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.080
x position both encode the year that the company IPOed.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.520
In this visualization,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.540
shape does not encode any concrete information since there are only circles.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.680
Since you always have to choose a shape for a bubble chart like this, a circle

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.750
is a neutral shape, at least until you start using other shapes in conjunction.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.870
But if there were circles, squares, maybe triangles,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.140
each of those can encode a different type of company maybe by its industry but

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.260
in our case, again, since there's only circles,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.180
shape does not encode much concrete or valuable information.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.960
A fifth encoding that we haven't explicitly covered and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.780
is sometimes not formally thought of as a visual encoding is opacity.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.260
Opacity is very similar to color saturation or

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.460
density, as we covered previously, but it is not exactly the same.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.030
The opacity in this case, refers to how transparent each of the circles are.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.490
And while the opacity doesn't communicate any information about the data points,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.290
in our case it does allow us to se the relative distribution of

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.660
the data points and how they overlap.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.410
Since there is many companies that apparently IPOed in the year 2000,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.310
they all had relatively small company values at the time.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.930
We see a very dense dark purple, but if you notice as we go up,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.300
we have a few circles where we can notice the overlap, and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.210
some circle that are off on their own, with no overlap.
