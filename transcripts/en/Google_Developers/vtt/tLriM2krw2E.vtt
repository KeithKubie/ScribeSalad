00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.350
MANDY WAITE: Another
one for you.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.760
Another performance.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.544
So, what is the performance
difference between GAE Python,

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:10.261
GAE Java, and GAE Go?

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.930
FRED SAUER: OK.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.500
Fair question.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.680
This is actually one that
comes up a lot.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.560
It's a question that I try
at first not to answer--

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.000
MANDY WAITE: Right.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.270
FRED SAUER: --and then I'm
happy to give an answer.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.600
But I'd like to start out
and say there are subtle

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.450
differences between the three
different runtime

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.380
environments.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.670
Python--

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.240
if you write any application in
Python versus Java versus

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.820
Go, there are some things that
work better in one language

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.650
versus another.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.470
What's probably much more
important for your

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.970
application, for your service
that you're running, is what

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.120
your developers know and where
they're going to be

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.380
productive.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.300
So if you have a Python shop--

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.220
everyone knows Python really
well, and there's one or two

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.800
guys that know a little
bit of Java--

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.170
even if Java were slightly
better for your application,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.440
you're going to be much more
productive building in Python,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.690
so you should do that.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.180
And the same goes the
other way around.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.130
Having said that, if all things
were equal, if you

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.080
hadn't hired any development
staff yet or you could pick

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.150
any language or you just want to
learn something new, there

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.850
are some trade offs to make.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.170
And maybe you should look at the
complexity of the product

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.850
that you're building and how
long it's going to last.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.010
Python is a scripting
language--

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.370
tends to be a little more
productive for people

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.690
prototyping, iterating
in small teams,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.370
kind of working together.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.780
Let's you be very agile.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.870
You can do things
very quickly.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.410
If on the other hand, you're
building a product and you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.430
have a very large development
team or a very complex code

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.280
base-- you're doing a lot of
refactoring and you could use

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.890
some help from tools that can
kind of refactor your code, do

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.480
static analysis--

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.268
then Java is probably a
language that's more

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:56.570
productive.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.060
And if you want to do something
that's really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
performance sensitive and you
want to build with the stuff

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
that Googlers are building on, I
would seriously check on the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.590
Go runtime.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.470
There's some really pleasing
results there.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.520
Having said that, it's an
experimental runtime still, so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.350
if you're building a production
app, right now

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.540
probably Java or Python.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.396
Pick the one you'll
be in productive.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.787
MANDY WAITE: So retraining your
Java developers to work

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:27.520
in Go is probably not the best
way to get performance?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.330
FRED SAUER: Unless that's
what motivates them.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.150
And for some people, a new
language is the thing that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.550
wakes them up in the morning,
more so than a cup of coffee.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.270
For other people, it's being
able to be productive and hit

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.860
the ground running.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.273
MANDY WAITE: Excellent.

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:41.686
OK.

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:42.936
Good advice.
