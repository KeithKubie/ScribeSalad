another reason the finale to last

00:23:12.739 --> 00:23:12.749
another reason the finale to last
 

00:23:12.749 --> 00:23:16.190
another reason the finale to last
airbender worked is you had a set of

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200
airbender worked is you had a set of
 

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.960
airbender worked is you had a set of
characters that you have really got to

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:17.970
characters that you have really got to
 

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.210
characters that you have really got to
know and really really like like you

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220
know and really really like like you
 

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.950
know and really really like like you
know every character in and out and

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960
know every character in and out and
 

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.499
know every character in and out and
there was a progression and they didn't

00:23:24.499 --> 00:23:24.509
there was a progression and they didn't
 

00:23:24.509 --> 00:23:26.810
there was a progression and they didn't
deviate from their characters to a point

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820
deviate from their characters to a point
 

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.219
deviate from their characters to a point
where it took you out of the story like

00:23:28.219 --> 00:23:28.229
where it took you out of the story like
 

00:23:28.229 --> 00:23:30.200
where it took you out of the story like
why are we doing this or why have we not

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:30.210
why are we doing this or why have we not
 

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.210
why are we doing this or why have we not
seen this character forever why it's

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220
seen this character forever why it's
 

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.869
seen this character forever why it's
just better written and when you are so

00:23:35.869 --> 00:23:35.879
just better written and when you are so
 

00:23:35.879 --> 00:23:37.519
just better written and when you are so
close to those characters that are able

00:23:37.519 --> 00:23:37.529
close to those characters that are able
 

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:39.440
close to those characters that are able
to make that connection it makes a

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:39.450
to make that connection it makes a
 

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:42.499
to make that connection it makes a
finale like that so much more important

00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:42.509
finale like that so much more important
 

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:46.070
finale like that so much more important
and meaningful this really works and I

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080
and meaningful this really works and I
 

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.310
and meaningful this really works and I
did love this finale because we're

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320
did love this finale because we're
 

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.719
did love this finale because we're
finally at the point where I've made

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:50.729
finally at the point where I've made
 

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.940
finally at the point where I've made
that connection but I don't have two

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:52.950
that connection but I don't have two
 

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.619
that connection but I don't have two
seasons previous where that was done

00:23:54.619 --> 00:23:54.629
seasons previous where that was done
 

00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:58.009
seasons previous where that was done
perfectly um in my opinion overall I

00:23:58.009 --> 00:23:58.019
perfectly um in my opinion overall I
 

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.779
perfectly um in my opinion overall I
think season one did it better and there

00:23:59.779 --> 00:23:59.789
think season one did it better and there
 

00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:01.430
think season one did it better and there
were chunks of season two that touched

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440
were chunks of season two that touched
 

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.950
were chunks of season two that touched
upon it but not until right near the end

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960
upon it but not until right near the end
 

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.659
upon it but not until right near the end
so it's like we've been sitting here

00:24:05.659 --> 00:24:05.669
so it's like we've been sitting here
 

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:08.089
so it's like we've been sitting here
complaining about these things because

00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:08.099
complaining about these things because
 

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:09.589
complaining about these things because
the characters have been inconsistent

00:24:09.589 --> 00:24:09.599
the characters have been inconsistent
 

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:13.960
the characters have been inconsistent
all over the map you know basically just

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970
all over the map you know basically just
 

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.349
all over the map you know basically just
kind of just bad writing um you know but

00:24:18.349 --> 00:24:18.359
kind of just bad writing um you know but
 

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:19.489
kind of just bad writing um you know but
when you have characters that are

00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:19.499
when you have characters that are
 

00:24:19.499 --> 00:24:21.200
when you have characters that are
strongly written you have a progression

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.210
strongly written you have a progression
 

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.450
strongly written you have a progression
