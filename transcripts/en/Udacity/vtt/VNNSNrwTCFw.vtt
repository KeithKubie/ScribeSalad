00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It turns out that, yes, if there have been many bugs in one place,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
it is likely that there will be more bugs in the very same place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the more interesting, because all the bugs we see have been fixed,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so you'd assume that over time there would be fewer bugs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But that's not the case.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
With bugs it's like fishing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You find plenty of bugs in one place one day.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The next day fish will assemble at the same place again,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
possibly because fish like the same places again and again,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
except that for fish we have a good theory on how the reproduce.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
For bugs, we do not.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There is a bit of a hypothesis though.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The assumption is that the same factors that have contributed to bugs in the past

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
will keep on contributing in the future.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Generally speaking, past fixes and a bit less so past changes

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
are good predictors for future fixes.
