MARY KATE: Hello, and
welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.300
I am super excited
to be here today

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.220
to introduce "Profit
from the Positive."

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.420
And I'm not just saying
that because I read the book

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.790
and learned that it's best
to start with a sizzle.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.060
I'm saying that because the book
is actually quite excellent.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.840
I am a researcher here at
the People and Innovation lab

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290
at Google, where
my job has defined

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.690
new ways to use social science
to create one of the best

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.360
places to be a creative worker.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.330
And in my role here,
I am constantly

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.320
looking for new Google-y
ways to make our company

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.430
a more amazing place to work.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.820
And it is my pleasure to
be introducing this talk,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.970
because this book is full of
ideas on how to do just that.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.540
Senia Maymin, an executive coach
and founder of two startups,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.690
and Margaret Greenberg, founder
of the consulting and coaching

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770
practice, the Greenberg Group,
have scoured the research

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.730
and come up with concise
answer to the question,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.000
how can we get people to
perform at their best?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.470
And their answer is by
identifying, cultivating,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.790
and using their
strengths every day.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.160
Creating roles,
work relationships,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.270
and organizations
where people can

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.240
do that while under intense
pressure to innovate

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.770
is not easy.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.110
And this book isn't
the silver bullet.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.790
But it does offer
a silver lining.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.740
Creative new ways of approaching
day-to-day management

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.220
challenges by focusing on what
drives employee engagement.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.610
I look forward to learning more.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.167
Join me in welcoming
Senia and Margaret.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:42.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.330
SENIA MAYMIN: Hello, hello.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.959
Hello, Google.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.000
We're very excited to talk
to you about the book.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.160
And specifically, to
give you three tools

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.010
that you can walk away with.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.970
As you see in the
subtitle of the book,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.930
we have Boost Productivity,
Transform Your Business.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.720
So you're literally going to
walk out of here with tools

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.034
to help you amp up
your productivity

00:02:07.034 --> 00:02:07.825
and your influence.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.517
The book has a few
different components

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:15.100
that you may have
already heard about.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.030
But basically, it takes
the latest research,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.860
just like Mary Kate just said.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.560
And it uses over
30 practical tools.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.510
And one thing that
you'll see throughout,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.551
and you'll see throughout
what we're telling you,

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.760
is that there are real
life case studies.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.800
Both what Margaret
and I have experienced

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.680
as we've been executive
coaches and have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.310
worked with people who
want more productivity, who

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.750
want more influence.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.950
And as an aside, we
actually often find

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.710
that the people who want
to be most productive

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.552
are those people
who already are.

00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:45.760
So when we ask people, what
do you really want to do?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.635
The ones who say they
want more productivity,

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:50.330
they tend to already
be more productive.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.430
As an example of the
real-life case studies,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.950
you'll see that in the
book, in Chapter Five,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.360
which is the hiring chapter.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.040
The first part is what
you can do for yourself.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.730
And the second part
of the book are

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.800
common problems, common
issues, such as hiring,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.290
how to bring out the
best performance reviews.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.620
So you will see that we featured
Google highly in the hiring

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.700
chapter.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.810
What other company has
a term like Google-y?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.700
That is just really
neat that you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.195
think about hiring in
a specific way that's

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:24.070
very specific to you.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.680
The other example of a very
strong company that does that

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.340
is Zappos.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.535
And for them, the
word is "more weird."

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:32.160
More weird is what's
important to them.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.974
But not too weird,
not too little weird.

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:35.890
So it's very important
to think about culture.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.170
And you'll see that in
the Chapter Five section.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.930
Today, what are we
really talking about?

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.890
We're talking about getting more
done, but without necessarily

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.700
working more hours.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.040
So what can we do?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.720
Before we do this,
I want to tell you

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.680
a little bit about
what is this thing that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.260
is our time pressure to succeed.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.180
Americans work eight hours
more per week than Germans,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.990
but we are no more
productive, unfortunately.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.480
If you look around the room,
7 of the 10 people around you

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.610
will tell you that work is
a major source of stress.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.279
Maybe not here,
maybe not at Google,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.070
as there are a lot of
people working on it.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.490
But this is a
national statistic.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.850
There has been a
time diary study

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.760
done by sociologists since 1965
that literally has measured

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.960
what do people do and how
do they spend their time?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.360
And from 1965 until today, we
have only one additional hour

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.310
of free time.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.740
Now, how great or
not great is that?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.040
We have great technology.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.580
We have multiple ways
that we can get more time.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.980
But we're not getting
that much more time.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.050
So if you liked listening
to music in 1965,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.980
and you like listening
to that same music now,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.790
you only have one
more hour to do it.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.950
This is a major concept
that Margaret and I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.780
talk about with
every single company

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.280
that we have worked with.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.840
Which is flip-flop costs.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.060
You may be more familiar with
the term as multitasking.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.950
We all do it.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.450
I do it.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.949
You do it.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.630
Everybody multitasks.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.830
The part about multitasking
that you may not

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.250
know about is
multitasking can be fine,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.160
but it's the switching
cost, that flip-flop cost.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.510
So flipping from one
project to another.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.390
And that's the
part that actually

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.110
decreases your
productivity by 40%.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.630
The book is called "Profit
from the Positive."

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.009
We want you to profit
financially, emotionally,

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.550
mentally from these
tools that you're

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.020
going to walk out of here with.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.760
But what is this positive
thing that we have there?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.820
So I'll tell you
first what it's not.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.710
I'm going to give
you the bartender's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.630
guide to positive psychology.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.740
So when people see
the word "positive,"

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.710
they often think,
oh, smiley faces.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.900
They think this is a
rosy-eyed view of the world.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.350
Sometimes people
think, oh, that is

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.680
and that should be the
glass-half-full mentality.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.430
But no.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.720
It's actually the
disturbing-the-water part

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.370
of the glass.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.870
That's what we think
positive psychology is.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.310
Positive psychology
is an academic study.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.620
And it's basically saying,
OK, glass half full.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.680
There's the water level.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.566
But how can we study
that water level?

00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:17.940
How can we figure
out what really

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.540
does make people
optimistic, what

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.270
really does make
people more resilient?

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.780
Another thing that
people sometimes

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.270
say about positive
psychology is,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.811
oh, you mean that
kind of thing where

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.460
I sit around doing
gratitude mantras

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.630
and I try to really make
lemonade out of lemons?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.820
And we say, no.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.735
Please don't necessarily
try to do that.

00:06:34.735 --> 00:06:36.860
One of the things that you
may very well want to do

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.910
is you may want to take
just part of that lemon,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.790
and squeeze it
into a lime drink.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.410
Do something totally different.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.570
So not necessarily that positive
means smiling and always good.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.740
One thing that you will
not walk out of here with

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.420
is you will not walk out
of here with this attitude

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.310
that, I now feel more positive
about my productivity,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.820
and therefore I am.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.450
That's not what's
going to happen.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.200
So now that I've told
you all these things

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.730
that positive psychology is not,
what is positive psychology?

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.330
It's basically the
study of what's right.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.410
What do I mean by that?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.550
It's the study of what's
right in relationships,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.900
in personal fulfillment, in
business, in productivity.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.730
And it's when you look at
those things that are working.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.490
So let me give you an example.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.570
Take off your Google
hats for moment,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.490
and put on your architect hat.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.460
So pretend that you are
a British architect.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.950
And you are out to make the best
bridges that you can possibly

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.910
make.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.410
You have at least two different
things that you can do.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.030
You can look at all the
bridges that have fallen

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.360
and collapsed, and
are not standing,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.280
and the suspension
has gone wrong.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.980
Or you can look at
all the bridges that

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.180
have withstood the test of
time, that have been standing

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.820
for decades, centuries,
maybe thousands of years.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.290
Now, one thing we're
saying is don't not

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.850
study the bridges
that have collapsed.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.650
That's a very, very
important thing to do.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.990
We're good at problem solving.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.890
That's an important thing to do.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.020
But also look at the
bridges that have

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.460
withstood the test of time.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.960
Why?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.334
Because you're
not going to learn

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:16.640
the same lessons from both.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.380
So researchers in
social psychology

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.090
have studied bad marriages.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.590
And they found that
in bad marriages

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.030
there are a lot of arguments.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.738
So you might make the
conclusion that you

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.730
might want to not have
arguments in order

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.730
to have a good marriage.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.859
But researchers have
studied good marriages,

00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:33.400
and they found that
in good marriages

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.140
there are a lot of arguments.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.210
It's just, how do you
get past the arguments?

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.289
How do you resolve them?

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.559
So what we're saying is, also
study the strong bridges.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.500
These three tools.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.580
I'm going to give
you a shortcut,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.240
and they won't mean
anything to you right now.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.198
But at the end, they'll
mean everything to you.

00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:50.230
Trick Yourself.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.990
FRE, which is actually free.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.490
And that means
Don't Be an Expert.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.290
Let's start with Trick Yourself.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.710
This is what we hear
as executive coaches.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.810
We hear our clients,
who are already

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.470
highly successful people,
saying to us, I'm stuck.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.950
I'm not sure how to start.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.060
Or saying to us, it's important.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.500
I know this thing is important.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.870
But I just get too busy
working on other things.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.220
So what do we tell them to do?

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.430
One of the things that we try to
put into their toolkit is this.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.320
Imagine.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.000
Imagine that you are in
an experimental room,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.139
and a social psychologist has
come up to you and has said,

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:27.680
this is how we'll
run this experiment

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.890
that you've agreed
to participate in.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.940
I'm going to give you 20
activities, one by one.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.790
Each one of them will take
about three to five minutes.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.780
And I want you to do them
as I bring you new ones.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.420
So I might ask you
to make a puzzle.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.340
I might ask you to
make a clay figure.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.680
Say I'll give you some
yellow and brown clay.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.600
I might ask you to
fold the cardboard box.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.460
I might ask you to do
some different activities.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.220
Now, unbeknownst to you as
you start this experiment,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.460
at some point, the
experimenter will come in

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.550
and will actually
interrupt your activity

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.860
and tell you that it's time
to go on to the next one.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.390
So it might be that
you're doing an anagram,

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.684
and experimenter comes in
and says, OK, that's enough.

00:10:09.684 --> 00:10:10.850
Let's go on to the next one.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.990
Or it might be that you're doing
a crossword puzzle or LEGOs,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.320
and the experimenter comes
in and says, let's move on.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.420
Now, here's a question for you.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.210
At the end of the
experiment, the experimenter

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.340
will ask you, which
ones do you remember?

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.610
So he'll actually say,
do you remember the ones

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.927
that you were interrupted?

00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:32.510
He'll say, which
ones do you remember?

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.210
And I want you to list them.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.250
So my question to
you is, do you think

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.660
you're more likely to
remember the interrupted ones?

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.980
And let's say the jigsaw
puzzle, the little giraffe,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.710
and the anagrams
are the interrupted,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.450
and the other ones
are the completed.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.500
Or do you think you're
more likely to remember

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.442
the completed ones?

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.377
AUDIENCE: Interrupted.

00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:52.460
SENIA MAYMIN: Interrupted.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.585
So let's get some comments.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:55.080
Why did somebody
say "interrupted?"

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.517
Why?

00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:58.350
AUDIENCE: Your brain
is still working on it.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.700
SENIA MAYMIN: Your brain
is still working on them.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.320
What else?

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.460
AUDIENCE: More disturbing.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.066
SENIA MAYMIN: More disturbing?

00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:04.040
How disturbing?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.910
AUDIENCE: Disturbing
that I'm not done yet.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.610
SENIA MAYMIN: Not done yet.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.550
I want to do something else.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.800
Your brain is working on them.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.650
It's more disturbing.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.820
Who has a comment on
the completed ones?

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.230
That you spent
more time on them?

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.320
This room votes
interrupted, yes?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.110
This whole room
is entirely right.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.070
The interrupted tasks
were remembered so much so

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.650
that they were-- the room is
high-fiving each other, just

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.560
for the record.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.420
They were remembered so much
so that they were remembered

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.290
90% of the time more
than the completed tasks.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.605
Now, that's a little bit funny.

00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:37.980
I know the room
doesn't think so.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.900
But it's a little bit funny.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.358
Because you actually
had the chance

00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:42.592
to spend more time on
the completed tasks.

00:11:42.592 --> 00:11:43.300
What's happening?

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.860
It's exactly what the two
people here in the front said.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.919
It's that when you leave
things unfinished, really,

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:50.710
the way that the
experimenter described it,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.769
is there's a tension.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:53.060
There's a tension in your head.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.851
That's unfinished, how
do I get back to it?

00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.650
It's still rolling
around in your head.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.840
Now if you're at
a cocktail party

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.270
and you want to
be really snazzy,

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.820
this is called the
Zeigarnik Effect,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.360
for the researcher
who created it.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.950
So the fact that you
want to come back

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.080
to things that were unfinished.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.720
Let's take you to a
different place-- car washes.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.030
Who needs to go to a car wash?

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.980
I needed to last week.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.180
Car washes.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.310
Suppose you have one of
these two sets of car washes.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.450
You've gone to a car wash.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.530
You've driven by, you've
gone to a car wash.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.360
And you think, OK, I
got a car wash here.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.230
And at the end, the
person at the car wash

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.090
gives you a coupon.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.010
The person gives you
either this coupon.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.420
So this coupon has
eight little places

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.940
that you have to stamp before
you can get the ninth free car

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.880
wash.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.700
Or the person gives
you this coupon,

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.070
in which there are
10 places to stamp

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.820
before you get
the 11th car wash.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.310
But notice that the first
two are stamped out.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.900
Another question for you.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.060
In which one of these do you
think you would go all the way

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.020
and go to, in effect,
nine car washes

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.640
to get your free car wash?

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.360
The one with--

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.235
AUDIENCE: Two stamps.

00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:02.240
SENIA MAYMIN: With
the two stamps.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.060
Why?

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.707
AUDIENCE: Because it's that
they already give us something.

00:13:07.707 --> 00:13:09.290
SENIA MAYMIN: They
give you something.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.450
Almost like something free?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they give
something with the [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.034
SENIA MAYMIN: OK.

00:13:16.034 --> 00:13:19.922
AUDIENCE: I agree, but I think
the reason that I would say,

00:13:19.922 --> 00:13:21.866
because the process
already started.

00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:23.810
So leaving the
second one would feel

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.294
like wasting the two car washes.

00:13:25.294 --> 00:13:26.710
SENIA MAYMIN: So
there's a comment

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.584
that it feels like you're
wasting the two car

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:30.560
washes that you
didn't actually do,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.784
but that you may be wasting.

00:13:31.784 --> 00:13:32.950
Did you have a comment here?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.570
AUDIENCE: Similar.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.370
SENIA MAYMIN: Similar comment.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.300
And what did you want to say?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.061
AUDIENCE: I think
also, you don't

00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:37.585
need to get over
any mental hurdle,

00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:39.420
because the decision has
been made for you already.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.800
SENIA MAYMIN: The decision
has been made for you.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.020
You don't need to get
over any mental hurdle.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.110
You guys are right on.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.350
So either you've read the
book, or you're right in line

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.060
with the thinking
of the psychologist.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.060
Basically, 300 people--
about 150 in each group--

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.240
went through 19%
of that group where

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.180
they had to get eight stamps
to get the free ninth one.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.050
19% of that went
all the way through.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.380
Of the other group, 32%.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.710
So there's something
about having started.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.919
There's something about that.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.501
We'll give you an
example of something

00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.485
we see in our coaching.

00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:12.110
We see that when somebody needs
to put a presentation together,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.760
or put a report together,
sometimes they'll just start

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.050
and then step away from it.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.570
So literally plan that they
will step away from it.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.820
They kind of trick themselves.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.590
Or something that's in the
book is one of our clients

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.670
writes a to-do list, but she
writes the first two items

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.920
and immediately
crosses them off.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.260
It's a little funny, right?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.240
It's like you're very, very
physically tricking yourself.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.234
So now a question for you.

00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:37.900
And I'll give you the
very specific ways

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.769
that you can approach
the question.

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:41.310
This is my favorite
page in the book.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.160
It's page 17.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.614
It's 5-1-smallest.

00:14:43.614 --> 00:14:45.780
It's just like all the
things that you've described.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.280
But there are really
three questions

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.390
to be able to get yourself
to that trick-yourself state.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.860
5-1-smallest.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.030
What can I do in five minutes?

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.250
What can I do to move the
project forward by 1%?

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.230
And what's the
smallest action I can

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.810
take for the biggest impact?

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.580
They're very simple questions,
but sometimes simplicity

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.180
can make us take a step forward.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.430
I'd like you to
look around the room

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.390
and choose somebody who
you didn't walk in with,

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.520
and to turn to that person.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.445
And I'm going to give you about
a minute and a half per person.

00:15:19.445 --> 00:15:22.090
And to turn to that
person and to tell

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.857
them, what is a project--
Ideo tends to do this.

00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:27.690
They tend to really,
really trick themselves

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.307
into getting started.

00:15:29.307 --> 00:15:30.390
Let me just give you this.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.270
Today is Tuesday.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.603
For everybody watching online
as well, today is Tuesday.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.680
It will always be Tuesday when
you watch this presentation.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.240
This week, on what
project do I need

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.890
to trick myself into
getting started?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.380
So you already
know what that is.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.010
So tell a partner what that is.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.160
And ask yourself, and
have the partner ask you,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.180
how can I apply this five
minutes, 1%, smallest action

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.870
principle?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.550
Please go ahead.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.310
And both ways.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.579
You and then the other person.

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:57.412
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.150
SENIA MAYMIN: OK,
let's come back.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:10.480
Who would like to share
a trick-yourself example?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.981
So either the project
or what you've

00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:13.938
thought of that you can
do to trick yourselves.

00:16:13.938 --> 00:16:15.600
So I would love a
couple of volunteers

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.430
to share their
project and what it

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.590
is that you thought
to trick yourself in.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.052
Five minutes, 1%,
or smallest thing.

00:16:24.052 --> 00:16:25.010
MARGARET GREENBERG: OK.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.740
SENIA MAYMIN: This is Margaret.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.115
MARGARET GREENBERG:
I'm Margaret.

00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:27.840
Hi.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.660
One of the things that we
did is we wrote every Friday.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.564
We had a meeting at
one o'clock Eastern.

00:16:32.564 --> 00:16:33.480
I'm on the east coast.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.440
SENIA MAYMIN: Margaret's in
Connecticut, I'm in California.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.220
MARGARET GREENBERG: And so we
had this meeting every Friday

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.160
by phone.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.690
And what I would do
is I would send Senia

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.390
an email on all that I
accomplished that day.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.290
Whether I rewrote a chapter,
or did a piece of research.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.540
But when did I write the email?

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.350
I wrote it first
thing in the morning

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.070
at 7:30, as if I had already
completed all those things.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.715
And then I hit the send button
at five minutes before one.

00:16:58.715 --> 00:16:59.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.490
SENIA MAYMIN: Wonderful.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.308
The comment is he
was trying to do

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:07.849
yoga and meditation
every day, and he

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.880
found it hard to
commit to 90 minutes.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.790
So he told himself
and started doing

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.609
one minute per day, 60 seconds.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.069
You've done it for months now?

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.890
Fabulous.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.460
There's some research
that if you're

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.720
trying to get into the habit
of flossing your teeth,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.210
you really should
just floss one tooth.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.260
It gets you started.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.437
This was trick yourself
into getting started.

00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:32.020
And now we're going
to move on to FRE.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.950
And here's Margaret with that.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.970
MARGARET GREENBERG:
Thank you Senia.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.490
Thank you.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.110
So here we go.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.400
FRE-- Frequent Recognition
and Encouragement.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.380
And guess what?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.935
It really is free.

00:17:45.935 --> 00:17:47.310
And what we're
talking about here

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.090
is not formal
recognition programs

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.460
that most companies have.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.520
It's the informal recognition,
the expression of appreciation.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.830
So what do we know about that?

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.250
Well, I'll tell you
a little story first.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.880
There was a company that I
was coaching the president--

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.280
actually, here in California
now that I think about it.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.750
And they had just
acquired another company.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.180
And so we brought together the
leaders from both companies.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.070
And we wanted to do an inventory
of all the management practices

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.330
that both companies had.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.040
And so he asked the head of
HR from the other company,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.500
so what kind of
management practices

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.050
do you have to improve the
performance of your employees?

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.150
And the head of HR said, we
have a progressive discipline

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.190
process.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.900
So you can imagine,
I nearly fell off

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.340
my chair what I
heard that, right?

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.000
So I thought to
myself, well, imagine

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.250
if we had a progressive
feedback process.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.870
What might that look like?

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.980
So we got curious.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.210
Actually another colleague
of mine, Dana Arakawa, who

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.980
also went to UPenn
with Senia and me,

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.980
we got curious and decided
to conduct a study.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.830
But think about it.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.330
Progressive discipline.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.840
That's like-- do we have
any golfers in the room?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.060
That's like hiring of
golf pro who says just

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.965
before every swing, don't miss!

00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:07.790
Don't miss!

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.650
Don't miss!

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.630
Right?

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.640
So we said, there's
got be another way.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.680
So we wanted to conduct a study.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.020
So there was a company, another
high technology organization,

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.440
part of a large financial
services company.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.230
The CIO was curious, too.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.790
Was there any link
between giving

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.660
frequent recognition
and encouragement

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.820
and the performance of that
particular individual in team?

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.440
So one of the
things we often get

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.360
from clients is
they'll ask us, how

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.810
do I get the most out of people?

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.570
And we actually
suggest that they

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.410
ask themselves a somewhat
different question.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.810
Not a question and
that sounds like you're

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.190
trying to squeeze every last
ounce out of an employee--

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.440
how do I get the most?

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.580
Instead, we suggest that
they ask this question.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.121
How can we bring out the best?

00:19:59.121 --> 00:19:59.620
Now.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.779
You probably all know about
some of the Gallup research.

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:04.320
One of the ways to
bring out the best

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.580
is really to understand
and know your strengths

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.112
and get to use them every day.

00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:09.570
How many people
have actually taken

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.764
some kind of
strengths assessment?

00:20:11.764 --> 00:20:12.590
OK.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.930
How many people actually
consciously apply

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.034
their strengths every day?

00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:17.800
Great.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.300
OK.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.350
Keep working on it.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.310
Well, another way that you
can really bring out the best

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.750
is by giving frequent
recognition and encouragement.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.420
And again, it's free.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.400
So this study was at a financial
services company technology

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.710
department.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:37.860
About 900 technology employees,
about $100 million budget.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.440
And so we decided
to see if there

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.761
was any link between
these positive practices,

00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:45.260
like frequent recognition and
encouragement, and the results

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.230
that they got.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.180
So what did we find out?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.760
Well, one of the things--
and you probably know this,

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.050
working here at Google--
technology people

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.570
love to measure everything.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.310
In fact, I like to say
if you can't measure it,

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.814
it doesn't exist.

00:21:03.814 --> 00:21:05.230
They'll tell me,
if it doesn't fit

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.188
into a spreadsheet,
Margaret, it doesn't exist.

00:21:07.188 --> 00:21:08.610
I'm like, well, maybe not.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.870
So we were curious.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:16.530
So we conducted this study
with about 155 IT folks.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.910
Some of them were project
managers, architects, BAs,

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.140
et cetera.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.150
And we wanted to see
what the connection was.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.610
And the cool thing is they
had nine performance measures

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.480
that we didn't even
have to come up with.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.660
Performance measures such
as were they on budget?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.010
Were they on time, on schedule?

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.920
And what about quality,
the number of defects?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.520
And they had another handful
of other performance measures

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.840
as well.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.760
So we took a look at that.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.660
And we created a survey.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.250
And we asked questions
such as, my manager regular

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.520
recognizes project milestones?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.450
And how frequent does your
manager recognize performance?

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.800
And some other follow-on
questions as well.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.950
In fact, this particular
survey is actually

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.810
in the book in the appendix
that you can take yourself,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.850
and can also have
others take it.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.730
So what did we find out?

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.880
Well, we took the
employees' answers

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.900
to those questions and others.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.910
And we were able to
actually rank the responses,

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.580
from those managers that
received really high scores

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.560
on frequent recognition
and encouragement

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.910
and those that
scored really low.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.850
So we put it into the
quartiles, high to low.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.010
And guess what we found?

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.390
We now have the data.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.630
We actually saw a 42% increase
in the team performance

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.360
by those managers that
scored in that top quartile

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.150
for giving FRE than those
that scored in the bottom.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.930
So it made a big
difference-- 42%.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.560
So why don't we do, then?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.340
Why don't we do either
peer-to-peer more often,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.810
or manager direct report?

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.250
Why don't we do more of it?

00:22:59.250 --> 00:22:59.750
Well.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.230
There's a couple reasons why.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.270
One.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.130
We've been taught that there
are other productivity tools.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.150
Are you familiar with Lean
Six Sigma and tools like that?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.450
That to improve
productivity, you

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.510
have to measure the
work, the process.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.010
Now, I wouldn't
want you to walk out

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.950
of here thinking that
Senia and I aren't

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.880
in favor of improving process.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.470
We are.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.590
In fact, I spent a
good part of the '90s

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.390
doing process re-engineering.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.190
So I'm intimately
familiar with it.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.370
| you're missing out on a big
part of the results equation

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.180
when you don't also
look at the worker.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.810
How can we improve performance
through some of our practices?

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.210
Negativity bias.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.410
That's a term psychologists
use to describe

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.660
why we don't do
certain things, why

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.600
we tend to look at the
glass as half empty.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.580
Some evolutionary
psychologists believe

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.420
that for early
man to survive, he

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.160
had to be on the lookout for
that saber toothed tiger, not

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.080
a beautiful sunset.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.580
So we are often keen
to finding fault.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.910
We are more apt to catch people
doing things wrong than we

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.609
are to catch them
doing things right.

00:24:07.609 --> 00:24:10.150
Think about, you're all probably
familiar with those customer

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.000
service stats.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.850
Where when we have poor
service, we tell 13 people.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.840
But what we have seller
service, we only tell five.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.240
So we're hard-wired to
look at what's wrong.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.320
So giving positive feedback
doesn't come easily

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.650
to some people.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.680
And then lastly,
we've heard just

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.680
about every excuse in
our coaching practices

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.140
on why people don't do it.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.030
And here are a couple
of our favorites.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:39.470
"I'm too busy." "That's
what they get paid to do."

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.080
"I don't like encouragement
or need it to do my job."

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.580
Then we show them the data.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.700
"It's too early to celebrate."
we hear this all the time,

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.820
especially from
technology organizations

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.677
that have these multimillion
dollar multi-year projects.

00:24:55.677 --> 00:24:57.260
We don't know if
it's implemented yet,

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.260
so we've got to wait.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.020
No, don't wait.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.130
And then lastly, this is
really one of our favorites.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.360
"It'll go to their heads."

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.190
Come on!

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.580
So the question is,
how do you encourage

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.240
more positive feedback, when it
may not be part of the culture?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.855
And one of the
things we talk about

00:25:17.855 --> 00:25:19.440
in "Profit from the
Positive" is how

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.700
to become a positive deviant.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.220
And the fact that you're
all here today, right here,

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.600
probably tells us
that you probably

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.200
waiver on that positive
deviant slide anyways.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.610
So our recommendation would
be to just start doing it.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.000
There is something called
in psychology the contagion

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.920
effect.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.970
And it can work both
positively and negatively.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.670
So the more we do it, it
creates this contagion effect.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.147
Now, we'll get into
in a moment, you

00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:46.730
have to make sure
it doesn't backfire.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.770
And that's what this slide is.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.895
You want to make sure that
the frequent recognition

00:25:49.895 --> 00:25:55.070
and encouragement, there's
some parameters around it.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.805
So this is our backfire slide.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:26:01.930
Do we have any car
enthusiast in the room?

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.160
So first, one way to
prevent it from backfiring

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.310
is make sure that you're giving
process praise rather than

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.530
person praise.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.130
So Carol Dweck, who some
of you know from Stanford,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.220
has done a number of
research studies around this.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.780
And what we mean by
that is person praise

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.140
is when we recognize someone
with really general statements.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.380
Like Rebecca,
you're really smart.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.180
Or Fay, great job.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.050
The interesting thing that we've
found, or that Carol has found,

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.990
is that people that
give person praise,

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.970
it actually can create
a sense of helplessness.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.200
And that they're afraid
to lose that distinction.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.940
If we have anybody in the room
that has kids, remember that.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.540
I wish I knew this
earlier in my motherhood.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.121
The second.

00:26:49.121 --> 00:26:50.120
Think about it this way.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.090
Process praise is
when we praise someone

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.120
by actually describing the
process or the strategies

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.050
they used in completing
that particular project

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.300
or whatever it is you're
giving them feedback on.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.090
So that's an important concept.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:09.560
To say, I really appreciate that
you did that project for me,

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.030
or analyzed those
reports for me,

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.079
because I know you put in a lot
of time and a lot of effort.

00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:16.120
And you have a lot of
other things on your plate,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.830
so I really appreciate that

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.630
So whether that's peer-to-peer
or manager to direct report,

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.360
remember, process praise,
not person praise.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.320
Second, are you familiar with
the term absent presence?

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.540
Absent presence.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.850
It's what you do-- some of
you might be doing it right

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.870
now if you're on your iPhone.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:36.540
Taking notes.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.230
That's OK.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.660
It's when we dial into
that conference call

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.806
and then we put the phone on
mute and we catch up on email.

00:27:42.806 --> 00:27:44.180
Or it's when you're
out to dinner

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.660
with your spouse, lover,
partner, friend, whoever

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.920
and you're texting while
you're across from each other,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.680
and you're really not present.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.310
You're physically present,
but you're mentally absent.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.745
So when it comes to
delivering FRE, to your point,

00:27:58.745 --> 00:28:00.490
it has to be genuine.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.250
Yes, it has to be specific,
but it needs to be genuine.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.955
And one way to be
sure that it is

00:28:04.955 --> 00:28:06.910
is that you're really present.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.490
You give eye contact.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.500
Even if it's feedback you're
giving remotely to somebody

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.920
in another location
or another country,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.300
stop whatever you're doing,
turn away from your computer

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.800
if you're on the phone,
and really deliver it.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.480
You can tell when people aren't
present even over the phone,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.720
even over the computer.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.950
And then lastly,
praise to the back.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.890
This is a term that we
learned from one of the guys

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.590
we interviewed for "Profit
from the Positive."

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.560
He's actually the
co-founder and president

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.600
of EverFi, who Google actually
did early funding for.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.400
So EverFi is a DC-based
web-based curriculum

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.580
for students--
both middle school,

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.910
high school, and college--
where they teach kids

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.080
financial literacy skills
and some other life skills,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.690
anti-bullying kind of thing.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.050
And one of the things
he talks about at EverFi

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.920
is it's easy to give people
direct feedback in an email

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.190
or face-to-face.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.610
But oftentimes, we forget
about praising to the back.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.151
When you're in a
meeting and you talk

00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:09.175
about somebody who isn't there.

00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:10.480
And it reverberates.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.840
It comes back to that person.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.560
Hey, I was in that meeting.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.101
they were talking
about you, that you

00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:16.870
did this really great
job on XYZ project.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.110
They were really talking
about how valuable

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.880
you are to the company.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.070
So praise to the back.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.530
A couple other things.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.844
Some companies that we
interviewed for the book

00:29:28.844 --> 00:29:30.260
and have told some
stories around.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.560
EverFi is one.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.950
Zappos is another, out in Las
Vegas, that Senia visited.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.550
And jwi-de-- jwi-de-- de va?

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:41.955
Joie de Vivre.

00:29:41.955 --> 00:29:43.710
I'm better with my Spanish.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.130
Another, we interviewed
Chip Conley for the book,

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.030
as well as Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.460
And probably, maybe Google,
too we may add to this list.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.815
And this is a quote that we
love from one of the people

00:29:56.815 --> 00:29:58.690
that we quote in the
book. "Using recognition

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.370
is the best way to build
a high-energy, fun culture

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.650
and reinforce the behaviors
that drive results.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:11.600
Why be selfish on the one thing
that matters most to people?"

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.520
So with that, who have you
been meaning to give a FRE to?

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.540
Think about it for a moment.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.460
And again, turn to the
person next to you.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.560
Who have you been
meaning to give a FRE to?

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.375
It could be a peer.

00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:28.490
Do we have any
managers in the room?

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.570
If you manage, it might
be somebody on your team

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.986
that you want to
give feedback to.

00:30:31.986 --> 00:30:34.030
Maybe someone in
another department.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.677
Someone you've been
meaning to give a FRE to.

00:30:37.677 --> 00:30:39.760
So this one I'm only going
to give you 30 seconds.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.875
And remember, the process.

00:30:40.875 --> 00:30:41.750
What was the process?

00:30:44.331 --> 00:30:45.164
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:55.672 --> 00:30:57.130
MARGARET GREENBERG:
How many people

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.070
are actually going to now
deliver that FRE when they

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.970
go back to their
desk after this talk?

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.840
That they'll
actually deliver it?

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.600
OK.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.120
You can do better than that.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.380
OK?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.150
All right.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.850
I'm going to turn it
back over to Senia

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.320
then, who's going to introduce
us to the third tool.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.275
Go ahead.

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.900
SENIA MAYMIN: So
literally, in the book

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.174
we talk about it as Don't Quit,
Just Quit Being an Expert.

00:31:22.174 --> 00:31:24.340
And it's really when we're
hearing from our clients,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.540
this project is
extremely stressful.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.131
I'm frustrated at
my own results.

00:31:28.131 --> 00:31:29.130
I've been really trying.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.630
Or, for example, in sales,
I've gotten six nos.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.920
And now I'm about to
make a seventh call.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.050
What mental state
should I be in?

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.480
This was not a good week.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.459
So we all have these.

00:31:39.459 --> 00:31:40.000
I have these.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.650
You likely have these.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.810
What do we do?

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.566
This is Jeff Bezos
of Amazon saying,

00:31:44.566 --> 00:31:45.940
"if you want to
be inventive, you

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.480
have to be willing to fail."

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.880
He doesn't just say this.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.610
He says this in every
interview that he gives.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.240
And if you talk to
people at Amazon--

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.840
and we did for the book-- they
say this is his main mantra.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.060
To encourage a
culture of failure.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.760
But failure means trial and
failure, trial and error.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.360
What do we mean by all this?

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.650
Let's think about the
two different ways

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.240
that you can face the world.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.740
You can have a
performance mindset,

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.950
or you can have a
learning mindset.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.997
A performance mindset is when
you're thinking, all right,

00:32:19.997 --> 00:32:21.580
this is what I'm
going to demonstrate.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.000
I'm going to
demonstrate mastery.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.920
I'm going to
demonstrate competence.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.710
A learning mindset
is when you're

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.380
going to learn mastery
and learn competence.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.750
It's a completely different
way of figuring out

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.450
where you're going.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.390
Now, as I show you
the next quote, which

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.920
is another of my favorite
pieces of the book,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.830
just because it's
so implementable--

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.940
think about it in
terms of yourself,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.016
when you can say something
like this yourself.

00:32:46.016 --> 00:32:48.390
And think about it in terms
of when you can say something

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.950
like this to
somebody that you're

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.720
working with together
on a project.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.260
As you're working
together on a project,

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.160
you can describe a
project this way.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.900
These are exact words
that our researcher used.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.450
"You'll probably learn a
lot, but you'll probably

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.180
make a bunch of mistakes,
get a little confused,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.680
and maybe feel a
little dumb at times."

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.670
Now, I'm actually asking
you this question.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.550
What does that
make you think of,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.270
either when you say
to yourself or when

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.490
you get this kind of
instruction from somebody?

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.050
What kind of mindset
does that put you in?

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.726
What?

00:33:24.726 --> 00:33:25.440
AUDIENCE: Relief.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.315
SENIA MAYMIN: Relief.

00:33:26.315 --> 00:33:26.830
Why relief?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.920
SENIA MAYMIN: You can't mess
up much worse than that.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.590
Anything else?

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.140
AUDIENCE: Freedom to take risks.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.030
SENIA MAYMIN: Freedom
to take risks.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.690
That's how I feel
about it as well.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:41.120
And what happens if you
don't say this to somebody?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.125
It's just not implied.

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:43.250
That's what I'm getting at.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.980
There's nothing implied
about this kind of attitude

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.420
if you don't actually say it.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.185
At Joie de Vivre,
Chip Conely's company,

00:33:51.185 --> 00:33:53.560
one of the things he did is
he had a mistake-of-the-month

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.059
club.

00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:55.640
So he actually
would reward people

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.075
who had the biggest
learning from a mistake.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.650
Who does this?

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.080
A lot of companies do this.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.720
You do this.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.300
37 Signals, which is a
super company, does this.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.040
Amazon really, really
invigorates their people

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.929
to do this.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.719
But the part of it that you may
not think about it as often--

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.860
So even if you have thought
about these kinds of concepts,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.184
how can I get into
a learning mindset?

00:34:22.184 --> 00:34:25.150
If I'm messing up, how can I
think about it as learning?

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.199
One of the ways that we most
love to think about this

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.980
is, how can you carve this
kind of boomerang for others?

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.400
How can you make others, by
saying something like that,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.340
or by giving them the
permission and the freedom,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.072
think about this
kind of mindset?

00:34:41.072 --> 00:34:42.530
We're giving you
one more exercise.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.780
And it's the last one.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.530
And why are we giving
you these exercises?

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.239
We told you you'd walk
away with three tools,

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.320
and we want you
to practice them.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.820
Even though we're only giving
you 30 seconds to two minutes.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.139
But please, turn to the
person next to you and let's

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.449
talk about when taking on a
learning mindset for yourself

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.640
or for someone you work
with would be helpful.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.960
30 seconds per person.

00:35:02.515 --> 00:35:03.348
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.350
SENIA MAYMIN: OK.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.420
Learning mindset.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.500
You and the learning mindset.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.130
What is something you
heard from your partner

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.630
that you might be
able to implement?

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.110
Or what's an insight
that you have

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.552
in terms of how you can get
into the learning mindset?

00:35:24.552 --> 00:35:26.760
So the comment is, for
example, in this presentation,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.840
just coming to it and having
more of a learning mindset

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.230
rather than critical thinking.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.770
I find that too,
especially if you practice

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.150
a sport or a hobby-- So I
really love ballroom dancing.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.580
And sometimes I'll go
to a beginner class.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.189
And it is somewhat beginner.

00:35:39.189 --> 00:35:40.730
But I can have that
critical mindset.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.380
Like, oh, that's boring,
or that's boring.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.880
Or I can say, what
else can I learn?

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:47.660
So questions?

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.422
Yeah?

00:35:48.422 --> 00:35:52.604
AUDIENCE: Earlier you mentioned
something about that there

00:35:52.604 --> 00:35:57.280
was a big difference between
managers [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.030
MARGARET GREENBERG: We don't
know which way the arrow goes.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.920
But one of the things
we will tell you is we

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.550
had to throw out a
whole piece of the data.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.070
We also had the managers
take the assessment and say,

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.970
I give frequent recognition
and encouragement.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.620
And what happened was
we then compared it

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.300
with the employees' response.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.642
And they didn't match up.

00:36:19.642 --> 00:36:21.600
So the employee said,
no, I'm not getting much.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.891
And the manager was saying,
I give frequent recognition

00:36:23.891 --> 00:36:24.940
and encouragement!

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.920
So really, we tossed out
the manager feedback.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.795
Because when it comes
to frequent recognition

00:36:28.795 --> 00:36:32.070
and encouragement, whose
opinion matters most?

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.350
It's the receiver
that's receiving it.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.220
So just a quick
recap on the tools.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.230
There's 31 tools in
"Profit from the Positive."

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.860
We gave you just three
in this last hour.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.960
Trick yourself into
getting started.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.520
FRE.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.300
And then don't quit, just
quit being an expert.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.420
OK you're in perf season,
right, here at Google?

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:53.920
Yes?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.950
Well, guess what?

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:59.272
We've heard that performance
reviews are really painful.

00:36:59.272 --> 00:37:00.480
We've heard it from managers.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.605
We've heard from employees.

00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:03.800
We've heard from HR folks.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.942
So we devote a whole
chapter, actually,

00:37:05.942 --> 00:37:06.900
to performance reviews.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.090
We call it "Change
'Em or Chuck 'Em."

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.410
And one of the tools within
this chapter is called Preview,

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.890
Don't Just Review, Performance.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.870
And this really borrows
from sports psychology

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.660
around visualizing success.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.250
So if you're curious on how to
make the dreaded performance

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:28.260
review less painful,
definitely read Chapter Seven.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.630
And then one other tool
that we didn't get to do

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.140
is Increase Your Odds.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.350
There's some research
around when and where.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.050
Those of you that
rely on others.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.730
You might be an
individual contributor,

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.680
and you don't necessarily
have people that report you,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.670
but you rely on others
to get your work done.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.620
You need things from them.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.010
You're more apt to get
what you need and get

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.040
what you want if you give the
person a triggering event.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.500
And tell them where
and when you'd

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.220
like that piece
of work delivered.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.770
So if I say to you,
Rebecca, will you

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:04.000
please get me that
analysis tomorrow?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.180
Twice as likely if I
say to you, Rebecca,

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.640
can you give me that analysis
by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning?

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.750
In fact, even if you
can email it to me

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.710
or bring it to my office
on a flash drive, whatever.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.370
Twice as likely to
get what I want.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.750
So a couple other free
tools we just snuck in there

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.300
if we had time.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.360
So here we go.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.350
This is our website,
ProfitfromthePositive.com.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.811
There are a lot of free tools.

00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:31.060
This is someone that definitely
has a learner mindset.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.550
She's going to be
the next, maybe, CEO.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.830
Google maybe?

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.260
She'll break that glass
ceiling maybe after all.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.020
But a lot of free tools there.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.490
We also have a Facebook
page by the same name.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.010
And we'll also stay here,
answer any other questions.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.730
We're going to be
here for a while.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.630
We'll also be happy to
inscribe your books for you.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.760
And really, thank you.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.061
It's been such an
honor to be here today.

00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:54.810
We can't tell you.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.450
Thank you for having us.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:02.312
[APPLAUSE]
