00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.271
Benjamin Franklin was quoted to have said,
“Early to bed and early to rise makes a

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.120
man healthy, wealthy and wise.”

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.650
And according to science, he might have been
right.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.430
Many successful creative people stick to strict
morning routines.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.019
Anna Wintour editor in chief at Vogue starts
her day with a bright and early 5:45 a.m.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.810
tennis match, according to The Guardian.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.289
Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs had his own ritual
every morning too.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.820
“For the past 33 years, I have looked in
the mirror every morning and asked myself:

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.870
“If today were the last day of my life,
would I want to do what I am about to do today?

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.910
Taking the time to find that kind of perspective
has been biologically proven to be a total

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.300
game changer.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.670
Biologist Christoph Randler found that early
risers tend to be more proactive, more optimistic,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.110
more agreeable, and conscientious.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.550
And as they start the day early with that
attitude established, challenges that come

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.360
later in the day take less of a toll physiologically.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760
The point is not to wake up early just to
start working early — others use the time

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.550
for meditation, exercise, stretching, writing,
or finding inspiration.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.240
But the consistency of the time of day biologically
programs their minds and bodies differently

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.920
than those who do not take advantage of that
window of time.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
MRI scans show that the prefrontal cortex
of our brain is most active in the early morning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.850
after we wake up.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.850
That’s the part of the brain used for decision
making, social behavior, planning, goal-making,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.580
personality, and willpower.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.240
Speaking of willpower - researchers at the
University of Nottingham and the National

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.570
Institute of Education in Singapore revealed
that there is a significant physiological

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.220
drop in self-control as the day wears on.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.509
Effort, perceived difficulty, fatigue, and
blood glucose levels all suffered from later

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.219
stages in the day.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.880
Willpower is most strongest in those few,
precious early-morning hours.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.899
Mornings, then, make the most sense for productivity
since willpower can be sapped throughout the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.700
day by any number of different stressors—work,
school, kids, chores, etc.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.749
But that’s just it, maybe it’s all those
things you HAVE to do that makes it better

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:54.829
to be a morning person.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.789
It’s deeply ingrained in our culture that
waking up early is a good thing.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.579
Schools and business work on the assumption
that most people work better in the morning.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.029
and many people think evening people are lazy.

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:08.289
When in fact they tend to be more creative,
humorous and according to a study published

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.310
in the journal Personality and Individual
Differences.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.760
Creative types just tend to work better in
the evening, another study published in the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
Journal of Biological Rhythms found that their
brains were most excitable at 9 p.m.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.319
And it’s rooted in biology to some degree.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.540
Some studies show that about 50% of our sleep
cycle can be pinned down to biology.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.510
Back in our caveman days, having a mix of
early risers and night owls was probably a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.510
good thing.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.340
That way someone could always take over the
watch.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480
And there’s a small shift in society, some
businesses have started to institute flex

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.959
time, where workers can set their own schedules.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.870
But for the vast majority of workers, being
a morning person might be best for now.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.970
If you want to get into the rhythm of a morning
person there’s a few tricks you can try.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.250
Go outdoors!

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.150
One study published in the journal Current
Biology found that a week of camping can reset

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.239
the body’s clock.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.040
The researchers found that when we are exposed
to natural light most people’s bodies sync

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
to the cycles of daylight.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.000
According to a different study published in
the journal Neuroendocrinology Letters, just

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.190
getting a burst of sunlight in the morning
can “stimulate the body's 24-hour biological

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.319
system, which regulates the sleep/wake cycle.”

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.790
Getting into a routine can also set you on
the right track.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.260
The time of day doesn’t matter so much as
simply sticking to your ritual everyday.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.489
Rituals can help you stay focused.

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.629
But how does someone stay focused when they’re
being set on fire?

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.750
Check out this video from Rituals to see how
a Hollywood stuntman stays calm.”
