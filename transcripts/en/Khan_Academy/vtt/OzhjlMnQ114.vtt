00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:02.182
- [Instructor] We're now
going to tackle part (b)

00:00:02.182 --> 00:00:03.731
of the potato problem,

00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:05.678
and it says use the second derivative

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:08.978
of H with respect to time to
determine whether your answer

00:00:08.978 --> 00:00:12.830
in part (a) is an underestimate
or an overestimate

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.107
of the internal temperature of the potato

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.598
at time t is equal to three.

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.420
So in part (a), we found the
equation of the tangent line

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.767
at time equals zero and we used that

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.969
to estimate what our
internal temperature would be

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.916
at time is equal to three.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:31.584
So how is the second derivative
going to help us think

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:35.170
whether that was an overestimate
or an underestimate?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.465
Well, the second derivative

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.080
can help us know about concavity.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.530
It'll let us know, well, is our slope

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.207
increasing over this interval,
or is our slope decreasing?

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:46.323
And then we can use that

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:49.559
to estimate whether we
overestimated or not.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.248
So first, let's just find
the second derivative.

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:54.110
So we have the first
derivative written up here.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.179
Let me just rewrite it, and
I'll distribute the negative 1/4

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.453
'cause it'll be a little bit
more straightforward then.

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:03.934
So if I write the derivative
of H with respect to time

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.851
is equal to negative 1/4

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:09.550
times our internal temperature,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.590
which it itself is a function of time,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.854
and then negative 1/4 times negative 27,

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:16.604
that would be plus 27

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.128
over four.

00:01:19.128 --> 00:01:22.080
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.595
So now, let me leave that graph up there

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:26.267
'cause I think that might be useful.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.989
What is the second derivative going to be

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:29.502
with respect to time?

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:32.030
So I'll write it right over here.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.447
D, the second derivative of H

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:39.238
with respect to time is
going to be equal to,

00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:44.230
well, the derivative of this
first term with respect to time

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.620
is going to be the derivative
of this with respect to H

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.115
times the derivative of
H with respect to time.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:51.454
So this is equal to negative 1/4.

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:53.950
That's the derivative of
this term with respect to H,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.704
and then we want to multiply
that times the derivative of H

00:01:56.704 --> 00:01:57.897
with respect to time.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.169
This comes just straight
out of the chain rule.

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.504
And then the derivative of a constant,

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:02.898
how does that change with respect to time?

00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:06.094
It's not gonna change, that
is just going to be zero.

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:07.512
So just like that, we were able

00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:11.156
to find the second derivative
H with respect to time.

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:13.382
And now what does this tell us?

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:17.904
Well, we talked about,
in the previous video,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:20.460
that over the interval that we care about,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.671
for, actually, I can
show you from this graph.

00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.192
Over the interval that we care about,

00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:26.192
for t greater than zero,

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:29.067
it says that our internal temperature

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:32.598
is always going to be greater than 27.

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:35.274
And so when you look
at this expression here

00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:39.002
or when you look at this
expression here for dH/dt,

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.689
we talked in the previous video

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.594
how this is always going
to be negative here.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:46.592
Because H is always going
to be greater than 27,

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.488
so that part's going to be positive.

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:50.692
But then we're gonna multiply
it by a negative 1/4,

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.787
so our slope dH/dt,

00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:54.846
our derivative of our
temperature with respect to time,

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:57.429
is always going to be negative.

00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:01.143
So we could write that this

00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:01.976
or this,

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:04.934
this is going to be negative,

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.260
let me write it this way.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.093
Since

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:12.215
H is greater than 27

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:15.905
for t is greater than zero,

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.379
we know that dH/dt

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.039
is negative,

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.769
is negative.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.410
So we could say that this right over here,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.243
since dH/dt

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.046
is less than zero

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.083
for t is greater than zero,

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:40.498
the second derivative
of H with respect to t

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:43.165
is going to be greater than zero

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:45.886
for

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:46.886
t is greater

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:49.616
than zero.

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.919
And so what does that mean?

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.824
It means that we are,

00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:55.273
if your second derivative is positive,

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:57.946
that means you're concave upward,

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.196
concave upward,

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:03.433
which means slope is increasing,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.863
slope

00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:07.620
increasing.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.599
Or you could say slope
becoming less negative,

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.766
slope becoming

00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:18.026
less

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:19.532
negative.

00:04:19.532 --> 00:04:20.681
Now what does that mean?

00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:21.759
And you could see it intuitively.

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.021
If the slope is becoming
less and less negative,

00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.200
then that means when we approximated

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.432
what our temperature is at t equals three,

00:04:29.432 --> 00:04:32.139
we used a really negative slope.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.537
When, in reality, our
slope is getting less

00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:36.407
and less and less negative.

00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:39.403
So what we would've done is
we would've over-decreased

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:43.022
our temperature from t equals
zero to t equals three.

00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:46.669
So that would mean that we
would have underestimated it.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.023
So let me write that down.

00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:50.176
And I'm running out of
a little bit of space,

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:52.427
but let me write it right over here.

00:04:52.427 --> 00:04:54.191
So that implies,

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:57.108
so this implies that underestimate,

00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.474
underestimate

00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.254
in part (a).

00:05:04.254 --> 00:05:06.319
And if I were taking this on the AP exam,

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.835
I would flesh out my
language a little bit here

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:11.190
to make it clear, but
hopefully that makes sense.
