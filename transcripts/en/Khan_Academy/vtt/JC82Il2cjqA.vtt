00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:12.017
Nobody's born smart
We all start at 0

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.106
Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do
algebra

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.619
Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike --
Nobody's good at anything at first

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:29.024
There was a time when Einstein couldn't count
to 10, and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.050
Shakespeare had to learn his ABC's
just like the rest of us

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:40.099
Thankfully, we're born to learn
Slowly, surely, you stumble, slip, crawl,

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:44.174
fall, and fail, and fall
Frustrating, confusing, trying, struggling

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:50.083
Until one day, you walk

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:54.054
One foot in front of the other
One idea on top the next

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:58.243
Each wrong answer making your brain a little
bit stronger

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.280
Failing is just another word for growing
And you keep going

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.044
This is learning

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.583
Knowing that you'll get it even if you haven't
gotten it yet.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.390
Because the most beautiful, complex concepts
in the whole universe are built on basic ideas

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.068
that anyone can learn, anywhere can understand.
Whoever you are, whereever you are

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:25.068
You only have to know one thing:
You can learn anything
