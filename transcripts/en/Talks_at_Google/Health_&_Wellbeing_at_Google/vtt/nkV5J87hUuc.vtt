[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:57.250
PATRICK SWEENEY: Thank you all.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.600
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.210
I'm really very honored to
be giving a Google talk.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.290
It's exciting for me.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.937
I was looking forward to
this for quite a long time.

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:07.270
And we're going to talk today
about the surprising power

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.410
of fear.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.630
And I could have never
imagined the things

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.209
that Elaine had mentioned.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.750
If you look in the
background, that's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.590
me, actually going down
across one of the glaciers

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.630
on Mount Elbrus, the
highest mountain in Europe.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.690
And I could have never even
imagined that 15 years ago.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.900
So I'm here to share a
little bit of that journey.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.600
Before we get
started, tell me, who

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.890
today has made a
decision based on fear?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.780
Raise your hands.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.280
OK.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.690
Who in the past week has made
a decision based on fear?

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.840
OK.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.640
So if you think about it--

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.400
I think we've got a very
confident group here,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.000
or there might be a little
bit of a confidence bias--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.920
if you think about
the reason you stopped

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.200
at a red light this
morning on your way

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.600
into work, walking into
work or biking into work,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.420
was the motivation behind
that fear or something else?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.870
There's only two motivations
in your decision making.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.828
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:10.880
So according to Dr. Srini
Pillay at Harvard, 88% of us

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.340
harbor hidden fears.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.020
And of course, if
you ask anyone, no.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.490
I don't have any hidden fears.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.590
Because they're hidden, or
else they wouldn't have them.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.190
So we're going to explore
that a little bit today.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.210
Because it affects
your emotions.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.960
And if you look at
Jane, here, so you're

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.170
not Mr. Perfect, Brad, but
marriage means more to me

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.850
than love ever could.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.240
So she has some hidden fears,
obviously, of being abandoned

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.470
and that sort of thing.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
The latest research that
we have available to us

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060
shows that the only
way to conquer fear

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.530
is to find more of it.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.330
Most people don't realize that.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.440
That to really tame fear,
you have to find more of it.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.980
So there's only two
choices you have.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.420
You can either tame fear,
or fear can tame you.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.850
There's no in-between.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.740
Ripping the lid off
those hidden fears

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.367
will dramatically
change your life.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:07.950
They're going to
change your emotions.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.325
They'll change how you deal
with your colleagues at work,

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.750
they'll change how you deal
with your friends and family,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.190
and they'll change how
you feel about yourself.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.060
So today, I'm going to go
into a three-step framework,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.250
using the latest
neuroscience, that's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.620
going to help you rip the
lid off those hidden fears

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.900
and learn how to use
that fear as fuel.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.600
That's the exciting part is
when you can get to the point

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.060
where that fear doesn't
become something you avoid,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.000
but rather it becomes a
source of fuel for you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.840
So it's going to
make you happier.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.480
It's going to make
you more successful,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.580
and it's going to bring
about world peace.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.410
And I'll cover that
in about 30 minutes.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.930
Now, you Googlers
should be impressed.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.990
Because the Dalai Lama
takes about an hour

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.400
to get to his world speech part.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.900
I'm going to do it
in half the time.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.120
So it's 50% more efficient,
even though the Lama

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.680
is a big hitter.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.010
So my mission has been
to bring fear to people

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.030
and to help people
find more of it.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.930
I've worked with CEOs,
professional athletes, US

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.050
Special Forces, and we
found some amazing things,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.820
and I'm going to
share that with you.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.970
One of the things that's
clear is we all have a gift,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.770
and that gift is inside.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.244
And oftentimes, fear keeps
it locked in to people.

00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:17.910
So I'm going to start out today,
before we get into the science,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.165
with a gift for all of you.

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.540
Whenever I come
to a new country,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.580
I like to do something
to celebrate the culture.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.610
So I'm going to sing
"Frere Jacques,"

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.960
a traditional Swiss
lullaby, but I can't sing.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.480
So we're a little
pressed for time.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.805
I usually ask for
volunteers, but Elaine said

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:36.930
we don't have so much time.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.013
So I'm going to pick five
people from the audience

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:40.230
to come up and sing with me.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.620
And I'm going to start out with
you, sir, in the gray shirt.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.740
Ma'am, you with the kind
of cranberry-colored shirt

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.240
back there.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.190
And ma'am, back there,
with the flowered shirt on.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.690
Yes, please.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.240
Come on up.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.740
Yeah.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.080
Come on right up here.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.820
And sir, with the glasses on.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.897
Please come over here.

00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.730
Ma'am, even though
you're not looking at me,

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.563
I can still see you.

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:01.980
Come on.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.640
Come on up.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.880
You'll be our last one.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.380
OK.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.640
Now, we have these five folks.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.152
If I could ask your name.

00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:11.860
AUDIENCE: Andres.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.490
PATRICK SWEENEY: Andres.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.200
AUDIENCE: Jana.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.135
PATRICK SWEENEY: Jana.

00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:14.610
AUDIENCE: Maria.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.423
PATRICK SWEENEY: Maria.

00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:16.150
AUDIENCE: Xander.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.274
PATRICK SWEENEY: Xander.

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:17.940
AUDIENCE: Juana.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.360
PATRICK SWEENEY: Juana.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.230
AUDIENCE: Andrea.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.800
PATRICK SWEENEY: Andrea.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.370
OK.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.530
So we've got these
six folks up here

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.290
who either are going to
become the stars of Google--

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.510
because this is going out
to hundreds of thousands

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.360
of people, who will see
it all over the world, all

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.160
over Google's
organization, everywhere.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.550
So they're either going
to be tremendous stars,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.920
or they're going to
be looking for work,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.920
looking for a new
spouse and partner,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.020
and living in some
shack in the woods

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.360
because they embarrassed
themselves so badly.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.577
So don't think
about that though.

00:05:47.577 --> 00:05:50.160
What I want you to think about
is just what we're going to do.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.659
OK.

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:51.840
Come on in a little closer.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.540
On three, we're going
to-- one, two, three.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.210
Frere Jacques, Frere
Jacques, dormez vous?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.710
Dormez vous?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.330
You all know the words, right?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.930
OK.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.096
So we're going to start out.

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:01.260
One, two, three.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.062
Fr-- oh, no.

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:04.020
I can't believe you guys
thought I was actually

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.831
going to make you sing.

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:06.330
OK.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.097
Nobody is going to sing up here.

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:09.680
And if you're in the
audience, and you

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.700
were thinking you
might get picked,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.520
I want you to stop right now
and answer the same question

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.870
I'm going to ask these guys.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.650
How do you feel?

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.230
How do you feel?

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.082
AUDIENCE: Relieved.

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:21.540
PATRICK SWEENEY:
You feel relieved.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.070
A second ago-- a second
ago, how did you feel?

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.660
Let's say, before
you felt relieved.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.282
How'd you feel?

00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:29.394
AUDIENCE: Ridiculous.

00:06:29.394 --> 00:06:30.560
PATRICK SWEENEY: Ridiculous.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.380
OK.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.160
And when you say you felt
ridiculous, where in your body

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.450
did you feel ridiculous?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.665
Can you pinpoint-- where?

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:40.540
AUDIENCE: In my mind.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.790
PATRICK SWEENEY: In your mind.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.580
Can you pinpoint a
physical location?

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.080
No?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.710
OK.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.980
Who else felt nervous
or embarrassed?

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.550
OK.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.380
Well we've got-- so
let's start down here.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.626
Where did you feel it?

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:54.250
AUDIENCE: I am all shaking.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.030
PATRICK SWEENEY:
You're all shaking.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.988
Your hands are shaking.

00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:57.290
We can see that here.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.790
OK.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.470
So your whole body's shaking.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.490
That's awesome.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.070
And you?

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.054
AUDIENCE: I had no idea what
song you were talking about.

00:07:03.054 --> 00:07:03.730
PATRICK SWEENEY: Yeah,
it is-- you didn't know

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.810
what song I was talking about?

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.920
But she was still ready to sing.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.520
God love you.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.301
Good for you.

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:08.800
And where do you
feel it physically?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.970
Is there someplace in your body?

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.050
AUDIENCE: Some right here.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.250
PATRICK SWEENEY: Just
kind of in your heart,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.000
in your stomach, and
that sort of thing.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.238
And you?

00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:16.196
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:07:16.196 --> 00:07:17.618
[LAUGHS]

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.007
PATRICK SWEENEY: Tight
jaw, tight shoulders?

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:21.632
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:21.632 --> 00:07:23.034
Maybe also trembling a bit?

00:07:23.034 --> 00:07:24.700
PATRICK SWEENEY:
Trembling in the knees.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.492
A little Elvis leg?

00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:25.991
Right?

00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:27.370
You can't get the leg to stop.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.650
OK.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.483
Well, give them a round
of applause, please.

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:30.197
Have a seat.

00:07:30.197 --> 00:07:31.030
Thank you very much.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.620
So if you are in the
audience, and you

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.995
were afraid you
were going to get

00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:42.750
picked, what I want you to think
about is where you felt it.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.650
Stop for a second and think,
physically, where you had it.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.110
Do we have any poker
players in the room?

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.730
Anyone who plays poker?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.440
No?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.490
Does anyone know what a tell is?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.560
What's a tell?

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.440
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.684
PATRICK SWEENEY: Yes.

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.606
AUDIENCE: It's when
you give away--

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:01.937
that you're saying
something about what

00:08:01.937 --> 00:08:03.020
you're thinking right now.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.810
PATRICK SWEENEY: It's a
subconscious gesture, behavior,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.160
or emotion that you do when
you have something good.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.010
So poker players
call this a tell.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.550
You might pull on your ear.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.700
You might straighten
out your shirt sleeve.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.860
Or there's something
you might do

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.740
that can give away the fact
that you've got a good hand.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.780
That's called a tell in poker.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.860
Every single person
has a fear tell.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.240
We have a way that fear
manifests itself in your body.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.601
And that grows depending
on the level of fear.

00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:37.559
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.820
Because it's important that you
start to understand your fear

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.950
tells because they start
to give you messages.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.710
When you see an email from
one of your colleagues

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.440
or your boss, and you
start to feel that tell,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.320
maybe you'll feel it
right there, where--

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.780
I think it was Andreas was
saying he felt it a little bit.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.529
Or maybe you'll feel
it down in your legs.

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:58.920
But you start to
recognize those tells.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.190
Most people do a
lot to avoid that.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.070
And I want to tell you, to
be the best version of you,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.110
and to let out
everything you have

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.150
and not make decisions
based on fear,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.840
you want to find more of that.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.030
So it's taken me an awful
long time to figure out

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.080
the neuroscience behind it
because I've interviewed

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.420
over 35 leading neuroscientists
from MIT, Harvard, Tufts,

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.340
Trinity, all over the world.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.900
And some of the
technology we have,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.030
just in the past five
years, has allowed

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.210
us to have a look into the brain
and understand how some of this

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.690
works.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.320
I had a hidden fear, and
I didn't recognize it

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.080
until it was almost too late.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.140
Elaine mentioned that I had
started a few technology

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.740
companies.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.100
So I was a CEO of a
venture-backed company.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.570
We were really
hot and successful

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.430
in the software space.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.740
And I was working 70
or 80 hours a week,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.610
typical VC-backed type of CEO.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.180
And I was going out every night
to these networking events

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.160
and CEO events and
private equity events.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.400
And I was drinking six or
seven beers every night

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.690
when I went out.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.412
And then I come back at
about midnight or so,

00:10:09.412 --> 00:10:10.245
and I'd feel guilty.

00:10:10.245 --> 00:10:12.852
It's that whole Irish
Catholic thing, right?

00:10:12.852 --> 00:10:13.560
You're a redhead.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.790
You get that.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.990
So [LAUGHS] it was crazy.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.620
And I woke up one
morning, went to the gym,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.690
just like you guys
probably do here.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.739
Went into the gym.

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:23.280
Hey, Sweeney!

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.760
How are you doing?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.260
Good!

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.100
Got to work arms today.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.390
Started working arms, ooh.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.501
Boy, that arm
hurts a little bit.

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:30.000
All right.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.458
Well, I'll just do
a little cardio.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.670
Get on the machine.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.170
Then the next day,
I got in, woke up.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.360
Same thing.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.090
Starting to feel really bad.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.870
And I thought, wow.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.200
I should go to the doctor
and get this checked out.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.400
And I didn't.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.106
Can anyone guess why?

00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:48.480
AUDIENCE: Afraid
to get bad news?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.710
PATRICK SWEENEY: I was
afraid to go to the doctor.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.200
Yeah.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.303
Yeah.

00:10:50.303 --> 00:10:51.840
I was afraid to get bad news.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.130
Third day, woke up.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.230
I could barely move the arm.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.630
I said, I've got to
go to the doctor now.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.460
So I went to the doctor, and
he looked at it, and he said,

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.449
you know, it looks
like a staph infection.

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:04.740
That's pretty common among
guys who spent a lot of time

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.090
in the gym and working out.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.040
So we're going to give
you some antibiotics,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.110
and we're going to
take a few blood tests.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.390
The nurse will call you
back in the afternoon.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:12.970
I said, OK.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.470
Good.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.670
Thanks.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.360
Well, the nurse
didn't call me back.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.890
The doctor did.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.310
And that's when my life changed.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.400
He said, I don't
know what it is,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.190
and we can't figure it out
here in our little hospital

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.300
in Virginia.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.490
We're going to send you
up to Johns Hopkins.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.370
One of the top
hospitals in the world.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.330
So I got the express ticket
to the Johns Hopkins matinee

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.150
for leukemia patients.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.780
And I went up there,
and I got checked in.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.080
And I got put into this bed.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.210
And I had a one-year-old
daughter at the time.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.360
And I had my wife, who was
six months pregnant, with me,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.040
who was just white as a ghost.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.720
Stressed out as you could be.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.670
I had more tubes
and wires plugged

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.210
in me than the space shuttle,
just about to lift off.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.020
And I'm sitting in this bed, and
all of a sudden, Dr. McDevitt

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.630
walks in.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.100
He takes two steps inside the
door, looks across the room.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.050
There were three
kids behind him who

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.650
I thought were the kids he
must coach in the soccer team

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.040
after work, because they didn't
look a day older than 12.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.675
And he stopped, and he
turned to look at them.

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:23.550
And he said, oh, wow.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.740
This is really interesting.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.040
This guy's T-cells
went rogue and started

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.110
attacking the rest of
his white blood cells.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.041
He's got no immune system.

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:35.790
And he's talking like
I wasn't even there.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.220
I'm like, hey, doc.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.530
Yeah, but the good news is
I got the first colonoscopy

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.980
in the morning.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.530
And he didn't even laugh.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.470
He came over, and he sat down.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.805
And he said, look.

00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:49.180
We're going to do
a lot of tests.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.388
We're going to try and figure
some of this stuff out.

00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:55.560
But are your affairs in order?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.180
Now, I'm no Doogie Howser,
but when a doctor asks you

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.075
if your affairs are in order,
you're pretty much screwed.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.782
Does anyone not know who
Doogie Howser is, by the way?

00:13:07.782 --> 00:13:09.880
Oh, God, I hate all you people!

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.100
You missed the Dalai Lama
joke too, from Caddyshack.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.810
Does anyone know
any '80s trivia?

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.010
Who knows the '80s trivia?

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:15.670
Stay with me.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.390
Someone?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.410
Anyone?

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:17.950
OK.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.449
All right.

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:19.930
Couple people.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:20.740
All right.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.580
Doogie Howser was a prodigy
doctor who was like 12 years

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.450
old as a doctor.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.080
So anyways, they started
figuring stuff out,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.940
and it didn't look good at all.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.490
It was a really rare
form of leukemia.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.770
I had no immune
system, and my body

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.410
was being attacked constantly.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.800
I sat there, and
like Elaine said,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.960
I had spent five years
training for the Olympics.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.360
My first Olympic
trials, I finished 14th.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.910
The second Olympic
trials, I finished second.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.650
The difference
between those two was

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.600
I did a ton of mental training.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.810
I was in Colorado Springs at
the US Olympic Training Center,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.510
learning how to use my
mind to get my body faster.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.390
So when I sat in
there in Hopkins,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.890
and they were telling
me there's not

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.431
much they think they can do,
and they've never seen something

00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:07.120
like this before, I said, OK.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.920
Well, there's something
I've got to do.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.450
I sat there day and night,
imagining these warrior cells

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.440
coming out of my body and
attacking those rogue T-cells.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.260
And I just sat there, and
I envisioned it day in

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.150
and day out for two weeks.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.580
My body building up
these warrior cells.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.830
And I had the greatest
doctors in the world.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.620
And I kept doing that.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.350
And not to give away
the ending, but I died.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.100
I didn't die.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.350
I'm here.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.350
I lived.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.470
And when I got out of
the hospital at Hopkins,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.160
I walked out, and it was in
the worst part of Baltimore.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.590
It's in a ghetto area.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.100
It's really rundown.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.650
And I walked out, and I
saw this leaf in a puddle.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.710
And it was red and tinged
with gold around the outside.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.039
I would have never even stopped
before this all had happened.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.080
I stopped, and I looked
down, and I thought, wow,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.520
that's really beautiful.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.000
I know it sounds cliche, but it
was like this gratitude switch

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.130
got flipped on in my head.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.820
And all I could think about was
how awesome it was to be alive

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.560
and how much I had wasted
my life worrying about fear.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.030
Being afraid of everything.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.360
And I didn't even know how
afraid I was of all the things

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.280
that were going on in
my life until I got out

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.560
of that hospital, and
I faced my real fear.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.692
When I faced that real fear,
I realized fear was a fraud.

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:29.930
A complete fraud.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.960
I found this study from Cornell
University called The Legacy

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.340
Study.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.680
What they did was they
interviewed thousands of people

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.566
between the age of 70 and 109.

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:40.940
And they said, we
want to collect

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.204
the wisdom of our elders.

00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:43.870
So they asked them a
bunch of questions.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.380
Asked them for
their best advice.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.020
There was only one
thing of the thousands

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.794
of people that was common
around just about all of them.

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:53.210
And that was that
they wished they

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.090
had spent less time worrying.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.720
They wish they had spent less
time in their life in fear.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.960
Because fear is all about
the future or something bad

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.460
that happened in the past.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.930
So if you're living
in the present,

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.700
and you're enjoying
the moment, you

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.920
can't be in a fearful state.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.550
Fear is like a Rottweiler.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.090
You get a little
Rottweiler puppy,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.610
you can throw it in a cage,
and you can occasionally

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.810
toss him scraps.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.755
That thing won't be able to hold
itself back if you let it out,

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:23.630
because it's going to
tear at your flesh just

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.370
to get something to eat.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.320
If you take that
same Rottweiler,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.570
and you care for it, and you
bring it into the family,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.150
and you feed it,
and you train it,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.910
that thing will do whatever it
takes to keep your family safe.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.410
It will become your best friend.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.050
Fear is the exact same
way, but most of us

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.550
do our best to ignore it.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.730
So I want everyone to
stand up for just a second.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.400
Pretend you're that Rottweiler.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.420
Shake it out.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:49.920
OK.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.530
Now, I'm going to let
everyone in on a secret.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.270
And this is one of the key
fear secrets to start with.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.280
You are going to die.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.650
And you are going to die.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.420
And you are going to die.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.760
And you are going to die.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.220
And we're all going to die.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.688
I want everyone to repeat
after me, I will die.

00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:14.900
AUDIENCE: I will die.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.900
PATRICK SWEENEY: Louder.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.599
I will die!

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.710
AUDIENCE: I will die!

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.001
PATRICK SWEENEY: One more time.

00:17:19.001 --> 00:17:19.510
I will die!

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.657
AUDIENCE: I will die!

00:17:20.657 --> 00:17:21.490
PATRICK SWEENEY: OK.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.730
Now, is anyone
unclear about that?

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.300
All right.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.140
Sit down.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.840
Because now we can live.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.660
Now, if you're afraid of dying--
and that's one of the biggest

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.840
fears in the world--

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.570
no matter what your spirituality
is, there is no argument,

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.420
we're going to go back
to wherever we came from.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.900
So I want everyone to close
their eyes for a second,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.700
especially if you're
afraid of dying,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.850
and I want you to think about
yourself dying, right now.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.130
If you were afraid to
get up here and on stage

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.380
and be embarrassed
or feel ridiculous,

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.110
I want you to think
about that right now.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.170
All of those things
happened in your mind.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.170
That was a movie you
played in your mind.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.420
And fear is always
a horror movie.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.910
So think about the worst movie
you can think of right now.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.890
Standing on the edge
of a cliff, getting

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.770
thrown in water with a
bunch of great white sharks,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.390
whatever your biggest fear is.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.790
Think about it now
and try and feel

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.820
the sensations in your
body that are changing.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.980
Feel where you're
feeling it in your belly

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.950
and your hips and your chin
and your jaw and your knees,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.830
anywhere you're feeling that.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.580
Now, here's what I
want you to do when you

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.560
feel that for the next time.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.810
Take a deep breath in
to a count of four.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.700
Hold it for a count of four.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.500
And let it out for
a count of four.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.337
In.

00:18:33.337 --> 00:18:35.770
Two, three, four, hold it.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.300
Two, three, four.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.530
[EXHALES] Two, three, four.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.160
In.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.470
[INHALES] Hold it.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.880
Two, three, four.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.840
Out.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.310
Two, three, four.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.760
If you keep that rhythm up,
when you get in a fear state--

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.160
I'll explain a little bit
of the science behind it--

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.020
you change from having
an erratic heartbeat--

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.080
which if you looked on an
EKG is a heartbeat that

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.690
looks like a silhouette
of mountains--

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.250
to having a coherent heartbeat,
which is just a nice sine wave.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.220
That allows you to take over
your sympathetic nerve system

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.120
again.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.030
Because it gets hijacked when
you get in a fearful state,

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.560
and you stop thinking correctly.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.350
Just that breathing,
that four by four,

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.640
is a great way to get you.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.540
So the first step in
this three-step framework

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.390
is to start to recognize
your fear tells.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.860
Start to figure out
what your body does

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.640
so you can take control
over it, and you

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.360
can get back in control.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.650
So I was terribly serious
about the World Peace part.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.220
I think if I can teach millions
of people to tame their fear,

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.630
we can have world peace.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.970
Because I believe
what Gandhi said.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.670
He said, hate isn't the enemy.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.440
Fear is the enemy.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.280
And if we can all understand
fear and learn to tame it

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.360
and use it as a fuel, we can
get to a place of World Peace.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.080
So to understand fear, you
have to understand what

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.090
I refer to as a fear frontier.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.480
Because we've got a battle
going on inside our brains.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.220
I call it the Battle
of the brains,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.220
and it has to do with
two primary glands

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.240
within your brain.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.520
The first one is the amygdala.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.910
It's a little almond-shaped
gland that sits at the base

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.770
of your brain, and it
handles the three F's.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.870
Anyone know what
the three F's are?

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.090
When you get scared?

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.220
Fight is one.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.204
Anyone else?

00:20:29.204 --> 00:20:30.682
AUDIENCE: Fight.

00:20:30.682 --> 00:20:31.640
PATRICK SWEENEY: Fight.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.080
Flight.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.680
The third one?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.190
AUDIENCE: Freeze.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.190
PATRICK SWEENEY: Freeze.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.930
Exactly.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.970
So the amygdala is what
controls the fight, flight,

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.070
or freeze response.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.180
So that is the
gland that saves us

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.550
from saber-tooth tigers
and woolly mammoths.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.950
It's been there since
the beginning of time.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.100
What we didn't realize
was that jumping

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.931
at the first sign of
rustling grass or freezing

00:20:54.931 --> 00:20:56.930
like a deer in the
headlights every time someone

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.890
made a loud noise didn't exactly
make us the best dinner guest.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.380
So over the past
50,000 years or so,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.350
we developed something
called the prefrontal cortex.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.770
And the prefrontal cortex
is the adult supervision

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.280
for the brain.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.660
What happens in a
normal state, when

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.070
we're sitting here right
now, the prefrontal cortex

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.970
is in charge.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.970
For most of us, anyways.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.511
Not for me, because I'm scared
to death being up here talking

00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:21.440
to you guys.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.300
But the prefrontal
cortex, you can see here,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.330
handles your world
when you're chilled,

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.580
when you're maybe a
little bit uneasy.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.630
But then when you start to
get high on the anxiety scale,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.670
on the dread scale, all
the way up to terror,

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.390
the amygdala takes over.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.120
And the amygdala is only
making up stories about fear.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.310
You can't measure fear.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.080
You can measure risk, right?

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.519
Risk is of all the people in
this room, in our lifetime,

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.560
there's going to be seven
people in this room who

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.710
die of car crashes.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.740
If we took this same size
room, and we multiplied it

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.290
times 50 times,
we'd find one person

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.090
who would die in a plane crash.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.780
That's risk.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.800
We understand that.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.330
That's data driven.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.560
Fear is different for all
of us because it's not real.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.280
It doesn't exist.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.770
We make it up in our mind.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.250
It's almost like risk is on
one end of the solar system,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.580
over here in Mercury,
and fear comes out

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.750
of the other end of the
solar system from Uranus.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.800
That was a joke.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.260
That's why my 10 and 11-year-old
boys love my jokes when I

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.480
throw them in the presentation.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.880
The truth is, fear is a joke.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.900
There is no real basis
for any kind of fear.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.250
So if we can learn to take
this prefrontal cortex

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.100
and bring it over here and
make it in control when you're

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.530
doing it, this is exactly
the kind of courage

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.900
that Special Forces trained for.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.700
And they do it in
just one realm,

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.070
and they need to do
it in three realms.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.130
I told you, there's two
ways to make decisions.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:04.070
One is based on fear, the
other is based on opportunity.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.930
If you think about
every major decision

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.690
you've made in your life;
to come to work at Google,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.130
to move to Zurich, to get
in a serious relationship.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.140
Any major decision
you've made in your life,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.530
you've made it either out of
fear or out of opportunity.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:23.000
Out of opportunity comes
growth and gratitude.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.220
And those are the two
pillars for happiness.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.290
That's why understanding
fear and taming fear

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.840
can make you happier.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.170
I mention my 10 and
12-year-old boys for a reason

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.140
when I was talking
about the amygdala.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.780
For anyone who has
children or anyone who's

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.100
a teacher, who's working with
kids who are under 25 years

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.860
old, this is critical to know.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.160
The amygdala is fully
developed at birth.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.170
So they have the fight,
flight, and freeze response

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.370
when you're born.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.580
Because that saves you from
the charging woolly mammoth.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.030
The prefrontal cortex,
that doesn't get fully

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:06.020
developed until most people
are in their mid-20s.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.020
So think about that when
you're in a situation where

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.730
all of a sudden, a
kid starts screaming,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.670
and you can't figure out, why
can't you just think rationally

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.307
about this?

00:24:14.307 --> 00:24:15.890
Because he doesn't
have the capability

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.360
to think rationally yet.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.020
So someone who's
under 25 needs to be

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.240
trained to create
the connections

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.830
between the prefrontal
cortex and the amygdala

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.390
so that prefrontal
cortex can take control.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.320
And there's three things,
three types of fear

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.000
that we're going
to address here.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.870
But the important thing is
even after you're 25 years old,

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.920
you can still change.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.620
You can still create
courage because of something

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.810
called neuroplasticity.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.700
Neuroplasticity
has only recently

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.700
been proven with some of
the new technology we have.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.555
But basically, your mind
can change at any age.

00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:55.430
And that's what happened
to me when I finally

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.260
faced my fear frontier.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.630
So what I'm hoping
everyone here can do

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.530
is figure out what their fear
frontier is and move that out.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.124
And the further you move
that fear frontier out,

00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:07.790
the more in control
of your life you are

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.520
and the happier you
are going to be.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.400
If you understand the
three fears that exist,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.720
number one is physical.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.520
So we talked about
US Navy SEALs.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.250
And I've worked with
them in the past,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:24.107
and they are tremendous in
terms of physical courage.

00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:25.940
And what they do is
they've got this courage

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.390
factory in Coronado, California
called Basic Underwater

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.790
Demolition School, or BUDS.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.470
And SEALs go there
for six weeks.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.440
They take the strongest
and bravest candidates

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.930
from the normal Navy, and
they bring them to BUDS.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.410
Now it's not surprising
the average age

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.130
of a Navy SEAL going through
BUDS is 21 years old.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.260
So they're getting them
before that connection

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.520
is fully developed.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.480
And they ratchet up the
amount of physical fear

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.080
that they get put in every
day, until the SEALs start

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.990
to realize that when they get
that reaction, when they start

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.090
to feel the same trembling
knees, the butterflies

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.030
in the stomach, the tight
jaw, they can say, OK.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.510
This is our fuel.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.310
This is energy.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.060
We're going to get
something on, and we're

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.170
going to kick some ass.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.467
And anyone can learn to do that.

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:14.300
One of the challenges
some of the Navy SEALs

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.280
I've worked with
have is they only

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.650
learned to do it in
the physical realm.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.130
There's also emotional
fears and instinctual fears,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.740
as you can see from this graph.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.080
And like any other fear,
like any other skill,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.550
you have to practice.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.184
Courage, in those instances.

00:26:30.184 --> 00:26:31.850
You've got to understand
what it's like.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.390
Because what happens when
you hit your fear frontier is

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.800
cowardice begets cowardice.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.680
My biggest fear was dead
center in the middle of this.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.040
It's flying.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.620
I saw a plane crash, a delta
DC-9, when I was six years old.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.570
All 100 people on board died.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.120
I was terrified to fly.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.690
I had my entire life locked
away from me for 30 years,

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.580
and I didn't know it.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.310
And that planted a
seed of cowardice

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.470
that crept through
my whole body.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.420
I was a kid in
high school who was

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.810
afraid to go to sleep at
night without the light on.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.640
And that's how bad it was.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.680
So my biggest fear
became flying.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.100
But then after I got out of the
hospital, all I could imagine

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.510
was my one-year-old daughter.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.500
And would I have
to be the guy who

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.960
is remembered by his
daughter as being

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.887
too afraid to get on a plane
and take her to Disney World?

00:27:26.887 --> 00:27:28.470
And I said, man,
there's no way I want

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.030
that to be what I remember.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:34.110
So I decided to go mano a
mano with my flying fear,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.180
and that changed my whole life.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.640
And what happens from a
physical perspective--

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.856
this is a great example
of the type of technology

00:27:42.856 --> 00:27:44.230
we've had in the
past five years.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.410
This is from Dr.
Anna Byler, who used

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.350
to be at MIT, who just opened
up the neuroscience center

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.030
in Bordeaux.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.380
And what you're going to see
now is a mouse's amygdala

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.080
creating a pathway to
the prefrontal cortex

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.410
and the prefrontal cortex coming
back in the other direction.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.134
So what this shows--

00:28:03.134 --> 00:28:04.800
more than anything
else, what this shows

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.770
is how amazing the
technological advances have been

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.670
in just the past five years.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.170
But what you're seeing here
is that pathway connecting

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.270
between the amygdala and
the prefrontal cortex

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:21.380
means that those neurons
are firing together often.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.880
And neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.620
So that brain that
you just saw was

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.900
creating a highway of courage.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.260
And the more that those neurons
fire together, the easier

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.790
it becomes for that
pathway to fire together.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.470
So the more in control that the
prefrontal cortex can become.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:44.660
That's the second step of
this three part framework.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.460
That second step is to scare
yourself at least once a week,

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.550
so you can start to bring
those feelings up and start

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.750
to control them.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.890
And ideally, you scare yourself
at a higher and a higher level,

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.600
and you start to get in control.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.450
And you wire that pathway
between your amygdala

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.490
and your prefrontal cortex.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.910
Our bodies were designed
for physical stress

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.920
over thousands and
thousands of years.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.890
And we live in such
a stress-free world.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.070
We avoid stress, and we've
never lived in a safer

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.370
time in human history.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.500
We don't even walk
upstairs anymore.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.810
We stand on an escalator,
or we take an elevator.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.660
We don't even carry our
bags in the airport.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.130
We drag them behind
us on wheels.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.640
We try and do everything
we can to avoid stress.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.000
The problem is, our bodies
are wired for stress,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.800
so we have to find more of it.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.730
And that's step three is we
want to build this courage.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.470
We understand there's
neuroplasticity.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.300
It can happen at any time.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.520
All of this can be easier if you
create the right environment.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.040
The right foundation for it.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.610
And that's what I
call fear fitness.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.150
So the three steps are
to learn your fear tells,

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.750
scare yourself once a week,
and then stress your body three

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.190
to five times a week.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.610
The easiest way to do this
is with aerobic exercise.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.770
It gets better if
you add in strength

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.180
or some form of agility.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.360
Rock climbing is a great
example of that, or dancing.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.780
And then lastly,
there's so much new data

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.100
around what happens if you go
back to environmental stress.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.780
I tell everyone the
easiest thing to do

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.610
is take a cold shower
in the morning.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.530
In the first week, it sucks.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.600
And everyone in here--
everyone I've ever said,

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.410
said, no, no, no.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.451
Other people can do that.

00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.266
I can't take a cold shower.

00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:31.640
And everyone says
the same thing.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.840
But you can.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.880
And after a week
or two, it actually

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.680
becomes pretty easy to do.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.562
But you're training
your body to handle

00:30:38.562 --> 00:30:39.770
those environmental stresses.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.900
I run in the wintertime with
just a pair of shorts on.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.260
And it's a type of
stress that our body

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.350
needs because our
genetic array has

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.460
been aligned for very
specific instances and very

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.180
specific stresses.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:59.330
And if we're not using those,
it's almost like a race car.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.880
A Ferrari is sitting there
with all these tubes.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.590
It has all these
washers in them.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.610
But because it never gets run,
the washers get all dry rotted,

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.570
and they stop working.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.651
That's what your immune
system goes through when

00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:11.900
you go through those stresses.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.130
That's what almost killed me.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.050
Because I was living
that life of burying

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.460
my fears with beer every
night and 80 hours a week.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.890
So the other thing
that just came out

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.770
in the past six weeks
that's really interesting

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.380
is your diet plays a
tremendous role in your courage

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.280
and your happiness as well.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.030
So if you have the
right gut bacteria,

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:36.260
if you eat yogurt and sauerkraut
and kimchi and the things that

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.320
develop the good
bacteria in your gut,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.660
it's quicker to shut
off your amygdala.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.440
So it makes the circuits
to turn the fear response

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.730
off much quicker.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.680
And that's data that's
just come out literally

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.060
in the past six weeks.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.160
So there's so much
amazing stuff around how

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.770
to live a courageous life.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.620
Now what I want to do-- that's
the three step framework.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.940
I want to give you the
five fatal fears that we

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.680
see a lot in corporations.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.940
So you can use this to become
authentic, courageous leaders.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.700
And this is from,
like Elaine said,

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.610
working with a lot of
CEOs throughout the world

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.510
and a lot of government
organization.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.550
We've seen five fatal fears
that are pretty prevalent.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.070
First and foremost is
the fear of the unknown.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.840
You see this a ton in
mergers and acquisition.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.340
Right?

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.730
When people acquire
something, they say, OK.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.450
We want to keep the status quo.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:32.270
It's called a status quo bias.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.120
You also see it in
market leaders too.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.280
Kodak is a perfect example.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.449
Kodak was such a huge,
successful company.

00:32:39.449 --> 00:32:41.240
And they said, well,
we don't know anything

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.989
about this digital revolution.

00:32:42.989 --> 00:32:44.280
We're not going to do anything.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.260
We're not going to get into it.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.730
We're going to sit back and see.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.170
So fear of the unknown.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.840
The second is fear of rejection.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.200
Or fear of rejection from the
tribe is what it boils down to.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.750
The only reason anyone
would feel ridiculous

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.820
standing up here,
about to sing--

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.120
nothing changes.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.000
Nothing changes in your world.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.094
You're not in physical danger.

00:33:04.094 --> 00:33:06.260
There's no reason that you
should have any reaction,

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.650
except we're programmed
instinctually

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.410
to stick with the tribe,
because it's safer.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.320
100,000 years ago, if you
got rejected from the tribe,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.880
that meant certain death.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.170
You couldn't live.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.870
Today it doesn't
mean that at all.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.960
Today, oftentimes,
in fact, it means

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.500
you're an innovator
because you don't

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.010
want to be stuck with groupthink
or the sunflower management

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:30.380
that some people refer
to, which is just like,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.640
you do whatever the
leader wants you to do,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.700
so you can keep him
happy or her happy.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.920
So it's crazy.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.900
Apophenia is the second one.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.610
Or sorry, the third one.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:44.510
Apophenia is finding patterns
where patterns don't exist.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.980
This is most easily seen when
someone has had a few successes

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.370
and they get what's called
the winner bias or the success

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.650
bias, and they aren't
given the same scrutiny,

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.200
or their projects aren't
given the same analysis

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.300
that other projects
were, because maybe they

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.210
had one or two successful ones.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.350
The fourth one is atychiphobia.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.389
And that is basically
the fear of failure.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.850
It comes down to something
called a stability bias.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.370
We see this more
times in careers

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.170
than we necessarily
see it in companies.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.497
But we see people who have
a tremendous skill set,

00:34:18.497 --> 00:34:20.330
and they don't want to
do it because they're

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.840
afraid they might fail, and they
have something good already.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.639
I use my brother
every now and again

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.880
as an example because
he's such a great artist.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.449
He's a federal agent, and he
does law enforcement for the US

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.810
government from 9:00 to 5:00.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.230
He's pretty good at his job.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.130
He rushes home to build
custom motorcycles.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.730
And he spends all weekend at
swap meets and going to shows,

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.420
and he's sold his motorcycles
in Japan, all over the US,

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.170
throughout Europe.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.414
And I've said to him a
bunch of times, Sean,

00:34:50.414 --> 00:34:51.830
you ought to do
that for a living.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.120
You'd be making millions of
dollars doing what you love.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.900
He'd say, oh, no.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.180
I've got 15 years, and
I'll get my pension,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.640
and then I can do it full time.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.970
And I see that all the time.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.261
And that's the fear of failure.

00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:06.960
People are looking
for that stability.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.585
If you ever hear
someone saying they're

00:35:08.585 --> 00:35:10.500
working for the weekend, right?

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.450
I can't wait for the weekend.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.430
It means they have
the wrong job.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.290
You have the right
job when you're

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.740
able to combine your
passion with your vocation.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.360
And that's what I
call your genius.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.490
If you can spend every
day in your genius,

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.692
you love coming to work.

00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:27.150
You love doing what you do and
working with the team you're

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.990
working with.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.910
If you don't, you're
being held back

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.830
because of a fear
decision that you made,

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.100
not an opportunity decision.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.230
The fifth one is a fear of loss.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.680
And we see this with
sales teams all the time.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.800
A lot of sales guys will
come from meager backgrounds.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.220
Families that maybe never
had gone to college.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.570
Never made a lot of money.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.210
And they'll start
making $150,000 a year,

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.210
and they'll buy the Porsche, and
they'll join the country club.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.140
And these guys start to get
pushed from their VP of sales

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.310
or their CEO.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.060
They say, OK.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.500
You can do way more than this.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.610
And they could.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.590
They could do
million dollar years.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.870
They could really have
an incredible life

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.670
that they only dreamed of.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.320
But all of a sudden, when
they hit a certain level,

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.290
they think, well, what
if I lose the Porsche?

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.770
What if I lose the big house?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.410
What if I lose the country club?

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.710
So we see this a lot with
sales guys having fear of loss.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:25.350
And again, it's a decision based
on fear, not on opportunity.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.660
So I'm going to share one
more tool that I put up

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.870
on the web for you guys.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.190
And this is a great way,
especially with your teams

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.530
or with your personal
decisions, to make a decision.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.060
This is from the stoics
over 2,300 years ago,

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.840
and it's called--

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.130
I love the name--

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.040
pre-meditation of evil.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.370
So when you get trouble, or
you get scared, a lot of people

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.930
say, oh, go to your safe place.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.190
Go to your happy place.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.900
That's the worst
thing you can do.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.760
You want to go to
the evil place.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.730
You want to go someplace
where you absolutely think

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.880
of the worst scenario possible.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.890
And then you want to
see that happening,

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.510
and you want to
create the mitigation

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.400
for it, the likely results.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.220
And then that brings you a
whole new level of confidence.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.570
And this is done
by Marcus Aurelius,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.560
who's a famous stoic, who
made this famous years

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.220
and years ago.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.751
And there's a whole process
that we use with corporations

00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:17.250
to do it.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.660
But it's a great way to
start taking control of life.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.660
Because life only
happens two ways.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.300
Life can either happen to you--

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.610
if you're making
decisions based on fear--

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.680
and that means you're a victim.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.640
Or life can happen by you.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.249
And you're the
author of your life.

00:37:36.249 --> 00:37:38.040
And that means every
decision you're making

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.780
is based on an opportunity,
not because of fear.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.380
So I made this
transformation for flying.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.140
When I got out of
the hospital, I

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.260
decided to get my
private pilot's license,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.360
and I fell in love with flight.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.650
And I couldn't
believe for 30 years,

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.450
this had been completely
locked away from me.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.520
So I got my instrument rating
so I could fly in any weather.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.360
And then I went on and got my
commercial pilot's license.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.570
And I wondered, how many other
people are living in fear

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.060
and having the greatest joy
of their life locked away

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.227
from them because of a fear?

00:38:14.227 --> 00:38:16.560
So that's when I started
trying to convince other people

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.390
to go out and find their fear.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.510
So now the kid who
was afraid, who

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:25.320
would cry every time I saw an
airplane, is this guy here.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.780
This is the Green Mountain
Valley Aerobatics School

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.950
Aerobatics Contest
in Vermont last year.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:39.100
And I had more fun doing
this and flying on the water,

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.960
in aerobatics, doing all
sorts of different stuff.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.310
And I was just amazed that this
has been held away for so long

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:45.810
for me.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.990
And if you ever get scared
of heights or anything else,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.710
let me know.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.740
I'll take you up for a flight.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.860
So I got second in this
aerobatics competition

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.466
last summer in Vermont.

00:39:05.466 --> 00:39:07.340
And I know someone out
there is saying, well,

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.860
if this fear stuff works so
good, why didn't you get first?

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.160
So you try pulling five G's
with your stomach trying

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.950
to duck out of your sphincter,
and let me know how easy it is.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:16.970
Because it's tough.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.762
But it's so [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:18.762 --> 00:39:19.970
And I would have never known.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.220
I would have been hidden away.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.079
I would have never traveled to
all the places that I traveled.

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:26.620
I would have never done all the
stuff that I do with my fear.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:31.400
So what I'd ask you is what
is holding you prisoner

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.720
from your greatest joy?

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.870
What fears are influencing
the decisions that you make?

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.390
So now I've got one last thing.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.250
I want everyone to
stand up one more time.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.550
And we're going to take
the courage code together.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.960
I want you to raise your right
hand, and repeat after me.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.531
I will scare myself once a week.

00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:52.745
AUDIENCE: I will scare
myself once a week.

00:39:52.745 --> 00:39:53.870
PATRICK SWEENEY: Very good.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.441
I will extend my fear frontier.

00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:59.090
AUDIENCE: I will extend
my fear frontier.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.496
PATRICK SWEENEY: I will
face life with courage.

00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:03.930
AUDIENCE: I will face
life with courage.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.830
PATRICK SWEENEY: I will make
decisions based on opportunity.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.270
AUDIENCE: I will make
decisions based on opportunity.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.476
PATRICK SWEENEY: And I
will lead with bravery.

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:14.420
AUDIENCE: And I will
lead with bravery.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.070
PATRICK SWEENEY: When you do, I
promise, your life will change,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.770
and you'll have such
an amazing life.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.560
And what's in here will come
out to share with everyone else.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.770
Thank you all very much.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:23.660
I'm Patrick Sweeney.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.510
Goodnight.
