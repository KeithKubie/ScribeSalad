streamlined<00:04:37.300><c> down</c><00:04:37.690><c> to</c><00:04:37.900><c> just</c><00:04:38.110><c> the</c><00:04:38.350><c> two</c><00:04:38.380><c> of</c><00:04:38.650><c> them</c>

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
streamlined down to just the two of them
 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.950 align:start position:0%
streamlined down to just the two of them
yeah<00:04:39.220><c> and</c><00:04:39.430><c> it's</c><00:04:39.550><c> it</c><00:04:40.330><c> seemed</c><00:04:40.630><c> to</c><00:04:40.750><c> make</c><00:04:40.900><c> sense</c>

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's it seemed to make sense
 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.890 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's it seemed to make sense
that's<00:04:41.500><c> like</c><00:04:41.830><c> you</c><00:04:42.370><c> have</c><00:04:42.400><c> to</c><00:04:42.880><c> keep</c><00:04:43.060><c> the</c><00:04:43.360><c> circle</c>

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 align:start position:0%
that's like you have to keep the circle
 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.070 align:start position:0%
that's like you have to keep the circle
going<00:04:44.560><c> sort</c><00:04:45.160><c> of</c><00:04:45.280><c> this</c><00:04:45.460><c> you</c><00:04:45.700><c> know</c><00:04:45.850><c> if</c><00:04:46.060><c> you</c><00:04:46.330><c> don't</c>

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
going sort of this you know if you don't
 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.450 align:start position:0%
going sort of this you know if you don't
and<00:04:47.560><c> I</c><00:04:47.590><c> thought</c><00:04:47.770><c> they</c><00:04:47.919><c> demonstrated</c><00:04:48.400><c> that</c>

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 align:start position:0%
and I thought they demonstrated that
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
and I thought they demonstrated that
pretty<00:04:48.730><c> well</c><00:04:48.940><c> with</c><00:04:49.240><c> Finn</c><00:04:49.660><c> not</c><00:04:50.020><c> interrupting</c>

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 align:start position:0%
pretty well with Finn not interrupting
 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.530 align:start position:0%
pretty well with Finn not interrupting
Jake<00:04:50.950><c> in</c><00:04:51.160><c> the</c><00:04:51.250><c> beginning</c><00:04:51.700><c> mm-hmm</c><00:04:52.270><c> cuz</c><00:04:52.419><c> at</c>

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 align:start position:0%
Jake in the beginning mm-hmm cuz at
 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.879 align:start position:0%
Jake in the beginning mm-hmm cuz at
first<00:04:52.720><c> I</c><00:04:52.870><c> was</c><00:04:53.020><c> like</c><00:04:53.080><c> I</c><00:04:53.470><c> was</c><00:04:53.590><c> thinking</c><00:04:53.650><c> back</c>

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 align:start position:0%
first I was like I was thinking back
 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
first I was like I was thinking back
like<00:04:54.100><c> well</c><00:04:54.250><c> why</c><00:04:54.400><c> did</c><00:04:54.669><c> you</c><00:04:54.700><c> really</c><00:04:55.120><c> just</c><00:04:55.240><c> show</c>

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 align:start position:0%
like well why did you really just show
 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
like well why did you really just show
them<00:04:55.900><c> I</c><00:04:55.930><c> think</c><00:04:56.290><c> that</c><00:04:56.410><c> helped</c><00:04:56.710><c> demonstrate</c>

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 align:start position:0%
them I think that helped demonstrate
 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
them I think that helped demonstrate
more<00:04:57.460><c> you</c><00:04:57.790><c> can't</c><00:04:58.860><c> disrupt</c><00:04:59.860><c> the</c><00:05:00.310><c> cycle</c><00:05:00.820><c> you</c>

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 align:start position:0%
more you can't disrupt the cycle you
 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
more you can't disrupt the cycle you
know<00:05:01.210><c> like</c><00:05:01.450><c> if</c><00:05:01.600><c> you</c><00:05:01.750><c> do</c><00:05:01.930><c> that</c><00:05:02.110><c> then</c><00:05:02.410><c> it's</c><00:05:02.590><c> like</c>

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 align:start position:0%
know like if you do that then it's like
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
know like if you do that then it's like
the<00:05:02.800><c> cycle</c><00:05:03.130><c> is</c><00:05:03.340><c> exactly</c><00:05:03.730><c> that</c><00:05:03.940><c> broken</c><00:05:04.300><c> and</c>

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 align:start position:0%
the cycle is exactly that broken and
 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
the cycle is exactly that broken and
everything<00:05:04.630><c> crumbles</c>

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 align:start position:0%
everything crumbles
 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
everything crumbles
you<00:05:06.130><c> know</c><00:05:06.190><c> you</c><00:05:06.280><c> CJ</c><00:05:06.730><c> keep</c><00:05:07.030><c> blowing</c><00:05:07.480><c> up</c><00:05:07.630><c> so</c><00:05:08.230><c> I</c>

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
you know you CJ keep blowing up so I
 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.290 align:start position:0%
you know you CJ keep blowing up so I
guess<00:05:08.740><c> it</c><00:05:08.950><c> I</c><00:05:09.310><c> guess</c><00:05:09.730><c> it</c><00:05:09.880><c> has</c><00:05:10.000><c> since</c><00:05:10.180><c> they</c>

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 align:start position:0%
guess it I guess it has since they
 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.050 align:start position:0%
guess it I guess it has since they
killed<00:05:10.690><c> a</c><00:05:10.840><c> bunch</c><00:05:10.990><c> of</c><00:05:11.080><c> Jake's</c><00:05:11.580><c> maybe</c><00:05:12.580><c> or</c><00:05:12.880><c> what</c>

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 align:start position:0%
killed a bunch of Jake's maybe or what
 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
killed a bunch of Jake's maybe or what
that<00:05:13.240><c> dream</c><00:05:13.510><c> Jake</c><00:05:14.050><c> any</c><00:05:14.290><c> who</c><00:05:14.470><c> knows</c><00:05:16.200><c> and</c><00:05:17.200><c> yeah</c><00:05:17.380><c> I</c>

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 align:start position:0%
that dream Jake any who knows and yeah I
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.690 align:start position:0%
that dream Jake any who knows and yeah I
like<00:05:17.710><c> that</c><00:05:17.770><c> too</c><00:05:17.950><c> how</c><00:05:18.250><c> there's</c><00:05:18.400><c> just</c><00:05:18.610><c> this</c>

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 align:start position:0%
like that too how there's just this
 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
like that too how there's just this
endless<00:05:19.090><c> cycle</c><00:05:19.240><c> and</c><00:05:19.540><c> only</c><00:05:19.750><c> one</c><00:05:20.110><c> gets</c><00:05:20.919><c> out</c><00:05:21.160><c> that</c>

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 align:start position:0%
endless cycle and only one gets out that
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.690 align:start position:0%
endless cycle and only one gets out that
like<00:05:21.880><c> kind</c><00:05:22.450><c> of</c><00:05:23.020><c> breaks</c><00:05:23.680><c> if</c><00:05:24.070><c> you</c><00:05:24.280><c> know</c><00:05:24.460><c> in</c><00:05:24.580><c> a</c>

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 align:start position:0%
like kind of breaks if you know in a
 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.450 align:start position:0%
like kind of breaks if you know in a
sense<00:05:24.940><c> like</c><00:05:25.300><c> you</c><00:05:25.540><c> know</c><00:05:25.660><c> the</c><00:05:25.900><c> so</c><00:05:26.680><c> one</c><00:05:27.040><c> Finn</c><00:05:27.310><c> is</c>

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 align:start position:0%
sense like you know the so one Finn is
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
sense like you know the so one Finn is
destroyed<00:05:27.880><c> and</c><00:05:28.180><c> then</c><00:05:28.300><c> I'm</c><00:05:28.450><c> ever</c><00:05:28.630><c> Jake</c><00:05:28.870><c> has</c><00:05:29.080><c> to</c>

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 align:start position:0%
destroyed and then I'm ever Jake has to
 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
destroyed and then I'm ever Jake has to
sleep<00:05:29.500><c> and</c><00:05:29.710><c> be</c><00:05:29.800><c> the</c><00:05:29.919><c> new</c><00:05:30.010><c> body</c><00:05:30.250><c> but</c><00:05:30.400><c> yeah</c><00:05:30.700><c> the</c>

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 align:start position:0%
sleep and be the new body but yeah the
 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
sleep and be the new body but yeah the
one<00:05:31.030><c> that</c><00:05:31.150><c> was</c><00:05:31.210><c> running</c><00:05:31.479><c> that</c><00:05:31.750><c> cycle</c><00:05:32.200><c> kind</c><00:05:32.890><c> of</c>

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 align:start position:0%
one that was running that cycle kind of
 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
one that was running that cycle kind of
gets<00:05:33.160><c> out</c><00:05:33.340><c> so</c><00:05:33.640><c> it's</c><00:05:33.820><c> it's</c><00:05:34.390><c> fun</c><00:05:34.660><c> it's</c><00:05:34.930><c> it's</c><00:05:35.140><c> some</c>

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 align:start position:0%
like this really sir took the idea of
 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
like this really sir took the idea of
the<00:05:49.840><c> loop</c><00:05:50.080><c> and</c><00:05:50.440><c> breaking</c><00:05:51.160><c> the</c><00:05:51.310><c> loop</c><00:05:51.520><c> and</c><00:05:51.729><c> what</c>

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 align:start position:0%
the loop and breaking the loop and what
 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
the loop and breaking the loop and what
can<00:05:52.000><c> happen</c><00:05:52.120><c> with</c><00:05:52.419><c> it</c><00:05:52.660><c> and</c><00:05:53.050><c> place</c><00:05:53.979><c> it</c><00:05:54.010><c> maybe</c>

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 align:start position:0%
can happen with it and place it maybe
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
can happen with it and place it maybe
enjoyably<00:05:55.120><c> confusing</c><00:05:55.750><c> I</c><00:05:55.810><c> think</c><00:05:55.990><c> it's</c><00:05:56.380><c> meant</c>

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 align:start position:0%
enjoyably confusing I think it's meant
 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.830 align:start position:0%
enjoyably confusing I think it's meant
to<00:05:56.710><c> be</c><00:05:56.800><c> like</c><00:05:57.190><c> this</c><00:05:57.880><c> is</c><00:05:58.090><c> hard</c><00:05:58.270><c> to</c><00:05:58.419><c> follow</c><00:05:58.539><c> but</c>

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
to be like this is hard to follow but
 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.260 align:start position:0%

about a lot of time travel episodes and
 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.610 align:start position:0%
about a lot of time travel episodes and

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 align:start position:0%
like infinite loop episodes have just
 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
like infinite loop episodes have just
chosen<00:06:33.070><c> it</c><00:06:33.520><c> in</c><00:06:33.669><c> general</c><00:06:34.120><c> they</c><00:06:34.960><c> try</c><00:06:35.229><c> to</c><00:06:35.289><c> go</c><00:06:35.470><c> too</c>

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.070 align:start position:0%
chosen it in general they try to go too
complicated<00:06:36.130><c> and</c><00:06:36.610><c> you</c><00:06:36.880><c> stop</c><00:06:37.330><c> having</c><00:06:37.630><c> fun</c>

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
complicated and you stop having fun
 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.149 align:start position:0%
complicated and you stop having fun
this<00:06:38.800><c> one</c><00:06:39.009><c> was</c><00:06:39.220><c> just</c><00:06:39.250><c> a</c><00:06:39.520><c> lot</c><00:06:39.699><c> more</c><00:06:40.590><c> done</c><00:06:41.590><c> well</c>

this one was just a lot more done well
again<00:06:42.460><c> I</c><00:06:42.490><c> think</c><00:06:42.580><c> because</c><00:06:42.940><c> you</c><00:06:42.970><c> have</c><00:06:43.090><c> that</c><00:06:43.330><c> 11</c>
