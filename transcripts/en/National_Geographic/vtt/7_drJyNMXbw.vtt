<i> Man: We're gonna talk
 about a pivotal moment</i>

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.569
<i> that we're at in
 the history of neuroscience,</i>

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.237
<i> in the history
 of science really,</i>

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.739
<i> because scientists
 are helping to decipher</i>

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.609
<i> what you could arguably say</i>

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.478

 in the universe.</i>

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.350
( applause )

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.553 line:0%
When I was still
a tenured professor,

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.089 line:0%
now I'm just a mere mortal,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.257 line:0%
when I was still
a tenured professor at Caltech

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.593 line:0%
and I could leap over
tall buildings,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:04.297 line:0%
I was, um... My main pursuit
was studying consciousness

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:06.332
the neural basis
of consciousness.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.101
And in particular I felt
the best way to pursue that

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:12.305
was to work on theoretical
ideas, but also to pursue

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:15.775
experiments in humans,
'cause if there's one thing

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.710
we know for certain
about consciousness,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.613
is that most of us are
conscious most of the time.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.016
In order to understand
anything about the brain

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.185
and ultimately about psychology,
we have to understand neurons.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.389
We know a lot about nerve cells
in post-mortem, in dead brains

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.191
and of course in animals.
But there's a rare occasion

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.693
when you can
actually listen in

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.794
to the way neurons
talk to each other,

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.697
and that's during neurosurgery.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:43.302
So in some subset of patients,
that have epileptic seizures,

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.505
there's an idea
that if you can locate

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.241
from the place in the brain from
which the seizure originates,

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.811
and if you can then
surgically remove that,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:57.283
then in many cases depending on
the type of epileptic seizure

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.685
the seizures will go away.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.622
Now in some patients you can't
locate it from the outside,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.924
so then what the neurosurgeon
does, implants up to

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.459
12 microelectrodes
into the patient's head.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.028
And so you can
essentially triangulate.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.197
When the patient has a seizure
you can triangulate,

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.733
and then you can pinpoint
where the seizure originates.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.535
So now in principle we can
listen to individual neurons.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.271
And I say listen because
the way they talk to each other

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.574
is they're sending out
these brief electrical pulses

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.375
called action potential
or spikes.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.644
You can put them
on a monitor

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.312
and you can actually
listen to them.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.546
( popping noises )

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.181
So these are actually neurons,
nerve cells,

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.517
in a brain of a patient that
are chatting to each other.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:33.252
We don't--we're only
beginning to understand

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.387
the code that they use
to talk to each other.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.489
But we can pick up
this signal

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.325
and it's very similar
in animals.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.228
So the patient is conscious,
you can do all sorts of games

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.798
with the patients or you can
show him or her images.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:49.034
So what we did, we probed
and we showed different things

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:50.703
to the patients because
we wanted to uncover

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.739
what is the trigger, what turns
these individual neurons on?

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.176
See here, what you can see,
we show this image of a spider,

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.745
of an animal,
of the Eiffel Tower,

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.113
of a bunch of Kobe Bryant,

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.182
of a bunch of other
famous people,

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.085
and here, of an actress
called Jennifer Aniston.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.988
Some of you may know her, she's
a famous Hollywood actress.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.357
But now, if you show images
of Jennifer Aniston

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.692
the neuron will respond...
( makes buzzing noise )

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.295
Very reliable,
on each trial.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:18.131
The neuron didn't respond
at the time she was married

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.000
to another famous actor,
and, uh...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.034
( audience laughing )

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.103
And the neuron
didn't respond to that.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.571
This is now in the textbook

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.673
and is called
"Jennifer Aniston neurons".

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.110
So the idea is that things
that you're very familiar with

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.147
like actresses or actors,
politicians,

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.083
your spouse, your kids,
your workers, your car,

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.519
your dog, anything that
you see again and again

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.120
your brain abstracts

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.489
and represents
by a bunch of neurons.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.058
Not one, this isn't just one
Jennifer Aniston neuron.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:48.027
There may be 10,000,
or maybe even more neurons

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:49.629
that respond
relative specifically

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.230
to Jennifer Aniston.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.832
And so the idea
is this tells us something

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.201
about the way neurons...

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:57.036
The things that
neurons care about.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:58.637
So in this high-level
part of the brain,

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:00.139
they care about things
that we care about.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.575
It's not surprising. I mean,
we care about abstract things

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.377
like people
and the relationship,

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:08.314
or like idea,
concept things

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.217
like justice or democracy
or America or Afghanistan,

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.318
all those things, and there
will be groups of neurons

00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:15.321
that very specifically
respond to that

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.623
when you think about
those things.

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:20.693
So you can do a lot of
research at that level.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.661
Um, so this is a neuron.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.764
Here you have its
sort of input region.

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.067
This is called
the dendrite, in red.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.102
And then here
at the cell body

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:31.503
there's a lot
of electric machinery

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:32.905
that we understand quite well.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.407
It generates this action--
this pulse

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:37.010
when it's sufficiently excited,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.278
and then it sends out
that pulse onto the wire.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.247
This is the output wire,
it's very complicated.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.748
And every time
there's a connection

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:45.551
this is indicated in yellow
and that's a synapse.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:50.356
The synapse is a contact point
between two neurons.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:54.026
And how much one neuron
influences the next neuron

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.262
is encoded in the strength
of that synapse.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.232
And all the evidence
shows that a memory,

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.000
like the memory
of my first kiss,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.502
or the memory that I know
what Julius Caesar said

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.539
when he was killed
by his friend Brutus,

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.674
all that sort of memory
is encoded

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.477
in the strength of
billions of synapses

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.080
that constitute memory
and that also ultimately

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.482
give rise to consciousness,
the feeling of something.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.085
What really gives rise to
thought and consciousness

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.786
and memories is
the cerebral cortex.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.022
The cerebral cortex
is really a sheet.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.458
It's a pizza.
It's pretty much...

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.193
Think of a pizza that's two
to three millimeters thick,

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:30.663
pretty much like my vest here,
two to three millimeter.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.565
It's this size,
and we've got two of them,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.433
but they're highly folded.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.402
And this is
a computational tissue

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:39.071
that evolution invented
roughly 200 million years ago.

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.140
It's common to all mammals,
and it gives rise

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.410
to our identity, who we are,
our feelings, our memory

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.812
our sense of selves.

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:49.315
And we at the Allen Institute
and many, many other scientists

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.450
are trying to understand
what is the universal...

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.585
what is the,
sort of the algorithm,

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:55.755
what is the computation
that's performed

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:58.690
within this dense forest
of 100 billion neurons?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.295
It's 100 billion trees
that give rise to all of this.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.996
So now what we're gonna do,
we're gonna zoom in

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.264
in this last movie
I'll show you.

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:08.701
We're gonna zoom in onto
one piece, a sliver here

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.302
that's incredible thin.

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:12.105
It turns out for those of you
who know about numbers,

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:15.108
twelve micrometers
in thickness.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:18.978
That's maybe a tenth of
the width of a human hair.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.381
It's very, very thin but we're
gonna zoom in, in great detail

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.284
because the more we look,
the more details we see.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.187
I show this
because the one thing

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:32.558
that you're confronted with
is overwhelming complexity.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.495
Each new generation
of measurement techniques,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.230
of microscopes, reveals
more and more complexity.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.666
It has to be complex because
ultimately it has to give rise

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.634
to the subtlety
of the human mind.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.437
So what we'll see here
is a piece of cortex

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:48.207
from the mouse brain. Here
again is one of those neurons

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.008
just like the one
we showed before.

00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:53.145
You'll see a whole bunch of
them, so we're gonna take a trip

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.448
with cool music,
that starts up here

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.583
and that goes
slowly down here.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.451
And it visualizes
every single synapse,

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:01.587
so what you're gonna see
are three colors.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:04.590
You'll see in high detail,
you see magenta.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.026
Each magenta pointer,
each point is a synapse.

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.762
As I said, they are--
In this piece

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.065
there's gonna be
a couple of billion synapses.

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:16.569
Green is a subset of one
particular type of neuron,

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.272
and the blue color you see
is tubulin.

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:24.444
It's dendrites and axons
of other neurons.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.679
This is one millimeter again,
so the millimeter

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:30.683
is half the size of
the width of a grain of rice.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.685
All right, and now...

00:07:33.685 --> 00:07:36.322
( music playing )

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:42.261
So it's a mouse brain.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.264
The common laboratory mouse.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:53.739
The size of the brain
is roughly a sugar cube.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.641
And that's where
we'll zoom in.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.679
Just remember, the magenta
are the synapses.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:03.516
The green is
one set of neurons.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:06.452
They happen to be called
Layer Five for the experts.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:10.623
And blue is tubulin that
shows the wiring of axons.

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:13.759
And now we'll go
through this cortex.

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:23.763
( applause )

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.599
Good evening.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:30.235
So you might think
after seeing that movie

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:32.504
that it's hopeless, that we
can never understand anything

00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:34.673
about something
so complicated.

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:37.243 line:0%
Um, so what I want to do

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:41.146 line:0%
is to say that in fact
we have learned enough

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.115 line:0%
not only to understand
some fundamental things

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.750 line:0%
about how the brain works,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.519
but also to intervene in
ways where we can restore

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.787
lost functions,
and I want to give you

00:09:48.787 --> 00:09:51.423
just two examples
of the kinds of things

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:55.328
that we can do because of
our understanding of the brain.

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.530
So the first one
is one in which...

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.499
where technology we have
is going to allow us,

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.601
allows us to write
into the brain,

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:05.071
to actually do something
to transform the brain

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.573
by intervening
in brain circuits.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.807
So, let me just explain.

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:11.577
So every day
when you move around,

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:14.780
your brain is working
to produce movements,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.616
and there's a very important
chemical in your brain

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:20.619
called dopamine that comes
from the bottom of the brain

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.721
in the brain stem,
and it comes up

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.357
and basically dopamine
is oozed all over your brain,

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.058
and in many areas
it's sort of, uh...

00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:29.327
...your brain is taking
a bath in dopamine.

00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:32.665
In some cases, the dopamine
neurons degenerate, they die.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.934
In fact, in all of us, we
lose a little bit as we age.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:37.669
But if these neurons die,

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:40.139
the circuits don't work properly
and you get something

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.608
that James Parkinson
described in 1817

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:45.444
as "the shaking palsy".

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.413
And what happens here is,
you can see this lady

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:50.649
who has lost many of
her dopamine neurons.

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:52.485
She has the shaking palsy.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.420
You have a tremor, you
can't move, you're rigid,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.789
and you have difficulty
initiating movement.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:00.191
It's a severely
debilitating disease,

00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:02.161
and it's because of
the loss of dopamine.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.763
Now we can't put dopamine
back in the brain very well.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:07.299
There are some pills,
but it doesn't work

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:09.334
exceptionally well
in all cases.

00:11:09.334 --> 00:11:11.604
But what we can do,
is we can put

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:16.008
a stimulating electrode about
the size of a small soda straw

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.209
that has the ability

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.011
to electrically stimulate
at the end,

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.513
and we can, by turning on
this stimulator

00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:24.049
we can tickle these brain
circuits and make them act

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.618
as if they had
dopamine back again,

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.219
so they work again.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.688
And as a consequence, we have
a very remarkable result

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.557
when we turn on
this stimulation.

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:34.526
So here is the same lady,
after the electrical stimulation

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:36.161
has been turned on,
and you can see

00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:38.564
the shaking, the tremor,
the rigidity is gone.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.632
And this is
an amazing reawakening

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:43.435
of these motor circuits.
They are no longer held slave

00:11:43.435 --> 00:11:46.372
to this disruption that's there
with the lack of dopamine.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.374
This kind of intervention
in brain circuits

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.276
to rebalance, or what
we call "neuromodulation",

00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:53.579
modulating these brain
circuits back to normal,

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:56.448
is now being tried in a large
number of other disorders,

00:11:56.448 --> 00:12:00.251
and as far ranging as dementia,
Alzheimer's disease.

00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:02.588
Imagine now we could
bring that circuit back

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:06.058
into control so that instead
of having cognitive decline,

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.494
you could allow a person
to retain their memory

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.662
throughout life
instead of losing it

00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:14.767
as happens with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:17.202
So the second disorder
I want to tell you about

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:21.774
is the loss of the ability
to move, paralysis.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:25.344
And there are a large number of
ways you can become paralyzed,

00:12:25.344 --> 00:12:29.782
and that basically cuts off
a brain that functions

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.350
from the body.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.052
So, let's just sort of see
what happens when you move.

00:12:34.052 --> 00:12:36.788
So basically, when
you're thinking about

00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:39.591
planning to say, pick up a pen
and jot down a phone number

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:41.326
or take some notes here,

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:44.229
your brain, many areas of
your brain collaborate together

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:48.067
and work to produce a plan and
that plan is turned into action,

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:51.336
and it largely engages
this one important area

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:53.539
called the motor cortex.
It's a strip that runs

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.474
from the top of your head
down to your cheekbone,

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.543
about an inch wide or so.

00:12:57.543 --> 00:12:59.344
And if you're thinking
about jotting down a note

00:12:59.344 --> 00:13:01.713
to control your arm,
there's a region at about

00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:04.750
the middle third of this area
that controls your arm.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.287
And that sends out a bundle
of fibers, these axons.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.689
It's a compact bundle about
the size of a pencil lead

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.691
that has a million
of these fibers.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.561
It runs down
through the brain stem

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.396
and down into
your spinal cord,

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:20.398
and it's the requisite pathway,
it's the important pathway

00:13:20.398 --> 00:13:24.069
to send commands from your brain
to move out to your muscles.

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.272
So, for example, if you were
to have a spinal cord injury,

00:13:27.272 --> 00:13:29.575
that would interrupt this path
you would be paralyzed.

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.343
You couldn't move
your arms and legs.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.445
If it was the whole path
destroyed, you would think

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.280
about moving, but
nothing would happen.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.116
We call that tetraplegia.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.752
And even more devastating
damage can happen

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.320
with destruction
in the brain stem,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.355
where it still interrupts
the pathways, but because

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:46.825
it's higher up in the brain,
it not only will

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:50.729
render a person tetraplegic,
they cannot speak

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:53.098
and sometimes they can't move
at all in the worse condition.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.666
We call that
a locked-in syndrome.

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:57.803
They can only move their eyes
up and down and that's it.

00:13:57.803 --> 00:14:00.672
So, I'm gonna tell you
about two people.

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:03.375
Cathy Hutchinson,
who had a brain stem stroke

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.644
about 15 years before
this picture was taken

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.345
when she was sitting
on her couch.

00:14:07.345 --> 00:14:09.148
She was completely
locked-in for a while,

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:13.252
and then was able to move
her face and eyes and head,

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:15.220
but not able
to speak any longer

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.555
and not able to move.

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:18.757
And Matt Nagle had
a spinal cord injury

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:21.259
when he was involved in a fight
and a knife went into his neck

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.128
and severed his spinal cord.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.230
So he can talk
and he can move his head

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.666
but he cannot
move his body at all.

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:29.368
And what I'm going
to tell you about

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:32.137
is a project which
we call "Braingate",

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:34.406
but it's a kind of
brain-computer interface.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:39.077
Our attempt to take signals
from the motor cortex,

00:14:39.077 --> 00:14:43.048
take them outside the body
and allow people to run machines

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.317
and control devices
to free them up,

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.453
to give them independence
to control again.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:50.589
And what we do is we have
created this electrode array

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.592
that is implanted in the arm
area of your motor cortex.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.360
Now the electrode array
is a tiny,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.096
baby aspirin-sized implant,

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:59.731
and it has a lot of these
little prongs sticking out.

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:01.667
These are electrodes
that are actually inserted

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.369 line:0%
into the cortex to get up
close to these neurons

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:06.005 line:0%
that you just saw.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.540 line:0%
And the reason we have to
put this into the brain

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.775 line:0%
is the action potentials,
the spikes,

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:13.678
the electrical impulses that
come out of individual neurons

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:16.248
only go a very short distance.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.784
So in order for us to
listen in to those impulses

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:21.486
we have to put electrodes
up very close.

00:15:21.486 --> 00:15:24.156
But those impulses are
the message of movement.

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:26.791
So what I'm gonna do
is let you listen in

00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:29.628
to a recording
in which a technician

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.464
is telling... In this case,
it's Cathy,

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:36.001
he's telling her to imagine
opening and closing your hand,

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:39.237
and you'll hear the spikes
change their firing rate.

00:15:39.237 --> 00:15:40.672
So it'll get higher and lower,

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:43.175
and you can hear that there is,
in fact, a code there.

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:46.278
High means that
the hand is open,

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.680
and low means
the hand is closed.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.815
So just listen in
for a second.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.051
<i> Man: Relax.</i>

00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:54.386
( popping noises )

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:57.156
<i> Imagine you're
 opening your hand.</i>

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:01.660
<i> Relax.</i>

00:16:04.362 --> 00:16:05.697
<i> Close your hand.</i>

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:08.000
Donoghue: See, it shuts off.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.435
<i> Man: Relax.</i>

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.636
( popping resumes )

00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:13.706
<i> Open your hand.</i>

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:21.213
So, this is the basis of
the device that we've created.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.115
Not only recording
from one cell,

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.117
but taking the pattern
of many, many neurons

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:28.120
and trying to relate what
the person is thinking about

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.655
to what something
in the real world will do.

00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:32.557
And this is the set-up
that we have.

00:16:32.557 --> 00:16:34.460
The person has
this electrode array

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.695
implanted in their arm area
of the motor cortex,

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:39.431
We have now in this rather
crude, primitive version

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.132
because it's just
an early stage version,

00:16:41.132 --> 00:16:42.467
they had a plug in their head.

00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:45.103
The electronics
are connected by a cable

00:16:45.103 --> 00:16:47.339
that amplifies those
little, tiny signals,

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:49.307
takes them through a computer
and the computer basically

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:51.342
counts up and measures
those spikes,

00:16:51.342 --> 00:16:53.612
and tries to figure out,
well, that means up,

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:56.081
or that means open
or that means closed.

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:58.150
And what I'm gonna do
is show you some videos

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.185
that show what the patients
have been able to do.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.520
Of course, we were
very excited,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.989
and we asked Matt to do
a whole bunch of things

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:06.024
Here, he is gonna
draw a circle, then he's

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:09.161
gonna tell us what it's like to
be able to control something.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:12.464
So he's controlling that
cursor with his thoughts.

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:15.100
And this is actually the
world's first art, I think.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.003
Neurally drawn circle.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:21.106
Oh, man, I can't
put it into words.

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:24.042
It just...
I used my brain...

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.212
I just thought it.
I said, "Cursor,

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:28.981
go up to the top right"
and it did.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.317
And now I got control of it
all over the screen.

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:34.352
-It's wild.
-Actually, this is...

00:17:34.352 --> 00:17:37.322
He was using his consciousness
to manipulate his neurons,

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:40.159
but he actually didn't really
understand what was going on.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.060
Something happens
when you think,

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.429
and it manifests
as those spike changes,

00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:46.497
but what's really going on
is the mystery.

00:17:46.497 --> 00:17:49.067
So, he hadn't moved anything
in a long time,

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:51.837
so we were able to get
this prosthetic hand.

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:53.472
And it doesn't
really do anything,

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.641
it's just a motorized hand
that can open and close,

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:57.509
so we ran a brain command
into it,

00:17:57.509 --> 00:17:59.077
and told him tell us
what you're doing,

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:01.146
and imagine opening
and closing that hand.

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.481
And you're gonna
hear his reaction

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.483
to the first time
he's moved something

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:05.617
in a couple of years

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.319
because remember,
he's completely paralyzed.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.222
And you'll listen to
his strong reaction.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:12.591
Whoa, holy shit.

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:14.426
( audience laughing )

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:17.596
So, just if you missed that.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.699
Whoa, holy shit.

00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:26.204
Close.

00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:29.507
Nice. Open.

00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:32.410
Close.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.148
Not bad, man.
Not bad at all.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.783
He really became a star
by doing these things.

00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:40.752
Now, of course those aren't
very practical actions,

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:43.055
and what we really want
to do is enable people

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.756
to do things
that are meaningful,

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:47.292
and for people like Cathy,
who can't speak,

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.427
communication is
extremely important.

00:18:49.427 --> 00:18:52.297
So, my colleague Leigh Hochberg
and others in our group

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.766
have created...
If you can move a cursor,

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:57.102
you can choose
words on a screen.

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.271
Instead of using a keyboard
in which you have to move

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.207
a cursor all over the screen,
we made a radial keyboard

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.509
with word prediction,
and this is actually Cathy

00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:06.645
spelling out a sentence.
So just to show that

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:10.348
she can use this spelling
interface to convey messages.

00:19:10.348 --> 00:19:11.717
But we'd really like to see

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.418
something even
more sophisticated

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:15.153
to do things that you can't--
she can't do.

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.721
She can't do things
with her arms.

00:19:16.721 --> 00:19:19.191
So here, Cathy is
controlling a robot arm

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.491
and we're doing
something simple.

00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:22.394
We just elevated
these little foam balls

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:24.563
and told her to reach out
and grab them.

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:26.732
And because of our ability
to make some sense

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:29.567
of the way the arm is coded
and reaching space,

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:31.369
she was able to do that.

00:19:31.369 --> 00:19:34.305
So what we did is we said,
"Let's do something practical

00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:35.674
and meaningful for you."

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:38.543
And so we gave her
her morning coffee,

00:19:38.543 --> 00:19:40.578
and we said, "Okay, Cathy,
for the first time

00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:44.082
in 15 years you're gonna feed
yourself your morning coffee

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:46.017
and not have to rely
on another person

00:19:46.017 --> 00:19:47.652
to come in and do that."

00:19:47.652 --> 00:19:50.622
So, here she is with
the control of the robotic arm,

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:55.093
on her own taking her
first drink of coffee.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:57.662
We found out in the afternoon
she actually sometimes had

00:19:57.662 --> 00:19:59.664
Kahlua in the coffee as well.

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.299
( audience laughing )

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:04.469
Of course, they only use it
in a research setting so far.

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:07.205
What we want to do is make it
available all the time.

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:09.040
And in fact, what we
really want to do

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.743
and really strive to do
over the coming decades

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:14.613
is to be able to take
a person who can't move

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.548
and reanimate
their own muscles.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.551
To basically create
a physical nervous system

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.053
where their biological one
is irreparable.

00:20:22.053 --> 00:20:24.389
So here's an example of
what we're aiming to do.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.559
The idea here is that
there's an implanted array.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:30.128
It generates signals, it
comes down to something like

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:33.264
a smartpack on your belt
like a cell phone,

00:20:33.264 --> 00:20:36.034
that then communicates to
an electric nervous system

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:38.803
and it activates a stimulator
which then stimulates

00:20:38.803 --> 00:20:41.373
the nerves and causes
the muscles to activate.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:43.474
So it's what your nervous
system normally does,

00:20:43.474 --> 00:20:45.443
but it's all done with
physical components.

00:20:45.443 --> 00:20:48.113
And one of the next
important steps

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:51.749
is to create something that
is basically a smartphone

00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:54.619
inside the head, and
my colleague Arto Nurmikko

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:56.654
has created this device,
which is something

00:20:56.654 --> 00:20:58.856
that will allow us
to wirelessly transmit

00:20:58.856 --> 00:21:01.726
all of those complex
brain signals outside.

00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:04.329
And here in now
nice, bloodless surgery

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:08.366
done in a kitchen no less,
there's the implant.

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:11.102
The transmitter sits
underneath the skin

00:21:11.102 --> 00:21:13.338
and it transmits
all that information out.

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.039
And this is not
in humans yet,

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.607
but it will be
in the next coming years,

00:21:16.607 --> 00:21:18.476
but has been
tested in animals.

00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:20.512
And this is feasible now.

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:23.481
It has more sophistication than
what you have in your cell phone

00:21:23.481 --> 00:21:25.017
to be able to communicate,

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.018
be able to tell us
what's going on,

00:21:27.018 --> 00:21:29.020
and to get that information
to the outside.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.057
So, this is coming, the ability
to rewire the nervous system.

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:34.426
And I asked Cathy
to send me a note

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:36.828
about what does it mean...
What would she like to do again.

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.830
And so she sent me this note,
she typed it out:

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.165
"I would love to garden again.

00:21:41.165 --> 00:21:43.568
I really miss gardening,
canning and cooking.

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:46.238
I also wanted to be able
to hold a book with both hands,

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:47.638
or even a robot arm.

00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:50.341
I really hope someday
I'll be able to use my voice.

00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:51.710
I can handle paralysis,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.346
but lack of communication
is torture. Thank you."

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:58.116
So, I would say thanks to them,
these brave patients

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:00.752
and thank you. I think
I'll conclude with that.

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.522
( applause )
