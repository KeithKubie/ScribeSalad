00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.620
And welcome to the
Developer Show.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.044
Before we get to
the TLDR, I just

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:06.210
wanted to mention something.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.170
Some of you have
already noticed,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.740
we have this bar
at the bottom that

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.060
shows the topics in the show.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.575
And if you want,
you can just jump

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:13.450
right now to our discussion
on the Chrome Dev

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.060
Summit, which is fine.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.970
We'll still be here.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.470
All right.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.670
Let's start with a quick view
of what's happened recently

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.240
with the Google
Developer platform,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.381
also known as the TLDR.

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.630
Use containers to make your
development and deployment

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.740
simpler with the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.500
Google Container Engine and
Google Container Registry

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.250
recently got some
enhancements to give you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.500
more options in managing
container images,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.820
and running services at scale.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030
Learn to be a Senior Web
JDeveloper with a Nanodegree

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.145
program just
launched on Udacity.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.520
This course covers everything
from service worker and web

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520
components, to Gulp
and other tools.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.320
Ido is on the show today to
talk more about the program.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.778
IDO GREEN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:51.677
The minute I heard that Rich
was here, it was my pleasure.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Travel Time, one
of the most powerful features

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.110
from the consumer Google
Maps experiences is now

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.410
available in the
Google Maps API.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.310
So you can make your
location-based apps

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.250
even more relevant and
useful for your users.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.160
Tripping.com and Navagis
use Google Maps APIs

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.570
to improve UX and increase
revenue and traffic

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.910
by more than 2000% over
the past 12 months.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.530
Find out how you
can also go plaid

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.790
in this article written by
the Director of Engineering

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.450
at Tripping.com.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.810
A full-featured Open Source
sample Test Device Policy

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.250
Controller is now
available to help you test

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.840
your Android for Work feature.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.520
You can configure it for all
the Android for Work scenarios.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.560
So you can test your
feature on a single device

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.924
without having to redeploy
a policy each time.

00:01:35.924 --> 00:01:37.590
Rich was on the show
today to talk to us

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.839
about why this is so useful.

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:41.130
RICH HYNDMAN: Hoping to be
useful with de-complexifying

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.257
and/or simplifying
Android for Work.

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:45.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
you're off to a great start.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.880
The minimum purchase price
for apps and in-app products

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.800
on Google Play has been
reduced, giving developers

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.440
more flexibility to adapt their
pricing options to better suit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.920
local consumers in the more
than 190 countries where

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.200
Google Play available.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.770
The second edition
of the Secrets

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950
to App Success on
Google Play is now

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.380
available to help you discover
the useful features, tips,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.240
and best practices that will
help you grow a successful app

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.470
or game business on Google Play.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.510
New emulator support for
runtime permission checks, audio

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570
and resource
qualifiers for round.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.220
These are the awesome new
updates to the Android Wear SDK

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.130
for API 23, available now.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.290
Both the Chrome Dev Summit
and Android Dev Summit

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.541
happened here in Mountain
View, and they were awesome.

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.748
Don't worry if you weren't
able to make it in person.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.630
All the videos are
available online.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.110
I also managed to get some
time at the Chrome Dev Summit

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.105
this week with Darin
Fisher and Paul Irish.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.980
And we'll hear what
they have to say

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.520
about the future of the web
a little later in the show.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.240
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
this is The Developer Show.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.990
Bomb Squad grew revenue
by 140% per user

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.531
by using Player Analytics.

00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:59.780
Learn how to use Player
Analytics and Google Play Game

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.720
Services to find
success on Google

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.740
Play in this recent
article and video.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.494
Here's a look.

00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:06.310
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.910
-Before Player Analytics,
I was pretty much blind.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.100
I was just guessing what
my players were doing,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.640
and what was causing
them to spend,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.223
and where they're
spending their time.

00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:15.265
But I didn't really know.

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:17.639
When I started using the tools,
it was a very eye-opening

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.260
experience.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.050
I could suddenly see
the low-hanging fruit

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.720
where I could improve retention,
or improve monetization

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.416
on the game.

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:25.040
Player Analytics
showed me that players

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.800
were earning more than they
were spending on the game.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.570
So I was able to
re-balance my economy,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.040
and make a significant
positive impact on my revenue.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.930
I immediately saw 140% lift in
the average revenue per user,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.680
as well as a 67% lift in
average revenue per paying user.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.055
Player Analytics really helped
me to kind of open my eyes

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.513
and see what I was doing right,
and what I was doing wrong,

00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:45.330
and sort of correct
the ship to a point

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.977
where now it's
working financially.

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:47.560
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.780
Let's keep it rolling with
some more Android topics.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.363
Rich, you're on the show today
to talk about Android for Work.

00:03:52.363 --> 00:03:55.909
Tell us a little bit about these
Test Device Policy Controllers.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:56.700
Did I get it right?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.480
RICH HYNDMAN: You
did get it right.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.760
Test Device Policy Controller,
another one of those things

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.550
that need de-complexifying.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
De complexifying?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.100
RICH HYNDMAN:
De-complexifying, yes.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.510
That.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.650
So at this point we all
know what Android for Work

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.220
is, right?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.345
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Absolutely.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:06.730
RICH HYNDMAN: Go on.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Seriously.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.060
RICH HYNDMAN: Really?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.450
RICH HYNDMAN: OK, excellent.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.324
So with Android of Work,
you can-- damn you--

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:12.630
bring your own device to work.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.710
Or you can have
corporate-owned devices.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.010
In either situation,
and both situations,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.529
IT administrators are going
to be setting device policies

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.136
on your device, whether
the camera is enabled,

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:23.760
whether the device
has to be encrypted,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.055
which intents can fire,
that kind of thing.

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:28.055
So if you're building an
enterprise application,

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.230
you're going want to be able
to test all those things.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.090
But I imagine that it's
difficult in a production

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.720
environment when your IT
folks are deploying something

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.680
for production, and you want
to like, test this other thing.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.430
RICH HYNDMAN: Yep.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
how do you do that?

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.330
RICH HYNDMAN: If you have a
real Android for Work device,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.400
you can't use it
really for testing.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.650
Because you've only got one
set a policies set on it.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.850
So you want to get a test device
and put the Test Device Policy

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.860
Controller on it, which
is the thing we just

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.924
announced in Open Source.

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:52.090
And then you could set all
your own device policies.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.124
You can enable and disable
applications at will,

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:55.040
and test them all out.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.380
RICH HYNDMAN: The really
nice thing in Version 2

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.296
of the Test Device Policy
Controller is it now

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:01.930
supports corporate-owned
single-use devices as well,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.790
which maybe is slightly
complication as well.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.090
I don't know.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.280
It's like kiosk modes.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.990
So--

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
not complicated.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.900
RICH HYNDMAN: Hotel check-ins,
airplane flight boards,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.080
whatever it is,
single-use devices.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.774
And the new version
of Test DPC lets

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:16.690
you set up a device to
be a single-use device.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.909
It can be locked down, no
status bars, no buttons,

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.450
anything at the
bottom of the screen,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.211
and just single-application use.

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.251
Well we've got to get on
to talking about Chrome.

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:27.616
But I just want to mention,
nice watch you have there.

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:28.492
RICH HYNDMAN: Thank
you very much.

00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:29.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It
looks real good on you.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.190
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think
it's the right one.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.970
So let's talk about
the Chrome Dev Summit.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.516
It recently happened
here in Mountain View.

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:39.140
And we'll get to some interviews
in a little later in the show.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.515
But first, if you have no idea
of what I'm talking about,

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:44.972
here's a peek at what
went down at the event.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:46.410
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.690
-We're here down as
the Chrome Dev Summit,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.399
playing with the physical web
beacons and the cool things

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.440
that they're controlling.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.189
-Fancy photo wall.

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.035
-This is a photo wall.

00:05:55.035 --> 00:05:58.084
-Giving power to annoy people
at the Chrome Dev Summit.

00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:59.072
-Yeah.

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:00.060
-Right?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.585
You can make this more
annoying if you want to.

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:03.547
It's going to be--

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:04.521
-Like that?

00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.320
-Oh, voting wall.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.820
Voting wall.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.680
Let's check out the voting wall.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.150
You guys know this one, right?

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.940
You can thumb up, or you
can thumb down in real time.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.930
You can kind of be
somewhere in the middle.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.263
-Oh, that's real cool, actually.

00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:14.474
-Let's vote on some things.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.015
-It's a physical
web vending machine.

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:18.150
And basically that
means walk up to it,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.730
and interact with it without
selling an app whatsoever.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.650
So we'll choose KitKat.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.760
-And I don't have to put
in my credit card then?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.470
-Then you can just hit that
button as much as you want?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.460
-Interaction on demand.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.520
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Those
physical web devices

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.760
had no idea what was coming.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.800
So I that's a peek at
the Chrome Dev Summit.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.700
And that's the shirt
that I'm wearing.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.825
If you couldn't recognize
it, it's the web, iconified.

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:53.700
IDO GREEN: Beautiful.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's a great shirt.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.460
So we're celebrating Chrome
right now, just this moment.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.476
Tell us, how did the Dev
Summit go for developers

00:07:03.476 --> 00:07:04.789
and to the content overall?

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:05.830
Did you have a good time?

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.163
IDO GREEN: So it went very well.

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:08.840
It's actually pretty
amazing conference

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.580
to see how we are bringing
up extremely quality content.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.810
The web development environment,
actually pretty changed

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.570
completely in the
past 12 months.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.660
We're seeing a slew of new APIs.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.500
I think developers have
great capabilities.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.795
Some of-- just to
mention service workers,

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:30.560
push notification, device level,
activations, and many more.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.540
And these new APIs are
giving lots of powers

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.600
to developers to build
native-like web apps.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.810
One example that I'm
truly exciting about

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.960
is FlipKart Light,
which is actually

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.460
to see the future right now.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.210
And if you go there
you will see a web app

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.200
that is working very
fast, engaging and getting

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.630
all the benefits that you're
getting from a native app

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.670
to their users.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.925
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So yes, service
workers, progressive web apps,

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.300
bringing sort of the native
experience to the mobile web.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.650
These were huge themes at the
Chrome Dev Summit this year.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.691
And in fact, I got a little
time with some people

00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:04.754
on the ground to talk in more
depth about these themes.

00:08:04.754 --> 00:08:06.670
So Why don't we go to
that clip, and come back

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.920
and talk some more?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.856
Absolutely.

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:09.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.070
-Hi there.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.445
I'm hear with
Darin Fisher, who's

00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:14.930
the VP of Engineering
for Chrome.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.120
And you had a great
keynote this morning

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.370
at the Chrome Dev Summit.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.990
-Thank you.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.320
-There's a lot of really
great data in that keynote.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.610
It's 400 million monthly active
users on Chrome last year

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.700
at this time.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.680
And today you announced 800
million monthly mobile users

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.240
on Chrome.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.480
-There are a lot of users
on Chrome on mobile.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.460
And so working hard to make the
mobile web work great there.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.539
And it's challenging.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.770
The mobile web wasn't designed
for mobile originally.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.644
But more and more you
see developers creating

00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:42.760
great mobile experiences.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.870
And at Chrome,
we're just working

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.150
to help make that possible.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.670
And just a lot of
opportunity, a lot

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.930
of upside, when
people get it right.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.640
-That's great.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.265
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:50.764
-Absolutely.

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:51.960
-And check out the keynote.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.650
It's awesome.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.860
Paul Irish, who I
think all of you know.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.340
But if you don't, he's a product
manager on Chrome, working

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.675
on web tools and performance.

00:08:59.675 --> 00:09:00.530
Hi, Paul.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.120
-What's up?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.994
-I was hoping today we
could talk about RAIL.

00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:06.320
Why is load time not a good
measure of web performance?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.080
-The important thing
here is really just

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.560
like what is the user
perception of load.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.190
Like success really
is like, user

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.675
gets to that meaningful content.

00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:16.530
So that's what we're
really optimizing for.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.880
-So let's actually go
through the letters.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.150
That's L, so Load
time is at the end.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.070
-So I is idle.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.500
The user is not doing anything.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.230
But you, as a developer,
have a responsibility

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.900
to make sure that if
they do something,

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.390
the app's going
to be responsive.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.990
A is animation, this covers
like any visual animations,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.280
or even scrolling.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.614
These are the things that we
expect to happen at 60 FPS.

00:09:35.614 --> 00:09:37.030
So if you're doing
work, if you're

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.750
constructing these
animations on the fly,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.550
your work needs to be
16 milliseconds in order

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.430
for the user be like, ooh, that
feels like smooth and awesome.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.720
R is the last one.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.170
This is all about response.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.900
If I am basically like
hitting on a button, like I

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.850
need to see a result. You know?

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.410
I can't just like be waiting.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.190
And so we have goals around
how many milliseconds

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.190
is a reasonable amount
of time for that response

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.040
to happen, from touches
to scrolls to drags.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.430
Like each of these are
important interactions.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.645
And we need to consider
them individually.

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:09.144
-Awesome.

00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:10.052
Thanks, Paul.

00:10:10.052 --> 00:10:10.960
-Cool, you bet.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.870
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And that
was Darin Fisher and Paul

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.827
Irish at the Chrome Dev Summit.

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:17.160
Now let's talk about the
Senior Web Developer Nanodegree

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.950
with Ido.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.660
Ido, we had the Web
Developer Nanodegree.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.860
But we added a Senior.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.630
What did we add
with that Senior?

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.690
IDO GREEN: Right, so we wanted
to take you to the next level.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.231
So if you're already
a web developer,

00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:29.960
you know HTML, JavaScript, CSS.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.000
You really want to
tune your skills

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.130
and improve them and know how
to leverage the new APIs that we

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.700
have today on the web platform.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.010
This is the course to take.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.970
The web platform got
a slew of new APIs

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.510
that could really improve
your user's experience.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.430
We're talking about service
workers, offline apps,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.090
push notifications, device-level
access, and many more.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.500
And this is the best
place to actually learn

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.431
how to leverage them.

00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:55.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
it's a Udacity course.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.770
So if you just want
to get your feet wet,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.936
all the course materials
are available at no charge.

00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:00.364
IDO GREEN: That's the best part.

00:11:00.364 --> 00:11:01.150
RICH HYNDMAN: The best part?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.960
Didn't you get your hands
dirty with this one?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.668
IDO GREEN: I did.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.660
And actually I had the
honor to do the course

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.420
about improving your web forms.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.250
So if you want high
conversions on your web forms,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.330
take this course.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.380
RICH HYNDMAN: Everyone
wants high conversions

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.080
on their web forms.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.530
IDO GREEN: That's true.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.105
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Everybody does.

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:14.605
Indeed.

00:11:14.605 --> 00:11:16.159
IDO GREEN: That's why I did it.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well
you know what they say

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.550
that children are our future.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.590
Well every year students
around the world

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.870
participating in Google's
Student Ambassador Program,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.600
and quite a few of
them are developers.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.840
And many of them are taking an
interest in areas as complex

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.540
as the intersection of
government and technology.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.380
Derek Slater, are senior policy
correspondent and all around

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.200
good guy, recently
took some time

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.960
to hear from this next
generation of great developers

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.410
about what they're building now
and their views for the future.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.550
-I have in an app
that I've started

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.550
called Layover Delivery.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.570
It's like kind of like an
airport delivery service,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.861
where you can deliver like
food to different terminals.

00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:52.710
But there's strict
regulations with the FAA

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.345
and other things that like
the government-owned things

00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:55.970
at the airport.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.820
-What we're trying to do is
kind of build a data-driven app

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.080
to help organize health care.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.740
Because health care
is just so behind,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.880
when it could be done so
much more efficiently.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.930
Patients' information,
you're not-- it's

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.190
a huge barrier trying
to get that information.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.140
If you want to build
any sort of application

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.460
or develop using data
from these hospitals.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.590
Like, that's a big no-no.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.650
-The average age of senators
and representatives in the House

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.800
and stuff like that,
they're all lake definitely

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.210
above the age of like
30 and everything else.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.340
So I'm not sure that they
know the advancements

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.540
that we've made, and how
we use the internet now.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.300
Because it's changed a lot
from how they used it before.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.090
And if they try to block it
with policies like SOPA and all

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.779
that stuff, it's really
going to restrict the amount

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:43.070
of innovation that we can make.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.160
You know what I mean?

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.701
-Like general
oversight is all right.

00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.050
But having a government back
door, or some sort of access

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.530
that compromises the integrity
of a company or the way

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.696
that it's doing something
is a little bit difficult,

00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:55.110
or at least problematic.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.350
-I think government is
starting to finally realize

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.934
how the internet
works, and is finally

00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:00.183
listening to the right people.

00:13:00.183 --> 00:13:02.320
Like I think we've got a
long way from the internet

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.120
is not a big truck.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.744
It's just a series
of tubes, especially

00:13:04.744 --> 00:13:07.830
with the net neutrality
rules that are coming out.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.440
I'm really optimistic that the
internet can stay as a place

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.086
where people are free to develop
whatever they want, and yeah.

00:13:14.086 --> 00:13:15.336
That's what I'm excited about.

00:13:15.336 --> 00:13:16.070
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's been a while

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.541
since I've heard the dump truck
and series of tubes metaphor.

00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:21.670
So here's a question for you.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.500
What is your absurd
internet metaphor?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.709
RICH HYNDMAN: So, how about
salmon swimming upstream?

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:28.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.640
RICH HYNDMAN: A, that's what I
see when I see your tee-shirt.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.460
For some reason it
just looks like that.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.835
I mean I live in
the countryside.

00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:36.460
I'm so thankful if one of my
packets actually gets through.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.730
But salmon swimming upstream.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.521
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:40.520
That's the internet for Rich.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.020
IDO GREEN: I have
something similar.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.480
But bear with me.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.960
It's a mountain,
lots of snow on it.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.900
And fresh tracks,
like the shirt.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.790
RICH HYNDMAN:
Snowboard is a packet.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.615
IDO GREEN: Sort of.

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:52.460
RICH HYNDMAN: And if one
goes off the mountain,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.730
that's packet loss, that's like.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.521
IDO GREEN: Exactly.

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.520
RICH HYNDMAN: This works for me.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.818
If you think you can do
better than these guys,

00:13:58.818 --> 00:14:00.729
please do so in
the comments below.

00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:01.520
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.300
I'll see you next time right
here on the Developer Show.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.050
