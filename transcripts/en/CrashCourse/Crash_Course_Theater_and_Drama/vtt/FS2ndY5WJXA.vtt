Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater and remember that guy we said

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.580
we weren’t going to talk about in the last
episode?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.220
Well, we’re gonna talk about him for a while
now.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.510
I mean, of course, Yorick’s pal Shakespeare.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.280
And yes, Shakespeare actually wrote all of
Shakespeare’s plays, though sometimes he

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.310
had help.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.410
But hey, you don’t become the presiding
genius of English theatre without some assistance

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.470
Today, we’ll cover Shakespeare’s biography,
look at playwriting in Elizabethan England,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.640
and take on a genre our boy Bill helped invent:
the history play.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.590
So once more into the breach!

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.280
Who’s with me?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.199
Typical!

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:54.590
INTRO
So, who is this Shakespeare guy, anyway?

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.260
We first hear of him on April 26th… or 23rd…
or even a little earlier… in 1564, when

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.739
he’s baptized in the sleepy market town
of Stratford-upon-Avon.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.310
His father, John, was a glover, and did ok
for himself.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.859
John held a number of civic positions including
ale-taster of the borough, and eventually

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:19.030
mayor… an unorthodox political ascendancy,
but hey whatever works!

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.700
John’s wife, Mary, was the daughter of reasonably
wealthy landowners.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.700
And Shakespeare had four younger siblings
who lived to adulthood including one, Edmund,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.259
who was an actor but died at 27.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.439
At the age of six or seven, William starts
attending the Stratford Grammar School, where

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.689
much of the instruction was in Latin.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.799
He almost certainly read Plautus’s comedies
and Seneca’s tragedies.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.000
Some scholars think he leaves school at 13,
some think at 15.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.829
Maybe he works as a butcher; maybe he works
for his father.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.210
In 1582, he marries Anne Hathaway–NO THE
OTHER ANNE HATHAWAY–who is 8 years older

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.399
than him, and 6 months pregnant.

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.030
She gives birth to Susanna in 1583, and the
twins Judith and Hamnet a year and a half

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.260
later.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.499
Hamnet!

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.350
At some point after the birth of the twins,
Shakespeare moves to London.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.229
And no one knows why!

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.900
There’s one story about how he had to go
to London because he poached a deer?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.150
There are also rumors that he joins up with
traveling players.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.561
But we don’t really know anything more until
1592, when he’s a popular actor and the

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:27.879
author of several plays—and people are making
fun of him by calling him “Shake-scene.”

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.200
Harsh.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.659
Around this time, one of the twins, Hamnet,
dies at the age of 11.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.980
Hamnet!

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.430
And when the theaters closed due to the plague,
Shakespeare writes some long poems.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.319
When theaters reopen, he joins the Lord Chamberlain’s
Men as an actor, a playwright, and a shareholder.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.480
By 1597, Shakespeare has made enough money
to buy the second fanciest place in Stratford-upon-Avon,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.819
In 1611, he retires to Stratford proper; and
again, no one knows why.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.090
And in 1616, at the age of 52, he dies.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.250
His anti-grave robbing epitaph reads: Good
friend, for Jesus’ sake forbear,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.849
To dig the dust enclosed here.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.110
Blest be the man that spares these stones,
And cursed be he that moves my bones.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.879
So, how did Shakespeare become a playwright?

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.250
It’s hard to say for sure, but traveling
players performed frequently in Stratford

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.250
when he was a kid.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.450
If he really did join a traveling company
during his lost years, it would have exposed

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.820
him to all sorts of plays, and the three or
four production techniques that English theater

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.820
had at the time.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.799
Playwriting wasn’t a prestigious occupation
in Elizabethan England.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.150
A lot of plays were written in these decades
as there was a hunger for novelty.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.360
Established theaters were still a new thing,
and these companies had no repertory of classics

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.610
to fall back on.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.680
So each company required new plays every couple
of weeks.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.370
Writing plays was often a group effort, and
works from the beginning and end of Shakespeare’s

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.689
career were written this way... more collaboratively.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.299
Though it had the potential to make a lot
of money, many playwrights often depended

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.780
on side jobs or patronage.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.709
Shakespeare made his money not so much as
a writer, but as a shareholder in the company.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.720
He definitely didn’t make his cash in royalties.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.700
Most plays weren’t even published, and most
of the ones that were appeared in cheap quartos—a

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.420
name for booklets made up of pieces of paper
printed on eight sides and folded up to become

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.630
four double-sided pages.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.690
Many of these quarto publications were based
on pirated copies and bad memories and are

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.050
full of error or variation, though some are
accurate.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.360
Occasionally, several different versions of
a play would get published, like an early

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.150
quarto of “Hamlet” that reads: “To be,
or not to be,/ There’s the point.”

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.040
I know, Yorick.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.450
These quartos were usually published anonymously,
and even if an author’s name did appear,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.750
he didn’t receive any money from them.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.610
Copyright wouldn’t be invented for about
another hundred years, by the way.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.940
And yeah, any playwright of this era is definitely
a “he”.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.010
In 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s
death, two fellow actors in the King’s Men,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.420
John Heminges and Henry Condell, decided to
collect and publish Shakespeare’s works

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.500
in an authoritative edition, to honor their
friend.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.910
Their luxury volume, known as the First Folio,
included 36 plays organized as Comedies, Histories,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.940
and Tragedies.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.260
It left out Two Noble Kinsmen and Pericles,
which are common now, as well as Cardenio,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.280
the one Shakespeare play that’s definitely
lost.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.570
We’ll start with the histories because they
were some of the earliest plays Shakespeare

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.720
wrote: King John, Richard II, the two Henry
IVs, Henry V, the three Henry VIs and Richard

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.790
III.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.500
Henry VIII was written a lot later.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.290
With the exception of King John and Edward
III, the rest of these plays describe the

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:00.870
rise of the Tudors, the royal house of Elizabeth
I, queen during the early years of Shakespeare’s

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.870
career.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.120
Why are these “history plays,” but not
Julius Caesar or Macbeth or Cymbeline?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.530
Well, these distinctions are fuzzy.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.160
They were created by the editors of the First
Folio, not Shakespeare himself.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.310
But as scholar Lily Campbell puts it: “Tragedy
is concerned with the doings of men which

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:26.220
in philosophy are discussed under ethics;
history with the doings of men which in philosophy

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.340
are discussed under politics.”

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.310
So Richard II is a history because it’s
about Richard’s eventual defeat by Bolingbroke,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.300
but Macbeth is a tragedy because it’s about
Macbeth’s personal conflicts.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.960
By the way, this isn’t really a theater.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.250
So I’m perfectly comfortable saying Macbeth.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.010
I’m no longer perfectly comfortable saying
Macbeth.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.050
What was the point of history plays?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.480
Well, a straightforward history play is a
patriotic exercise that celebrates past greatness

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.260
and commiserates over past suffering, without
stopping to question God’s providence.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.970
History plays were designed to keep people
in line: Thomas Heywood wrote in the 1612

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.410
“An Apology for Actors,” that these plays
“are writ with this ayme… to teach their

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.980
subjects obedience to their king, to shew
the people the untimely ends of such as have

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.500
moved tumults, commotions, and insurrections,
to present them with the flourishing estate

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.110
of such as live in obedience, exhorting them
to allegiance.”

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.200
basically, when it comes to tumults and insurrections,
don’t start none, won’t be none.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.490
But Shakespeare isn’t that straightforward.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.610
A couple of his plays are about men who usurp
the throne from kings and then become kings

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.170
themselves, so his works are hardly a wholesale
condemnation of tumult, or a rubber stamp

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.130
on the divine right of kings.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.900
Early critics claimed that he upheld the Tudor
myth, but later ones have argued that he’s

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.280
up to something more subversive.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.420
For an example, let’s look at one of his
best-known history plays, “Richard III.”

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.100
in the Thoughtbubble:
Edward IV is back on the throne after putting

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.540
down a rebellion.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.360
His little brother Richard, aka, “that foul
bunchback’d toad,” isn’t psyched about

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360
it.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.620
Richard contrives to have his other brother,
Clarence, sent to the Tower of London and

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:24.330
then seduces Lady Anne, even though he murdered
her father and her brother… and she knows

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.330
it.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.240
Richard has Clarence drowned in a large cask
of wine, which helps push Edward IV into an

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.340
early grave.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.459
Edward’s sons will succeed him, though,
so Richard has more murdering to do!

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:42.050
After arranging to have a bunch of people
executed, Richard has the two princes held

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.069
in the Tower.

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:48.139
He tries to convince the people that the princes
are illegitimate and he is the rightful heir

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:49.500
to the throne.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.829
The other lords more or less go for it, but
just to be sure, Richard has the princes murdered

00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:55.829
anyway.

00:08:55.829 --> 00:09:00.129
Now that he’s king, Richard poisons his
wife so he can make a more dynastically savvy

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:01.129
marriage.

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.269
But all this villainy starts to catch up with
him, and rebellions break out.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:10.209
One of them is led by Richmond who—spoiler
alert—will become Henry VII.

00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:15.450
On the battlefield, Richard is haunted by
his victims, famously offers his kingdom for

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:23.069
a horse, and then dies, with Richmond announcing:
“Now civil wounds are stopped; peace lives

00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:24.069
again.

00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:27.970
/ That she may long live here, God say ‘Amen.’”

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.480
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.319
So a happy ending!

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:33.670
Unless you’re Richard.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.600
Or one of the many people that he murdered.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.480
It’s easy enough to read this play as rah-rah
Tudor propaganda.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480
Boo Richard!

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.670
Yay Richmond!

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:47.110
But while the play shows Richard as a tyrant
and a usurper, it isn’t a wholly negative

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.110
portrayal.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.870
Shakespeare’s Richard is a genius and a
charmer… and a villain and a killer.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:58.089
So while the historians were busy confirming
his wickedness, Shakespeare also shows him

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:00.110
as attractive and theatrical.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:06.889
He’s the character you can’t stop watching
and the one that great actors want to play.

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:11.639
Also, quick aside, people used to accuse Shakespeare
of making up the fact that Richard had a hunchback

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:16.660
just to make him seem extra evil, but a few
years ago they found Richard’s bones in

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.710
a parking lot—and it turns out while he
may not have been a full on hunchback, he

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.710
did have scoliosis.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.709
While we don’t know all the circumstances
of where and when and how Shakespeare became

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:32.089
a writer, his early work shows him taking
the straightforward form of the chronicle

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:35.670
play and molding it into something more exciting
and ambitious.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:42.420
He added breathtaking poetry, penetrating
insight and fun scenes of people being killed.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.089
In wine.

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:48.900
Next time we’ll look at how those scenes
were probably acted, and we’ll discuss Shakespeare’s

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900
tragedies.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:11:25.109
But until then… curtain!
