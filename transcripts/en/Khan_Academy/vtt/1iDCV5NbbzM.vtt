00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:01.471
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:04.117
Welcome to the last and strangest part

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:07.721
of the irregular verb,
the truly irregular.

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.597
Yes friends, here I have
compiled all the weirdest,

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:14.360
all of the wooliest, all
the eeriest and spookiest

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.532
forms of verbs that don't otherwise

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:18.876
fall into other categories.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:23.132
So we can't say that they
end with a changed -ed,

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:25.675
we can't say that they end with an -en,

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.581
and we can't say that
there's a vowel shift.

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:30.309
We've already covered those.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.498
This is the time for the weird stuff.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.702
First up, -ught.

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:36.556
Huh, what a strange collection of letters

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.239
that is to be found in English.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.333
So we take a word like teach,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.962
and in the past tense it's taught.

00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:50.000
Likewise, catch becomes caught.

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:55.568
And bring becomes brought.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.403
Yes, that's really strange.

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:03.962
There are only a couple of
words that behave that way.

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:05.451
It's also pretty weird and pretty rare

00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.016
for there to be a vowel shift
from the present to the past,

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.914
and also a "d" sound.

00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:13.093
So for example we take the word flee,

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.671
which means to run away,
and in the past it's fled.

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:18.416
Likewise in the present, we say say,

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.956
and in the past, we say said.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:25.275
So that "a" becomes "ai",
and the "ee" becomes "e",

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.336
and it's this weird vowel
shift that's also followed up

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.115
by a "d" sound.

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:35.370
There are some words for
whom time does not exist.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.786
These are verbs for whom the present tense

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:39.016
is the same as the past tense.

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:40.906
Prepare to have your mind blown.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.346
The past tense of bet is bet.

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:45.776
The past tense of set is set.

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:49.646
The past tense of hurt is hurt.

00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:50.629
Yeah, it's weird.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.716
Finally, there are some helper verbs,

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:57.426
or auxiliary verbs called
models, that are super weird,

00:01:57.426 --> 00:01:59.676
and have these properties
that aren't repeated

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:01.326
anywhere else in English.

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.946
So present tense can
becomes past tense could.

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:07.336
I can stand on my head,

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.436
or I could stand on my
head when I was five.

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:12.366
May becomes might in the past.

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.476
Shall becomes should.

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.440
And will becomes would.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.676
And what's super weird about these L's

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:27.766
in could, should, or would,

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:28.915
is listen to me saying them!

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.556
You don't pronounce the L's,

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.066
and this is the only place in English

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:34.166
where that silent L shows up.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.186
It's so strange!

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:36.256
Ah, I love it!

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.836
These are the irregular verbs.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:43.016
And these, in fact, are the
most irregular of the irregular.

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:46.766
If you can master these, you
will be a grammar champion.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.346
And I believe in you because
you can learn anything.

00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:51.266
David, out.
