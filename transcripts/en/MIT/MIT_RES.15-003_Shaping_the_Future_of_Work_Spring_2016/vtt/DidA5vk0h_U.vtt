00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.100
Today I want to talk
about the importance

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.150
of the basic education
system, and the theme

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
is going to be that it's a
necessary, but not sufficient

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.450
strategy, for education
for the future.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.240
We're all familiar with
the basic education model.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.730
We start in kindergarten
and go through grade school

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.870
through high school.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.560
Hopefully go on to a two-
or a four-year college

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.240
and maybe even to
graduate school.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.930
Then we enter the labor force
and we start our working career

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.570
after we complete our education.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.330
Well that model no longer works.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.230
Today, we have to think
about lifelong learning

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.250
because technologies
are changing,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.440
the job market is changing
in unpredictable ways,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.220
and new ways of
working are going

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.890
to continue to come along.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.220
They're going to require
us to refresh our skills.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.860
As this graph shows,
the evidence is clear.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.440
High school dropouts
are really doomed

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.470
to a lifetime of poverty wages.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.220
On average they earn
about $24,000 a year.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.850
High school graduates get
to about $34,000 a year,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.210
and college graduates
get to about $55,000

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.880
a year average income.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.940
So the key lesson of this
graph is, by all means,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.180
every one must
finish high school

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.750
and hopefully go beyond that.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.080
But you could say the same thing
for high school graduation.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.030
College still pays off.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.640
This graph shows the
difference in median earnings

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.120
of high school and
college graduates,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.690
and you'll see that it's
been growing over time.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.310
That's both for
men and for women.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.250
The gap between high school
and the college degree earnings

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.340
has grown, and so there's
increasing returns to college

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.430
even given the increased
cost of college.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.470
This graph shows that adjusting
for the increased cost,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.400
that gap is still growing
and the increase in returns

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.280
to college, particularly
since around 1980,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.900
have been growing by
very, very large numbers.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.650
And so the message here is
that, yes, college is expensive,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.980
but we've got to be careful
not to underestimate its value.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.970
At the same time, it's
important to recognize

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.300
that there's wide variation
in the earnings of college

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.040
graduates.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.730
So it's very important to
be careful to choose when,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.260
where, and what kind
of organization,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.620
what kind of
institution you choose

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.970
to get your education at.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.080
Ending your education and
then entering the workforce

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.030
was a model that
worked in the past,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.140
but it's not going to
work in the future.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.640
So let's look more
carefully at how

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.550
we're going to move through
a model of lifelong learning

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.350
in the future.
