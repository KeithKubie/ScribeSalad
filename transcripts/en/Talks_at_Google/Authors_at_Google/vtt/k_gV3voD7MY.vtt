00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:04.260
MANG: Good morning, my
friends and those fans

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.960
watching on YouTube.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.210
I'm so delighted today to
welcome my friend, and my dear

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.340
brother, Jinpa-- Thupten Jimpa.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.210
Well, most of you know
Jinpa from watching him

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.450
being next to the Dalai Lama.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.660
Jinpa is, and has
been, the Dalai Lama's

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.460
principal English
translator since 1985.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.070
Right?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.063
Yeah, back when
even I was young.

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.060
In that role, Jinpa serves as
a bridge between languages.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.660
He's bridging
Tibetan and English.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.600
And he has been in that role
in other instances, as well,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.770
translating many of
the Dalai Lama's books.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.080
However, he's beyond that.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.640
He's not just the Dalai
Lama's main translator.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.870
He is an eminent scholar
in his own right.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.360
He is the president of the
Institute of Tibetan Classics.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.640
He is a chairman
of Mind and Life.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.690
And he's a visiting scholar
at Stanford University.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.900
And in that capacity, he created
the Compassion Cultivation

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.220
Training program,
the CCTV program.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.360
And overall, he is one of
the most eminent scholars

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.490
in the world, on the
field of compassion.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.770
So in that sense, Jinpa
serves as another bridge.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.790
Jinpa is bridging some of
the most advanced teachings

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.610
in Tibetan Buddhism into the
modern world, to our world.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020
He's translating the
teachings in words

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.690
that even I can understand.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.550
So that's just the
service he's providing.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.150
In addition to that, having
known Jinpa for a while,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.880
I can tell you--
in person, he is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.450
just as you expect him to be.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.320
Maybe better.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.480
He is kind.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080
He's wise.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.360
He's very gentle.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.540
And he's too modest to tell you
this, so I'm going to tell you.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.960
He is the model of
embodiment of compassion.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.070
He's a model of what it's
like to use compression

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.430
to transform your life.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.020
And so, he's here to talk
about his latest book,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.010
"A Fearless Heart."

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.570
And with that, my friends,
please welcome my dear friend

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.160
Thupten Jinpa.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.730
THUPTEN JINPA: Thank you,
Mang, for your very warm words

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.290
of welcome as well
as introducing me.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.500
And good morning.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.930
Thank you for coming and sharing
this morning brief moment

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.070
with me.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.780
And I realized that,
actually, a large part of you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.930
are trainees or instructors of
Search Inside Yourself, which

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.000
is a program that
Mang developed.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.420
And based on that
program, Mang also

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.520
wrote a very successful book
that has been internationally

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.190
received so well.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.550
And I'm delighted to be
spending this morning

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.310
with, particularly, the
instructors of Search Inside

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.680
Yourself, which I see as
a powerful and beautiful

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.610
combination of true great
insights of our time.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.330
One is mindfulness.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.168
And the other one is
emotional intelligence.

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:38.915
And I take my hat
off to all of you

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:41.990
who have dedicated teaching
this and spreading this

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.250
to the larger world.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.190
It's also a joy for me to
be able to say a few words

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.360
on a topic that I'm personally
very passionate about,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.690
compassion.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.440
And particularly at
this place, Google,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.230
which, over the
last decade or so,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.150
has increasingly become
very important presence

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.020
in everybody's lives.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.090
And that's a fact.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.839
And so to be able to say
a few words on compassion

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.500
on the campus of Google has
a special meaning for me,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.670
because I see one of the very
important aspects of compassion

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.780
is the universal
global dimension,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.890
just as Google has this very
universal and global presence.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.360
I see compassion as
probably one of the most,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.590
if not the most, important place
in the interface of individuals

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.980
interacting with
society, individuals

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.260
acting with each
other, and cultures

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.920
and societies and communities
interacting with each other.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.590
And I genuinely believe that the
time for compassion has come.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.370
In some ways, the
realization of the importance

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.590
of compassion in
our society and time

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.310
has really been forced upon us.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.010
And there are powerful
forces in our time

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.120
which are bringing the various
cultures and communities

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.920
of the world closer.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.100
It's a cliche to say
that we are living

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.070
in a truly globalized world.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.840
In the old days,
there wasn't much cost

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.250
to having a of world
that is parochial,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.540
where you have a
slightly [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.630
sense of the importance of
your own version of history

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.020
and your own version of how
to structure a good society.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.520
But now we're living in a time
where even these ideas, which

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.220
may seem, you know, part of
an individual's kind of bias,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.240
have important implications
in how we relate to others

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.380
and how we interacted
with each other.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.980
And in this kind of world
where, increasingly, we

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.870
are seeing through this
very close encounters

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.750
between cultures and ideologies
and religions and ethnicities,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.870
we are beginning to see
pressures building up.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.970
So then the question
is, how do we

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.360
equip ourselves to be in a world
where that kind of pressure's

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.520
brought to bear
on a daily basis?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.530
And particularly
in the West, you

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.195
know, unlike some other
parts of the world,

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:38.440
western countries in
general-- and particularly

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.050
in North America,
like Canada and US--

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.260
are truly multiracial,
multiethnic, multireligious,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.420
multicultural communities.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.360
You know, we live in a time
and a world in our society

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.380
where, on a daily basis,
we interact with people

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.900
from completely different
background, people who look

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.940
differently, even physically.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.350
So I think North America, as
a result of this experience,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.910
probably has something to offer
to the larger part of the world

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.380
where people are struggling.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.480
You know, we saw part
of that in France,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.500
where there's a substantial
minority of people.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.520
And, you know,
France as a society

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.280
is struggling to incorporate
that element of diversity

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280
within there.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.470
So I think these kind of
pressures are being built.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.540
And also, His Holiness
often reminds us

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.150
that one of the plus
side of the growing

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.620
environmental degradation
is that it is reminding us

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.100
that we're living in one world.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.170
We may have
different ideologies,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.900
different national
policies, national interest,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.500
but environment doesn't care.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.060
You know, when things go
at the environmental level,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.190
it doesn't care how
rich your country is,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.350
how powerful your country is.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.350
The impact of
environmental degradation

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.940
is going to be felt everywhere.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.870
So that, also, is
reminding us that we

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.540
are in this all together.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.680
So in this kind
of age, there are

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.340
pressures coming from
the societal structures

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.910
and changes, which is
really forcing us to come up

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.240
with a new way of seeing
the world, new way of being

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.960
in the world, a new way
of thinking about others

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.170
and ourselves.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.910
And in this area,
I genuinely believe

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.880
the message of compassion
has a powerful role to play.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.250
Now one could say, yes,
but compassion is something

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.470
that we humans have been
talking about and thinking

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.390
about for a long time.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.470
If you look at all
the great teachings

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.980
of the religious traditions
going back to 3,000 years,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.460
compassion is really at the
center of the ethical teachings

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.960
of these great traditions.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.620
So the religions have been
teaching us about compassion

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.070
for all these years.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.560
What is so different now?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.960
You know, what makes
you think, or what

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.160
makes me think that that
message of compassion

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.630
is now going to be taken
more seriously when

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.280
it has been not taken that
seriously for all these years?

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.690
And here, I think
the new science that

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.560
is emerging that has to
do with understanding

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.940
empathy, understanding
compassion, understanding

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.840
the role of altruism
in development

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.360
of human behavior
and human evolution,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.320
I think is making a difference.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.420
Because in the past, we
have viewed and related

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.180
to qualities like
compassion and altruism

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.380
as part of the religious values,
something that we ought to do.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.650
And when relegate these
values to something

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.730
that we ought to do, and part
of our moral value system,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.140
then one of the interesting
thing about that

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.640
is that our relationship
with these qualities

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.220
acquire a flavor that
brings in a guilt.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.720
When we think about
these qualities,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.690
when we see, then,
the need in the world,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.170
and when we are not able
to act out of compassion,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.340
we feel guilty.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.710
And guilt leaves a kind of
rather sour taste in our mind.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.290
Because nobody wants to
feel bad about themselves,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.810
then we tend to instinctively
learn to avoid, and even

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.900
instinctively turn our gaze.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.200
And that is a dynamic
that we've develop.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.580
But now, with a new
science, we're increasingly

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.570
realizing, actually,
these qualities

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.895
are really part of who we are.

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:33.300
They're a part of
our natural makeup.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.330
I mean, although
historically, it

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.830
was the religious
traditions that really

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.980
took the responsibility
of spreading

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.040
the message of compassion and
love, [INAUDIBLE] of concern

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.100
for others' well
being and so on.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.680
But in themselves, as His
Holiness often reminds us,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.060
in themselves they're completely
independent of religion.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.370
And now there are new research
showing that, in fact, you

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.210
know, qualities like compassion
and empathy are, in fact,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.640
inborn.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.040
Children as young
as six months old,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.490
through some very, very
ingenious experiments

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.240
that were done by
some psychologist,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.810
demonstrate powerful
preference to helping behavior,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.770
as opposed to
hindering behavior.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.250
There's a beautiful,
actually, experiment,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.640
which is probably one YouTube.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.220
You can see it shows
children watching

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.030
a video where there's a kind
of a cartoon, two characters.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.340
And there's a slope.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.140
And these cartoon characters
have been animated.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.220
So there are images
of eyes and mouth

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.815
so that children can relate
to them as being, you know,

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:38.950
sentient.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.230
So one object tries to go up.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.980
And it keeps falling down.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.922
And it goes up.

00:11:43.922 --> 00:11:46.380
In one scene, there's another
object that comes from behind

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.930
and gives it a push to help it.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.290
In another scene, the
same thing goes on,

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.710
but now this time, another
object comes from the top

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.130
and actually pushes it back,
so that it obstructs it.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.520
And children show,
inevitably, preference

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.310
for the helping behavior.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.530
And then, when they are given
the choice to choose toys--

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.310
and they did that with
all sorts of variations

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.810
of colors and shapes.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.520
And they always choose
the one that helps.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.650
So these kind of bias
towards helping behavior

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.230
is built in us very,
very early in our age.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.150
And then some
interesting experiments

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.160
that shows that children about
the age of 14 months, they

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.220
instinctively engage
in helping behavior.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.310
And this was done by a team
of two German scientist

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.850
from Max Planck Institute,
where one of the experiments

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.520
involve the experimenter
trying to dry clothes

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.020
on a clothesline, and
drops accidentally

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.810
one of the clothes pin, and
pretends can't reach it.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.010
And the child,
about 14 months old,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.680
looks, and then
immediately gets up--

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.050
and even though the
child may be playing,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.270
gets up and picks it up
and give it to the person.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.320
And they found out
that, actually, children

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.220
do this naturally
and instinctively.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.080
But if you reward them,
they don't do it again.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.030
So it's interesting.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.780
And there's some important
message here for the parents

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.380
because I know in the West,
it's quite well widespread

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.570
that parents give money to
the children to do the chores.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.740
So I think there's
some important lesson

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.600
for the parents here.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.750
I resisted that.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.520
And I managed to
convince my wife

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.520
that when children
were getting older,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.860
we wanted them to do the chores.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.870
But I said we will give
them weekly allowance.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.710
But there shouldn't
be any direct link

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.270
between the money they receive
and the chores they do.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.160
And I was so happy to see
that in those experiment

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.280
and felt that, OK.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.950
My intuition was right.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.100
So I think there all these
very, very cool findings

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.090
coming from science
that are increasingly

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.020
showing that actually
compassion is

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.500
part of our natural instinct.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.040
It's actually part of
our natural makeup.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.740
And furthermore, there
are more and more

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.460
research findings showing
that, in fact, compassion

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.190
is good for us.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.700
His Holiness often
says that many people

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.785
feel that when they
listen to compassion,

00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:11.960
and they think about compassion,
and they think about kindness,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.300
many people feel
that to do compassion

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.840
and to act out of compassion
is good for someone

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.590
else-- the recipient--
and not necessarily

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.120
good for themselves.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.350
But he says that, actually,
the first beneficiary

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.000
of your experience of
compassion is you, yourself.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.100
Because your
compassionate act actually

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.140
brings about a material
benefit to the other

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.200
is dependent on many
factors, including

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.490
receptivity on the part of the
recipient, their state of mind.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.530
And sometimes you may
have the best intention.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.360
But what you do may
not be the right thing

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.100
to do in the right situation.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.560
But when you feel compassion,
and reach out to someone,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.586
at that moment you, yourself,
have gained the benefit

00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:54.710
of experiencing compassion.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.410
In fact, in my book I talk
quite a bit about this.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.740
And I refer to
compassion as "the best

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.010
kept secret of happiness."

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.910
And that's one of the
paradoxes of compassion,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.390
as well as happiness.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.360
Because when we think
about compassion,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.450
we, in a common sense or
intuitive kind of sense,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.950
would say, OK.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.730
Yes, when we feel compassion,
we are opening our heart.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.500
We are making room in our heart
for someone else's problem

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.290
and situation.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.740
It's a good thing to do.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.060
But it's not
necessarily a way to joy

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.760
because one would, in fact,
expect additional misery

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.910
because you are
taking on more problem

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.110
than you, yourself, have.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.340
But it turns out it's the
exact opposite, you know,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.814
when we experience compassion.

00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:45.230
And studies have
shown that people

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.690
who act out of kindness--
in fact, the psychologists

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.860
refer to it as
"the helpers high."

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.180
There's a chemical in the brain,
associated with the feeling

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.090
euphoria, gets activated.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.050
And so that's sort of
an interesting paradox

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.539
because one would expect more
misery and distress, you know,

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:05.830
when you act out of compassion.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.510
But exact opposite happens.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.970
But if you think about
it, it's not really

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.230
that much of a
paradox because one

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.450
of the things about the
experience of compassion

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.790
and feeling of compassion
is, at that moment,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.600
you feel deeply connected
with someone in front of you.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.150
And that powerful
sense of connection

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.440
is very important part of human
aspiration and human need.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.740
We are social creatures.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.870
And our happiness
and our suffering

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.100
really is determined by the
quality of relationships

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.220
that we have with others.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.840
There might be few,
you know, hermits.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.820
Maybe one in a
billion, you know,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.900
who will be able to be
in a total state of joy

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.860
alone, without needing
that interaction

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.900
with a fellow human at the
level of heart connection.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.310
But that might be
one in a billion.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.695
But for most of us, in
our experience of joy

00:17:03.695 --> 00:17:06.300
and our experience of
suffering and pain,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.940
really comes from the
quality of relationship

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.069
that we have with important
people in our life-- you know,

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.869
colleagues at work and
other people that we have

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.619
to interact on a daily basis.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.810
So when you
experience compassion,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.069
you really feel
connected to someone.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.480
And in that state,
basically, one

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.980
of the important
things that happens

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.360
is that you learn
to forget yourself.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.030
And it's this letting go
of your sense of self,

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.700
or self-awareness, that really
opens the space for joy.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.190
So now take a step back and
think about all the times

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.590
when you felt most happy.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.060
I bet the common
denominator is that ability

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.047
to forget yourself.

00:17:52.047 --> 00:17:53.380
That's the paradox of happiness.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.350
So if you really
want a true joy,

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.860
you have to let go of your
own self-consciousness.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.890
And there's nothing more
powerful than the experience

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.840
of compassion to make
that possible for you.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.370
So I think that that's probably
the reason why compassion

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.280
is the key to happiness.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.060
Another important
benefit of compassion

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.345
is that, because of
this powerful dimension

00:18:17.345 --> 00:18:20.410
of being able to identify and
connect with someone in front

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.460
of you, compassion is the best
buffer against the problem

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.970
of loneliness.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.070
And loneliness is
increasingly becoming

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.780
an issue in contemporary
society because we tend

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.520
to live a more nuclear life.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.690
And many of us live
also kind of alone.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.190
And in that situation,
if you don't

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.970
learn to be able to connect
with someone important person

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.870
in your life at a deeper
level, whether it's

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.750
being part of a
community, or having

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.340
a healthy relationship, or
strong family connections,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.470
loneliness is becoming an issue.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:58.070
There was a rather sad data that
came out couple of years ago,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.520
which showed that in the United
States, one in five people

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.660
report not having any person
in their life that they

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.630
can confide in.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.910
Now that's terrifying.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.180
I mean, we humans are not
meant to be living like this.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.940
So I think here,
again, compassion

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.190
is really the best buffer
against that kind of danger

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.020
of loneliness.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.510
And loneliness has real
impact on your own longevity.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:28.480
There were studies showing, done
on old age homes, where people,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.600
you know, who report frequent
experience of loneliness.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.510
And it really correlates very
strongly with early death.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.630
So it is costly.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:40.290
It's costly.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.350
I don't think we were even,
evolutionary-speaking,

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.540
meant to be living like this.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.250
And another important
fact about compassion

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.735
is that when you're able to
experience compassion, and act

00:19:52.735 --> 00:19:58.270
out of kindness, it
really creates a sense

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.250
of purpose in your life.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.670
And there's nothing like
feeling that you matter,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.500
whether it is at workplace, or
whether it's at your family,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.980
whether it is in your
relationship with your friends.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.210
When you know that
you matter, it

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.410
gives you a sense of purpose.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.350
And sense of purpose
is, again, being

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.950
found as one of the
most important factors

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.430
in personal happiness.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.720
And also there's a correlation
between longevity and sense

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.040
of purpose, as well.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.910
So in all of these
areas, compassion really

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.760
does the trick.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.080
And furthermore,
you know, for me--

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.410
someone who grew
up as a Buddhist

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.550
monk in the traditional Tibetan
Buddhist society-- you know,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.960
living a moral and
ethical life is something

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.940
that is part of my aspiration.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.360
And compassion provides
us a powerful anchor

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.680
of our personal ethics.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.850
It provides us moral compass.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.850
So when confronted
by a situation where

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.340
you are in a moral dilemma,
the best question to ask is,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.900
what is the most compassionate
thing to do here?

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.430
So it really gives you a
kind of a moral compass which

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.580
really allows you to
be clear, you know,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.410
what the priorities are.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.710
And if the situation calls
for a tough, firm action,

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.280
it needs a fierce
compassionate response.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.180
You know, compassion
sometimes is

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.770
misunderstood as just giving
in and just bowing down.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.450
That's not really the case.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.200
What compression does
demand in a situation

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.470
is that you never
lose sight of the fact

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.280
that the other person,
too, is another human being

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.340
just like me, who
wishes to seek happiness

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.170
and who wishes to
overcome suffering.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.850
That much is really demanded
by taking compassion

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.760
as your main moral ground
to respond to a situation.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.050
But if the situation calls
for a much tougher stand,

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.570
you can do it.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.630
I mean, if you look at
people like Nelson Mandela

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:04.660
and Mother Theresa and His
Holiness, the Dalai Lama,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.800
these people were
not weak individuals.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.350
They were powerful individuals,
deeply compassionate,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.570
but quite powerful.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.800
And deeply committed
to what they do

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.390
and very strong in
their opposition

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.110
to injustice-- particularly
social injustice.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:26.870
So sometimes we tend to mistake
compassion for kind of meekness

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.290
and just giving in.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.190
And that's something that
we have to bear in mind.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.840
So when you think
about all of this,

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.870
and also when you combine
this understanding

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.410
with the realization
that, actually,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.440
compassion is part of
our natural instinct.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.200
That's one of the
beauty of compassion.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.270
I mean, if you compare
compassion to mindfulness,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:52.250
mindfulness is something
that you have to cultivate.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.570
You know, I think we
are naturally equipped

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.670
with a mind that
is very distracted.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.620
There was a study that
shows that almost 50%

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.150
of the time, our
mind is wandering

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.910
even if we are supposed to
be focusing on something.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.120
That was a study that
came out from Harvard.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.510
So mindfulness is something that
we have to actually cultivate,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.580
an acquired skill.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.420
But compassion is
something that we are all

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.270
capable of doing naturally.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.780
And especially people who have
the experience of being parents

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.550
know what it feels like to
experience an emotion where

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.090
the focus is completely
the other, where

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.710
there's no self-referential
or self-agenda involved.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.637
A biologist, a cynic,
might say, yes.

00:23:34.637 --> 00:23:36.720
You will do this because
the child in front of you

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.410
is biologically related to you.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.660
All the rest and all the rest.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.040
But the fact is,
actual experience,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.090
the focus is
completely the other.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.870
And your ultimate goal
of the interaction

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.260
is the welfare of the other
person in front of you.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.810
That is compassion.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.180
And that comes from
a powerful instinct

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.740
that we all have
that craves to be

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.380
connected with someone, this
nurturing, caring instinct.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.190
And this, I think, is something
that we have to keep in mind.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.880
Then the question is, if
compassion is so good,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.650
and if it is natural,
how come we don't use it

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.310
more in our day-to-day life?

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.310
That's an interesting question.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.420
And here I think we have
to take a step back and try

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.900
to understand.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.730
Often, we bring resistances
with relation to compassion.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.050
At the cultural level,
particularly in the West,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.750
since the popular official
story of who we are as a species

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.800
really comes from Darwin's
Evolutionary Theory

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.610
and the survival of the
fittest kind of model,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.465
and so there was a long
tradition in the West--

00:24:44.465 --> 00:24:48.000
at least among the
scientifically educated

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.130
community-- that ultimate
explanation of human behavior

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.510
really must be rooted in the
pursuit of self-interest.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.850
And competition is
the behavior that

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.770
manifest from this
pursuit of self-interest.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.040
So its competition and
pursuit of self-interest

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.930
are seen as the ultimate
explanation of human behavior

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.790
and human evolution.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.580
And so much so that--
I mean, when I first

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.770
went to Cambridge to study
Western philosophy, I was 30.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.720
And by that time, my formal
training and Buddha studies

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.490
have already been completed.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:28.600
And I was actually quite shocked
to realize how deeply embedded

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.710
this idea that, behind
every human behavior,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.870
there must be some
self-interest element that

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.640
is the ultimate explanation.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.610
And the reluctance on the
part of people to really allow

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.890
the possibility of real
truism, that was actually

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.830
quite shocking.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:51.710
And then later, of course, I
came across these kind of ideas

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.100
more formally
presented in works.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.410
And there is, in fact,
a notorious statement

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.650
made by an American
biologist who

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:05.270
said that "scratch an altruist
and watch a hypocrite bleed."

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:11.160
So those kind of ideas were the
official version of who we are.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.690
And then when you have
that kind of idea,

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.090
then you become suspicious
of genuine charitable,

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.780
altruistic behavior.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.630
You either see them
as, you know, abnormal,

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.530
some who are very special, and
some people are born like that.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.630
And you don't really
relate to these qualities

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.360
as being part of your
defining character.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.030
And also, individually,
we bring resistance

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.870
to expressing our
compassionate part,

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.900
partly because of this
kind of having bought

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.240
into this powerful narrative.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.000
But also because in
the West, particularly

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.940
the contemporary culture--
increasingly in different parts

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.990
of the world, too-- our
society is structured

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.890
in highly a competitive manner.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.820
And this competitiveness
is introduced

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.270
at a very, very early
age, from the word get-go.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.060
From grade one,
we are constantly

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.530
exposed to evaluation, judgment,
and cross-comparison, and all

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.030
of this.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:27.800
So we internalize sort of a
self-protecting mechanism that

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.760
shapes the way in which we view
our interaction with others,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.910
and which colors our attitude
to things like compassion

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:35.860
and so on.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.860
So then we expect these only
in a small, informal setting

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.080
of your own family
life and friends.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.060
And at the societal
level, we don't really

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.550
expect these things.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.700
So I think it's
these resistance then

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.610
we are afraid we bring fear.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.070
We are afraid that if we are
too compassionate and too kind,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.380
we will be seen as a pushover.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.210
We will be seen as weak.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.470
And people will take
advantage of me.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.540
And sometimes we also worry
because in Western thinking,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.860
we make very sharp dichotomy
between the rational part

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.800
of who we are and the
emotional part of who we are.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.820
And going back all the
way to Plato's time,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.320
that there is this conflict.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.020
And because compassion
is seen more

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.520
as belonging to
the emotion camp,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.450
people worry that if they allow
too much of their kindness

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.700
and compassion to take over,
that their rationality might

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.910
get dimmed.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.030
They may not be, you know,
tough, that is required.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.040
Their toughness
might be undermined.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.620
So people, we worry, you know?

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:39.180
And also, even in parent and
children relationship, parents

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.970
worry that if they are too
kind to their children,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.342
they might spoil the children.

00:28:45.342 --> 00:28:47.175
And the children may
not learn the toughness

00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:49.140
that is required in life.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.420
So we bring all this kind of
fear and other resistance.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.570
And that hinder the expression
of our compassionate part.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.910
So what I present in the
book is to really make a case

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.880
that compassion does matter.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.790
It is part of our
natural makeup.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.390
And we can do
something about it,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.680
so that we learn to, really,
not just leave compassion

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.070
at the mercy of situations.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.375
Because for most of us,
we really leave compassion

00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.220
at the mercy of situations.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.860
You know, when it's triggered
by situation, we act out.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.090
We allow it.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.000
And when that happens,
the most beautiful part

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.260
of who we are really comes out.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.140
Look at the overwhelming
response at the grassroot level

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.170
to the Asian tsunami, to
the earthquake in Haiti,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.000
and now in Nepal.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.340
The governmental level
responses may not

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.690
be forthcoming immediately.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.890
But at the ordinary
people's level, you know,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.875
international community
has been very generous.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.490
But we leave it at the
mercy of situations.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.240
We don't really make it.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.740
But the point I'm trying
to make in my book,

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.650
as well as the idea behind the
Stanford Compassion Training

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.780
that I had the privilege
to help develop, the idea

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.990
is that we can do
something about it.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.080
We can actually make
compassion a proactive stand,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.670
and a perspective, or a
mindset, from which we

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.270
relate to our world.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:20.860
And once we're able to
make it a proactive stance,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.115
and then we get a choice
to be able to relate

00:30:23.115 --> 00:30:25.720
to any difficult
situation-- both personal

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.260
as well as at the level
of community and society--

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.140
that we as individuals,
if we make the choice,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.410
then we bring the best of
ourselves into that situation.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.880
And whether it is in the
area of conflict resolution,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.150
prevention of conflict, or
healthy relationship, when

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.090
we are able to bring
compassion, even to parenting,

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:46.910
it changes everything.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:56.050
And we, ourselves, learn to live
with joy, because sometimes we

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.890
think that, well, compassion
and these things are wonderful.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.230
But maybe sometime in future, we
will think about these things.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.980
And we will.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.840
And people get so caught in what
they are doing in the moment--

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.660
where it is job, or
making money, and so on--

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.460
and the people forget to live.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.716
And life moves on.

00:31:14.716 --> 00:31:16.840
This is where the Buddha's
teaching on impermanence

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.490
is very, very, very powerful.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.590
The teaching on
impermanence reminds us

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.040
that the clock is
ticking all the time.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.990
And if we don't learn to
live on a daily basis,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.030
moment by moment, with joy
and with the best of our part,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.760
then we miss, because you can
never go back and bring back

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.480
that time that is lost.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.230
There's one of my
favorite authors

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:46.052
is this Czech writer,
Milan Kundera.

00:31:46.052 --> 00:31:48.010
He wrote a powerful
series of essays

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:50.550
called "The Life Is Elsewhere."

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.480
You know, people who live their
life, thinking that someone

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.320
else is living a good life.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.790
And, you know, they forget
that they're actually living.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.720
And they forget to live.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:09.170
And so this is why I think it's
important that, in the end,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:13.230
being able to live your life out
of a compassionate standpoint,

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.860
you're the first one
to stand to gain.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.180
Your relationships acquire
a different quality.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.950
People enjoy being with you.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.975
And also, you learn to
be at ease with yourself.

00:32:25.975 --> 00:32:28.100
You know, those who have
had the chance to interact

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.110
with His Holiness,
you will recognize,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:36.470
here is a person who is totally
comfortable in his own skin.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.380
It's a refreshing energy.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.280
And that kind of
freedom, that kind

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.030
of sense of abandon, that kind
of flexibility-- where he's

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.120
able to deeply delve
into a situation,

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.040
be completely empathetic,
and do the best to help, then

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.130
at the same time switch off
and move on to the next thing--

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.850
that ability to
switch modes and be

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.690
totally at ease with himself,
that comes from compassion.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.750
And that is doable.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.570
So then how do we do this?

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.640
And here, of course,
there's a whole program

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.870
that I've developed.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.570
And, you know, those
who are interested

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.490
can visit the Stanford website.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.250
But I would say few things.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.480
One is, in our
day-to-day life, we

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.650
need to pay conscious
attention to,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.900
what is the place of
compassion in my life?

00:33:31.485 --> 00:33:35.980
How does compassion figure
in my hierarchy of value?

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.680
Even those of us who don't
see ourselves as religious,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.119
we are still moral creatures.

00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:43.660
You know, we are
emotional creatures.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.743
We are rational creatures.

00:33:44.743 --> 00:33:46.250
But also, we are
moral creatures.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.160
And each of us, whether
articulated or not,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.190
we have our value system
that organize our life.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.560
And the values of those
things, principles,

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.500
that when you violate it,
makes you feel uncomfortable.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.370
It makes you feel that
you haven't lived up

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:01.420
to your own standard.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.050
Those are basically values.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.580
I mean, values is a fancy word.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.440
But basically, it relates
with those kind of principles.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.260
And some of us, those who are
within the formal religious

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.190
setting, like Buddhism,
then we have a consciously

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.130
spelled out value system.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.800
But majority, who live
a more secular life,

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.480
it may not be fully articulated.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.060
But each of us has
a value system.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.969
So then the question
is, how does it

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.350
figure within my own
hierarchy of value?

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.440
And to make it more important.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.690
The second thing is to really
make conscious effort to,

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.960
as much as possible,
make compassion part

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.290
of our everyday intention.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.239
Whatever we do.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.219
One of the beautiful practices
from my Tibetan tradition,

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.770
is to-- every morning-- you set
an intention, to make this day

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.139
a meaningful, a purposeful.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.380
You spend this day with more
mindfulness, more compassion,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.410
and really pay attention to
how your behavior affects

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.470
other people.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.940
So it's a very simple practice.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.670
You can do it in one
minute or two minutes.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:10.630
And so that intention-setting
on a daily basis, regularly,

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.760
really has the chance to
then shape our motivation.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.680
And motivation is what
makes us do things.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.760
You know, if we are angry
and feel kind of wronged,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.160
we act out.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.900
If we feel moved and
touched, we act out.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.420
So motivation is a powerful
driver of human behavior.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.010
But most of the
time, our motivations

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.850
are not very conscious
to ourselves.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.480
Motivation is the
underlying reasons

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.430
why we do certain things.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.005
Intentions are more conscious.

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:43.380
Of course, sometimes
in everyday English,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.170
we tend to mix the two,
as if they are synonymous.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.240
But they're not.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.570
Intention has a more
directed goal, an objective.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.430
Motivation is more of
an underlying reasons

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.260
why we do certain things.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.120
And the way in which
you shape the motivation

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.450
is to consciously
shape your intention.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.450
And if you're able
to bring compassion

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.750
as part of that intention,
there is a chance

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.750
that it will become part
of your motivation system.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.250
So once we're able
to do that, then we

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.340
will be able to bring greater
awareness into our life.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.570
So when we are content
with the situation,

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.280
then awareness kicks in.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.020
And this is why like
mindfulness-type practices,

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.360
like contemplative
practices, are so powerful.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.770
Because contemplative
practice brings three gifts.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.520
One is attention--
ability to pay attention.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.430
Second is to bring
conscious intention,

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.400
so that you can live your
life more consciously.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.870
And third is the ability to
bring greater self-awareness

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:45.420
into a situation.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.180
So this is through training.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.300
And when I speak of
training, I don't

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.830
mean to confine it
to just commitment

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.720
to every day of formal sitting.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.320
If people can do it,
that's fantastic.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.570
But that's also,
some people are not

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.660
inclined to that
kind of approach.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.280
But you can pay
conscious attention,

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.760
bring intention, and
become more aware.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.200
And in this way, we can
really change and transform.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.190
And in the end, if
we are able to live

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.540
our life from a
standpoint of compassion,

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.110
it really acquires a
totally different quality.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:25.690
And the Buddha was right when
he said that with our mind,

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.430
we create our own world.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.560
Effectively what
the Buddha is saying

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.030
is that, although we may be
all living in the exactly

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:37.900
the same physical environment,
but the world that each of us

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.890
experience is very different.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.170
The differences
come from the way

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.650
we perceive the world,
the attitudes we

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.910
bring into the world, and the
values that shape our outlook.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.090
And that changes the way we
feel and experience the world.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.300
And that changes
the way we behave.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.590
And how perception
changes in our feeling

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:05.040
was powerfully demonstrated by
a very simple experiment that

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.340
was done, where subjects were
sitting opposite each other,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.810
looking at their own monitor.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.170
They were asked
to wear headgear.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.870
And then they were listening to
a same music at the same speed.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.080
And they were asked to tap
their fingers according

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.200
to the rhythm.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.250
So in one set of experiments,
they all tapped in synchrony.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.375
In another set of
experiments, they

00:38:27.375 --> 00:38:28.870
were listening to
different music.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.280
So they tapped differently,
without synchrony.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.930
And afterwards,
they were exposed

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.310
to a situation where
one of their partners

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.240
was unfairly penalized.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.220
And they observed the response.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.780
And in those situations where
people tapped in synchrony,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.620
they expressed much more sense
of concern for their partner.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.200
And in the other
group, where they

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.604
were tapping not
in synchrony, there

00:38:53.604 --> 00:38:55.520
wasn't that kind of
stronger sense of concern.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.796
And if you asked
them, they wouldn't

00:38:58.796 --> 00:39:00.170
know that that
was the thing that

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.870
was, you know,
influencing their attitude

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.530
and feeling about this person.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.890
So the point here is
that if we consciously

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.630
learn to view
ourselves and others

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.090
from a standpoint of
compassion, it really

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.630
has the power to change the
way we feel about others.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.266
And that holds promise
for transformation.

00:39:20.266 --> 00:39:22.890
You know, because when we think
about spiritual transformation,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.250
sometimes people think about
something far down the line.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.600
But actually, really, I mean
you can, on a day-to-day life,

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.440
it makes a huge difference.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.100
So let me just read few words
as a form of conclusion.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.685
And then I'll take
some questions.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.500
"When we make a
habit of compassion

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.950
in our everyday lives through
regular practice an action,

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.580
we live with more courage, less
stress, and greater freedom.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.710
In time, we will automatically
see ourselves, and the world,

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.020
in terms of interconnectedness.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.210
Our default position
towards other people

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.590
will be as fellow human
beings, rather than sources

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.090
of antagonism and threat.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:13.000
Our new, other-oriented
habits will free us

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.350
from the old habits
of self-judgment,

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:18.260
self-protection, and
worrying about ourselves.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.900
Our relationships, from chance
encounters with strangers,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.020
to our intimate connections with
our closest family and friends,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:31.880
will be permeated with a sense
of openness and kindness,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.210
rooted in the understanding
of our fundamental human

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.000
condition-- our shared
needs, vulnerability,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.580
and the basic aspirations
for happiness.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.470
We will habitually respond
to all people suffering

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.770
and needs with compassion,
unprejudiced by who

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.250
they are in relation to us.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.570
Even when it comes to
a difficult person who

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:56.440
causes us problem, we will
not lose sight of the fact,

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.600
just like me, he, too,
is a fellow human who

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.050
aspires to happiness, and
does not wish to suffer.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:08.140
These thoughts will have
entered our fast system.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.540
Our actions, too, will reflect
our deep, even cellular,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.845
knowledge of the impact
we have on others.

00:41:13.845 --> 00:41:17.610
Our habit of kindness will
be reinforced over and over

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:20.670
by the joy we take in
being kind to others,

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.420
and seeing them happy.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.750
Being helpful will
be our new normal.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.790
We will come to
embody compassion,

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.760
not just admire it as an ideal.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.970
We will learn to live it
through our thoughts, feelings,

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.030
and behavior.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.760
In short, making a
habit of compassion

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.890
will transform our lives."

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.615
Thank you.

00:41:49.742 --> 00:41:51.200
AUDIENCE: In acting
with compassion

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.430
to others, what is our
responsibility for thinking

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.350
about their existing condition?

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:01.540
And by acting
compassionately to them,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.930
are they going to
feel an obligation

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:09.020
to act compassionately in
response to someone who they

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.950
may not be in a position to?

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.205
And will that lead
to resentment?

00:42:13.205 --> 00:42:14.929
Do we need to be
worried about that?

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:16.970
THUPTEN JINPA: That's a
very, very good question.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.100
Actually, I think
when we act out

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.660
of compassion towards
someone, on our part,

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.020
I don't think there should
be an expectation of how

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.790
they would respond.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:29.600
Because when we bring an
expectation on our part,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.760
then it puts pressure
on the other person.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.940
Because a true
compassion is motivated

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.560
by just a thought of wanting
to do something for the other,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.600
and regardless of
how that other person

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.186
may receive the extended hand.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.330
And that's why, sometimes, a
true compassionate response

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.520
to a situation may be simply
to let the other person know

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.260
that you are there, available,
not necessarily doing

00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.180
something.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.910
And sometimes a situation
calls where what is needed

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:07.170
is just an understanding
and a more apathetic ear,

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:09.380
rather than some solution.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.880
And this is why compassion,
to act out of compassion

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.702
is, you need a
little bit of wisdom.

00:43:15.702 --> 00:43:17.535
One of the beautiful
things about compassion

00:43:17.535 --> 00:43:20.550
is that it offers us
the ability to respond

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:25.770
to suffering without
completely being,

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.230
you know, pulled by the urge to
do something about, and solve,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.260
the problem.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.120
And especially for
men, like, we are not

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.940
very good at dealing
with situations where

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.410
there is no obvious solution.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.190
We freak out.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:40.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.240
Women are much better
at this, probably

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.750
because of their
maternal instinct.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.512
You know, sometimes
with children,

00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:47.845
they are throwing their tantrum.

00:43:47.845 --> 00:43:50.640
But they're screaming
their heads off.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.710
The best response
is just to be there,

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.800
not to react, but to show
understanding and empathy.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.790
And show the child that
when he or she is ready,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.030
the mummy's ready, you know?

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.370
I've raised two kids, my
younger daughter is 16

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.680
and elder one is 18.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.480
I had a very easy life
with the elder one.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.730
But the younger one, when
she was between two to four,

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.080
was a real challenge.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.600
And that's when I
realized, actually,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.440
even someone like
myself-- who have

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.420
come through the
monastic training

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:29.150
and always felt that I had quite
a strong reserve of patience,

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.680
I say that in my book-- and I've
never experienced in my life

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.406
where I've been driven
to being so mad.

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:39.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.780
So I think the most
important thing is not

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.630
to impose upon the recipient
some kind of expectation.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:51.510
And when people know
where you're coming from,

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.640
then people are very dignified
in the way in which they will

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.130
receive or, you know, say, OK.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.050
I don't need the help right now.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.980
So here you have to resist from
being what the Americans quote

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.860
"busybodies."

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.500
Yes?

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.560
AUDIENCE: What advice
do you have for people

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.480
who are managing people?

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.410
So, managers.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.260
And are there any
particular practices

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:34.100
you recommend for people who
are in positions of authority?

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.924
Thanks.

00:45:35.924 --> 00:45:37.590
THUPTEN JINPA: Very,
very good question.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.760
I think, now here, I'm entering
the territory where I don't

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.940
really have much experience.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.180
I mean, the only
management experience

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.730
I have is really
the monastic area,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.770
monastic community, where I was
a member of a community that

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.290
had about 400 monks.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.200
And I was involved in the
administrative side of that,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.568
partly because I was one of the
few who actually spoke English.

00:46:06.568 --> 00:46:08.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:14.150
But I've always found it, in
my own role in the management

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:19.260
kind of experience, that when
you make clear where you're

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.990
coming from, when your
intention is clear,

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.700
people are always much
more accommodating.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.310
So I think that kind of
clarity is very important.

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:34.590
And then, also, many of
us struggle with our egos.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.220
And often, ego comes in the way.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.330
And in fact, human beings
are very, very complicated

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.290
creatures.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.060
When there are more
than two people,

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.470
there's already a complexity.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.580
And often, much of
the problem really

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:54.070
comes not so much from the
challenge of the actual world,

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:58.310
but really the challenge of the
dynamics of the personalities.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.300
So here, if you are especially
more in the leadership

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.630
kind of position, if
you are able to bring

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:11.380
an element of kind of
egolessness-- it's tough--

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:17.820
but if you're able to bring
that, it really sets the tone.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.860
I have been the chair of Mind
and Life institute for now

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.340
about four years.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.430
And we have a very large
board, about 12-13 people.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:30.740
And I also noticed, not just
in the monastic setting,

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:37.110
but here too, when I'm able to
bring the best of my intention,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:42.894
with no self-concern
about my ego,

00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:46.050
and it completely
changes the dynamic.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:49.230
And it also sets the
tone for everybody else

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.680
to bring their best.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.740
So I think that's
one important lesson.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.530
And also, sometimes
in a management,

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.470
you have to make very
difficult decisions.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.860
And you have to learn
to give the bad news.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.760
And here, I think a
little bit of training,

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:10.160
and there's always a
more compassionate way

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.620
of conveying this news.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:18.030
And this is something
that-- because in the end,

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.420
people are very, very
forgiving and understanding

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.870
when they understand that
you did something because you

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.050
had no other choice.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.800
And you did it with full
consciousness, and also

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.300
a sense of concern.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.130
And people, they take
it less personally.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.010
The experience of
hurt is very painful

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.520
when the recipient
of that decision

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.410
feels personally
discriminated against.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:50.090
Somehow, when the person
takes it to be personal,

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.550
that's when it becomes
much more painful.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.480
So that's one suggestion.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.000
And at the level of
authority, I don't know.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.370
I mean, I just hope--
Bill George has just left.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.420
Bill George is
involved with Mind

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:09.610
and Life Institute in a
very interesting project

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.540
call ACEL, Academy of Ethical
Leadership, where the Mind

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:18.280
and Life Institute is trying to
bring principles of compassion

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.830
and empathy in leadership role.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.600
But I think there is
now people are beginning

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.100
to think about how
to bring mindfulness,

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.450
how to bring compassion,
into this kind of equation.

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.190
But at the moment, I think
the dominant paradigm really

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:36.570
is not that.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:41.034
I mean, I even read-- with
horror-- some articles

00:49:41.034 --> 00:49:42.950
in the "Scientific
American" a couple of years

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:49.970
ago how, in fact, some kind
of psychopathic, you know,

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.730
attributes are good in
an efficient leader.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:50:00.250
So, right now, that current
kind of paradigm is really that.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.390
But I think mindfulness
and compassion

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.956
is beginning to make inroads.

00:50:05.956 --> 00:50:07.580
Because in the end,
even from the point

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.980
of view of the
leaderships themselves,

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:14.610
at the personal level, they are
all individuals like ourselves.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.160
They're worried
about their family.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.520
They're worried about
their reputation.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.228
They're worried about
they're well being.

00:50:19.228 --> 00:50:21.290
They're worried
about their fame.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.950
They're all individuals.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:26.860
And even from the point of
view of their own self-care,

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.185
something like having a
more principled approach

00:50:30.185 --> 00:50:34.330
to their leadership role is in
their own personal interest.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:39.510
And those kind of realizations
will gradually come.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:44.330
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
the Good Samaritan experiment,

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.860
about how the
person who was going

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.560
to give the lecture on
the Good Samaritan, when

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:55.140
they were rushed, wouldn't
help someone on the way.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.890
And I've been
wondering for a while,

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.470
from the perspective
of compassion,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.030
what is actually going on?

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:06.910
And I'm asking specifically
in Silicon Valley,

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:10.610
where the competition between
companies has a lot of rushing.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.140
There's a lot of,
who can be first?

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.630
And it's just part of our jobs.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.990
And so I'm trying
to understand what

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.870
really is the
mechanism for being

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.190
rushed undermining compassion?

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.810
And what is it?

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:29.770
Is there a particular
focus, or practice,

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.960
in terms of compassion that
can help to ward that off?

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.910
THUPTEN JINPA: That's a
very, very good question.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:43.420
And I've also read that study
and was quite intrigued.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:52.840
But I understand, because
when we are in a rush, OK,

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.340
our attention completely shifts.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.540
And in order to be able to
tap into your compassion,

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.670
you do need to allow the
attention to be there.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:06.934
Because without attention, you
don't understand the situation.

00:52:06.934 --> 00:52:08.600
And without understanding
the situation,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.250
you don't connect
with the situation.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.170
And for us to act
out of compassion,

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:16.900
we need to feel that
connection, or identification.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.100
And when we are in rush,
we don't allow ourselves.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.160
And especially if you're
rushing to an important meeting,

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.780
even before you are
physically there,

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.470
mentally, you're already there.

00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.650
And it leaves no room
for us to actually allow

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.650
ourselves to be attentive
to the need in front of us.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:41.450
And so this is an
important factor.

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.512
And when we think
about this, people

00:52:43.512 --> 00:52:45.970
start thinking, OK, then that
means you need a lot of time.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.350
But that's not true.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:49.960
Attention, awareness
of situation,

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.600
and connecting
with the situation,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.970
these all things
happen very, very fast.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.490
But we do need to allow
that initial space.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:59.720
And this is what
is not happening

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.640
when people are really
rushing, and especially

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.180
when they've already
rushed with their mind.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.920
Now, ideally, if
we take compassion

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.100
as part of our daily
experience more seriously,

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:16.150
then we will be able to learn
to be more in the present.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:19.020
And then even if you have
to rush to a meeting,

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:25.250
you know, while you are walking,
your mind is still with you,

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.950
instead of your
mind already being

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:31.812
there, which then prevents
you from being able to connect

00:53:31.812 --> 00:53:33.020
with what is in front of you.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:38.580
So that's probably one factor.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.490
But as to the larger question
of this highly competitive,

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:49.930
fast-paced culture,
I don't know.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:55.230
I mean, the influence of
Silicon Valley's discoveries

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:59.540
and invention is
just so, so powerful.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.220
And I just wish
that, once in awhile,

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.930
people in the
leadership position

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:10.250
would take a step
back and reflect on,

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.410
what is the large implication
at to societal level,

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.540
with all these things
that we're bringing out?

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:21.090
Recently, the Apple
brought out the iWatch.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:25.480
You know, I just hope that
their motivation is not just

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.920
selling us another need,
with making more money.

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.595
If that is the case,
it's troubling.

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:40.640
But on the other hand, the world
is so driven by economic needs.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.320
And countries and
companies constantly

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.440
come up with their
quarterly reports,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.560
and growths
projections, and so on.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.990
And in this kind of
highly charged, kind of,

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:56.640
pressure approach, I
don't know if people

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.300
have the time or the
space to step back.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:06.810
But there is a kind of
a moral responsibility.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:10.550
Although most people
in the actual business

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:13.190
may argue that it's
none of their business

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.390
how people use the
technology what is on offer

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:20.640
is up to the
individual's choice,

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.420
but at the same time,
that's not completely true.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.810
Once you change the culture
through this technology,

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.060
everybody has no choice
but to participate in it.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:34.290
Because, otherwise, you are not
part of the larger community.

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.000
So in these kind
of situations, I

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.670
hope there will be more debate.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.400
But surprisingly,
there hasn't been much.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:47.380
When biotechnology and genetic
modification of biological

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.160
organisms were taking place,
in Europe particularly,

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.050
there was a huge amount
of debate-- you know,

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.150
among the academics,
the intellectuals,

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:58.030
among the leaders
of the industry--

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:02.290
and which really shaped the way
in which the whole industry,

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:05.240
you know, was
eventually unfolded,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.680
with the labelling
and all of this,

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.270
which I thought was a very
responsible way of dealing with

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:14.360
new reality which
has been created.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.070
And the power of the
digital technologies--

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:21.870
when we invent a new product
which becomes very widespread,

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.280
we're actually
creating new reality.

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.040
And new reality demands
a new ethical response,

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.650
responsibility.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.720
But we, often as a
society, we don't

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.710
rise to that challenge of coming
up with a critical discussion.

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:38.710
And so I don't know.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.760
I mean, at some point,
this neck breaking speed

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.560
has to slow down.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.310
But at the moment, it doesn't
seem to be slowing down.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:51.570
MANG: So we are very lucky.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:55.642
This book is basically, in a
way, Jinpa's coming out party.

00:56:55.642 --> 00:56:58.604
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:58.604 --> 00:57:00.020
What you don't
know about Jinpa is

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.100
that he's actually very eminent
and famous in the Tibetan

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.670
Buddhist community for being a
very highly respected scholar.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:11.410
And this is his coming out,
out of their community,

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.200
into our world,
the modern society,

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.240
and coming out as a
teacher for the rest of us.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.180
The book is "A Fearless Heart,"
available where books are sold.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:23.250
And my friends, Thupten Jinpa.
