DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.790
I'm Don Dodge, and this
is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.020
Today, I'm going to do a show
on viewer questions.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.110
I did a show a few weeks
ago about, can

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.240
startup ideas be stolen?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.260
It generated lots of questions,
so I have a few

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.480
here today that I'd
like to cover.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.550
The first question comes
from Nikolai Lind.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.760
And he says, do you guys
agree that software

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.780
patent system is broken?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.320
What do you think about New
Zealand's ban on software

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.010
patents, and should other
countries copy this approach?

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.450
Well, I need to preface my
remarks by saying that these

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.790
are my personal views,
not Google's views.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.120
But yes, I would agree that the
software patent system in

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.700
the US is broken, particularly
for software.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.530
There are lots of patents
issued that

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.370
should never be issued.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.200
The biggest problem
is patent trolls.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.710
Patent trolls are institutions
that acquire patents, but they

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.460
aren't real companies,
so they call them

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.040
non-practicing entities.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.680
They acquire patents and then
turn around and sue startups.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.510
They sue startups because
startups don't have a lot of

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.440
money and can't defend
themselves, so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.150
they're easy prey.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.200
Then after winning several of
these suits against startups,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.830
they start going after bigger
and bigger companies because

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.200
they have some case
law behind them.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.470
So yes, it is a big problem.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.620
And there are organizations
in the US--

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.580
the Application Developers
Alliance is one, the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.640
Electronic Freedom Foundation
is another--

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.160
that are trying to fight
these things.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.700
I'm not familiar with New
Zealand's ban of patents and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.510
how that works.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.850
But not all patents are bad, so
I think it's dangerous to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.650
totally ban patents.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.320
Patent reform is probably
the better approach.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.710
Our second question comes from
Keith Trinka, and he says,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.560
what do you guys think about a
startup versus a skunkworks

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.910
type inside of a
larger company?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.490
Would you expect one to be more
innovative or successful

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.120
than the other?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.600
That's a good question.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.470
Innovation doesn't matter
where it starts.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.690
The bigger question is, once
that innovation is done, where

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.900
will it be more successful, in
the context of a startup or in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.160
the context of a
larger company?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.750
My opinion is that startups
are all in every day.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.230
So they're taking big risks.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.850
They're totally committed to
this idea, and they innovate

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.350
and make it happen.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.420
When it comes time to take that
innovation to market,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
again, they're totally committed
and all in, so the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.270
chances that they're going
to be successful

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.160
are probably better.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.130
Innovation can happen
at a large company.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.520
And there are skunkworks and
research labs and things like

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.140
that where innovation happens,
but those innovations are

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.010
typically focused on
the core business.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.850
So they're longer-term projects
or innovations to a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.540
core feature or product
of the company.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.620
And as long as those line up
well, then that can be very,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.900
very innovative and seamlessly
added to the product and be

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.450
very successful.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.820
Where it hasn't been
successful is--

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.380
probably the biggest example
is Xerox PARC.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
Xerox PARC had one of the most
famous research labs in the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.550
world that developed things
like the graphical user

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.820
interface and the mouse and
all sorts of other amazing

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.960
innovations, laser printers,
I believe.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.950
And those innovations didn't
line up with the corporate

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.510
goals or the corporate
product strategy.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.410
So all that great innovation
went to waste and never saw

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.580
the light of day.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.210
So I think innovation can happen
anywhere, in a startup

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.420
or in a skunkworks in
a large company.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.990
But taking that innovation to
market is where it falls down

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.760
and where startups are better
than large companies.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.250
Another question came from
The Novice Mind.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.000
Interesting username.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.690
What advice do you give startups
for dealing with the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.230
legal minefield, such as
copyrighted user content or

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.420
other legally concerning
areas that can

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.960
appear from user content?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.120
Another good question.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.000
You may recall I was vice
president of Napster, the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.200
music company, and we had a few
issues with user content.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.620
However, in that case, it was
not user-generated content, it

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.900
was user-contributed content,
and there's a big difference.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.140
User-generated content is
generated by the user and,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.380
typically, has no
copyright on it.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.890
Sometimes, however, a
user-generated content piece

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.310
will include something that is
copyrighted, and that's where

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.750
you run into trouble.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.680
But there are safe
harbor areas.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.010
There's the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act that covers

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.610
copyrights, and it gives safe
harbor to software companies

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.420
who are, like, discussion boards
or sharing places and

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.630
that kind of thing, where you're
not responsible for

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.710
what the users put
on the site.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.150
There are procedures called
takedown notices, where anyone

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.220
who sees copyrighted information
that they own can

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.100
notify you, as the site
owner, and say,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.160
hey, that's my content.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.900
It's violating my copyright.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.180
Take it down.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.300
And then you have to investigate
that and take it

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.470
down within a certain
number of days.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.440
So as long as you do that,
you're in the open and not

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.730
liable for any copyright
infringement.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.130
If there's rampant copyright
infringement, and that's all

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.510
you do, such as the case in
Napster, then you're going to

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.930
get vicarious copyright
infringement and aiding and

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.360
abetting copyright infringement,
and that's where

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.150
you get into big trouble.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:25.300
So as long as your site or app
has significant legal use and

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.600
can be used for other things,
and there's just a small

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.460
amount of copyright
infringement, you can handle

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.410
that with a safe harbor and
deleting the copyright

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.910
information.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.480
If not, then you have
larger problems.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.590
I'm not a lawyer, so I don't
give legal advice.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.200
That's just an opinion and
based on my experience.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.630
All right.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.120
So keep these viewer
questions coming.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.900
They're very interesting, and
I'll try to answer as many of

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.950
them as I can in future shows.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.630
So thank you, and join
us next time.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.050
