MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.310
I'm here today
with Louise Mirrer,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.651
who is the President of the
New York Historical Society.

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.109
And we're here to
talk a little bit

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.130
about Silicon City, this
fantastic new exhibit

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.184
that they've got.

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:15.100
I was lucky enough to
be at the opening of it.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.974
I have a whole bunch of
questions for Louise.

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.850
And hopefully you do too.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.970
I thought I would start
with just a few words

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.886
to introduce Louise and
tell you all about her

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.189
if you don't already know.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.230
Even before that, I should
just-- how many of you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.063
have been to the New
York Historical Society

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:31.450
or are familiar with it?

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.312
So think of it as
an opportunity.

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:34.770
LOUISE MIRRER: Got
some work to do.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.540
MALE SPEAKER: It's
an opportunity

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.040
for expanding membership roles.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.630
So in my opinion, one of the
iconic cultural and historical

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.590
institutions of New York
City, on the Upper West Side,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.970
conveniently one block from
my daughter's middle school.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.020
But just a fantastic place to go
with a host of great exhibits.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.150
And as an unsolicited plug,
Louise has brought in a team

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.040
and has herself been responsible
for a tremendous rebirth

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.960
of an institution that
I've known for 45 years.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.730
But that looks such a
dramatically more revived,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.070
alive, and interesting
one than the one

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.030
that I attended as
a very young child.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120
So for all those
reasons, I'm especially

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.040
excited to have you here today.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
Now I'll try to shut up
and get out of your way.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.150
So I guess opening, tell us a
little about the Silicon City

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.220
exhibition.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.200
What is it?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.190
What does that name mean to you?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.847
What was the genesis?

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:31.430
LOUISE MIRRER: So first of all,
I'm going to thank all of you.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.580
I'm going to thank
Google because Google

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.250
has been a great partner
in this exhibition.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.830
And I though I was
saying to William

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.400
before that my notes tell
me to save this for the end,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
I'm going to start out by saying
that thanks to the partnership

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.290
with Google, we already
have 7,500 New York City

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.220
public school students
from elementary school

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.480
through high school
signed up to learn coding.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.170
And apart from going through
the exhibition, the chance

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.730
for these kids-- you may
know that elementary schools

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.400
in New York City public
schools tend not to.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.500
I don't know if any of them
actually teach coding yet.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.760
So thanks to Google, these
kids have an amazing, amazing

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.510
opportunity.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.370
So thank you very much and
thank you for being here.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.870
So Silicon City, the genesis
of the exhibition-- first

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.260
of all the name.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.420
We've all heard
of Silicon Valley.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.100
We've all heard
of Silicon Alley.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.590
And so we decided that we
would play a little bit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.870
with New York's own
history in the story

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.120
and call the exhibition
Silicon City because in fact

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.320
what the exhibition shows
is that New York has been

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.630
central to the history,
the entire history

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.670
of innovative technology,
beginning with what we call

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.150
the Victorian internet
when Samuel Morse invented

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.250
the telegraph thanks to research
that was done in New York.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.010
So that was in 1839.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.160
We really traced
this amazing history

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.340
and established that
for a very long time,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.850
you wouldn't think of
innovative technology

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.059
without thinking of New York.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.433
MALE SPEAKER: I never heard
the phrase Victorian internet

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.730
before refer to the telegraph,
but I like that a lot.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.919
If it's OK, I may
use that again.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.752
LOUISE MIRRER: Sure.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.859
MALE SPEAKER: So I going to
bash my question, two questions,

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.400
a little bit.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.294
What made you think--
what kind of brought this

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:41.960
to the Historical
Society and brought it

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.014
to the Historical
Society in your mind?

00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:46.430
LOUISE MIRRER: Well that's a
great question because people

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.730
ask me all the time, how
do you get the idea to do

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.680
an exhibition, any exhibition.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.360
And I'm going to say
that maybe some of you

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.280
have great ideas for exhibitions
because that's basically

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.930
the genesis.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.750
This one came out of
two social occasions

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.500
that I was present at.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.100
The first was a branch that
an acquaintance of mine had.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.050
I was talking to
a random person,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.590
had never met him before.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.050
But he was actually from
Mountain View, California.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.820
And he said to me,
you know, there's

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.050
a great museum of computer
history in Mountain View.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.020
And I thought that sounds
really interesting.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.050
I went to Stanford.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.460
So I'm always looking for
excuses to return to The Farm.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.700
And I went that summer to visit
the Computer History Museum.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.580
And one thing that
struck me instantly

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.020
from the start through the
finish is how much of the story

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.840
told at the Computer History
Museum took place in New York.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.440
And then it was probably
only a couple of months

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.060
later that I was at another
social occasion talking

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.810
to Walter Isaacson, whose book
hadn't yet been published,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.040
"The Innovators."

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.200
And I just casually
mentioned to him,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.330
making small talk, that I had
visited this amazing museum

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.780
in Mountain View.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.020
And he said to me, well my
book's about to come out,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.650
and I did a lot of my
research there at that museum.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.790
And you want to tell
the New York story.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.570
So that was enough of a
coincidence of inspiring ideas

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.030
for me to talk to my
colleagues and then start

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.400
talking to people
with expertise really

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.090
all over the country
on computer history.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.800
And that was the genesis.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.680
So as I said, if any of you
have another great idea,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.940
we're always happy
to receive them.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.610
MALE SPEAKER: So
one of the things

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.230
that struck me in the
exhibit was the kind

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.740
of unique historical status that
the IBM Pavilion at the 1964

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.220
World's Fair places in
the exhibit in the history

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.740
of computing in New York.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.220
Of course I had known
that the 1964 World's

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.190
Fair as being kind of a
component of "Tomorrowland,"

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.670
a somewhat regrettable movie,
and in a more minor way

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.590
a throwaway joke
in "Men in Black."

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.300
But maybe you want to tell us
a little bit about that IBM

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.950
Pavilion and what was that
kind of the icon of change

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.590
yet to come.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.290
And how did what was
there-- how did that predict

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.710
what was yet to come?

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.650
LOUISE MIRRER: Well
of course as I said,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.100
computer history stretches
back much earlier than 1964.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.850
But it was really in 1964
with the World's Fair--

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.069
and it wasn't just IBM,
it was also Bell Labs.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.360
MALE SPEAKER: Right, of course.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.380
LOUISE MIRRER: But IBM had
this fabulous pavilion.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.910
I happen to know it
was the first-- I

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.340
happen to know first hand.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.060
I'm a little bit ashamed to
say because it will give you

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.310
an idea of how old I am.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.490
But 1964 was the
first time I was

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.100
allowed to take public
transportation on my own.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
And I was very young.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.840
I would not have
allowed my own children

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.830
to do that today, more recently.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.740
But I went to the World's
Fair with a few of my friends

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.470
in 1964.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.457
And there were
lines-- I don't know,

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:18.540
we thought they were a
mile long-- that's probably

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.980
a bit of an exaggeration--
outside this pavilion that

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.020
looked like an egg.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.450
It had been designed
by Eero Saarinen, who's

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.310
one of the great designers
of the 20th century.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.450
And when you finally got a
chance to go inside the egg,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.120
you became part
of a people wall.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.120
You were hoisted up.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.670
And someone came out like
looking like a conductor

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.640
in a top hat and tailcoat.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.740
And you learned
about the future.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.600
And the future, it was filled
with computers and technology,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.360
and things that people in 1964
might have heard about, known

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.580
something about, but
really didn't think

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.820
were likely to change
the way we did things.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.540
And the purpose of the
pavilion was really

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.080
to persuade us that
everything-- our kitchens

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.860
would behave differently.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.440
Our everyday life would
be permanently altered.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.280
And of course Bell Labs
had its picture phone.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.697
The big joke among
my set was oh,

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:29.780
suppose you're in the
shower when the phone rings.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.404
That's going to be
really embarrassing.

00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:34.020
Somebody is going
to look at you.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.260
And interestingly, we all
thought it was a big joke.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.880
And we thought it
was a big joke.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.640
Unfortunately it was a
big joke at the time.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.470
They were way, way
ahead of their time.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.050
The picture phone
was a huge flop.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.640
Although I would
say that in addition

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.780
to Belgian waffles,
which we were introduced

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.590
to also at the Belgian
Pavilion of the World's Fair,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.540
probably the picture phone was
the most exciting innovation

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.810
we learned about.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.990
But back to your
question, we decided

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.970
that though we were going to
go back to the 19th century

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.730
to tell the history of
computers in New York,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.030
we would actually start
by inviting visitors

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.030
to enter Saarinen's egg and
be inside the World's Fair.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.990
And we did that so
that people could

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.210
see what everyone thought the
future would bring, and then

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.040
go back in time.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.990
Once you leave the egg,
you do go back in time

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.730
to the 19th century.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.280
And you get a chance to
see why people thought

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:46.300
that future was possible in
'64, and what was possible,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.020
and how long did it take
before we had picture

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.961
phones as a way of life.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:56.130
MALE SPEAKER: I guess
this is a picture phone.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.713
LOUISE MIRRER: That's
a picture phone.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.880
MALE SPEAKER: In '64 you got
to see what did turn out to be,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.530
I guess to many's surprise,
a vision of the future.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.130
But what were some of the
biggest surprises to you

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.010
as the exhibit was being
curated and assembled,

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.790
anything you learned
about New York's role

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.820
that you hadn't known?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.550
LOUISE MIRRER: Well
I must say that one

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:29.060
of the most interesting
things that I really learned

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.940
was as much about history
as it was about technology.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.270
And that was that-- you
know, I'm a historian

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.160
and I run an American
history museum.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.590
So I know that Article
I of the Constitution

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.950
requires a census
every 10 years.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:52.000
And that was really critical
to figure out how to tax people

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.570
and how to apportion
representation in 1790 when

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.020
the first census was taken.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.510
And I also was very aware that
at the end of the 19th century,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.300
we had an enormous population
explosion in this country.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.350
But I was not aware that
actually the punch card

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.430
system, which was something I'm
very familiar with, though I

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.600
wasn't around in the 1890,
but the punch card system was

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.370
actually developed by Herman
Hollerith in order to-- you

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.280
probably all know this,
but I did not-- in order

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.380
to accommodate the
need to take a census

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.650
in an era of huge, huge
massive population growth.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.640
So I think that one of the
really interesting things

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.930
about the exhibition
is the opportunity

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.380
to understand scientific
discovery as a companion piece

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.700
to our historical trajectory.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:57.040
What also really surprised me--
I also was one of the first

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.860
to take a transistor
radio to Jones Beach.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.100
I grew up in New York
as I said before,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.070
so Jones Beach was sort of like
where you went over the summer.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.570
And it was very exciting
to have this little pocket

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.180
radio that you could play
your rock and roll music when

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.070
you were getting a
sunburn on the beach

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.140
since we didn't know any
better in those days.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.600
But I didn't really
realize how the development

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.340
of the transistor really
revolutionized the ability

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.680
for all sorts of
things to happen.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.659
And one of the discoveries
I made along the way-- one

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.700
thing that happens when
you work on an exhibition

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.330
is you meet incredibly
interesting people,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.910
in my case, people you
wouldn't ever otherwise meet.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.840
And I met a guy from
the Bronx originally

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.820
who used transistor technology.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.180
He had gone to City
College and he actually

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.820
invented this while he was
a student at City College.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.500
He used transistor technology
to develop an instrument called

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.980
the cardiotron.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.310
And the cardiotron
allowed a doctor

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.220
to move around with a
cardiogram machine, which

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.030
was an enormous innovation
because you could figure out

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.600
what someone's
heartbeat was remotely.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.290
And in fact he showed me some
pictures of his sales pitch.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.790
And my own father
was a cardiologist.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.950
And lo and behold I found my
father in one of the pictures--

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.510
so that was really
quite incredible-- who

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.550
was receiving a demonstration.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:43.110
But so many things were
certainly new to me.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.010
What wasn't new to
me, but is new to so

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.100
many of our young visitors
was a Selectric typewriter.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:57.150
And I typed my dissertation
on a Selectric in 1980.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.380
And that seemed like
a huge innovation.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.620
I mean, little did I know
that five years later, you

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.700
know I would have tossed the
Selectric in favor of an IBM

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.270
word processing machine.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.690
But at the time
it seemed amazing.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:19.540
And what happens is we decided
to have a bank of Selectrics

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.380
for fun.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.280
MALE SPEAKER: I loved
that by the way.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.952
Oh, the feel of that typewriter
keyboard is just unparalleled.

00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:25.410
LOUISE MIRRER: Well
what happens is

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.980
that the most amazing
thing in the world

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.810
to our very young
visitors is this bank

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.270
of Selectric typewriters.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.070
And they are waiting in line
to have a chance to type

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.400
on this thing.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.520
And as one of my
colleagues said,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.370
he quoted his son
as saying, it's

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.100
amazing to have a computer
that you can type on

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.604
and it prints at the same time.

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:46.103
Wow.

00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:48.869
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:48.869 --> 00:14:50.160
Back to the future as they say.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.535
MALE SPEAKER:
Where's the screen?

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.592
Something you touched
on a minute ago

00:14:56.592 --> 00:14:58.300
when talking about
the interconnectedness

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.470
of technology and
science in the area is I

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.700
think there is this theme
of the interconnectedness

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.840
or the role of technology in
New York's great industries.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.290
And of course New York is
great at many, many things.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:19.210
But media, culture, we're
arguably the greatest

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:19.800
in the world.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.175
And there certainly
seems to have

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.060
been a great kind of
technology component

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.460
to media, culture, finance,
these other New York

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.726
industries, institutions.

00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:30.850
LOUISE MIRRER: Well I think
that's why New York was

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:36.280
so central to
technological innovation

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.330
because a lot of things
were happening here

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.930
that were on the cutting edge.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.020
Culture is really
key among them.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:49.610
So the earliest experimentation
with, for example, music, art,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.820
dance, Cage and Cunningham
to give one salient example,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.520
they were really learning
about innovations

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.380
in computer technology
and figuring out

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.750
how they could make
what, at the time,

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.070
sounded like totally weird
sounds and movements.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.660
And we have a wonderful little
video in the exhibition.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.490
You can see they're
hooking up a toaster

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:20.010
and I think maybe a
blender also to make music.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:26.440
And it's very funny and
sort of Chaplinesque.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.940
But experimentation has
always been the calling card

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.870
of culture in New York.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.980
And we have a long
history of bringing--

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.060
we did an exhibition
on the 1913 Armory Show

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.830
in New York which introduced
New York to modern art.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.260
Modern art came to New York.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.050
It shocked a lot of people.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.470
And this kind of
new music, computer

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.610
generated music,
computer generated sound,

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:03.170
I mean it's no accident that New
York is just a very open city.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:08.520
And the early experimentation
really all happened here.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.940
And some of the
other discoveries

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.640
that we made along the way
were that actually things

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.440
that are really
closely associated

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.030
with Hollywood or with
California more generally,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:24.569
like Toy Story, pixilated
movies, computer generated

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.089
films, actually
also happened here.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.670
And some of the academic
institutions in town

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.310
were really central
to all of that.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.630
MALE SPEAKER: Do you think
that that-- so having

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.480
gone to school at Stanford and
been to the Computer Museum

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:48.250
and so on, is this core
to New York's technology

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.230
identity a difference from
the Silicon Valley one, which

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.930
is now very, very focused
on consumer experience

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.080
of technology directly?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.470
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah,
I think New York

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:04.920
was central for a long
time to innovation,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.880
kind of mechanical innovation.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:14.030
And then I think--
I was at Stanford

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.180
at a time when
Stanford was really

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.680
promoting its faculty to do
research, innovative research.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.980
And I think probably
the understanding

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.440
of how you could commercialize
an invention that came out

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.360
of an academic
institution was more

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.080
West Coast than East Coast.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:41.290
And I think that that probably
gave Mountain View and Silicon

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.370
Valley its edge.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.310
But I think New York
has retained industries

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.910
that make a company like
Google an attractive partner

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.300
for the city.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.680
We have advertising here.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.500
So anyone who has a business
model that requires proximity

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.700
to advertising agencies, New
York's a good place to be.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.310
Culture, the same thing,
certain kinds of culture,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.000
maybe not Hollywood films
or games these days.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.130
But I think that
New York has really

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.170
hued, even during the
time that we argue--

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.820
I mean, we basically
abandon the story

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.900
in the 1980s in our exhibition.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.260
We go through the end of
the '70s and then we say,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.000
it moved to the West Coast.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.170
We have a little bit on the '90s
because certainly the capital

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.090
markets in New York
were paying attention

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.740
to technological
innovation in the 1990s.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.010
And then we restart the
story in the present.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.510
MALE SPEAKER: And the present
seems like an interesting time

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.593
and a bit of a difference.

00:19:48.593 --> 00:19:52.060
Now they call it the tech
renaissance in New York,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.620
but renaissance
implies-- I guess

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.703
rebirth implies there was
death along the way when

00:19:55.703 --> 00:19:58.510
the point of the exhibit is in
fact that was never the case,

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.009
right?

00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:01.900
But it does seem
like New York now

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.760
has a tremendous number of
small, medium, and large sized

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.470
companies that are--
technology is the business,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.080
not just an enabler for the
business or a component of it,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.470
much more mirroring what's been
done in Silicon Valley I guess.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.140
Do you see that as
a permanent change?

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.880
Is this changing the landscape
of New York-- the economics,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.792
the political dynamics?

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:25.000
LOUISE MIRRER: Oh absolutely.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I think Google is a very,
very big part of that story

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.200
because this building has
anchored a whole new rebirth--

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.230
certainly you've been part
of a whole new rebirth

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.390
of Manhattan's Far West Side.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.990
And I think that the whole--
I live on the east side,

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.210
despite the fact that I
work on the Upper West Side.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.460
But neither of
those places really

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.910
is sort of the center of what's
happening today, certainly

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.730
not in technology.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:00.130
And I think that the personality
and the geography of the city

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.480
has been very, very much
changed by the renaissance

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.350
of technology here.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.490
And I think also
that what's very nice

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.380
is that companies
like Google and others

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.830
that have sunk their
roots in New York

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.840
really understand
that you can still

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.020
attract a different
kind of person

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.360
to work in technology
at New York

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.710
perhaps, in New York
than on the West Coast.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:31.980
I'm a New Yorker.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.430
I'm fourth generation
New Yorker,

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.930
so I'm very New York focused.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:42.090
But I do think that it's nice
to see that startup technology

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.580
companies that are doing
really great cutting edge

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.410
kinds of things,
companies like Google,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.990
are recognizing that New
York really has a special DNA

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:59.699
and that it's fun to
work here in the city.

00:21:59.699 --> 00:22:00.490
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.920
Well I'm glad we
agree, absolutely.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.460
So maybe talk a little
bit more about the coding

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.560
experience, the coding teaching
that's going on at the exhibit.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.720
This seems like
kind of a new thing

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.260
for the Historical Society.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.720
LOUISE MIRRER: Well it is.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.800
We were really
glad for the chance

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.950
with this exhibition to talk
about science because there's

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.410
such a focus on
trying to prepare

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:36.080
new generations for
work, for having

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:42.850
the capacity to work in these
new industries these days.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:47.580
And we have a lot
of kids who visit.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.090
Some of you may know
this, but New York forever

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.550
has required, if you're
in a public school,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.410
has required you to
pass an American history

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.464
Regents examination
in 11th grade.

00:22:59.464 --> 00:23:01.880
If you don't pass it, you don't
graduate from high school.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.470
And as everybody
knows, you don't

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.030
graduate from high school, you
tend to have zero life chances.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.550
So we've been very much
about leveling the playing

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.270
field at the New York
Historical Society.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.200
And we've spent a lot
of time and energy

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.970
trying to make sure
that students are--

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.260
of course we believe in it.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.760
They should know
American history.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.900
They should know
their local history.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.100
But they should also be able
to graduate from high school.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.590
So we've spent a lot of
time and energy doing that.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.670
But we haven't really had a
chance to prepare students

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.960
for careers in
science and technology

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.180
because we focused on history.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.730
And this exhibition really
gave us the opportunity

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.960
to say well what can we do now.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.620
And as I said at
the start, we were

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.800
very fortunate to have a
partnership with Google,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.270
because we got
expertise from you.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.980
So your colleagues
have enabled us.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.430
We have some great videos
which you can access on online

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.290
and have a great time watching.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.540
It's fun for us.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.130
I'm sure it would
be fun for you too,

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.850
to introduce very
young kids to coding.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.260
And you know it is a skill that
is extremely very necessary.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:23.480
And it is a skill that just--
I guess they don't really

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.420
have the bandwidth to do it in
the early grades in New York

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.770
City public schools.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.880
So we have the opportunity
to any teacher,

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:39.020
any class throughout the city
and the public schools to come.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.100
The students get a guided
tour of our exhibition.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.200
And then they spend an hour in
one of our Google classrooms.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.370
So we've got three Google
classrooms, one very big one

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.200
and two nice sized
ones, but not as big.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.440
And they spend an
hour learning coding.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.430
And it's really a lot of fun.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.620
So it's great.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.210
Thank you.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.240
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.720
It's great we can do that.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.240
Never would I have thought that
I would have the opportunity

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.000
as part of Google to collaborate
with the New York Historical

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.500
Society.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.300
It's kind of one of the great
thrills of being part of Google

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.180
in New York for me I think.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.150
I'm out of my question list.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.160
And I wonder if it would
be OK for us to open up

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.990
to questions from the audience?

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.200
LOUISE MIRRER: Sure.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.026
MALE SPEAKER: We have
mics on either side.

00:25:22.026 --> 00:25:23.357
I see Ramona is bravely going--

00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:25.190
LOUISE MIRRER: You ask
me anything technical

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.565
I'm going to throw
it back to you

00:25:26.565 --> 00:25:29.072
to answer, so just as a warning.

00:25:29.072 --> 00:25:31.630
AUDIENCE: Hi,
thanks for visiting.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.650
You've spoken about West
Coast versus East Coast.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:40.760
But I'm also be curious to know
if you have insight into why

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.213
some of the tech industry
moved out of New York

00:25:43.213 --> 00:25:46.100
into the suburbs, and now it's
moved, which I think is great.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.220
But do you have any
thoughts on that?

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.300
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.750
We actually did a
couple of years ago now,

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.810
we did an exhibition called
World War II and New York.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.520
And the exhibition
really showed how,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.490
at the end of World
War II, manufacturing

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:07.780
which had been so central to
the city and the environs really

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.110
moved to the West Coast.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.850
I mean already you
could see Grumman

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.110
and the aircraft industry
was out on Long Island.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.430
But manufacturing writ large
was starting to leave the city.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.830
It was already
migrating to California.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:29.490
And I think that really,
part of the story

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:36.380
is that New York became less
hospitable for a whole range

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.190
of reasons after World War II.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:45.160
There's more land, cheaper,
more energy, cheaper, geography,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.560
real estate.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.130
And there were new
industries that

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.880
came to New York and
supplanted manufacturing,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.340
like all the culture.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.820
The University in Exile, New
School University for example.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.030
So I think it's very complex.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.140
But I think this started
at the end of World War II.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.480
New York fell on very
hard times in the 1970s.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.240
It was really not a
great place to live,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.810
not a great place to work.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.280
People fled to the suburbs.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.610
You would not be sending
your children to school

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.870
on the Upper West Side.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.370
MALE SPEAKER: I grew up on the
Upper West Side in the 1970s,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.590
so I have the scars to show it.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.390
LOUISE MIRRER: No, I remember
coming back from college one

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.690
year and I stayed
with a friend who

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.990
lived in one of these now
glorious apartments in the West

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.610
80s.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.170
And you could hear
the shots ringing out.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.520
So I think that was part
of the complex of things

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.310
that happened.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:48.279
And that's what
happened, changed.

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.070
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.300
It's the skeletons of
those institutions that

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.650
remain I think are interesting.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.570
So I worked for
Columbia University

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.930
in what had been IBM's
original Watson research labs,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:04.402
115th Street, and Bell Labs
had originated downtown.

00:28:04.402 --> 00:28:05.960
You can kind of
see the skeletons

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.460
of these institutions,
or they're still

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.260
present on the
streets of Manhattan.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.830
We have another
question over there.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.400
I had a question
about sort of-- again,

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.899
you mentioned this
earlier, but kind

00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:21.310
of the reputation of New
York versus Silicon Valley

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.230
is kind of the
grassroots support

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.160
of the tech industry from its
citizens and constituents.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.804
And New York, for
better or worse

00:28:29.804 --> 00:28:31.720
has sort of avoided a
lot of the problems that

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.760
have affecting the Bay Area
with a reputation of creating

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.100
these little startups that
promote either the gig

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.850
economy as they say-- your
Ubers, that sort of thing.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.790
And New York also
has a lot of startups

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.102
that make real tangible things.

00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:49.310
And I was wondering in the
course of putting together

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.990
this exhibition if you
saw any sort of trends

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.114
in that way of sort of the
continuation of New York

00:28:53.114 --> 00:28:55.850
as kind of an
engine of innovation

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.457
in its historical sense.

00:28:57.457 --> 00:28:59.290
I know you just talked
on that a little bit,

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.380
but this idea that
people build things

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.390
in New York that are useful and
that are useful to everyone.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.473
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah, well
that's a great question.

00:29:06.473 --> 00:29:09.450
And the first question
was a great question too,

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.930
which I couldn't do justice to.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.680
But there are some great
books on suburbanization.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.870
But I would say in the last
gallery of the exhibition,

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:25.640
we have a case that has some
3D printed objects in it.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.060
We worked with Shapeways, which
is one of the newer 3D printing

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.230
companies.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.510
And I love the idea
that 3D printing

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:42.760
seems to have really taken
hold as an industry in New York

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.402
because they are
making real things.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.190
I think Wall Street suffers a
little bit from the same thing.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.130
What's this capital?

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.270
There's no there there.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:59.070
But I think that it
does sort of return

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:04.682
the whole phenomenon of 3D
printing and its uses from-- I

00:30:04.682 --> 00:30:06.390
think it's great if
I have a dinner party

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.380
and run out of spoons that I
might have [INAUDIBLE] make

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.920
one-- on the trivial end to
the really serious robotics

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.180
applications of a 3D printing.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.730
I think it's great that New
York has sort of returned

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.430
to its manufacturing
roots in that sense.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:31.510
And I feel that it doesn't
really undermined anything

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.580
about the intellectual
purpose of New Yorkers

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.020
and what's done at
various universities.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.260
But maybe that's a
way of seeing it.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.580
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.330
Thanks for coming.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.950
Forgive me, I haven't been
to the exhibition yet,

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.792
so this question
probably belies that.

00:30:50.792 --> 00:30:52.250
And it's a little
bit of connection

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.120
to the first question as well.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.830
And it's sort of
curatorial question.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.180
When I think about this
sort of time period

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.560
of the birth of
computing, I think

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.550
of New Jersey and Princeton,
places very allied to New York.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.480
But I was just
wondering what you

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.380
decide New York is when
you're talking about this.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.840
Is it Rochester?

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.060
Is it Manhattan?

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.764
Is it Montauk?

00:31:17.764 --> 00:31:22.740
I was just wondering
when you were deciding

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.220
that, how did you sort
of say what New York was,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.860
what the Silicon City was, and
how far its tendrils kind of

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.635
extended?

00:31:29.635 --> 00:31:30.510
LOUISE MIRRER: Right.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.170
So Bell Labs actually
started right around here.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.250
So we're almost home.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.910
We're almost at ground
zero in terms of Bell Labs.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:43.370
And ditto for any innovation
that was connected.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:52.410
I mean Columbia's Watson Labs
for example on 116th Street.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.850
I mean, IBM's
headquarters have always

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.310
been on 57th and Madison.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.560
So New York City, many
people don't know this.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.070
They think that
Bell Labs was always

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.500
in New Jersey and Murray Hill.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.402
I mean, I say Murray Hill, and
people think I mean Manhattan,

00:32:10.402 --> 00:32:12.110
but there is a Murray
Hill in New Jersey.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:14.318
MALE SPEAKER: Actually here
when you say Murray Hill,

00:32:14.318 --> 00:32:16.730
people think you
mean New Jersey.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.980
LOUISE MIRRER: A lot of jokes
about Manhattan's Murray

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.690
Hill, so I won't go into it.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:27.340
But actually if you
trace the history

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:33.810
when Samuel Morse was working
on the telegraph, he was here.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.950
He was right here.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.000
So Edison, Thomas Edison also.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.210
I mean, all of the
early inventions

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:47.620
really relate to what we would
call strictly New York City.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.860
But we're very broad minded.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.540
And we do think that there
is sort of a tri-state area

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.600
that we can claim as New York.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.500
So we do play a little bit.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.560
IBM of course
moved up to Armonk,

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.990
and then it moved further north.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.380
And we do go out to Princeton.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.720
We certainly have gone
out on Long Island.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.990
So yeah, so we do
fudge a little bit.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.550
But you know,
Silicon Valley is now

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.170
a huge-- I mean,
where did it start?

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.547
It started in a
very small location.

00:33:20.547 --> 00:33:22.630
I don't even know what the
geographical boundaries

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.620
are anymore.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.537
So if they can do
it, we can do it.

00:33:27.537 --> 00:33:28.620
AUDIENCE: We did it first.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.790
Thanks for coming.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.200
You were mentioning
earlier about teaching kids

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.570
to program in school.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.630
And I remember when I was
in grade school in the '80s,

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.460
they taught us
BASIC programming.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:47.070
And the first code I ever
saw was my math textbook.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.640
But I guessed that stopped
happening at some point.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.640
Did your research uncover why
that no longer was happening

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.080
in public schools,
and kind of if that's

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.920
going to start happening
again, to teach kids to code?

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.420
LOUISE MIRRER: Well,
you know, there

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.650
are a lot of things going
on in schools today.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:08.520
So what tends to
happen is you have

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.239
a very prescriptive curriculum
that basically teaches you

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.900
what you need to know
with a view of passing

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.929
a benchmark exam.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:23.900
It's no secret that
kids-- maybe the pendulum

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.920
is swinging in a different
direction these days.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.330
But testing became
increasingly important.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.670
So I think what happened
was that you tended

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:36.920
to develop a curriculum that
would be focused on what you

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.232
needed in your benchmark
exams really early on,

00:34:40.232 --> 00:34:41.190
fourth and fifth grade.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.690
I mean, there always
were, but there

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.820
was a lot more freedom
I think for a teacher

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.070
to help kids explore.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.870
And that really
stopped happening.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.940
No Child Left Behind
was big legislation.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.400
I guess I'm trying to think.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.660
It came in with the second
Bush administration,

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.110
so not that long ago.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:06.580
But it really did alter the
picture for what kids learned.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.200
So the curriculum became
tighter and tighter.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.750
I think there was
a lot of pressure

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.250
on the New York City public
schools, probably not all that

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.616
long ago, maybe in
the last decade,

00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:22.500
to prepare students for
careers in new technology.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.690
And as a result they
started introducing

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.300
coding in the high
schools because the logic

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.750
was, you're at the tail end of
your career in public school.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.310
And now is the time
to teach you skills

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.750
that you would
need to get a job.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.030
But it's actually much too late.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.257
You'll all know that.

00:35:42.257 --> 00:35:43.340
You'll all recognize that.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.830
It's much too late.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.940
First of all, the
dropout rate, even

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.490
though it's improved
hugely-- I mean,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.150
there's a huge dropout rate.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.400
I don't know what the percent.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.691
I used to know the percentages.

00:35:53.691 --> 00:35:56.420
But it's pretty big.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.342
So there are a lot
of kids that just

00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:00.550
don't make it to high school.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:05.200
So if you haven't
started them on a path,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.830
they're never
going to get there.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.820
And I think that--
we certainly think

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.430
that introducing coding
for public school

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:17.930
kids in elementary school is a
way of saying stay in school,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.390
because you're already
on your way to a career.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:27.227
And I think basically that's--
I could go on and on talking

00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:29.060
about it because it's
sort of a hobby horse.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.850
But we feel very, very
strongly that this

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.640
is one of the greatest
things that we can do

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.880
is to give a New York City
public school-- and most

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.950
of the kids who
come to us are free

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.970
lunch, free breakfast kids.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.020
So they're really
getting an experience

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.820
that you would get
as a matter of course

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.320
in a private school That.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.040
You would not get
in public school.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.460
MALE SPEAKER: If you're also
interested in learning more

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.835
about what Google
is doing, there

00:36:53.835 --> 00:36:57.012
are K-12 programs run out
of NGDU that are done here

00:36:57.012 --> 00:36:57.970
in the New York office.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.391
I'm sure it would be easy to
connect to the people working

00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:02.890
on that stuff and give you more
of our perspective on what's

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:03.300
going on.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.966
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:37:03.966 --> 00:37:04.880
That' s a lot.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.190
LOUISE MIRRER: And by the
way, when we do an exhibition,

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:13.060
we don't sort of go cold turkey
when the exhibition ends.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.330
So every time we
do an exhibit, it

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.280
leaves an imprint on
whatever we do forever.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.510
So we expect that this will
be a part of our offerings way

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.780
beyond the exhibition.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.030
MALE SPEAKER: Oh that's great.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.863
I did not know that.

00:37:27.863 --> 00:37:29.529
That's awesome.

00:37:29.529 --> 00:37:30.070
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.030
Thank you for coming.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.060
I also didn't make it
to the exhibition yet,

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.320
but I heard your
comments earlier

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.850
about the lapse of
computer history

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.510
in New York in the 1990s
and how it came back.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:46.240
I wanted to ask
about-- certainly

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.560
it's true when we think
about the internet.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.590
I mean, all the internet
based computer history

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.450
was made out west and
came back to New York.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.590
But computational
finance, for example,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.340
has mostly been in
New York because

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.010
of the essential position of New
York in the financial markets,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.740
and to a lesser degree
Chicago and London

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.740
I guess, but certainly
not out west I think.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.340
So what kind of flavors
of computer history

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.690
are you representing
in the exhibition?

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.780
What kind of weights are
you giving to each one?

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.620
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah, well
business was-- even though

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.310
Thomas Watson Sr. Came out of a
marketing and sales background,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.070
he was at National
Cash Registers.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.440
I guess that was NCR,
the original NCR.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.440
And then IBM was International
Business Machines.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.980
And we do focus
very, very heavily

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:45.030
in the exhibition on the kind of
companionship between business

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.890
and New York, a focus
on business in New York,

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.450
and the need for
business machines,

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.700
the need for computers
to support business.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.250
What we basically
decided was look,

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.290
the 1980s is so much
more of a West Coast

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:09.060
story in terms of innovation
where really, we're

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.770
not going to-- I mean, there are
people who have argued with me,

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.670
and they're right, that
it's not like we fell off

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.350
the charts completely.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.870
But we just decided that the
1980s was not the New York

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:24.890
story.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:28.250
And we decided that we
would cover the 1990s

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:34.045
in a film, which actually Fred
Wilson persuaded me to do.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.340
He said without the
venture capital,

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.170
even if it was venture capital
to support the computer

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:48.330
industry on the West Coast,
what was happening on the West

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.260
Coast, it was still
coming from New York.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:58.110
And in the 1990s, companies
like JP Morgan, their largest

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:03.030
segment of investment was
going into the tech industry

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.480
in the 1990s.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.260
So we didn't abandon
the 1990s completely.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.270
I mean you're right.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.180
You're right, we could
have gone straight through.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.989
And business and
technological innovation

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:20.030
have always beem-- I mean,
we do make that point.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.110
When you come to the
exhibition, you'll see,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.860
we do make that point.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.320
But then again, in
the present time,

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.230
there are so many
other directions

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.710
that technology has
gone in in New York

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.880
that, though business is
still extremely important,

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.660
technology has
developed in ways that

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.280
are completely independent of
what's going on on Wall Street.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.750
And Wall Street isn't a
geographical location anymore

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:43.590
anyways.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.250
MALE SPEAKER: Hasn't been
for a long, long time.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.340
LOUISE MIRRER: I mean,
there's a name on the street,

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.250
but it's much more diffuse now.

00:40:55.034 --> 00:40:56.700
MALE SPEAKER: So this
idea about there's

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.074
being so many
parts of technology

00:40:58.074 --> 00:41:04.240
there are uniquely New York, one
of the sharpest CTOs I know who

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.580
has a whole bunch of interesting
problems in distributed

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.824
computing is the CTO
of Rent the Runway.

00:41:08.824 --> 00:41:10.490
And it seems to me
like that seems to me

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.380
to be kind of New York
in such a great way.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.570
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah,
that is terrific.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.890
MALE SPEAKER: It's
finance and it's fashion.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.910
LOUISE MIRRER: Yeah, that's
great, great example.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:25.720
AUDIENCE: So you've come back
a few times to the issues

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:30.360
surrounding the sort of flight
from the city and the Ford

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.810
to New York, drop dead era.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.000
And it seems also that sort
of the tech renaissance

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.840
coincides with the
reemergence of the city

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.990
as a desirable place
and people moving back.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:52.110
So I was curious with the
rise now of virtual reality

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.460
and telepresence and
self-driving cars,

00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:00.280
how do you see those things
impacting things going forward?

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.610
Do you think it will somehow
help concentrate things?

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.250
Do you think it will
defuse things again,

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:10.402
or kind of won't matter
that much to the city?

00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:12.360
LOUISE MIRRER: No, I mean
I think you're right.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.410
New York is back.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.960
And I think it really is back.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.190
And I think all of
those innovations--

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:26.670
I think the idea that you could
have a driverless car in New

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.972
York is so appealing,
unbelievably appealing.

00:42:28.972 --> 00:42:31.180
MALE SPEAKER: I think it
beats the drivered cars I've

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.650
seen in many cases in New York.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.114
LOUISE MIRRER: Make
it happen, now.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.370
I think New York has come back.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.080
It's really not a coincidence.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:49.970
We had leadership in the
city, certainly beginning

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.990
with the Giuliani
administration which

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.050
was very focused on making
New York a safe place again.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.390
You know, no accident that he
had a career as a prosecutor.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:03.760
And that's where he
decided to put his eggs.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.780
And then we had three terms
of Michael Bloomberg, who

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:15.200
was very, very focused on
enhancing the city's reputation

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.800
and ability as a
center for technology,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:23.530
including creating a whole new
campus that resides right here

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.760
in this building right now.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.230
And I think it would
be a great pity, given

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.520
that that campus
will be opening,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.987
I think in a couple of years--

00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:34.320
MALE SPEAKER: Next year I think.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.777
LOUISE MIRRER: In one year.

00:43:35.777 --> 00:43:37.860
I was saying with William
before, I'm watching it.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.920
I live actually across
the river from it.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.520
So I'm watching it out of
my bedroom window as it

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.970
sprawls, frozen sprawls.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.040
I think that we have
bet with that campus

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.940
and with your presence here
and with everything that's

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.210
happening, we've really
bet on the future

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.345
of New York as a center.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.630
I think that will only thrive.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.610
We don't know.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.190
I think what the
1964 World's Fair

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.420
told us was that we
really have no idea what

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.810
the future's going to bring.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.240
But I've always bet on
New York, and I would

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.116
continue to bet on New York.

00:44:16.116 --> 00:44:18.115
AUDIENCE: So your comment
about Cornell Technion

00:44:18.115 --> 00:44:20.530
is a perfect segue to what
I was going to ask about,

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.720
which is you've mentioned
Stanford a few times.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.870
And you're an alumna.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.250
And of course Stanford
was a big part

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.820
of why Silicon Valley happened
in Palo Alto, and Stanford

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.920
Research Park and HP and so on.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.090
What do you think the role has
been of-- we have fantastic

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.200
universities here, Columbia,
NYU, and further afield,

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.380
well obviously CUNY in the
city, but further afield

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.920
Princeton and Yale and so on.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.080
What has been the role there?

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.870
Could they have had
more of an impact

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:51.380
as Stanford did
on the West Coast?

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.310
And what do you think
looking forward,

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.390
especially with Cornell
Technion, what's

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.250
the role for them going forward?

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.580
LOUISE MIRRER: Well it's
another really great question.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.330
I was the provost for the
CUNY system for seven years

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.200
before I took my job at the
New York Historical Society.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:17.280
And the view at CUNY was that
great engineering had really

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.930
been coming out of
particular of City

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.920
College for a very long time.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.030
City College had a lot of
collaborations with Columbia.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.020
NYU had had an
engineering school,

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:32.260
but sort of closed it I
guess is the short form,

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.010
because it's true.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.500
So there have been great
opportunities I think.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.600
And I think Columbia and City
were pioneers in robotics

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.370
and did a lot of work.

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.700
Princeton obviously,
great examples.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.300
But they haven't been Stanford,
and they haven't-- you know,

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.880
I think it just goes back to--
I was an academic still for most

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.390
of my career.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.530
And I think that there has
been a sense among East Coast

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:15.190
academic institutions that
it's a little bit-- how can I

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.340
say this politely--
it's just not

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:24.320
right to have commercial
academic partnerships.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.320
And I think Stanford's
great strength

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.080
was to sort of pioneer
encouraging that.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.910
And so I think maybe
it's fair to say

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:38.610
that New York institutions
focus more on culture,

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.380
more on the humanities.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.940
They withdrew a little
bit with the closing

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.500
of NYU's School of Engineering.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.870
They withdrew from engineering.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:49.400
They didn't see
the opportunities.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.920
I mean, you look at
the corridor, Boston,

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.070
MIT for example, I
think it's probably

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.950
fair to say that New
York did lose ground.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:03.110
Could we have had relied
on the institutions

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:06.360
already in the city to have had
a homegrown-- you know, Cornell

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.270
Technion institution maybe?

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.340
But there's always
excitement around something

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.240
new and different.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.750
And PR means a lot.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.740
It means a huge amount.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.950
We spend a lot of
money on advertising

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.010
at New York Historical.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.910
So I'm the first person
to say, to announce things

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.840
to the world, we're
doing-- we've changed

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.910
our business-- is very useful.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:37.350
So I think the addition of a
new campus focused on technology

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.952
is a good thing.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:44.380
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I wonder, do you

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.920
think it's possible that
some of those universities

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.710
had a bit of "The Innovator's
Dilemma" class of problem?

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.570
When I worked at
Columbia, they received

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.822
a lot of technology transfer
and IP revenue from stuff

00:47:57.822 --> 00:47:59.030
coming out of medical school.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:02.180
And as a result there
was an institutional bias

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.210
towards pharma and
the relationships one

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.106
has with pharma and
medical device companies.

00:48:06.106 --> 00:48:08.480
And do you think it's possible
that there were situations

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:13.310
like that that positioned us
poorly as a city for this newer

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.830
computing industry?

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.913
LOUISE MIRRER: I think
that's a really good point.

00:48:16.913 --> 00:48:19.100
And now thinking back,
yeah, that was really

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:25.810
the main event I would
say at City College

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:26.960
were medical devices.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.140
So you're right about that.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.950
I mean, I hate to say it, but
I think it's probably true

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:38.630
that we just really
weren't thinking,

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.830
notwithstanding the fact that
Bloomberg started here and was

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:49.340
a huge as a company, was a
huge innovator in all respects,

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:53.250
I mean really in every respect.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:58.106
I think we just probably
missed the boat a little bit.

00:48:58.106 --> 00:48:59.980
MALE SPEAKER: I think
maybe one last question

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.063
and then we should let
Louise get a drink of water

00:49:02.063 --> 00:49:03.720
or something like that.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.440
AUDIENCE: What did
you wish you could

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.023
have fit into this
exhibition that you

00:49:06.023 --> 00:49:08.071
weren't able to include?

00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:10.770
LOUISE MIRRER: Gee, a lot.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:14.057
There are really a
lot of things that we

00:49:14.057 --> 00:49:16.390
would have liked to talk about
but didn't have the space

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.970
to do.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:25.240
We would have liked to have
done a whole arcade of games,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.630
because that is a part
of New York's history.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.500
We have one game
that you can play,

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.560
Space Invaders, which
was invented here.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.060
And it's a lot of fun.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.480
I think my colleagues
and I, we would

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.500
have loved to have had the
chance to recreate the energy

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:46.070
and excitement of
New York when that

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:51.070
was a big thing and a big focus
of social sort of collection

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.180
of people in the city.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.670
We would have loved
to have done that.

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.860
We also would have loved to
have had much more around art

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.010
and culture.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.790
We'd have loved to have had
a whole gallery showing some

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:11.480
of the great art that really
speaks to what computers

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.730
brought to contemporary art.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:18.290
We'd love to have done
those kinds of things.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:22.170
But you know, all
things being equal,

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.520
we would love to
have incorporated

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.260
one of our Google classrooms
into the exhibitions.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.290
By the way tonight,
we're launching drop in,

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.700
we're using our classrooms.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.140
Friday night were
pay as you wish,

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.230
which as a person
who counts the money,

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:41.480
I can tell you pay
as you wish means

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.550
you don't have to pay a lot.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.690
But because we're usually
flooded with visitors Friday

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.070
night as a result
of our openness,

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.360
we want to make the
museum open to anyone

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.360
whether they can pay
admission or not basically.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.630
But we are allowing people to
drop in our Google classrooms

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.500
and learn coding.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.760
So it would have been nice to
have had that embedded right

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.800
into the exhibition so people
would have had the proximity

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.100
to what's here and now.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.230
But yeah, I could go on forever.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.165
Thanks.

00:51:19.165 --> 00:51:21.690
MALE SPEAKER: So Louise, thank
you so, so much for coming.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.731
LOUISE MIRRER: Thank you.

00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:23.792
And thank you again.

00:51:23.792 --> 00:51:26.250
MALE SPEAKER: And go, go, go,
go to the New York Historical

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:26.830
Society.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.332
And pay full admission please.
