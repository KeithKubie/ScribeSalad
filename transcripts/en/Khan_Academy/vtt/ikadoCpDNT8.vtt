00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:02.998
So we have a matrix equation

00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:04.762
set up right over here,

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:07.244
we have matrix A times this

00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.278
plus matrix B times this

00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:10.903
plus matrix C times this

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:13.919
is equal to this two by two matrix.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:14.731
And the way it's set up,

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.311
it's a little bit of a puzzle.

00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.151
And I'll give you one clue as to what type

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.049
of matrices A, B, and C could be.

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.434
They're each either going to be

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:28.058
an Identity Matrix,

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:32.397
or a Zero Matrix.

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:34.378
So given that clue,

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:35.874
that each of these are either an

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:38.364
identity matrix or a zero matrix,

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:40.786
can you pause this video,

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:42.093
and essentially solve this puzzle?

00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:43.541
Which of these are identity matrices,

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:47.737
and which of these are zero matrices?

00:00:47.737 --> 00:00:49.305
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:51.203
So let's go entry by entry.

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.204
So if you look at this first entry

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.477
right over here,

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:58.082
how can we get a two
for this top left entry?

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.381
Well, let's see.

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.861
When we multiply, if any
of these are identities,

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:05.127
and essentially you just
get the value of the matrix,

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:06.372
if any of these are zero,

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.007
then essentially that
product doesn't get added.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.778
It's one way of thinking about it,

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:13.245
is that matrix won't matter anymore,

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.734
because it's going to
be multiplied by zero.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.246
So if A was a zero matrix

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:20.613
and B and C were identity matrices,

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.425
you would add one plus one to get to two.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:25.200
Just like oh, maybe that's the case.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.983
But it could be the other way around.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:30.118
It could be that A is identity matrix,

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:31.540
B is a zero matrix,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.245
and C is an identity matrix,

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:35.015
and you add one plus one

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:36.502
over there to get two.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:39.539
Or you could say that
maybe C is the zero matrix,

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.072
and B is the identity matrix,

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:42.997
and you add one plus one here.

00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:45.714
So really, all this is telling us is

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:47.415
two of these matrix,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:50.763
two of A, B and C are going
to be identity matrices,

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:52.210
and one is going to be a zero matrix,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.918
but we don't know which
one is which just yet.

00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:56.441
Any of them can be the zero matrix,

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.034
at least based on looking
at that first entry.

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:00.968
Now let's look at, I don't know,

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:03.257
let's look at this entry right over here.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:05.740
How can we add up to four?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.418
Well, let's see.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.787
Three, if this was an identity matrix

00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:10.871
and this was an identity matrix,

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:11.762
then you're going to,

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:13.298
then essentially you'll just be left with

00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:14.595
this matrix plus this matrix.

00:02:14.595 --> 00:02:17.033
This is going to be the zero.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:20.769
So three plus negative five.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.980
That is not equal to four.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.013
So both of these.

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.499
You can't have A and
B be identity matrices

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.834
and C be the zero matrix.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.899
So let's think about
other combinations here.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:38.154
So what about B and C being
the identity matrices,

00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.307
and A being the zero matrix?

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:41.463
In that situation,

00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:44.262
so A is the zero matrix,
that's not going to matter,

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:45.489
and we're essentially, when you multiply

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.392
B times this you're just
going to get this matrix,

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:49.744
and C times this, you're
going to get that matrix,

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.784
if B and C are identity matrices.

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:54.080
And so you have negative five plus one

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.823
would be negative four.

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:58.682
So that doesn't work either.

00:02:58.682 --> 00:03:02.681
So our last scenario is going to be

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.190
so we can essentially rule out B

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.608
as an identity matrix.

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:07.805
Because when we had B

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:09.866
be one of the identity matrices,

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:11.364
and we picked the other two options,

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:12.948
we still couldn't get to four here.

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:16.918
So B is going to be a zero matrix.

00:03:16.918 --> 00:03:18.491
And let's see if that works out.

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.615
A is identity, then A would be an identity

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:24.098
and C would be an idenitty matrix as well.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:27.726
So let's see if that actually makes sense.

00:03:27.726 --> 00:03:30.917
So if this right over
here is identity matrix,

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.984
and that over there is an identity matrix,

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:35.163
this whole thing simplifies to

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:39.778
one three four comma negative two

00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:44.242
plus one one three two,

00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:46.762
and it does indeed equal

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:48.042
one one plus is two,

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:50.062
three plus one is four,

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:52.942
four plus three is seven,

00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:56.942
negative two plus two is indeed zero.
