00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well what is the cos θ for example? Well, it's adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But the hypotenuse is just 1. So X/Xmax is just equal to the cos θ.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Similar thinking tells us that V/Vmax is equal to the sin θ.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now these two equations can be slightly rearranged to be written like this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, so we've learned that we can express position in velocity in terms of the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
maximum position in velocity and some trigonometric function of this weird angle θ.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Theta only shows up on this strange diagram I've drawn.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It seems like it might somehow correspond to time

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
since you know that as time progressed I moved along this diagram.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But before we can move any further, let's talk about radians.
