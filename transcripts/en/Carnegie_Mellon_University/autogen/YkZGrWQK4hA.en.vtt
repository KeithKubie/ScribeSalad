around here is a place where Dallas Fort
Worth got brighter so it's a place where

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590
Worth got brighter so it's a place where
 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.250

Dallas Fort Worth was growing now let's

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260
Dallas Fort Worth was growing now let's
 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.080
Dallas Fort Worth was growing now let's
zoom out to the whole US and what your

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090
zoom out to the whole US and what your
 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.360

red rings around each of the cities that
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.770
red rings around each of the cities that
are growing so for example Atlanta

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780
are growing so for example Atlanta

Dallas Fort Worth Houston Phoenix let's

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
Dallas Fort Worth Houston Phoenix let's
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.240
Dallas Fort Worth Houston Phoenix let's
compare that to China so let's go across

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250
compare that to China so let's go across
 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.740

the planet and take a look at Shanghai

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750
the planet and take a look at Shanghai
 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.670
the planet and take a look at Shanghai
Shanghai in 1984 was relatively compact

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680
Shanghai in 1984 was relatively compact
 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.750
Shanghai in 1984 was relatively compact
about eight million people and by the

about eight million people and by the

about eight million people and by the
time we get to present-day you can't see

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090
time we get to present-day you can't see
 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.179
time we get to present-day you can't see
where Shanghai own so back to 1984 you

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189
where Shanghai own so back to 1984 you

where Shanghai own so back to 1984 you
see all these separate cities and by

different story you see a little bit of

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899
different story you see a little bit of
 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.230
different story you see a little bit of
a green core but everything is red let's

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240
a green core but everything is red let's
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.130

and industrialization electrification

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929
and industrialization electrification
 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.219
and industrialization electrification
lots of population moving to the to the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229
lots of population moving to the to the
 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.649
lots of population moving to the to the
coasts and you see not just these red

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659
coasts and you see not just these red
 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.590
coasts and you see not just these red
rings but you see entire areas along the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600
rings but you see entire areas along the
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.020
rings but you see entire areas along the
eastern seaboard turn red now you can

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030
eastern seaboard turn red now you can
 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.870
eastern seaboard turn red now you can
compare that yet compared to the United

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
compare that yet compared to the United
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.270
compare that yet compared to the United
States where again you see a lot of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280
States where again you see a lot of
 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.770
States where again you see a lot of
places where it just stayed the same

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
places where it just stayed the same
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260
places where it just stayed the same
especially up in the Northeast it's a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
especially up in the Northeast it's a
 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.080
especially up in the Northeast it's a
much less pronounced effect than what we

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
much less pronounced effect than what we
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.560
much less pronounced effect than what we
see in China today
