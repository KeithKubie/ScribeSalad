00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys, check this out. I just got some super exciting news this morning.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.820
12 years ago, I sold my airplane to a guy in Canada,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.900
and he just sent me a message saying he's down here visiting in the United States, and he want's to take me for a ride.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.340
So that's what we're doing.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.680
How you doing George

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.400
Thanks man, it's good to see ya. How have you been?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.849
but I gotta tell you man there's
something about being back at a small

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.899
airport this is really a nostalgic you
know the weirdest feeling right now

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.329
George is like I didn't even leave it

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.079
this is Cessna 120 it's a
taildragger it's got the tail wheel in

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.390
the back and i sold it to this guy,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.760
George, 12 years ago and he's back in
town and asked me if I like to go for a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.879
ride so I said yes and we're going to go
up and play with the mountains and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.100
clouds today we're taking you along

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.960
I almost feel like I just jump in right
now and pick up exactly where I left off with it.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.100
the main reason I bought this airplane
almost 15 years ago is because

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.730
ironically it was cheaper to buy my own
airplane than it was to rent it from a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.190
school and build at the same amount of
flight time

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.160
so rather than going to a college or
university and paying thousands of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.390
dollars in tuition

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.800
i bought my own airplane taught myself
how to fly, challenged the exams and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.330
came up with all the same certifications
and ratings that I would have had

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.570
through a university but the difference
was I now had an airplane that i could

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.170
sell make my money back with put me in
the unique position of being one of the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.570
few airline pilots who had no student
loans

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.200
now these little hinge plates here move
up and down those are called ailerons

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.929
and that's what actually turns the
airplane from side to side

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.650
what's unique about the Cessna 120

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.940
is it doesn't have any flaps like
most typical airplanes do in fact any

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.510
other airplane that we look at around
here has flaps. flaps increase the drag

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
which slows you down but it also allows
you to fly slower before you fall out of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.600
the sky and makes a little bit easier to
land

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.290
so in addition to being a taildragger
having no flaps added another elemental

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
challenge to coming in and making a
perfect landing after a thousand hours

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.680
of flying this baby I felt like we were
connected

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
all right check it out guys, fuel guy is
here

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
Great Job.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.259
Luminary  traffic Charlie Foxtrot Juliet Yankee India, We're taking position runway 35 then

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.299
we'll be departing  to the South for
aerial maneuvering and over Mano Lake

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.140
alright, fingers crossed those cameras stay on.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.400
Logan area traffic Juliet Yankee India is over
Mano Lake only 7500 feet and below maneuvering.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.640
Here we go!

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.389
Ha ha ha, Like you've never been away. That's right.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.680
yeah, Nice shot.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.180
Sweet!

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.340
Coke Zero. We're taking this thing to zero gravity
and here's how it works

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.340
we go on and we go down

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.610
nice landing in the back there.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.660
Feel sick yet? Nope. I do.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.220
So Cool.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.360
My stomach is in knots right now.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.790
Ha ha ha ha.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.330
very nice!

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.200
We did it, We did it.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.670
Oh man, it's a good thing that this camera has stabilization

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.860
because that was so awesome i'm shaking

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.790
this has been such an exciting day we
did some really cool hammerhead stalls

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.880
and then we did some stalls and spins
and most of the battery went dead on one of

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.820
my GoPro so i just got my fingers
crossed that we got that footage after

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.850
all and what's really cool is I resigned
from the airline's a couple of months

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.520
ago and I was just starting to get the
itch to go flying again and then this

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.150
guy messaged me out of the blue to go
flying in my old airplane which has been

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.810
12 years since I've seen this thing guys
this is really special experience for me

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.010
and so glad you could be here and be a
part of it and see what we saw it was a

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.910
lot of fun and a little bit rusty on my
takeoffs and landings but we made it in

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.300
the end so big thanks to this guy George
thank you. You're welcome

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.480
making the trek down. Like you've never been away. Thanks for joining us in this video

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.890
and I'll see in the next adventure

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.200
talk to you then
