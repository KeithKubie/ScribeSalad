SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.360
My name is Sridhar.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.860
Thank you for joining
me here today.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.270
It's really great to have
I/O right in our backyard

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.520
at Shoreline again.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.280
It's a real highlight for me.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.510
I get to meet other engineers,
developers, and product leaders

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.280
from around the world, and
check out all the amazing things

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.250
that you're building.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.170
I've had a chance to
talk to some of you,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.290
and I'm in awe of all the
creativity that I've seen.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.170
You represent the best
developers that are out there.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.920
I'm sure that the creators of
the next Pokemon Go, Flipkart,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.840
or Airbnb are right
here in this audience.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.000
But creating a
successful business

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.860
takes more than just
an awesome product.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.650
All of you know that.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.940
I know of many great products
that aren't really around

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.020
because they're not
able to get enough users

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.210
or make enough money.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.180
So for my team here at Google,
our mission is crystal clear.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.460
What can we do to help you
turn your amazing products

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
into profitable businesses?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.860
Today, we're going to
discuss three things you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.890
need to focus on to get there.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.360
Number one is developing
seamless payment experiences.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.830
Number two-- earning more from
your apps, and number three--

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.900
growing by finding more
of your best customers.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.120
We'll share new
product innovations

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.660
in each of these areas to help
you delight your customers

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.650
and make your businesses
more successful.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.590
You've all heard the saying,
the customer is always right.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.030
They are.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.320
Consumer expectations are
higher than ever before.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.169
Consumers are looking
for more useful and more

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.810
delightful experiences
every single day.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.500
And with billions
of mobile users

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.140
globally, the opportunity in
front of us is pretty amazing.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.900
But the same is true for all
of your competition, too.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.010
And people have way more
choices now than ever before.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.070
Over five million apps,
many, many more sites

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.800
than that, hundreds of TV
channels, social media--

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.760
it goes on and on.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.700
So how are you
going to stand out

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.020
in the sea of amazing choices?

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.850
Jim Lyski, the CMO of CarMax
recently put it this way.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.100
Consumers used to evaluate
their experiences in silos.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.410
I'll compare CarMax against
all other used car dealers,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.200
and I'll compare Nordstrom
against all other clothing

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.930
retailers.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.320
Let's go back one slide, please.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.440
One slide forward.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.840
But now, people are clearly
taking those best experiences

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.240
from one industry and
demanding that they receive

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.580
the same or better everywhere.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.340
If they can order at a
very specific cup of coffee

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.400
and get it every
morning, why can't they

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.370
have an experience that's
bespoke and customized

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.460
for them when they buy a car?

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.470
That makes sense.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.860
With so much competition
and increasing customer

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
expectations, you can't
win customers with

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.160
a one-size-fits-all approach.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.260
This really calls
for new strategies

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.580
that puts the focus on
each individual customer.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.810
It means understanding your
customers and how they differ,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.470
it means creating growth and
monetization strategies that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.080
reflect those
insights, and it means

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.910
using tools that are
powerful and flexible enough

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.480
to act on that information.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.150
And this is where we
think we can help.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.690
Only Google can provide you with
the tools and technology that

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.880
help you put your customers at
the center of how you develop,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.630
earn, and grow
from your product.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.290
To start with, we're helping
you develop easier ways

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.150
to pay for your
products and services.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.140
How many of you have abandoned
a shopping cart online?

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.180
I did, just yesterday.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.480
Sometimes, it takes
really long to check out,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.010
or you don't have your
credit card handy.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.200
Either way, it's a pretty
frustrating experience,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.600
both for you-- you didn't
get what you wanted done--

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.030
and for the business
that lost your money.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.570
Paying online should be easy.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.800
And that's one of the
reasons why we've made

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.100
this a top priority for Google.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.130
Our open-platform
approach maximizes

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.840
the way in which people can pay
and the ways you can get paid.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.440
You want to provide a
seamless, consistent experience

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.610
across devices and
across platforms.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.130
Hundreds of millions
of people have already

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.350
saved their preferred
payment method,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.610
like a credit card or debit
card, to their Google account.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.150
And today, we're going to
announce a developer solution

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.090
that will allow people to use
these safeguards when checking

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.490
out in your apps,
sites, and more,

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.670
with just one single button.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.670
Payments are a critical part
of the conversion process,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.000
and we want to help you
make it as quick and as

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.410
easy as possible.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.490
And when you make it
easier for people to pay

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.910
for what they want, you win.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.350
It's really that simple.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.920
Next up-- earning
more from your apps.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.860
While some of the users
might make in-app purchases,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.550
let's face it-- the
majority never really do.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.280
And that's why earning
money with in-app ads

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.960
is the most common revenue
model for mobile businesses.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.690
AdMob helps you do that.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.650
Today, over a million apps
use AdMob to make money

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.800
on iOS and on Android.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.810
In fact, to date, we've paid out
over 3 and 1/2 billion dollars

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.700
in ads revenue to AdMob
developers like you--

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.340
more than any other ad network.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.450
And a truly customer-centric
monetization strategy

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.920
means you monetize different
user groups in different ways.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.860
For that, you need a solution
that's powered by insights--

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.390
one that offers great ad
formats and easy-to-use tools,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.764
and helps you scale to meet
increasing global demand.

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:51.180
And today, we're
going to show you

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.320
a completely reimagined AdMob,
rebuilt from the ground up,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.320
based on your feedback,
to give you all of that

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.260
and more for your apps.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.540
And last but not least--

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.860
growing your user base.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.730
Finding valuable
users isn't easy.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.710
Let me explain.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.700
I still love playing
"Words with Friends."

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.280
I know.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.124
And part of what I
love about the app

00:07:18.124 --> 00:07:20.540
is that my wife and I play
against each other, practically

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.550
every day.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.159
We usually have multiple games
going on any given moment.

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.700
And after playing
a turn in one game,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.110
you have to view an ad
before being able to play

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.790
a turn in another game.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.050
My wife is blessed
with a lot of patience

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.460
and will wait between each game.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.250
On the other hand, I paid
for the premium version

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.420
of the game that lets me
switch between unlimited games.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.240
My wife and I are two users
who interact with apps

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.030
in very different ways--

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.610
both valuable but
quite different.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.790
And as a developer, you need
to value us differently.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.590
To that end, you
need a marketing tool

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.710
that knows and can help you
pay the right amount when

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.960
acquiring new customers who
are like me or like my wife.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.770
That's why we introduced
Universal App Campaigns.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.780
We call it UAC for short.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.500
UAC makes it easy to find users
that not only install your app

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.950
but actually take
actions within the app.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.190
UAC reaches users
across iOS and Android

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.090
on each of Google's
billion-user properties

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.740
like Google Play, Google Search,
YouTube, Gmail, as well as

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.630
the millions of
sites and apps that

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.950
are on our Display Network.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.669
And rather than having to
manage multiple campaigns

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.460
and manually optimize each
one across these channels

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.300
and contexts, UAC does
this automatically

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.700
with one single campaign.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.810
It uses machine learning
and AI to improve and make

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.440
your campaign smarter
with every single app,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.150
and it learns from
countless signals

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.760
like where people are
engaging most with your app

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.250
and which [INAUDIBLE] works
best, all in real time.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.610
And with half a dozen
billion-user properties,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.320
we have the power to find your
users with both simplicity

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.690
and massive scale.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.180
And it's working.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.250
At I/O last year, we announced
that our app ads had delivered

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.490
over two million app installs.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.630
This year, I'm pretty
excited to share

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.580
that this has grown by a
factor of 2.5, to over five

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.160
plus billion app installs.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.000
Better yet, we are now
helping advertisers drive over

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.430
three billion in-app
actions per quarter.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.920
These are real people taking
real actions inside your app.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.770
Universal App Campaigns are
transforming the way developers

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.580
and marketers reach and
acquire the right users,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.380
and we truly think this is
the future of app growth.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.800
And to deliver more value
to developers and marketers,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.720
we are bundling all future
app growth innovations

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.420
right into UAC, making
it a one-stop shop

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.060
to get stuff done.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.170
I'm an engineer.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.170
I'm really proud of
these new innovations,

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.230
and I'm excited about how
they can help you understand

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.460
and better serve your customers
in order to stand out in what's

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.580
a really competitive ecosystem.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.680
So with that, I'd like
to bring up my team

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.500
to dive deeper into
these innovations,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.320
and we're going to kick
it off with Pali Bhat.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.202
Thank you.

00:10:25.202 --> 00:10:27.662
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.560
PALI BHAT: Thanks, Sridhar.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.480
Hello, everyone.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.774
I'm Pali, and I'm the product
lead for payments at Google.

00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:40.190
And today, I want
to share how you

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.890
can make it easy
for your customers

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.590
to pay for your
products and services

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.320
while giving them a
delightful experience.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.090
Now, your customers expect
to engage with you wherever

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.610
they are, whether it's on your
mobile website, on your app,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.210
or, in the future,
through the Assistant.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.090
Across all these services,
they expect checkout

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.600
to be fast and easy.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.510
Unfortunately, the
checkout screen

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.950
is the single biggest source
of friction in the purchase

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.590
experience today.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.340
In fact, the problem is
even more acute on mobile,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:29.960
where conversions are a full
1/3 lower relative to desktop.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.410
And a large reason for that
is because the existing

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.270
desktop checkout
experience, which

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.270
has been optimized for
a period of 20 years,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.900
simply doesn't work
well on mobile.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.060
Now, last year, we announced
our first set of solutions

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.760
to this complex issue
with Android Pay serving

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.030
as your passport for
giving your customers

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.820
a streamlined
checkout experience.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.050
We've seen tremendous progress
over the last 10 months,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.360
with Android Pay
now being available

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.430
in 10 markets around the world.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.000
I'm excited to
announce that we are

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.770
going to be bringing
Android Pay to even

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.500
more markets over
the next few months,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.185
including Brazil, Canada,
Russia, Spain, and Taiwan.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.620
We've also seen tremendous
momentum on the app side,

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.190
with thousands of top
developers having adopted

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.480
Android Pay to deliver
a seamless checkout

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.770
experience for their users.

00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.790
But we have the opportunity
to bring this experience

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.840
to even more users, and we
can do that in partnership

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.050
with all of you in the
payments ecosystem.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.100
So I'm excited to share one of
the first collaborations that

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.300
is going to deliver a very,
very meaningful number of users

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.250
a much, much better
checkout experience.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.590
And we've done this in
collaboration with our friends

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.310
at PayPal, where
PayPal users are

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.330
going to get the streamlined
Android Pay experience, simply

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.750
by linking the PayPal
account to Android Pay.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.596
So very excited about this.

00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:24.970
Let me show you
how this is going

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.280
to work on the mobile web.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.560
Thinking through what
I'm going to show you,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.170
all in terms of
buying something,

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.100
using Paypal and
Android Pay in action,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.110
I thought of my 8-year-old.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:44.750
Earlier this week, he had a
Dress Your Color Day at school.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.250
And dress your color
basically means

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.440
you have to pick
your favorite color

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.230
and wear your entire
outfit in that color.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.750
His favorite color is blue.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:59.270
So he had on blue jeans,
he had a blue top,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.490
he had a blue hoodie,
and, of course,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.830
because that wasn't
blue enough, he even

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.980
had a homemade blue cape.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.460
The only thing that was
missing was blue shoes.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.030
So I figured I'd surprise him
and buy him some blue shoes

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.640
today on Nike.com.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.250
Let me show you how this works.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.460
Can we switch to the
phone, please, for PayPal.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.250
Wonderful.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.750
So I'm going to bring up
Nike.com on the Chrome browser.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.570
And I've already
picked out the shoes.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.010
I got some sweet blue shoes.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.280
And when I'm ready
to check out, I'm

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.320
going to check out
with PayPal as usual.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:52.690
And you'll notice that that
gets Android Pay going,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.980
and instead of having to
enter my username or password,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.740
all I need to do is use
my fingerprint, authorize,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.620
and I'm done.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.250
Right?

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.760
No more entering
usernames or passwords,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.770
or even having to
create an account.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.180
You simply have to
use your fingerprint.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.330
Now, this experience
is going to be

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:22.300
coming to many of the
PayPal's millions of sites

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.850
over the coming few
months, and eventually

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:30.460
roll out to all of their sites
that have implemented PayPal.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.010
Now let's switch
back to the screen.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:35.930
Slides, please.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.630
Can you switch back
to the slides, please?

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.440
Awesome.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.090
We want to bring the same
experience to Visa checkout

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.115
and Masterpass users.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.620
So very excited about that.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.550
And as excited as
we are with all

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.090
of the progress we've
seen in Android Pay,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:12.510
we know that over 1
billion plus Google users

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.200
don't all have Android
Pay, or for that matter,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.840
any digital wallet.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.980
However, these
Google users frequent

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.630
popular Google products like
Google Play and YouTube,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.430
and as Sridhar
mentioned, have saved

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.854
hundreds of millions of
credit and debit cards

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:32.895
to their Google accounts.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.040
So today, we want to
announce a simple API for all

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.470
of you developers
out there to be

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.640
able to accept all of these
payment methods through Google.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.460
And developers who adopt
this API can enable

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.770
an easy-to-use checkout
experience for their customers,

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.040
and of course, as we
discussed earlier,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.230
reduce the amount
of friction, which

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.760
can lead to higher
conversions and more revenues.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.030
Best of all, this
new developer API,

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.260
which we call the
Google Payment API,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.991
is going to be free
for developers.

00:17:20.991 --> 00:17:23.356
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.640
Now, users don't need to
do any additional set-up.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.150
If they've already saved their
payment method to Google,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.580
they simply sign in and get
the streamlined checkout

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.760
experience.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.530
We've built this
Google payment API

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.840
on top of the Payment
Request standard, which

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.430
is now a W3C spec.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.730
Now, developers can simply add
this Pay with Google button

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.900
to their favorite
website or apps

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.580
by integrating with
the Google Payment API.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.730
I want to share with
you a little story

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.040
about this Pay with Google
button that you see here.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.380
This button is very similar to
the Sign In with Google button

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.920
that users are already used to.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.070
And our team was brainstorming
all of the different variations

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.830
that we could possibly
have on this button.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.900
And one of my absolute
favorite variants

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.240
was Treat Yourself with Google.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.707
Now, we didn't
land on that, but I

00:18:32.707 --> 00:18:34.790
think we've got a really
good alternative with Pay

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.289
with Google.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.470
Speaking of treating
myself, I wanted

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.800
to buy some cool new
headphones, and Wish is exactly

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.360
the place to get it.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.960
So we've been doing some work
with our friends over at Wish

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.930
to enable this cool Pay
with Google experience.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.270
Let me show you how it
works within the app.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.961
Can we switch to the
Wish phone, please?

00:18:57.961 --> 00:18:58.460
Thank you.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.435
Let me bring up the Wish app.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.310
I've already added the
cool black headphones

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.990
that I wanted to my cart.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.850
And whenever I'm
ready to pay, I simply

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.790
need to pick my form of payment.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.030
And here's the
special part, right?

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.680
I've got all of my payment
methods already attached

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.690
to my Google account.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.580
You see that Paypal
account that I just used

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.320
to buy those cool blue shoes?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.370
I have that.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.220
I have the MasterCard that
I've added to Android Pay.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.440
And of course, I have
my American Express

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.770
that I've saved to
my Google account.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.100
So I'm going to
continue, and that's it.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.600
I slide to pay.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.230
Right?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.620
I don't need to
enter any usernames,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.880
remember passwords,
or have to create

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.550
a new account on the Wish site.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.580
Pay with Google
makes it that simple.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.650
Now, the Wish team is
going to be rolling out

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.770
this Pay with Google
experience to all

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.640
of their users in
the coming weeks.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.790
But we've also been working
with a lot of the top developers

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.210
to enable this Pay with Google
experience to more users.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.620
So let's switch to
the slides, please.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.600
I'm excited to announce
that we're soon

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.110
going to have Airbnb, Deliveroo
DoorDash, and E24 integrated

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.820
with the Pay with
Google experience.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.100
And many more developers
are going to be coming soon.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.750
As you saw, this
experience is something

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.240
that's going to be available
not just in the United States

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.150
but also internationally, so
we're very excited about that.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.090
And if you're
interested in this API,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.735
you can sign up
for early access.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.000
That was Pay with
Google in action,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.200
across both the mobile
web and within apps.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.420
But we also talked
about how the Assistant

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.175
is going to be a huge new
platform for commerce.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.520
One of the things we've done is
work closely with the Assistant

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.680
team to bring the same great
Pay with Google experience

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.060
to the Google Assistant.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.800
Now, if you were
the keynote, I think

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.320
you might have
seen a demo already

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.830
of how this ordering experience
would look on Panera.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.860
Now, let's see that
demo in action again.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:50.698
So let's switch to the demo
that we have for the Assistant.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.120
And now, I'm going to be
trying this on the Assistant.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.110
It's a little bit noisy in
here, so if you can bear with me

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.960
and keep real quiet, we're
going to do this live.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.850
I'm going to bring
up the assistant,

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:19.400
and then try to order a sandwich
and some smoothies from Panera.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.520
Aha!

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:20.790
GOOGLE ASSISTANT
(AUTOMATED VOICE):

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.980
came back from a search.

00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:26.990
PALI BHAT: Talk to Panera.

00:22:28.402 --> 00:22:29.860
GOOGLE ASSISTANT
(AUTOMATED VOICE):

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.090
I found a couple of places.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.854
PALI BHAT: Ah!

00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:35.020
I think it's a bit noisy,
so I'm going to try again.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.847
Talk to Panera.

00:22:39.847 --> 00:22:41.305
GOOGLE ASSISTANT
(AUTOMATED VOICE):

00:22:41.305 --> 00:22:42.731
I found a couple of places.

00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.421
PALI BHAT: Mmm.

00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:47.170
Feels like we have a
lot of noise in here.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.880
Maybe we can all do it together.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.900
Let me try once more, because
this demo is really cool.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.820
Talk to Panera.

00:22:58.077 --> 00:22:59.535
GOOGLE ASSISTANT
(AUTOMATED VOICE):

00:22:59.535 --> 00:23:00.830
I found a couple of places.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.496
PALI BHAT: Argh!

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:03.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.970
The demo gods are
not smiling on us.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.070
So you know, we're going
to give it one more shot,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.810
because all of you, I think,
would be interested in this.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.590
And then, we'll switch
to a cool video we have,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.940
in case this exactly happens.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.189
Talk to Panera.

00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:20.689
Ah!

00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:21.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.182 --> 00:23:21.428
GOOGLE ASSISTANT
(AUTOMATED VOICE):

00:23:21.428 --> 00:23:22.875
I found a couple of places.

00:23:25.214 --> 00:23:26.380
PALI BHAT: So you know what?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.800
Why don't we actually
switch to the video,

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.350
and I'll show you a little bit
of how this works on the video.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.860
The cool thing about this
is, if you're actually

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.310
in a less noisy environment
than the Shoreline amphitheater,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.080
which hopefully
not many of you are

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.270
trying to use the
Assistant in, then

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.850
you can actually
get this experience

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:54.150
where you can interact with
the Assistant across both voice

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.460
and by interacting
with your touchscreen.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.970
And the cool thing
about it is, you

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.360
can switch seamlessly
between both the voice

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.060
and using the prompts that
the Assistant gives you.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.680
So in this particular example,
I could actually start ordering,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.490
let's say, the strawberry
poppyseed salad

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.700
without chicken, and then
switch to picking out

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.090
my favorite smoothie,
and then checking out.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.200
And what we've
done is integrated

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.760
the Pay with Google
experience into the assistant

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.270
so developers like you can have
a seamless experience for all

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.040
of your customers.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.460
And of course, just like you saw
with both the PayPal purchase

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.500
I showed you and the Wish
purchase I showed you,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.870
you simply confirm with the
fingerprint, and you're done.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.550
So we're very excited about
all of these new experiences

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.850
that we are bringing
to developers like you.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.070
We look forward to seeing
all of you integrating Pay

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.090
with Google into
your website's apps

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.390
or experiencing it
through the Assistant.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.672
With that, I'd like to
welcome Sissie Hsiao, who's

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.130
going to tell you
a little bit more

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.670
about how you can monetize
and grow your apps.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.479
Thank you.

00:25:11.479 --> 00:25:13.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:21.725 --> 00:25:22.850
SISSIE HSIAO: Hi, everyone.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.760
My name is Sissie,
and I am super

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.100
excited to be here
today to share with you

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.550
how Google will help you build
a more successful mobile apps

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.970
business.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.610
As Sridhar talked
about earlier, there

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.320
are over five million apps
across Android and iOS.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.680
And if I tell you that the
vast majority are free,

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.770
I'm sure most of you
won't be surprised.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.540
So what does it
mean for you, trying

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.270
to build a great
business, that users want

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.100
both free and amazing apps?

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.950
It means you need to think
very creatively about how

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.020
to monetize your
apps and make sure

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.060
that you're using
everything in your arsenal,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.410
including in-app purchases,
subscriptions, and now,

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.730
increasingly, advertising.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.000
Those of you who are using AdMob
know that putting in-app ads

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.530
is a primary and effective
way to monetize your apps.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.120
And we at Google
have been focused

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.230
on connecting you to millions
of Google advertisers

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.590
and over 40 ad networks.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.860
But just putting ads into
your apps isn't enough.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.040
How do you build a
product that delights

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.960
your users with ads experiences
that are just as good?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.670
In order to be
successful, you need

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.090
to be as thoughtful about
putting ads into your app

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.310
as the core user
experience itself.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.466
Let's take a major game
developer, ZeptoLab.

00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:54.090
I think they made
"Cut the Rope," which

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.400
I'm sure most of you
have played at one time.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.640
And they have a new
awesome game called "Cats."

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.090
They have been using the AdMob
platform for over five years

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.720
to monetize their apps, and they
use our full suite of formats,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.100
including interstitials,
rewarded video ads, and now,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.854
Native Advanced.

00:27:12.854 --> 00:27:14.520
And when they're doing
that advertising,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.620
they're very, very
careful to make sure

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.170
that the ads are
native to the game

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.790
and that they're
blending seamlessly,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.580
so that users who are playing
are still having a delightful

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.350
and fun experience.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.810
And it's working for them.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.870
Since they've added
rewarded ad units to "Cats,"

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.810
they have more than
tripled their AdMob revenue

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.070
in the past few months.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.120
ZeptoLabs is just one example.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.730
There are now over
1 million apps

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:47.890
using AdMob across Android and
iOS to monetize their apps,

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:53.740
and we have paid out more
than $3.5 billion to date

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.690
to app developers-- more
than any ad network.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.366
But we know you need more.

00:28:01.366 --> 00:28:03.490
We've been listening to
your feedback very closely,

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.460
and we've heard that you
need more from this product.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.090
You need three things.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.930
Number one, you want
a holistic picture

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.950
of your revenue, not just ads.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.420
How does ads relate
to the other revenue

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:20.110
streams like in-app
purchases and subscriptions?

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.620
Number two, you want
integrated app analytics.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.080
You want to see how
ads works and how

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.830
they affect the core user
experience of your app itself.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.490
And finally, number three, you
want better and more powerful

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:38.140
tools to manage and
maximize your revenue.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.660
Because of these needs, that's
what spurred my engineering

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.950
team to embark on a
mission and rebuild AdMob

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.840
from the ground up.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.480
And that's why,
today, I am incredibly

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.900
excited to share with you
the launch of a completely

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.840
rebuilt, re-imagined AdMob.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.668
Thank you.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.720
We wanted to give
you the tools you

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.480
need to build a successful
mobile apps business,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.720
and we're focused on building
an end-to-end monetization

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.390
platform that works for you.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.970
Our goals here are
primarily twofold.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.240
Number one, we want to
give you deeper insights

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.970
into how your ads behave,
and how they affect

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.350
the rest of your core app.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.990
And I'll show you
that in a second.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.930
And number two, we built
advanced control end

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.900
reporting, so that you
can maximize and optimize

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.400
your ads revenue.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.310
And finally, we built
all of these features

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.430
on a clean, modern, and
re-done user interface.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.180
However, instead of
just talking about it,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.945
let me show you a few screens
from the really new AdMob.

00:29:49.249 --> 00:29:50.540
Let me story-tell for a second.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.140
Suppose that I am a developer
at a mid-sized company, building

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.210
health and fitness apps.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.220
And when I first log
into the new AdMob,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.830
I see a completely
different user experience,

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.140
and what I see here
is a home dashboard.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.090
This home dashboard
is a quick snapshot

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.700
of all the apps in
my AdMob account,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.560
and it's telling me
important information

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.320
about how much I'm making
in each of these apps

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.360
across my entire business.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.450
If you see at the top, I'm
showing a new scorecard,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:22.160
which is telling me how
much I've made yesterday,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.680
this week, and this month.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.370
So it seems to be
a really useful way

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.730
for me to check how
my business is doing.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.040
If I scroll down, I'm
going to see a new card

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.010
on the left called the
App Performance Card.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.050
And here, we're
breaking out each

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.720
of the apps in this account
and telling me how much money

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.230
I'm making across my business.

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.970
If I look carefully,
though, it looks

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:49.100
like FitMobber, which is my
best app, has been tanking.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.871
It's dropped over $200
yesterday, which is a disaster,

00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:53.870
because this is the one
that's growing the best.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.760
I need to figure out
exactly what's going on.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.650
I dig in, I drill in,
and click on that.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.340
And let me jump
out of story mode

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.130
for a sec to explain to
you what you're seeing now.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.530
You're now seeing a completely
new app overview dashboard.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.300
And this app overview
dashboard is a dashboard

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.490
designed to show you
exactly what's going on

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.290
within a particular app--

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.844
in this case, in our demo.

00:31:16.844 --> 00:31:18.260
This is the FitMobber
app, and you

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.217
can see on both the
left hand and the top

00:31:20.217 --> 00:31:22.550
that it's showing you that
all the numbers you're seeing

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.280
are related to FitMobber.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.060
And furthermore, in the
middle, I see two new reports--

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.320
on the left, with the colored
bars, a total revenue report.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.770
And this is showing me not
just adds revenue from AdMob.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.430
It's also layering in in-app
purchases, subscriptions,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.740
or other in-app
monetization models

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.610
right into that bar chart,
so you can see at a glance

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.830
how my overall
revenue is trending

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.610
across all of these
different revenue streams.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.540
On the right, I see also a
completely new user metrics

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.580
card, and this
card is showing me

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.230
important health
metrics of my core app,

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.500
including sessions
and retention.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.850
What we've done to enable
this is weave together

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.910
Google Analytics for
Firebase directly

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.280
into the core of AdMob.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.780
We know that ads are a critical
part of your user's experience.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.560
You cannot build an amazing app
without understanding how ads

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.610
behave in the app, and you
can't monetize well without

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.110
understanding how users
behave in your app.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.120
So for the first time
ever, AdMob and Firebase

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.700
can share data across
these two platforms

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.390
to help you gain deeper insights
and build a more successful

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.871
mobile apps business.

00:32:42.871 --> 00:32:43.370
Cool.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.200
Let me get back to
my story and tell you

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.560
how I can use this to
fix my FitMobber issue.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.140
So if I look at these
numbers on the left,

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.270
it looks like the blue
bars have been shrinking,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.820
and the blue bars are
actually my ads revenue.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.227
So that makes sense.

00:32:57.227 --> 00:32:59.060
That's why I saw the
two-hundred-dollar drop

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.590
yesterday.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.660
And if I look on the
right, user metrics

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.240
have also taken a
turn for the worse.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.510
In fact, sessions per user and
session duration are both down.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.750
That means that users
are using the app less

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.690
and walking away more.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.760
I go to talk to my team and
ask them what is going on,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.170
and I learn that they put a
new ad unit right at the screen

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.042
in the app that is right
before users work out,

00:33:24.042 --> 00:33:26.000
which means that they
were just deterred enough

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.750
to stop working out and
stop subscribing to my app.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.290
That was a really bad placement
for that ad, for sure.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.480
I move it, and I wait a week.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.040
I hop back into the same
screen in the new AdMob,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.570
and wow, everything is
back and up into the right.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.860
Business is now
booming at FitMobber,

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.090
and I am a global company.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.530
I'm also using an advanced
feature called mediation.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.860
Mediation is very simple.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.710
It's basically a
set of rules that

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:02.220
allow me to send my ad units
to different ad networks.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.370
And if you're a bigger
app publisher business,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.690
this is really
important for you to use

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.980
and to maximize your revenue.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.110
Managing mediation
in the new AdMob

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.000
is easier than
ever with a feature

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.790
called mediation groups.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.900
And what mediation
groups lets you do is,

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.020
it lets you set up a single
set of mediation rules,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.940
and then apply it across apps,
ad units, or geographies.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.170
I'll give you an example.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.070
Let's say that FitMobber is
doing really well, especially

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.300
in Japan.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.489
And in Japan,
especially, you want

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.610
to send your ads to different
regional ad networks,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.500
because there are a
few ad networks there

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.429
that want to buy ads
just for users there.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.159
Using mediation groups, it's
now very easy to do this.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.300
I set up one mediation group
for Japan with my rules.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.540
And after that, it's quite
trivial to add ad units.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.139
I can add and units
to this group,

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.830
and it will start automatically
obeying the rules.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.860
I can also, if I change my
mind and want to reorder or add

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.280
different ad networks,
add that in one place

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.680
or change it in one place
and have it automatically

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.490
apply to all of my
ads in my Japan app.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.040
Very simple and very powerful.

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:19.740
At this point,
I've talked to you

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.120
a lot about how
Google is helping

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.810
you build a great in-app
advertising business.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.840
I want to pivot
completely and talk

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.810
about another extremely
crucial part of building

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.410
a successful business,
maybe the most crucial part.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.170
And that is growth.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.230
You cannot have a successful
mobile apps business without

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.230
having a successful
growth strategy.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.690
And in order to do that, you
have to answer two questions.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.970
Number one is, who
are my best users?

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.970
And number two is,
where can I find them?

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.830
Where are the most
effective channels

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.920
that I can show them my app and
get them to download and try

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.390
it?

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.280
I'm excited to share that Google
is working on these problems,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.660
and we have quite a few features
to share to solve these growth

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.940
challenges.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.210
Let me start with Google Play.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.960
Android is now active
with over two billion

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.840
monthly active
users every month,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.180
and Google Play is in over 190
countries around the world.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.670
People turn to
Google Play every day

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.720
to discover great apps
and games to enjoy.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.625
And we find increasingly that
besides searching in the Play

00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:36.250
Store, which they
definitely still do--

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.050
they search for the
apps that they want--

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.780
they are also responding
and downloading

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.090
apps that we're recommending
to them as they're

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.490
browsing the Play Store.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.540
Because of that and to help
you find those users who

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.090
are browsing and discovering
their next favorite app

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:57.170
in the Play Store, we are
announcing new ad placements

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:03.050
in the home and app listings
pages of the Google Play Store.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.660
These ad units will
only be available

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.600
exclusively to
Universal App Campaigns,

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.660
and they'll help you reach
users right there in that mode

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.520
of discovery in the Play Store.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.540
Obviously, besides
the Play Store,

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.720
there are many other channels
where people are discovering

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.580
their next favorite app.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.510
And that's why we built
Universal App Campaigns or UAC

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.310
as we like to call it.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:33.480
UAC helps you reach people
across multiple billion-user

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.180
properties, including Google
Play, Google Search, YouTube,

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.960
Gmail, and millions of apps
and websites across the Google

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.730
Display Network.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.930
In order to use UAC--
it's very easy--

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.920
you tell us what app you want to
promote, you tell us the price

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.600
that you want to
pay per install,

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.550
and you give us a little
bit of information

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:58.920
to help us create ads
like text, images, videos.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.560
We then take all of
that information in UAC,

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.200
and we use machine
learning to deliver

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.440
the maximum number of
installs to you at the price

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.050
that you've specified.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.690
And we do this by
automating and optimizing

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.280
every single bit of
the advertising itself,

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.960
including what the ads look
like, where to put the ads,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.830
and also more importantly,
what to bid for each impression

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.740
and click, so that we hit that
target price that you want

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.970
while delivering the maximum
number of installs for you.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.220
So wherever your
users are and whatever

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.890
they're doing, whether
they're searching on Google

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.040
or watching videos on
YouTube, only Google

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.110
has the breath of
channels to help

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.140
you find your most
valuable users,

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.890
right when they want
to download your app.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.740
Universal App Campaigns
has been helping companies

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.190
like Headspace, which is a
very popular meditation app,

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.670
improve health and
happiness around the world.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.470
And according to
Robert from Headspace,

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.680
Universal App Campaigns
has saved their team time

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.720
and driven results.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.630
Translation-- more
users that use and love

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:10.200
the app in less time.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.110
However, like Headspace,
we all know that growth

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.240
isn't just about installs.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.380
Many users will install
your app and not go along

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.510
and spend or engage or
potentially even open it.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.120
You need to spend your
acquisition dollars wisely

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.760
to find your most valuable
users, the ones that

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.470
will engage, spend, activate,
and enjoy your apps.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.000
Because of that,
I'm also extremely

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.480
happy that we're announcing
two new bidding options

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.610
in Universal App Campaigns--

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.570
target CPA or Cost Per
Acquisition, and target ROAS,

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.210
or Return On Ad Spend.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.120
And these bidding strategies
will help you profitably

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.010
acquire high-value users.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.170
Or put more simply,
they help you

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.270
pay more for users
who will pay you more,

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.890
and pay less for users who
we think will pay you less.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.650
I'll give you a very
concrete example.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.140
My husband and I are
both mobile gamers,

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.090
and we both love this
new game by Nintendo

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.830
called "Fire Emblem Heroes."

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.160
I don't know if you've
played it or not.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.930
It's a tactical RPG, and
basically, in this game,

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.640
you collect heroes.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.280
And the way you like heroes
is through exchanging

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.711
a virtual currency called orbs.

00:40:24.711 --> 00:40:26.210
Now, I'm sure most
of you who played

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.760
games know that the way to
get orbs is usually two ways.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.700
One is, you buy them
with real money,

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.640
and number two is, you can, sort
of, grind it out in the game

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.760
and earn them over
the course of playing.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.850
Now, I am really very impatient
and also very competitive,

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.620
so I have no issues spending
over $100 buying orbs

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.410
to collect my favorite heroes.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.560
My husband, on the other
hand, is more principled.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.560
He wants to grind it out,
and he's just a little cheap.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.210
So he's willing to spend
maybe, at most, $5.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.700
For an app developer
like Nintendo,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.960
they should be thinking about
acquiring players like me

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.910
at a higher price
point than players

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.647
like my husband who spend
at a lower price point.

00:41:10.647 --> 00:41:12.230
And with these new
bidding strategies,

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.370
they can do exactly that.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.630
And finally, at the core of
any smart growth strategy

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:23.750
is measuring whether you're
spending your acquisition

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.920
dollars wisely.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.910
And we know that many of you are
using third-party measurement

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:32.630
providers to measure the
attribution of your installs.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.550
And that's why today,
I'm happy to announce

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.480
that Google is launching a
completely new app attribution

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.070
program.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.540
And what this
program does is, it's

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.050
designed to integrate data
from the seven global companies

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.830
that you see on the
slide, right into AdWords.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.610
And our goal is to create
consistency and reliability

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.720
of the data integration and
the results that you'll get.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.970
We have also
streamlined the flow

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.060
so it's incredibly easy now
to get these app measurement

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.340
companies up and running
if you're using AdWords.

00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:09.280
With that, I want to thank
you all for the opportunity

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.620
to be here and share all
of these great features

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.540
that my team has
been working on.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.650
Please try them out, and please
share your feedback with us.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.800
And with that, I'd like
to turn it back to Sridhar

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.621
to close with his
final thoughts.

00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:22.120
Thank you.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:25.914 --> 00:42:27.455
SRIDHAR RAMASWAMY:
Thank you, Sissie.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.910
You know what's really exciting
about presenting to all of you?

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.600
We know that we have the most
innovative thinkers in the app

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.460
world right here.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.920
We know that many
of the products that

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.580
redefine how we communicate,
shop, and stay entertained

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.110
are going to be done by you.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.660
That's why we find
it so exciting.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.330
And we also know that in
order to turn these products

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.330
into successful businesses,
it's more important than ever

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:59.170
before for you to figure out
how to simplify the payments

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:03.250
process, how to tailor your
ad experiences to generate

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.380
the maximum amount of
revenue and to find

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.530
the right users for your app.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.750
And those of you that
do this are really

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.736
the ones that are
going to be successful.

00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:15.610
We have a number of
great follow-up sessions,

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.390
including one on payments,
right after this.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.570
They're up here.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.300
Thank you all for
listening to us.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.800
Take care.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.850
[APPLAUSE]
