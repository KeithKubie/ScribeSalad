want you to have to go back to your
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.910
want you to have to go back to your
notes and remind yourself what we talked

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
notes and remind yourself what we talked
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.340
notes and remind yourself what we talked
about each week and if you do you should

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
about each week and if you do you should
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.750
about each week and if you do you should
be able to get all the questions there

biologists are very fortunate and that
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549
biologists are very fortunate and that
they have a lot of structures of viruses

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
they have a lot of structures of viruses
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.560
they have a lot of structures of viruses
and that is going to lead our discussion

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
and that is going to lead our discussion
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260
and that is going to lead our discussion
today and I brought a few viruses with

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
today and I brought a few viruses with
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.889
today and I brought a few viruses with
me today which you've probably seen

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

aware this is not bad in terms of the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660
aware this is not bad in terms of the
 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.969
aware this is not bad in terms of the
structure as you will see it's

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979
structure as you will see it's
 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.980
is completely wrong
so we'll see by the end of today whether

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990
so we'll see by the end of today whether

you can see why it's got eyes - of
 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.180
you can see why it's got eyes - of
course they all have my eyes I don't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190
course they all have my eyes I don't
 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.290
course they all have my eyes I don't
know why

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300
 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.499
so viruses are built to be functional

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509
so viruses are built to be functional
 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.070
so viruses are built to be functional
and beautiful as well and that's of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080
and beautiful as well and that's of
 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.650

inexpensive and beautiful so all of that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550
inexpensive and beautiful so all of that
 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.770
inexpensive and beautiful so all of that
applies to viruses they're cheap and X

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
applies to viruses they're cheap and X
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.550
applies to viruses they're cheap and X
and beautiful so the virion proteins

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
and beautiful so the virion proteins
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.950
and beautiful so the virion proteins
that make up virus particles have

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960
that make up virus particles have
 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.050
that make up virus particles have
several functions they protect the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060
several functions they protect the
 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.190
several functions they protect the
genome so inside these virions or viral

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200
genome so inside these virions or viral
 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.960

capsid proteins is to protect those
 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.520
capsid proteins is to protect those
genomes so after they have to form a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
genomes so after they have to form a
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.240
genomes so after they have to form a
stable protective shell they have to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
stable protective shell they have to
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.339
stable protective shell they have to
recognize the nucleic acids specifically

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349
recognize the nucleic acids specifically
 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.199
recognize the nucleic acids specifically
you don't want cellular nucleic acids

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209
you don't want cellular nucleic acids
 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.380
you don't want cellular nucleic acids
going in there and they in some viruses

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
going in there and they in some viruses
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.089
going in there and they in some viruses
that have membranes around them they

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099
that have membranes around them they
 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.140
that have membranes around them they
have to interact with those membranes

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
have to interact with those membranes
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.760
have to interact with those membranes
when the viruses infect the cell they

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770
when the viruses infect the cell they
 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.440
when the viruses infect the cell they
have to deliver the genome to the cell

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450
have to deliver the genome to the cell
 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.900
have to deliver the genome to the cell
they have to bind receptors as we'll see

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910
they have to bind receptors as we'll see
 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.290
they have to bind receptors as we'll see
next time they have to unquote they have

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300
next time they have to unquote they have
 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.059
next time they have to unquote they have
to open up in some way to release the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069
to open up in some way to release the
 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.030
to open up in some way to release the
genome sometimes they have to induce

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040
genome sometimes they have to induce
 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.160
genome sometimes they have to induce
fusion with membranes if the virus has a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
fusion with membranes if the virus has a
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.809
fusion with membranes if the virus has a
membrane around it that has to fuse with

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819
membrane around it that has to fuse with
 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.440
membrane around it that has to fuse with
the host cell membrane and the virus has

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
the host cell membrane and the virus has
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360
the host cell membrane and the virus has
to move to the right place in the cell

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
to move to the right place in the cell
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.670
to move to the right place in the cell
and that's different depending on what

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
and that's different depending on what
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.020
and that's different depending on what
kind of virus it is could be the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030
kind of virus it is could be the
 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.119
kind of virus it is could be the
cytoplasm it could be the nucleus and

one thing that's very important to

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960
one thing that's very important to
 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.990
one thing that's very important to
realize is that viruses are not inert

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
realize is that viruses are not inert
 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640

when an unfavorable energy barrier is

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070
when an unfavorable energy barrier is
 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.970
when an unfavorable energy barrier is
surmounted and that usually happens

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980

want you to think about is that viruses

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600
want you to think about is that viruses
 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.290

that play active roles in the delivery
 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.600
that play active roles in the delivery
of the genome into the cell so let's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
of the genome into the cell so let's
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.850
of the genome into the cell so let's
explore metastability a little bit it's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860
explore metastability a little bit it's
 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.830

the ability of a non equilibrium state

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840
the ability of a non equilibrium state
 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200
the ability of a non equilibrium state
to persist for a long time so viruses

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210
to persist for a long time so viruses
 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.570
to persist for a long time so viruses
are non equilibrium States or in a non

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580
are non equilibrium States or in a non
 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.820
are non equilibrium States or in a non
equilibrium state and they can persist

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830
equilibrium state and they can persist
 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.980
equilibrium state and they can persist
in that state for a very long time until

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990
in that state for a very long time until
 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.370
in that state for a very long time until
they reach the right trigger and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380
they reach the right trigger and
 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.230
they reach the right trigger and
metastability is usually a consequence

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240
metastability is usually a consequence
 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.720
metastability is usually a consequence
of a very slow phase transformation so

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730
of a very slow phase transformation so
 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.060
of a very slow phase transformation so
you could keep a virus somewhere for

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070
you could keep a virus somewhere for
 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.890
you could keep a virus somewhere for
eons if you could eventually it would

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900
eons if you could eventually it would
 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.210
eons if you could eventually it would
reach its minimum free energy

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220
reach its minimum free energy
 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.800
reach its minimum free energy
conformation an example is diamonds at

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810

room temperature they're metastable

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310
room temperature they're metastable
 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.670
room temperature they're metastable
because they transform very slowly to

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680
because they transform very slowly to
 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.430
because they transform very slowly to
graphite but if you heat them up we

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440
graphite but if you heat them up we
 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.469
graphite but if you heat them up we
increase the rate of this transformation

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479
increase the rate of this transformation
 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.780
increase the rate of this transformation
and the diamond goes to graphite so

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790
and the diamond goes to graphite so
 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.760
and the diamond goes to graphite so
viruses are the same way we have to give

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770
viruses are the same way we have to give
 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.580

them a way to go quickly through the
 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230
them a way to go quickly through the
phase transformation and that occurs

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240
phase transformation and that occurs
 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.560
phase transformation and that occurs
during entry of the particles into cells

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570
during entry of the particles into cells
 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.779

this free energy state is gained when we

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:35.999
this free energy state is gained when we
 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.389

it has to be stable but it must also
 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.309
it has to be stable but it must also
come apart so it has to be both so we

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319
come apart so it has to be both so we
 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.309
come apart so it has to be both so we
call it metastable sort of a paradox but

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319
call it metastable sort of a paradox but
 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.989

assembly viruses are actually
 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:13.669
assembly viruses are actually
spring-loaded to unquote the genome but

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:13.679
spring-loaded to unquote the genome but
 

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.619
spring-loaded to unquote the genome but
they do so only under the right signals

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629
they do so only under the right signals
 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:16.819
they do so only under the right signals
they don't want to release the genome

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:16.829
they don't want to release the genome
 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.350
they don't want to release the genome
when they're floating around and in the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360
when they're floating around and in the
 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.629
when they're floating around and in the
atmosphere or in your digestive tract

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639
atmosphere or in your digestive tract
 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.059

they want to release the genome upon the
 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.189
they want to release the genome upon the
proper signal and that's the same signal

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199
proper signal and that's the same signal
 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.109
proper signal and that's the same signal
that gets the virion over this energy

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119
that gets the virion over this energy
 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.719
that gets the virion over this energy
barrier so when we assemble vo yawns we

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729
barrier so when we assemble vo yawns we
 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.299
barrier so when we assemble vo yawns we
put energy into the structure and when

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:32.309
put energy into the structure and when
 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.600
put energy into the structure and when
we uncoated energy is used for

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610
we uncoated energy is used for
 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.529
we uncoated energy is used for
disassembly so there again they're

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539

some cases actually replication and

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:45.239
some cases actually replication and
 

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:46.639
some cases actually replication and
transcription of the genome occurs

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:46.649

within the particle we'll see some

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:48.119
within the particle we'll see some
 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.139
within the particle we'll see some
examples of that some many viruses open

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:51.149
examples of that some many viruses open
 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.049
examples of that some many viruses open
up and the genome comes out but some the

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:54.059
up and the genome comes out but some the
 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:55.999
up and the genome comes out but some the
replication takes place within it so

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009
replication takes place within it so
 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.979

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:39.719
the structure of the virion
 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.390
the structure of the virion
today the structure of the

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400
today the structure of the
 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.580
today the structure of the
article which is created by the

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590
article which is created by the
 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.350
article which is created by the
symmetrical arrangement of very

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360
symmetrical arrangement of very
 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.409
symmetrical arrangement of very
identical proteins to provide maximal

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419
identical proteins to provide maximal
 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.040
identical proteins to provide maximal
contact and non covalent bonding so this

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050
contact and non covalent bonding so this
 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.129
contact and non covalent bonding so this
is very important symmetry and non

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139
is very important symmetry and non
 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.350
is very important symmetry and non
covalent bonding non covalent C allows

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360
covalent bonding non covalent C allows
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.020
covalent bonding non covalent C allows
you to take apart the very ons to let

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.030
you to take apart the very ons to let
 

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.870
you to take apart the very ons to let
the genome out the particle has to

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880
the genome out the particle has to
 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.790
the genome out the particle has to
deliver the genome so that's one of its

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800
deliver the genome so that's one of its
 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.400
deliver the genome so that's one of its
other function structure is to maintain

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:07.410
other function structure is to maintain
 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.350
other function structure is to maintain
the genome and then to deliver it into

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360
the genome and then to deliver it into
 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.779
the genome and then to deliver it into
cells and this is made possible because

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:11.789
cells and this is made possible because
 

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.060
cells and this is made possible because
we don't have covalent bonds holding all

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.070
we don't have covalent bonds holding all
 

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.939
we don't have covalent bonds holding all
the proteins together so this is an

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:16.949
the proteins together so this is an
 

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:18.770
the proteins together so this is an
amazing accomplishment to make a

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:18.780
amazing accomplishment to make a
 

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.409
amazing accomplishment to make a
particle like these without covalent

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419
particle like these without covalent
 

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.779
particle like these without covalent
bonds and that's done by taking one or a

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:23.789
bonds and that's done by taking one or a
 

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:26.029
bonds and that's done by taking one or a
few proteins and repeating them and

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039
few proteins and repeating them and
 

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.710
few proteins and repeating them and
having those proteins interact really

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720
having those proteins interact really
 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.300
having those proteins interact really
well with one another okay so some

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.310
well with one another okay so some
 

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.490
well with one another okay so some

tissue sections you know there's very
little contrast in that so they have to

00:12:55.489 --> 00:12:55.499
little contrast in that so they have to
 

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.769
little contrast in that so they have to
be stained but they can't use just any

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779
be stained but they can't use just any

stage so you stain with those materials

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:21.689
stage so you stain with those materials
 

00:13:21.689 --> 00:13:25.249
stage so you stain with those materials
the resolution is not very good so the

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:25.259
the resolution is not very good so the
 

00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:27.199
the resolution is not very good so the
the smallest structures you can see an

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:27.209
the smallest structures you can see an

contrast an alpha helix of a protein is
10 angstroms in diameter so you cannot

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:35.489
10 angstroms in diameter so you cannot
 

00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:38.439
10 angstroms in diameter so you cannot
see individual protein chains obviously

00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:38.449
see individual protein chains obviously
 

00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:41.659
see individual protein chains obviously
so no detailed structural interpretation

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:41.669
so no detailed structural interpretation
 

00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:44.659
so no detailed structural interpretation
is possible and so typically there are

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:44.669
is possible and so typically there are
 

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:48.079
is possible and so typically there are
two ways you can stain viruses on the

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:48.089
two ways you can stain viruses on the
 

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:50.900
two ways you can stain viruses on the
left is shown one way by putting the

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.910
left is shown one way by putting the
 

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.909
left is shown one way by putting the
stain covering the entire particle so

00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:52.919
stain covering the entire particle so
 

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.129
stain covering the entire particle so
you put the viruses on a grid shown in

00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139
you put the viruses on a grid shown in
 

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:57.229
you put the viruses on a grid shown in
orange you put the stain on top which is

00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:57.239
orange you put the stain on top which is
 

00:13:57.239 --> 00:13:59.119
orange you put the stain on top which is
this gray material and then the the

00:13:59.119 --> 00:13:59.129
this gray material and then the the
 

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:01.009
this gray material and then the the
electron microscope bombard it with

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019
electron microscope bombard it with
 

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:03.529
electron microscope bombard it with
x-rays and wherever there is a electron

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:03.539
x-rays and wherever there is a electron
 

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:05.269
x-rays and wherever there is a electron
dense material the x-rays don't get

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279
dense material the x-rays don't get
 

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.919
dense material the x-rays don't get
through the electrons don't get through

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:06.929
through the electrons don't get through
 

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.159
through the electrons don't get through
and this is a kind of image that you can

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:10.169
and this is a kind of image that you can
 

00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:12.590
and this is a kind of image that you can
pick up by doing that so when you do

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600
pick up by doing that so when you do
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.239
pick up by doing that so when you do
this you stay in the background and

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:14.249
this you stay in the background and
 

00:14:14.249 --> 00:14:16.729
this you stay in the background and
which gives detail to the particle so

00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:16.739
which gives detail to the particle so
 

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:18.439
which gives detail to the particle so
this stain is molding around the

00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:18.449
this stain is molding around the
 

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:20.509
this stain is molding around the
particle and it's staining it's making

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519
particle and it's staining it's making
 

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:21.160
particle and it's staining it's making
it outline

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.170
it outline
 

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.139
it outline
the particle but when you cover the

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:23.149
the particle but when you cover the
 

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:25.269
the particle but when you cover the
particle with stain you get both the top

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279
particle with stain you get both the top
 

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.759
particle with stain you get both the top
and the bottom at the same time of the

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:27.769
and the bottom at the same time of the
 

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.680
and the bottom at the same time of the
particle so you have a mixed image and

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:29.690
particle so you have a mixed image and
 

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.759
particle so you have a mixed image and
and that is often making it difficult to

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:32.769
and that is often making it difficult to
 

00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:36.340
and that is often making it difficult to
distinguish fine structures so typically

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:36.350
distinguish fine structures so typically
 

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.720
distinguish fine structures so typically
what's done is to only bring the stain

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:37.730
what's done is to only bring the stain
 

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.060
what's done is to only bring the stain
up about half way as shown here you get

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.070
up about half way as shown here you get
 

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.069
up about half way as shown here you get
only one part of the particle and that

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079
only one part of the particle and that
 

00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.180
only one part of the particle and that
gives you more accurate

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.190
gives you more accurate
 

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.129
gives you more accurate
structural information and just to show

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:45.139
structural information and just to show
 

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:46.870
structural information and just to show
you the difference when you cover the

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880
you the difference when you cover the
 

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.370
you the difference when you cover the
particle with saying you get this kind

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.380
particle with saying you get this kind
 

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.590
particle with saying you get this kind
of image which probably looks perfectly

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600
of image which probably looks perfectly
 

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.240
of image which probably looks perfectly
good to you but when you only cover half

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.250
good to you but when you only cover half
 

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.800
good to you but when you only cover half
the particle you doesn't begin to

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:53.810
the particle you doesn't begin to
 

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.900
the particle you doesn't begin to
resolve these sub structures these

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:55.910
resolve these sub structures these
 

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.730
resolve these sub structures these
doughnut shape sub structures which are

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740
doughnut shape sub structures which are
 

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.500
doughnut shape sub structures which are
very important and you don't see those

00:14:59.500 --> 00:14:59.510
very important and you don't see those
 

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.150

very nice images of viruses we'll just
turn the light off for a moment so you

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:08.990
turn the light off for a moment so you
 

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.420
turn the light off for a moment so you
can appreciate them these are all

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:10.430

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.720
higher resolution structural studies and
that's cryo-electron microscopy which

and you don't stain them you just freeze

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160
and you don't stain them you just freeze
 

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.009
and you don't stain them you just freeze
them and the freeze them gives them just

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:21.019

contrast that you can see them in the
 

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.579
contrast that you can see them in the
electron microscope and then you take

00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:27.589
electron microscope and then you take
 

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.650
electron microscope and then you take
pictures of the individual particles the

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:29.660
pictures of the individual particles the
 

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.120
pictures of the individual particles the
assumption here is that every particle

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.130
assumption here is that every particle
 

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.009
assumption here is that every particle
is oriented slightly differently on the

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:33.019
is oriented slightly differently on the
 

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:34.480
is oriented slightly differently on the
grid so it

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.490
grid so it
 

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.300
grid so it
basically like doing a cat scan of a

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.310
basically like doing a cat scan of a
 

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.070
basically like doing a cat scan of a
person where you rotate the x-ray

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:39.080
person where you rotate the x-ray
 

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.570
person where you rotate the x-ray
machine around them and get multiple

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:40.580
machine around them and get multiple
 

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.579
machine around them and get multiple
slices you're doing the same thing you

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:42.589
slices you're doing the same thing you
 

00:16:42.589 --> 00:16:44.530
slices you're doing the same thing you
take a few hundred pictures of viruses

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:44.540
take a few hundred pictures of viruses
 

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.050
take a few hundred pictures of viruses
and you digitize the images and then you

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.060
and you digitize the images and then you
 

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.769
and you digitize the images and then you
use Fourier transformations to convert

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:50.779
use Fourier transformations to convert
 

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:53.560
use Fourier transformations to convert
the images into phases and then you you

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:53.570
the images into phases and then you you
 

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.570
the images into phases and then you you
you mix them all together so here we're

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:55.580
you mix them all together so here we're
 

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.240
you mix them all together so here we're
showing one two three

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.250
showing one two three
 

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.670
showing one two three
different slices but in effect you would

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680
different slices but in effect you would
 

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.380
different slices but in effect you would
have hundreds of slices and then you do

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:02.390
have hundreds of slices and then you do
 

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.510
have hundreds of slices and then you do
an inverse transformation to make the

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520
an inverse transformation to make the
 

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.460
an inverse transformation to make the
particle from that so you're basically

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.470
particle from that so you're basically
 

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.460
particle from that so you're basically
taking slices of virus images and very

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.470
taking slices of virus images and very
 

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.730
taking slices of virus images and very
in many different orientations and using

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:11.740
in many different orientations and using
 

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.620
in many different orientations and using
software to reconstruct the entire

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:14.630
software to reconstruct the entire
 

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.169
software to reconstruct the entire
virion so that's why this is called

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:17.179
virion so that's why this is called
 

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:19.210
virion so that's why this is called
3-dimensional reconstruction because

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.220
3-dimensional reconstruction because
 

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.439
3-dimensional reconstruction because
you're reconstructing it from a

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:20.449
you're reconstructing it from a
 

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:22.840
you're reconstructing it from a
two-dimensional image so that's

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:22.850
two-dimensional image so that's
 

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:24.760
two-dimensional image so that's
cryo-electron microscopy this is the

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:24.770
cryo-electron microscopy this is the
 

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.860
cryo-electron microscopy this is the
kind of image you can make with that

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:26.870
kind of image you can make with that
 

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.500
kind of image you can make with that

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.090
same virus on grey up here in the desk
 

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.230
same virus on grey up here in the desk
it's now shown in red and this pulled in

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240
it's now shown in red and this pulled in
 

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.240
it's now shown in red and this pulled in
this case the virus was mixed with its

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.250
this case the virus was mixed with its
 

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.820
this case the virus was mixed with its
cellular receptor a soluble form of the

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:39.830
cellular receptor a soluble form of the
 

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.530
cellular receptor a soluble form of the
receptor that is without the cell and

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:41.540
receptor that is without the cell and
 

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.070
receptor that is without the cell and
those are in green and so you can see

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080
those are in green and so you can see
 

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.380
those are in green and so you can see
very nicely you can resolve the virus

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:47.390
very nicely you can resolve the virus
 

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.330
very nicely you can resolve the virus
particle as well as the individual

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:49.340

virus now the highest resolution comes

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:57.530
virus now the highest resolution comes
 

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.980
virus now the highest resolution comes
from x-ray crystallography in this

00:17:59.980 --> 00:17:59.990
from x-ray crystallography in this
 

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.640
from x-ray crystallography in this
technique you have to make a crystal you

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:02.650
technique you have to make a crystal you
 

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.169
technique you have to make a crystal you
have to take your purified virus and

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:05.179
have to take your purified virus and
 

00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:06.970
have to take your purified virus and
find conditions under which it forms a

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:06.980
find conditions under which it forms a
 

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.250
find conditions under which it forms a
very nice crystal a lattice of molecules

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:09.260
very nice crystal a lattice of molecules
 

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.890
very nice crystal a lattice of molecules
you bombard the crystal with x-rays and

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:11.900
you bombard the crystal with x-rays and
 

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.290
you bombard the crystal with x-rays and
then you'd make an image of the scatter

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:14.300
then you'd make an image of the scatter
 

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.510
then you'd make an image of the scatter
of the x-rays on in the old days that

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520
of the x-rays on in the old days that
 

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.400
of the x-rays on in the old days that
was done on film now it's done on an

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:18.410
was done on film now it's done on an
 

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.490
was done on film now it's done on an
image sensor and the idea is that as you

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:21.500
image sensor and the idea is that as you
 

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.190
image sensor and the idea is that as you
bombard this with x-rays the x-rays

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200
bombard this with x-rays the x-rays
 

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.480
bombard this with x-rays the x-rays
bounce off different atoms in the

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:25.490
bounce off different atoms in the
 

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.490
bounce off different atoms in the
crystal and end up on the scanner and

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:27.500
crystal and end up on the scanner and
 

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.430
crystal and end up on the scanner and
they are a representation of the crystal

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440
they are a representation of the crystal
 

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.740
they are a representation of the crystal
lattice and so you turned the crystal in

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:32.750
lattice and so you turned the crystal in
 

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.780
lattice and so you turned the crystal in
various orientations and bombard it and

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:34.790
various orientations and bombard it and
 

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.750
various orientations and bombard it and
eventually you can deduce the

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760
eventually you can deduce the
 

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.820
eventually you can deduce the
three-dimensional structure by by phase

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:39.830
three-dimensional structure by by phase
 

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.710

will illustrate this in a number of ways

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400
will illustrate this in a number of ways
 

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.240
will illustrate this in a number of ways
if you make identical bonds among the

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.250
if you make identical bonds among the
 

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.550
if you make identical bonds among the
subunits you get a regular structure and

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:06.560
subunits you get a regular structure and
 

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.160

and you get repetitive interactions

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:06.649
and you get repetitive interactions
 

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:08.680
and you get repetitive interactions
between the proteins and they form a

in Toronto and he says please explain

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799
in Toronto and he says please explain
 

00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:21.700
in Toronto and he says please explain
how virus-like particles are created for

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:21.710
how virus-like particles are created for
 

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.470
how virus-like particles are created for
Gardasil and Cervarix and beat those

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480
Gardasil and Cervarix and beat those
 

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.570

seems somehow magical that you can build

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:27.409
seems somehow magical that you can build
 

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:29.529
seems somehow magical that you can build
something that is structurally a virus

00:24:29.529 --> 00:24:29.539
something that is structurally a virus
 

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:32.200
something that is structurally a virus
on the outside but is essentially an

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.210
on the outside but is essentially an
 

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.129
on the outside but is essentially an
empty shell

00:24:33.129 --> 00:24:33.139
empty shell
 

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.930
empty shell
so he's absolutely right it's magic

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:34.940
so he's absolutely right it's magic
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.129
so he's absolutely right it's magic
because it's in the nature of the

00:24:36.129 --> 00:24:36.139
because it's in the nature of the
 

00:24:36.139 --> 00:24:38.649
because it's in the nature of the
protein so I just wanted you to see that

00:24:38.649 --> 00:24:38.659
protein so I just wanted you to see that
 

00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:40.629
protein so I just wanted you to see that
there are people out there wondering how

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:40.639
there are people out there wondering how
 

00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:43.330
there are people out there wondering how
this works now you know because the

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:43.340
this works now you know because the
 

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.220
this works now you know because the
proteins have this ability to interact

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.230
proteins have this ability to interact
 

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.789
proteins have this ability to interact
with one another in symmetrical ways

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799
with one another in symmetrical ways
 

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:50.080
with one another in symmetrical ways
that's why you can get these virus-like

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.090
that's why you can get these virus-like
 

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.810
that's why you can get these virus-like
particles so let's explore the two types

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:52.820
particles so let's explore the two types
 

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.739
particles so let's explore the two types
of symmetry

00:24:53.739 --> 00:24:53.749
of symmetry
 

00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:56.919
of symmetry
the first is helical symmetry it is the

00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:56.929
the first is helical symmetry it is the
 

00:24:56.929 --> 00:24:59.350
the first is helical symmetry it is the
way tobacco mosaic virus is built and

00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360
way tobacco mosaic virus is built and
 

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.869
way tobacco mosaic virus is built and
also a number of viruses that infect

00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:01.879
also a number of viruses that infect
 

00:25:01.879 --> 00:25:05.109
also a number of viruses that infect
people and what happens here is that we

00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:05.119
people and what happens here is that we
 

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:08.379
people and what happens here is that we
have a coat protein and these engage in

00:25:08.379 --> 00:25:08.389
have a coat protein and these engage in
 

00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:10.749
have a coat protein and these engage in
very similar interactions with one

00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:10.759
very similar interactions with one
 

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:13.060
very similar interactions with one
another and also with the viral RNA

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.070
another and also with the viral RNA
 

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.549
another and also with the viral RNA
which is shown here in yellow sorry in

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559
which is shown here in yellow sorry in
 

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:18.249
which is shown here in yellow sorry in
green alright so each of these is the

00:25:18.249 --> 00:25:18.259
green alright so each of these is the
 

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:20.859
green alright so each of these is the
coat protein subunit the tobacco mosaic

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:20.869
coat protein subunit the tobacco mosaic
 

00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:23.859
coat protein subunit the tobacco mosaic
virus is just made of one protein it's

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:23.869
virus is just made of one protein it's
 

00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:25.570
virus is just made of one protein it's
repeated over and over and it forms this

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:25.580
repeated over and over and it forms this
 

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.180
repeated over and over and it forms this
helical structure

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:27.190
helical structure
 

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.090
helical structure
okay and so that is that is the virus

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:30.100
okay and so that is that is the virus
 

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.520
okay and so that is that is the virus
itself the protein in the RNA doesn't

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:32.530
itself the protein in the RNA doesn't
 

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.560
itself the protein in the RNA doesn't
have anything else associated with it

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:34.570
have anything else associated with it
 

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.170
have anything else associated with it
these are some examples of animal

so we call this the nucleo capsid now
 

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.280
so we call this the nucleo capsid now
because it is part of a bigger structure

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.290
because it is part of a bigger structure

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.070
really a coil it is a very tight
structure that looks just like that and

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080
structure that looks just like that and
 

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.770
structure that looks just like that and
this is sendai virus these are the

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:31.780
this is sendai virus these are the
 

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.890
this is sendai virus these are the
nucleo capsids that's this guy this long

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:34.900
nucleo capsids that's this guy this long
 

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.260
nucleo capsids that's this guy this long
rod right here and they are encased in

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:37.270
rod right here and they are encased in
 

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.390
rod right here and they are encased in
an envelope and this one is broken so

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.400
an envelope and this one is broken so
 

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.270
an envelope and this one is broken so
the nuclear capsids are spilling out but

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:42.280
the nuclear capsids are spilling out but
 

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.190
the nuclear capsids are spilling out but
you can see how they would normally be

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200
you can see how they would normally be
 

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.250
you can see how they would normally be
contained within the envelope now you

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:47.260
contained within the envelope now you
 

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.320
contained within the envelope now you
can make your own demonstration of the

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:49.330
can make your own demonstration of the
 

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.350
can make your own demonstration of the
helical symmetry with these buckyballs

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360
helical symmetry with these buckyballs
 

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.870
helical symmetry with these buckyballs
so you can buy okay you can go in fact

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880
so you can buy okay you can go in fact
 

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.810
so you can buy okay you can go in fact
saul silverstein gave me these a year

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:57.820
saul silverstein gave me these a year
 

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.230
saul silverstein gave me these a year
ago and I said I can build a virus from

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240
ago and I said I can build a virus from
 

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.240
ago and I said I can build a virus from
this that's what I want to show you so

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.250
this that's what I want to show you so
 

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.730
this that's what I want to show you so
these are very strong magnets did not

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740
these are very strong magnets did not
 

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.340
these are very strong magnets did not
know actually okay so this is helical

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.350
know actually okay so this is helical
 

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.100
know actually okay so this is helical
symmetry okay and each of these magnets

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.110
symmetry okay and each of these magnets
 

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.080
symmetry okay and each of these magnets
is a protein subunit it interacts with

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.090
is a protein subunit it interacts with
 

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.390
is a protein subunit it interacts with
each of its neighbors in an identical

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:18.400
each of its neighbors in an identical
 

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.050
each of its neighbors in an identical
way and it makes the capsid of that

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:22.060
way and it makes the capsid of that
 

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.210
way and it makes the capsid of that
virus that was on the screen before so

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:24.220
virus that was on the screen before so
 

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.010
virus that was on the screen before so
the RNA is attached to this you don't

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.020
the RNA is attached to this you don't
 

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.110
the RNA is attached to this you don't
have RNA here but you can see there's a

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120
have RNA here but you can see there's a
 

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.630
have RNA here but you can see there's a
there's a helical rise here so it's just

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640
there's a helical rise here so it's just
 

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.160
there's a helical rise here so it's just
the way a virus is built perfect I

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.170
the way a virus is built perfect I
 

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.890
the way a virus is built perfect I
didn't take me a year I was I had these

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:37.900
didn't take me a year I was I had these
 

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.830
didn't take me a year I was I had these
on my desk and one of my students was

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840
on my desk and one of my students was
 

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.990
on my desk and one of my students was
playing with it and she assembled it

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000
playing with it and she assembled it
 

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.600
playing with it and she assembled it
into a long strand and I said I'll bet

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:45.610
into a long strand and I said I'll bet
 

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.820
into a long strand and I said I'll bet
you could make that into a helical

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:47.830
you could make that into a helical
 

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.399
you could make that into a helical
nucleo capsid and here we go so I've

00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:50.409
nucleo capsid and here we go so I've
 

00:27:50.409 --> 00:27:51.870
nucleo capsid and here we go so I've
been waiting to show you this for about

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880
been waiting to show you this for about
 

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.419
been waiting to show you this for about
a year ok so that's pretty cool those

00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:54.429
a year ok so that's pretty cool those
 

00:27:54.429 --> 00:27:57.720
a year ok so that's pretty cool those
are bucky balls I have a movie here for

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:57.730
are bucky balls I have a movie here for
 

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.010
are bucky balls I have a movie here for
the people who are gonna watch online

00:27:59.010 --> 00:27:59.020
the people who are gonna watch online
 

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.830
the people who are gonna watch online
who aren't here so they can see it as

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840
who aren't here so they can see it as
 

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.100
who aren't here so they can see it as
well

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:02.110
well
 

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.289
well
it's it's basically me doing the same

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:04.299
it's it's basically me doing the same
 

00:28:04.299 --> 00:28:07.649
it's it's basically me doing the same
thing wrapping up this this chain of

00:28:07.649 --> 00:28:07.659
thing wrapping up this this chain of
 

00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:10.529
thing wrapping up this this chain of
bucky balls and making a virus out of it

00:28:10.529 --> 00:28:10.539
bucky balls and making a virus out of it
 

00:28:10.539 --> 00:28:16.380
bucky balls and making a virus out of it
now the interesting question yes so each

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:16.390
now the interesting question yes so each
 

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.250
now the interesting question yes so each
subunit also binds the nucleic acid yes

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:20.260
subunit also binds the nucleic acid yes
 

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.960
subunit also binds the nucleic acid yes
now that's a good question because if I

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:21.970
now that's a good question because if I
 

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:25.409
now that's a good question because if I
took all these magnets and threw them in

00:28:25.409 --> 00:28:25.419
took all these magnets and threw them in
 

00:28:25.419 --> 00:28:28.440
took all these magnets and threw them in
a cup they wouldn't form a helix they

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:28.450
a cup they wouldn't form a helix they
 

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.630
a cup they wouldn't form a helix they
need the RNA to do that the nucleic acid

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640
need the RNA to do that the nucleic acid
 

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.460
need the RNA to do that the nucleic acid
because that drives their assembly into

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:32.470
because that drives their assembly into
 

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.620
because that drives their assembly into
this kind of structure so this is not a

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:34.630
this kind of structure so this is not a
 

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.899
this kind of structure so this is not a
perfect example of what helical symmetry

00:28:36.899 --> 00:28:36.909
perfect example of what helical symmetry
 

00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:38.880
perfect example of what helical symmetry
is because there's no RNA involved but

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:38.890
is because there's no RNA involved but
 

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:45.990
is because there's no RNA involved but
you get the idea basically ok that's it

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000
you get the idea basically ok that's it
 

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.360
you get the idea basically ok that's it
I gotta put that on YouTube see now see

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:48.370
I gotta put that on YouTube see now see
 

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:58.680
I gotta put that on YouTube see now see
how many hits it gets yes yeah yeah

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:58.690
 

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.600
now they deliver the gene encoding the

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:01.610
now they deliver the gene encoding the
 

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.700
now they deliver the gene encoding the
protein into a cell either a yeast cell

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:03.710
protein into a cell either a yeast cell
 

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.070
protein into a cell either a yeast cell
or an insect cell and the gene is

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080
or an insect cell and the gene is
 

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.049
or an insect cell and the gene is
transit is transcribed to mRNA it's

00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:08.059
transit is transcribed to mRNA it's
 

00:29:08.059 --> 00:29:09.730
transit is transcribed to mRNA it's
translated into protein within the cell

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:09.740
translated into protein within the cell
 

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.940
translated into protein within the cell
and then the proteins self assemble so

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:12.950
and then the proteins self assemble so
 

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.430
and then the proteins self assemble so
you could take the purified protein in a

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440
you could take the purified protein in a
 

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.230
you could take the purified protein in a
tube and it would also self assemble

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240
tube and it would also self assemble
 

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.899
tube and it would also self assemble
most likely but for production purposes

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:19.909
most likely but for production purposes
 

00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:21.879
most likely but for production purposes
for making a vaccine you need a lot of

00:29:21.879 --> 00:29:21.889
for making a vaccine you need a lot of
 

00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:24.070
for making a vaccine you need a lot of
quantity they express it in cells okay

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080
quantity they express it in cells okay
 

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:37.690
quantity they express it in cells okay
yes yes

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:37.700
 

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.360
so the the virus-like particles that we

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.370
so the the virus-like particles that we
 

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.650
so the the virus-like particles that we
talked about are made by symmetric there

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:45.660
talked about are made by symmetric there
 

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.770
talked about are made by symmetric there
are there icosahedral structures I don't

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:48.780
are there icosahedral structures I don't
 

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.680
are there icosahedral structures I don't
know of any where a helical structure

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:51.690
know of any where a helical structure
 

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.200
know of any where a helical structure
has been made with just the protein it's

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.210
has been made with just the protein it's
 

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.580
has been made with just the protein it's
my understanding that you need the

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:55.590
my understanding that you need the
 

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.460
my understanding that you need the
nucleic acid to nucleate two helix all

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:58.470
nucleic acid to nucleate two helix all
 

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:10.520
nucleic acid to nucleate two helix all
right is there another one okay yes well

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:10.530
right is there another one okay yes well
 

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.870
right is there another one okay yes well
in these helical structures they are yes

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880
in these helical structures they are yes
 

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.020
in these helical structures they are yes
but in the capsids to submit these

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.030
but in the capsids to submit these
 

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.950
but in the capsids to submit these
icosahedral capsids that we'll talk

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960
icosahedral capsids that we'll talk
 

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.580
icosahedral capsids that we'll talk
about next we don't know because we

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:22.590
about next we don't know because we
 

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.020
about next we don't know because we
assume there are some interactions but

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.030
assume there are some interactions but
 

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.520
assume there are some interactions but
we haven't been able to visualize them

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.530
we haven't been able to visualize them
 

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.290
we haven't been able to visualize them
structurally because the RNA or the DNA

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:27.300
structurally because the RNA or the DNA
 

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.600
structurally because the RNA or the DNA
is not ordered inside the capsid so it's

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:29.610
is not ordered inside the capsid so it's
 

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.870
is not ordered inside the capsid so it's
hard to see the interactions it's making

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880
hard to see the interactions it's making
 

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.100
hard to see the interactions it's making
but when you solve the structure of

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.110
but when you solve the structure of
 

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.130
but when you solve the structure of
these helical nucleo capsid you can see

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140
these helical nucleo capsid you can see
 

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.780
these helical nucleo capsid you can see
the nucleic acid interacting with the

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:38.790
the nucleic acid interacting with the
 

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.150
the nucleic acid interacting with the
protein because it's given order by the

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.160
protein because it's given order by the
 

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.980
protein because it's given order by the
protein order okay so this is just an

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:45.990
protein order okay so this is just an
 

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:50.240
protein order okay so this is just an
example of this interaction so here is

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:50.250
example of this interaction so here is
 

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.760
example of this interaction so here is
here's a virion of vesicular stomatitis

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:52.770
here's a virion of vesicular stomatitis
 

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.330
here's a virion of vesicular stomatitis

60 although that can be that can vary

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:23.620
60 although that can be that can vary
 

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.080
60 although that can be that can vary
but for the most part they're multiples

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.090
but for the most part they're multiples
 

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:29.700
but for the most part they're multiples
of 60 60 180 249 60 etc so that gives us

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:29.710
of 60 60 180 249 60 etc so that gives us
 

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.210

out a virus picture and I'll say the

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.130
out a virus picture and I'll say the
 

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.519
out a virus picture and I'll say the

all these interactions the interactions

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160
all these interactions the interactions
 

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.130
all these interactions the interactions
of all these commas again each comma is

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:17.140
of all these commas again each comma is
 

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.079
of all these commas again each comma is
a single protein there's sixty of these

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:19.089
a single protein there's sixty of these
 

00:37:19.089 --> 00:37:21.809

in the virus particle their interactions

00:37:21.809 --> 00:37:21.819
in the virus particle their interactions
 

00:37:21.819 --> 00:37:23.939
in the virus particle their interactions
are all the same in the particles so

00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:23.949
are all the same in the particles so
 

00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:25.410
are all the same in the particles so
every protein interacts with its

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:25.420
every protein interacts with its
 

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.319
every protein interacts with its
neighbor in the same way head to head

00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:28.329
neighbor in the same way head to head
 

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:30.539
neighbor in the same way head to head
tail to tail alright so here's the

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:30.549
tail to tail alright so here's the
 

00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:32.579
tail to tail alright so here's the
fivefold icosahedron axis you can see

00:37:32.579 --> 00:37:32.589
fivefold icosahedron axis you can see
 

00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:35.279
fivefold icosahedron axis you can see
one two three four five copies of the

00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:35.289
one two three four five copies of the
 

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:37.459
one two three four five copies of the

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680
threefold one two three
 

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.109
threefold one two three
now you also see there are some areas

00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119
now you also see there are some areas
 

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:48.329
now you also see there are some areas
where there are six one two three four

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:48.339
where there are six one two three four
 

00:37:48.339 --> 00:37:51.900
where there are six one two three four
five six copies so in some of these in

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:51.910
five six copies so in some of these in
 

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.620
five six copies so in some of these in
some of the viruses you do have six fold

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:54.630
some of the viruses you do have six fold
 

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.699
some of the viruses you do have six fold
interactions as well so that's the

00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:56.709
interactions as well so that's the
 

00:37:56.709 --> 00:38:00.089
interactions as well so that's the
simplest capsid you could build sixty

00:38:00.089 --> 00:38:00.099
simplest capsid you could build sixty
 

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:03.180
simplest capsid you could build sixty
subunits they proteins are asymmetrical

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.190

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.410
subunits they proteins are asymmetrical
and that's the point of drawing it as a

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:04.420
and that's the point of drawing it as a
 

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.799
and that's the point of drawing it as a
comma you have the head and the tail but

00:38:07.799 --> 00:38:07.809
comma you have the head and the tail but
 

00:38:07.809 --> 00:38:09.269
comma you have the head and the tail but
they all interact with each other in

00:38:09.269 --> 00:38:09.279
they all interact with each other in
 

00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:11.759
they all interact with each other in
very similar ways so here's an example

00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:11.769
very similar ways so here's an example
 

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:14.219
very similar ways so here's an example

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:34.900
and that's what the protein looks like
 

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.859
and that's what the protein looks like
here and that's the virion so for

00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:37.869
here and that's the virion so for
 

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:39.590
here and that's the virion so for
example these different parts of this

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:39.600
example these different parts of this
 

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.940
example these different parts of this
capsid protein are colored so the blue

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:41.950
capsid protein are colored so the blue
 

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.310
capsid protein are colored so the blue
part here you can see forms the fivefold

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320
part here you can see forms the fivefold
 

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.800
part here you can see forms the fivefold
axis of symmetry it's very easy to find

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:46.810
axis of symmetry it's very easy to find
 

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.440
axis of symmetry it's very easy to find
it you can just look at the point where

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.450
it you can just look at the point where
 

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.359
it you can just look at the point where
there are five repeated subunits around

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:51.369
there are five repeated subunits around
 

00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:53.790
there are five repeated subunits around
it one two three four five so all the

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800
it one two three four five so all the
 

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.310
it one two three four five so all the
blue is contributed from five different

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320
blue is contributed from five different
 

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.710
blue is contributed from five different
proteins and it's this specific part of

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720
proteins and it's this specific part of
 

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.320
proteins and it's this specific part of
the protein so how do you make a bigger

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:01.330
the protein so how do you make a bigger
 

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.410
the protein so how do you make a bigger
virus so you have sixty copies of a

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:04.420
virus so you have sixty copies of a
 

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.700
virus so you have sixty copies of a
single protein you how do you make

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:05.710
single protein you how do you make
 

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.370
single protein you how do you make
bigger viruses you just add more

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380
bigger viruses you just add more
 

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.060
bigger viruses you just add more
subunits very simple and this relates to

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.070
subunits very simple and this relates to
 

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.359
subunits very simple and this relates to
the triangulation number T T is simply

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:15.369
the triangulation number T T is simply
 

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:17.880
the triangulation number T T is simply
the number of facets per triangular face

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:17.890
the number of facets per triangular face
 

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.300
the number of facets per triangular face
of an icosahedron so here's a triangular

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.310
of an icosahedron so here's a triangular
 

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:25.320
of an icosahedron so here's a triangular
face has one facet but you can take that

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:25.330
face has one facet but you can take that
 

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.600
face has one facet but you can take that
triangular face and insert three

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:27.610
triangular face and insert three
 

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.210
triangular face and insert three
additional facets into it it gets bigger

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:30.220
additional facets into it it gets bigger
 

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.820
additional facets into it it gets bigger
this is still the triangular face but

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:32.830
this is still the triangular face but
 

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.580
this is still the triangular face but
now we have facets in it and that's

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:35.590
now we have facets in it and that's
 

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.980
now we have facets in it and that's
achieved just by adding more proteins to

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:37.990
achieved just by adding more proteins to
 

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.530
achieved just by adding more proteins to
it and if you want to make bigger

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:40.540
it and if you want to make bigger
 

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.150
it and if you want to make bigger
viruses and we know that they exist

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160
viruses and we know that they exist
 

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.890
viruses and we know that they exist
we're trying to explain how they are

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:43.900
we're trying to explain how they are
 

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.950
we're trying to explain how they are
made you simply add facets by adding

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960
made you simply add facets by adding
 

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.550
made you simply add facets by adding
proteins so this is called a T equals

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560
proteins so this is called a T equals
 

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.200
proteins so this is called a T equals
one virus and this is called the T

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:52.210
one virus and this is called the T
 

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.900
one virus and this is called the T
equals four viruses and any captured

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:54.910
equals four viruses and any captured
 

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.660
equals four viruses and any captured
with a greater than T equal one T number

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:57.670
with a greater than T equal one T number
 

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.120
with a greater than T equal one T number
will have a six-fold axis of symmetry so

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.130
will have a six-fold axis of symmetry so
 

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.980
will have a six-fold axis of symmetry so
I misspoke in the previous slide that T

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:01.990
I misspoke in the previous slide that T
 

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.170
I misspoke in the previous slide that T
equals one particle does not have a

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.180
equals one particle does not have a
 

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.080

six-fold axis has all fivefold threefold

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.090
six-fold axis has all fivefold threefold
 

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.030
six-fold axis has all fivefold threefold
and twofold but this is now a T equals

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040
and twofold but this is now a T equals
 

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.730
and twofold but this is now a T equals
four virus you can see one two three

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:11.740
four virus you can see one two three
 

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.140

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.150
four five six in addition to three two
 

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.599
four five six in addition to three two
and fivefold axes so simply putting in

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:18.609
and fivefold axes so simply putting in
 

00:40:18.609 --> 00:40:21.210
and fivefold axes so simply putting in
more proteins to make a bigger virus now

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.220
more proteins to make a bigger virus now
 

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.280
more proteins to make a bigger virus now
gives you not only Penta MERS or

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.290
gives you not only Penta MERS or
 

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.950
gives you not only Penta MERS or
fivefold axes but also six-fold axes as

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960
fivefold axes but also six-fold axes as
 

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.250
fivefold axes but also six-fold axes as
well okay the T number simply refers to

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:32.260
well okay the T number simply refers to
 

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.010
well okay the T number simply refers to
the number of facets per triangular face

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.020
the number of facets per triangular face
 

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.859
the number of facets per triangular face
here we have one two three four facets

00:40:37.859 --> 00:40:37.869
here we have one two three four facets
 

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:40.349
here we have one two three four facets
the T number is four here we have one

00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359
the T number is four here we have one
 

00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:42.180
the T number is four here we have one
facet in the triangular face the T

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:42.190
facet in the triangular face the T
 

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.790
facet in the triangular face the T
number is one so you'll see T number in

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800
number is one so you'll see T number in
 

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.200
number is one so you'll see T number in
the

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.210
the
 

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.630
the
and other materials that you read they

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640
and other materials that you read they
 

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.730
and other materials that you read they
just want you to understand what we're

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740
just want you to understand what we're
 

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.279
just want you to understand what we're
talking about you can use the T number

00:40:52.279 --> 00:40:52.289
talking about you can use the T number
 

00:40:52.289 --> 00:40:53.839
talking about you can use the T number
to calculate the total number of

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:53.849
to calculate the total number of
 

00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:56.660
to calculate the total number of
subunits in a virion so it's 60 times

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:56.670
subunits in a virion so it's 60 times
 

00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.200
subunits in a virion so it's 60 times
toas and again the simplest virus is T

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:00.210
toas and again the simplest virus is T
 

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.460
toas and again the simplest virus is T
equals 160 subunits one virus particle

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:03.470
equals 160 subunits one virus particle
 

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.259
equals 160 subunits one virus particle
so for example a T equals three at

00:41:06.259 --> 00:41:06.269
so for example a T equals three at
 

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:09.980
so for example a T equals three at
icosahedron has 180 subunits 60 times

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:09.990
icosahedron has 180 subunits 60 times
 

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.499
icosahedron has 180 subunits 60 times
three and this is in sets of three T

00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:12.509
three and this is in sets of three T
 

00:41:12.509 --> 00:41:14.480
three and this is in sets of three T
equals four 240

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:14.490
equals four 240
 

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.930
equals four 240
now not all viruses follow this T rule

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940
now not all viruses follow this T rule
 

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.989
now not all viruses follow this T rule
60 T and I you don't need to really

00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:20.999
60 T and I you don't need to really
 

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:24.289
60 T and I you don't need to really
understand why but on this table are

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:24.299
understand why but on this table are
 

00:41:24.299 --> 00:41:27.230
understand why but on this table are
some examples of that here for example

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240
some examples of that here for example
 

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.759
some examples of that here for example
this simple parvo virus the T the number

00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:31.769
this simple parvo virus the T the number
 

00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:34.640
this simple parvo virus the T the number
of subunits or 60 T is actually 60 and

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:34.650
of subunits or 60 T is actually 60 and
 

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.859
of subunits or 60 T is actually 60 and
that's what we observe but you can see

00:41:36.859 --> 00:41:36.869
that's what we observe but you can see
 

00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:41.359
that's what we observe but you can see
that for simian virus 4060 T is 420 but

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:41.369
that for simian virus 4060 T is 420 but
 

00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:43.339
that for simian virus 4060 T is 420 but
they're only 360 copies of one of the

00:41:43.339 --> 00:41:43.349
they're only 360 copies of one of the
 

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:46.220
they're only 360 copies of one of the
proteins so not all the rules follow but

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:46.230
proteins so not all the rules follow but
 

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.890
proteins so not all the rules follow but
they're pretty good overall well you

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900
they're pretty good overall well you
 

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.539
they're pretty good overall well you
have to know is that some viruses do not

00:41:50.539 --> 00:41:50.549
have to know is that some viruses do not
 

00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:52.910
have to know is that some viruses do not
contain 60 T subunits and you don't have

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920
contain 60 T subunits and you don't have
 

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.420
contain 60 T subunits and you don't have
to know why now when we put more virus

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:56.430
to know why now when we put more virus
 

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.640
to know why now when we put more virus
sorry when we put more proteins in a

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:58.650
sorry when we put more proteins in a
 

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.529
sorry when we put more proteins in a
capsid to make a bigger particle to go

00:42:00.529 --> 00:42:00.539
capsid to make a bigger particle to go
 

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:04.910
capsid to make a bigger particle to go
from this to something much bigger you

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920
from this to something much bigger you
 

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.190
from this to something much bigger you
get more than 60 subunits we increase

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200
get more than 60 subunits we increase
 

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.509
get more than 60 subunits we increase
the T number now we encounter something

00:42:11.509 --> 00:42:11.519
the T number now we encounter something
 

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:14.749
the T number now we encounter something
called quasi equivalents remember when

00:42:14.749 --> 00:42:14.759
called quasi equivalents remember when
 

00:42:14.759 --> 00:42:17.210
called quasi equivalents remember when
we had a small virus with 60 subunits

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220
we had a small virus with 60 subunits
 

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.339
we had a small virus with 60 subunits
all the subunits all the proteins

00:42:19.339 --> 00:42:19.349
all the subunits all the proteins
 

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:21.170
all the subunits all the proteins
interacted with each other in identical

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180
interacted with each other in identical
 

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.329
interacted with each other in identical
ways when you start putting more

00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339
ways when you start putting more
 

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:25.309
ways when you start putting more
proteins in to make bigger capsid that

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319
proteins in to make bigger capsid that
 

00:42:25.319 --> 00:42:26.630

can't happen anymore they're pretty

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640
can't happen anymore they're pretty
 

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.089
can't happen anymore they're pretty
similar but not exactly the same so we

00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099
similar but not exactly the same so we
 

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:32.239
similar but not exactly the same so we
call them quasi equivalent okay that's

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:32.249

to form the virion so the thickness of

00:45:15.949 --> 00:45:15.959
to form the virion so the thickness of
 

00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:17.809

the wedge gives you the thickness of the
 

00:45:17.819 --> 00:45:20.389
the wedge gives you the thickness of the

why it's derived from the host cell

00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:46.569
why it's derived from the host cell
 

00:50:46.569 --> 00:50:49.390
why it's derived from the host cell
because the virus can't make its own

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400
because the virus can't make its own
 

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.370
because the virus can't make its own
lipid doesn't have any machinery to do

that so all envelope viruses derive the

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:54.650
that so all envelope viruses derive the
 

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:59.140
that so all envelope viruses derive the
lipid from the host cell it can be

00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.150
lipid from the host cell it can be
 

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.349

always virus specific so the influenza

00:51:10.599 --> 00:51:10.609
always virus specific so the influenza
 

00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:12.460
always virus specific so the influenza
virus is always bud from the plasma

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:12.470
virus is always bud from the plasma
 

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.190
virus is always bud from the plasma
membrane and the herpes virus is bud

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200

icosahedral symmetry okay so remember

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:26.270
icosahedral symmetry okay so remember
 

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.440
icosahedral symmetry okay so remember
the helical symmetry this kind of

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:29.450
the helical symmetry this kind of
 

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.089
the helical symmetry this kind of
symmetry this can be wrapped in an

00:51:31.089 --> 00:51:31.099
symmetry this can be wrapped in an
 

00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:32.800
symmetry this can be wrapped in an
envelope and for animal viruses it

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:32.810
envelope and for animal viruses it
 

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.530
envelope and for animal viruses it
always is but for plant viruses it's not

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:35.540
always is but for plant viruses it's not
 

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.280
always is but for plant viruses it's not
and then we can have these icosahedral

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:39.290
and then we can have these icosahedral
 

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.349
and then we can have these icosahedral
particles also wrapped in envelopes so

00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359
particles also wrapped in envelopes so
 

00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:43.569
particles also wrapped in envelopes so
that gives you other options for

00:51:43.569 --> 00:51:43.579
that gives you other options for
 

00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:47.620
that gives you other options for
structure as well so in if you wrap a

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:47.630
structure as well so in if you wrap a
 

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.069
structure as well so in if you wrap a
virus in an envelope so take this and

00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079
virus in an envelope so take this and
 

00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:53.500
virus in an envelope so take this and
you wrap it in an envelope if you just

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:53.510
you wrap it in an envelope if you just
 

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.130
you wrap it in an envelope if you just
use them

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:54.140
use them
 

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.289

give it viral property so old virus has

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:00.410
give it viral property so old virus has
 

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.339
give it viral property so old virus has
put proteins in that membrane derived

00:52:03.339 --> 00:52:03.349
put proteins in that membrane derived
 

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:04.870

from the hotel these are called viral
 

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.539
from the hotel these are called viral
envelope glycoproteins so the envelope

00:52:07.539 --> 00:52:07.549
envelope glycoproteins so the envelope
 

00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:09.279
envelope glycoproteins so the envelope
is the membrane surrounding the virus

00:52:09.279 --> 00:52:09.289
is the membrane surrounding the virus
 

00:52:09.289 --> 00:52:12.549

about that now
so these viral proteins these

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520
so these viral proteins these
 

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.120

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:23.900
example where the glycoprotein is going
 

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.510
example where the glycoprotein is going
through the virus membrane and it's

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520
through the virus membrane and it's
 

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.790
through the virus membrane and it's
interacting with this capsid or nucleo

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:27.800
interacting with this capsid or nucleo
 

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.860
interacting with this capsid or nucleo
capsid this would be more accurately

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:29.870
capsid this would be more accurately
 

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.780
capsid this would be more accurately
called a nucleocapsid because it's

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:31.790
called a nucleocapsid because it's
 

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:34.300
called a nucleocapsid because it's
wrapped in a membrane but you can see

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:34.310

case then the symmetry of the nucleo

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:44.420
case then the symmetry of the nucleo
 

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.090
case then the symmetry of the nucleo
capsid should be transmitted to the

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:46.100

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.820
capsid should be transmitted to the
glycoproteins on the surface okay so if

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:48.830
glycoproteins on the surface okay so if
 

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.340
glycoproteins on the surface okay so if
this glycoprotein is interacting with

one of the five proteins around the
 

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.120
one of the five proteins around the
fivefold axis then the glycoprotein will

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:55.130
fivefold axis then the glycoprotein will
 

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:57.130
fivefold axis then the glycoprotein will
also assume fivefold axis of symmetry

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:57.140
also assume fivefold axis of symmetry

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:36.800
this is what actually opens up when the
 

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.609
this is what actually opens up when the
nucleic acid gets out of the particle so

01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:39.619
nucleic acid gets out of the particle so
 

01:05:39.619 --> 01:05:42.880
nucleic acid gets out of the particle so
these blue lines represents areas in the

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:42.890
these blue lines represents areas in the
 

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:45.339
these blue lines represents areas in the
capsid that can come apart and let the

01:05:45.339 --> 01:05:45.349
capsid that can come apart and let the
 

01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:47.620
capsid that can come apart and let the
DNA out and because they show up

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:47.630
DNA out and because they show up
 

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:49.480
DNA out and because they show up
differently on the cryo-em that's why

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:49.490
differently on the cryo-em that's why
 

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:51.010
differently on the cryo-em that's why
they're colored blue here the

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:51.020
they're colored blue here the
 

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.410
they're colored blue here the
interactions must be different amongst

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:53.420
interactions must be different amongst
 

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.940
interactions must be different amongst
those proteins then amongst all the

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:54.950
those proteins then amongst all the
 

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.200
those proteins then amongst all the
other proteins and the rest of the

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:56.210
other proteins and the rest of the
 

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:57.880
other proteins and the rest of the
capsid so another example of how you can

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:57.890
capsid so another example of how you can
 

01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:00.609
capsid so another example of how you can
have very specialized regions of even an

01:06:00.609 --> 01:06:00.619
have very specialized regions of even an
 

01:06:00.619 --> 01:06:03.430
have very specialized regions of even an
icosahedron shell that allows you to do

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440
icosahedron shell that allows you to do
 

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.700
icosahedron shell that allows you to do
specialized functions so I the title of

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:06.710
specialized functions so I the title of
 

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.109
specialized functions so I the title of
this is complex structures are

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119
this is complex structures are
 

01:06:08.119 --> 01:06:10.510
this is complex structures are
challenging viral structural biologists

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520
challenging viral structural biologists
 

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:14.290
challenging viral structural biologists
so this is not easy to do because it's

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:14.300
so this is not easy to do because it's
 

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.210
so this is not easy to do because it's
not only technically difficult to get

01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:16.220
not only technically difficult to get
 

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.990
not only technically difficult to get
the images but the computational

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000
the images but the computational
 

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.160
the images but the computational
processes that are involved to solve the

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.170
processes that are involved to solve the
 

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:23.410
processes that are involved to solve the
structures are are quite large and

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:23.420
structures are are quite large and
 

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.140
structures are are quite large and
that's another example of how biology is

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:26.150
that's another example of how biology is
 

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:27.640
that's another example of how biology is
attracting more people who are

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:27.650
attracting more people who are
 

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.210
attracting more people who are
interested in computational aspects of

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:31.220
interested in computational aspects of
 

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.650
interested in computational aspects of
structure

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660
 

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.720
