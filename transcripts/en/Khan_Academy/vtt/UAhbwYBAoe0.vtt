00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:03.312
- [Instructor] When we're
talking about major wars

00:00:03.312 --> 00:00:05.262
in colonial North America,

00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:08.873
we tend to think about
the American Revolution,

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:13.546
not its earlier iteration,
the Seven Years' War,

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.788
and I think that's a shame

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:18.517
because the Seven Years' War
was incredibly influential

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.879
not only on the American Revolution,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.741
but on the complexion of the world.

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.126
Thanks to the Seven Years' War,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.793
Canada became a British country,

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:31.677
not a French country.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.677
The Acadians moved down to Louisiana

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.036
and became known as the Cajuns,

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.484
and most importantly,
England became the world's

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:42.984
preeminent empire.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:48.496
So if you've been
following along this far,

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:51.067
you may have noticed two things.

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:54.184
One, that the people who named this war

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:56.478
seem to be very bad at math

00:00:56.478 --> 00:00:58.145
because 1754 to 1763

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.243
is nine years, not seven,

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:08.762
and that this war seems to have two names,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:10.146
both the Seven Years' War

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:11.916
and the French and Indian War,

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.602
which is a name you
perhaps have heard before.

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:16.241
Well, lemme tackle those two oddities

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:17.715
in reverse order.

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:20.634
So not only does the Seven
Years' War have two names,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:23.355
it has a whole number of names.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.297
It's called the Seven Years' War,

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:27.164
the French and Indian War,

00:01:27.164 --> 00:01:28.906
the War of the Conquest,

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:30.770
the Pomeranian War,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.466
the Third Silesian War,

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.561
the Third Carnatic War.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.033
This is a war with a whole bunch of names,

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.066
and the reason that it
has a whole bunch of names

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.426
is that it was fought in
a whole bunch of places.

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:44.232
The Seven Years' War was really

00:01:44.232 --> 00:01:45.982
the first global war,

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:51.925
and we're talking 150
years before World War One.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.140
Aspects of the Seven Years' War,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410
as you can kinda see from this map,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.020
were fought in Europe,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.801
in South America, the coast of Africa,

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:06.411
in India, the Philippines,

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:09.078
and of course, in North America.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.474
The many different names come from

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:15.490
the many different fronts of this war,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.304
and I would say that French and Indian War

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:21.768
is actually the name for
the North American front

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:24.606
of this war, or theater of this war.

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:26.510
So there are two reasons why I think

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.878
Seven Years' War is a better name

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:30.400
than French and Indian War.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.528
One is that Seven Years'
War gets at the idea

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:36.837
that it was not just
happening in North America.

00:02:36.837 --> 00:02:38.486
It was happening all over the world,

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:41.628
so it shows that it was a global war,

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.060
but I also think Seven
Years' War is a better name

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.683
than French and Indian War

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:47.920
because I think French and Indian War

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.611
is kind of confusing
because you would think

00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.944
that it means that the principal parties

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:58.867
in this war were the English

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.700
versus the French and the Indians,

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:07.180
when in fact it was the English

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.013
and their Indian allies versus the French

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:12.085
and their Indian allies.

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:15.789
Native Americans fought on
both sides of this conflict,

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.352
so rather than the English and Indian

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:20.989
versus French and Indian War,

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.207
let's go with the
shorter Seven Years' War,

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:27.811
which brings us back to
our awkward date range.

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.300
So the reason that it's
called the Seven Years' War

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.521
is because the English
didn't actually declare war

00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:36.604
on the French until 1756.

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:40.942
So even though fighting
started a little bit earlier

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:42.856
in North America,

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:46.648
the true range of dates,
at least in legal terms,

00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:48.398
is from 1756 to 1763,

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.691
or seven years.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.190
It's a complicated name
for a complicated war,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.105
but really what it came down to

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.938
was England and France

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.334
duking it out over who was going to be

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:09.293
the supreme imperial power in the world,

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:11.701
and they were concerned
about who was going to have

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.201
the most territory

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.472
in the world,

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:20.433
therefore, their concern
over who was going

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.864
to control North America

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:25.080
and their competing claims here,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.163
and also access to trade.

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:32.582
So who was going to be able
to trade with North Americans?

00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:36.159
Who was going to be able
to trade with the lucrative

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.224
Indian subcontinent,

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:42.155
and who would be the
leading power in Europe?

00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:44.367
So let's dial in a little closer

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.233
on the North American theater of this war,

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.005
which will have the most effect

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.338
on the future United States.

00:04:52.446 --> 00:04:56.684
Alright, so here is map
of territorial claims

00:04:56.684 --> 00:04:58.184
by European powers

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.754
in North America before
the Seven Years' War.

00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:09.221
Now you can see that there are some places

00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.113
where they overlap,

00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:14.502
which is really gonna be
the heart of the problem

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:15.919
in this conflict.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.730
So England, shown here in red,

00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.572
I'm gonna outline it a bit,

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.340
was, as you know from your
early American history,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.923
here along the eastern seaboard

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:34.006
of what's today the United States,

00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:35.604
and also up into Canada.

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:39.354
France claimed this
interior region of Canada

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.522
and today of the
territorial United States,

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:49.903
and Spain was in the mix here.

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:53.090
Remember Spain has still
been a fairly influential

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.173
colonial power in Florida

00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:58.327
and in contemporary Mexico,

00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:03.080
and also down here in
Cuba and South America.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.714
Alright, so we've got
three major European powers

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:09.464
in the mix here in North America,

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:12.488
England, France,

00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:15.614
and Spain,

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:21.070
but what this map doesn't show is

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.450
the American Indian powers,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.761
who are also in this area.

00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:28.713
So most of this region really west

00:06:28.713 --> 00:06:31.066
of the Appalachian mountains,

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:33.386
is Indian country,

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:37.553
and the majority of inhabitants
were Native Americans,

00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:41.879
and they really held the majority of power

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.791
in this region as well.

00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.791
So major Native American
groups that are in play

00:06:48.748 --> 00:06:52.248
in this conflict are Iroquois Confederacy,

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:55.521
and also Cherokees,

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:00.448
Hurons,

00:07:04.631 --> 00:07:05.631
Algonquians,

00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:13.894
Abenakis,

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:14.977
and Mi'kmaqs,

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.988
and that's just a small sampling.

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:25.215
So you can see that there are a number

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:28.132
of important Native American tribes

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.007
who are specifically
in this area of Canada,

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.772
which is disputed,

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:38.272
and also moving in

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.850
the greater Appalachian region.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:47.067
So what does each of these groups want?

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:50.484
Well, England definitely wants territory.

00:07:52.184 --> 00:07:55.851
They want to make sure that
they're English settlers

00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:57.507
along the eastern seaboard,

00:07:57.507 --> 00:08:00.251
whom we'll soon be calling Americans,

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.918
have room to expand.

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:10.261
The French wanna make sure that they still

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:13.761
have access to trade with Native Americans

00:08:17.984 --> 00:08:20.817
because their main concern is fur,

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.833
which is a very valuable
commodity in Europe,

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.503
and Spain wants to make sure that they

00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:33.336
have access to their sugar islands

00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:41.211
and also their precious metals

00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:44.994
in the Caribbean

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:48.469
and in South America.

00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:52.451
Now it's worth noting,

00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.402
'cause I think this is really
interesting to students

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:55.923
of American history,

00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:58.173
that all of this territory,

00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:01.368
all of North America,

00:09:01.368 --> 00:09:06.127
was way less valuable
than all of this territory

00:09:06.127 --> 00:09:10.180
because we're not talking
about just value in land.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.994
We're talking about value in commodities,

00:09:12.994 --> 00:09:16.077
and what the Caribbean had was sugar,

00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:20.638
and sugar is the most valuable crop

00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:22.696
in this time period.

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:26.507
So a tiny island down here in the Bahamas

00:09:26.507 --> 00:09:29.737
is probably worth more to a European power

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:33.708
than the entire interior of North America,

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:36.064
and what do these Native
American groups want?

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:39.356
Well, some of them want help with revenge

00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:41.092
on each other.

00:09:41.092 --> 00:09:44.070
Many other smaller Native American groups

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.965
have been displaced by the Iroquois,

00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:47.965
who are here

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:52.516
in upstate New York,
kind of Quebec region.

00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:55.614
So the Iroquois is actually expanding

00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:57.775
and really defending their claim

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:01.076
as the largest Native American empire,

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.290
but the other thing that they want

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.153
is to make sure that their territory

00:10:05.153 --> 00:10:07.486
is no longer encroached upon

00:10:08.884 --> 00:10:11.730
by English settlers in particular.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.134
Now one mistake I see early students

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:17.597
of U.S. history making is thinking that

00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:20.178
all Native Americans kind of shared

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:23.557
a cultural and political bond, right?

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:27.767
That they saw themselves
as one larger people

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:32.678
who had to unite against the
encroachment of Europeans,

00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:35.319
and that was definitely not the case.

00:10:35.319 --> 00:10:38.425
Native Americans had been
living in this territory

00:10:38.425 --> 00:10:40.953
for thousands of years,

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.370
and they had enemies and beef

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:47.242
with other groups that went back

00:10:47.242 --> 00:10:52.215
way longer than the arrival
of Europeans in North America.

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:55.465
So when nations like England and France

00:10:57.262 --> 00:11:01.591
arrived with their weapons
and their trade goods,

00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:04.565
the American Indians
didn't look at each other

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:07.174
and say, "Oh wait, now we're all one race.

00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:09.052
"We need to join together against

00:11:09.052 --> 00:11:11.206
"the encroachment of whites."

00:11:11.206 --> 00:11:14.613
They saw England and France and Spain

00:11:14.613 --> 00:11:17.696
as possible avenues to getting one up

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.225
on their older enemies.

00:11:21.225 --> 00:11:24.282
So when an English trader sold a gun

00:11:24.282 --> 00:11:25.699
to, say, a Huron,

00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:30.268
he was way more likely

00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:31.685
to go after, say,

00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:35.290
the Iroquois with that gun than he was

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.623
to go after a French trader.

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:40.519
So another reason why

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.750
the Seven Years' War is a better name

00:11:45.928 --> 00:11:47.791
for the French and Indian War

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.983
than French and Indian War is because

00:11:49.983 --> 00:11:53.183
these Native American groups did not ally

00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:55.001
all with France.

00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:57.834
In fact, the Iroquois and Cherokee

00:11:58.924 --> 00:12:01.419
ended up allied with England,

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:04.810
and most of the other
Native American groups

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.818
ended up allied with France,

00:12:06.818 --> 00:12:08.515
but they were fighting each other

00:12:08.515 --> 00:12:11.458
in addition to fighting England.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:15.557
Alright, so the stage
is set for this conflict

00:12:15.557 --> 00:12:18.848
with all of these competing groups

00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:21.015
in this unclear territory,

00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:25.290
and how this turns into a war,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.795
we'll get to in the next video.
