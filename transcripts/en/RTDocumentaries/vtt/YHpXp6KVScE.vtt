00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.160
I can't remember a thing

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.760
Nothing at all

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.360
I didn't understand what they did to me

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.200
When I came round they gave me drugs

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
When I turned 16, I cried a lot

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.680
They wanted me to dance, but I couldn't

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.180
I didn't know how to do it

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.760
Then they beat me

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
One girl said, 'There's no use crying

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.720
You'll never get help unless you leave'

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.320
I woke up thinking there's no point in living

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.040
If I died, at least I'd be free of this prison

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.840
Munni was offended, we'll try to persuade her

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.120
The sky is very blue,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.980
The sunflower is very yellow

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.440
A girl looks at a red rose

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.160
Rainclouds are very black

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.240
All the colours are very beautiful

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.620
They're all different and loved

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060
Good clients come to see me

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.560
The people who come here are very good

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880
First, we negotiate the price
and other conditions

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.160
They give me a certain advance
payment and I get to work

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.700
They want their parents' portraits
to pray in front of at home

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.580
They're framed and used
to remember their parents

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
It's not like how it used to be

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680
There was a time when things were poor

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.960
If we had one meal a day,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.880
we couldn't afford a second

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.760
That's why, deep down,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520
I've always felt upset

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.720
I've always thought that if
God had made me

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.160
an adult  much earlier,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.440
we would have long ago,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.840
and Mum wouldn't have had to show her 'art'

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.840
My mother's performances were really great

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.000
When she was dancing or singing 
nobody would look at anyone else

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.960
Come in, come in. Have a seat here

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.080
No one will film you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.360
We understand you're married.
Come and have a seat

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.960
This is my daughter-in-law

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.040
My name is Rinki. I was born here

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.160
My grandfather's sister used to dance

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.920
Then my mother came, and after her

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.800
we all moved here, due to our circumstances

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.840
I've been doing this since I was 8

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.680
I loved to dance and sing,
so I've been performing since then

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.200
We came to this district
when I was 14 or 15-years-old

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.800
They come in and ask if there'll be a show

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.560
We say, 'Yes, come in, have a seat'

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.680
We serve them refreshments

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.880
If they want to watch a dance,
we call the musicians in

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.720
Then the girls come

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.880
If there are a couple of performers,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.520
they'll watch the one they like

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.200
Right now the performers are in make-up
and waiting for clients

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.880
This district is known as
the city's red-light district

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.480
Everyone knows lots of young women
are ready to dance and sing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.920
It's a place with many traditions,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
which date back even to colonial times

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.240
Even back then, people
went there to watch the shows

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.440
If it's only singing and
dancing, there's no problem

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.560
There are good people here, who just sing and dance

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.160
but there also some bad people

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.720
They run dirty businesses like

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.400
prostitution and people trafficking

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.800
My name is Reshma Chand

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.880
I was born, raised and educated here

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm a businesswomen

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.680
I own 2-3 businesses and 4-5 rental properties

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.760
The income easily covers
my spending and sustenance,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360
so I use some of it to help others

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.520
As I live here, I know the locals well

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.120
I hear about their pain and problems,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.240
which means I become involved

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.720
That's why I am best placed
to do something for them.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.920
Is Nadjma there?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.160
Munni-bai dji!

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.800
Aleikum assalam!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.960
Is anyone there?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.520
Is Nadjma here? Call her

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.800
She should come

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.480
Just for two minutes

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.840
Nadjma!

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.840
Come here!

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.800
If you want to cry, come here

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.200
Put your head on my shoulder and cry

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.000
Is your heart beating fast?
Are you afraid?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.280
Listen, when they left you in this hell,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.880
didn't your heart tremble?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.120
Are you in trouble now?

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.040
Where you scared in that nightmare?

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.040
Do you remember giving
birth to your child so young?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.520
Didn't your heart tremble then?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.160
You have brothers, sisters,
and a child of your own

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.000
Do you want to give your child an education?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.600
Do you earn enough to do that?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.360
I spend everything I earn
taking care of everyone

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.360
First of all, I have a mother,
4 sisters and 2 brothers

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.920
I also have 3 children,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.080
a son who isn't here now, and my sister's son.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.440
My dad was in a bad way

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.680
There was no one at home

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.360
Mum did side jobs

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.720
She had no time to do
all the necessary chores

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.960
Dad had untreatable asthma

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.160
I was 13 when he died

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.560
We've been doing this job ever since

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.680
A friend promised we'd be paid

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.920
if we danced

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.320
As we were desperate for money,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.920
we started dancing and singing

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:51.440
We live on Shukla Road,
a 'professional street'

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.160
You find many prostitutes here

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.760
They end up here for many reasons

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.840
Some have been sold and forced into it,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.280
others are locals who inherited
the trade from their mothers

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.520
They all have one thing in common:

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.680
they do it because they're in need

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.800
My boat is spinning like a bee.
Why are you swimming so deep?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.560
You're the only one in my life.
What did I do wrong?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:47.120
Why are you rejecting me?
Life or death, oh, mother!

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.920
It's bad to cause people pain

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.160
Let's sing together

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.720
Ok. Who's next?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.680
- It's your turn!
- No, not me

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.120
Yes, it is. Sing something short

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.040
Women stay here for a minimum of 3 months

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.600
We provide food, board and
other necessary provisions

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.200
The women who come here
suffer from family problems

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.720
We also protect victims of
domestic violence

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.720
Here they are safe

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.960
These women have been through a lot

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.640
Once I dreamt someone was beating me

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.280
I woke up and there was no one there

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.280
It was probably because I was constantly beaten

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.720
Chandni was brought to us by the police

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.120
She was very depressed and
afraid when the police left,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.040
as she didn't know what this place was

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.520
She was afraid of something bad happening to her

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.600
She spent 2 days here and was very down

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.000
After two or three counselling sessions
she gradually began to speak

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.960
My parents both had heart problems

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.640
They left me with a woman
and told me to live there

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.120
They told me to ask her
to feed me if I was hungry

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.960
When she was 8,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.680
her family decided their
neighbours should raise her

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.080
She went to live with them,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.520
and washed their clothes and their dishes

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.800
They sold me to other people,
who sent me elsewhere

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.560
I ran away and met a girl, Sweetie

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.640
She said, 'Neither of us have anyone

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.480
I'll get you a job,
so work hard and keep studying'

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.440
She didn't let go of me and
she fed me on the way to Suvali

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.880
There, she sold me to Harkishta

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:41.200
In the Harkishta, illegal activities
go on behind the blinds

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.400
- What happened to you?
- They did dirty things to me

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.920
I ran away from there many times too

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.000
I was sold two or three times

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.280
- What happened exactly?
- I was beaten

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.320
They cut me here

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.320
Later, when I was brought to Punevas,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.840
they really tried to make me
do dirty things, but I wouldn't

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.000
I said, 'Kill me, but I won't do it'

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.560
Then they beat me, 3-4 people every day

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.640
Later, I ran away from there too

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.600
Very dirty business was going on there

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.360
What exactly were their demands?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.320
Sex

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.960
The only answer was to run away

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.120
Let's shout, 'Shiva's beating a drum!'

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.560
Our God Shiva is our defender!

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.160
Participants, please come
and take a festive treat!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.720
And let's all cry out,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.120
'All hail Rama!

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.680
All hail Hanuman!'

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.680
A dancing party would be organised

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.160
for all the young girls
who had reached maturity

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.840
They wouldn't know how
many girls there would be

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.040
The temple's main priests would then

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.480
select girls to become 'devadasi'

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.320
They simply proclaimed girls 'devadasi'

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.960
meaning they would satisfy
the gods' sexual desires

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.600
So the priests did what they
pleased to them on behalf of the gods

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.320
As the girls slept in the temple,

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.720
any priest could come and take one

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.400
That's the horrible life these girls had

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.880
When the British came,
they ended this horrible system

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.320
But what were the girls to do?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.040
They had to earn a living,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.640
so the system was transformed into a business

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.000
Dancing and singing became their business

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.000
Before, they weren't paid
by those who used them,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.400
now they all take money

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.720
It's simply a cultural tradition
that became a business

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.320
It's good to study in this school

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.280
She began her education aged
4, and is now in first grade

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.680
She passes her tests

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.440
She's learning English, Hindi and maths

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.560
She studies well

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.520
She'll finish school,
find a good job and work well

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.600
This is my dream and plan for the future

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.360
Why are you using only one finger? Use five

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.640
Like this?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.320
Use your fingertips instead of one finger

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.360
- Like this.
- Open your palm

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.480
If you eat with one finger, I'll cut it

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.840
It's about reputation

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.520
My daughter's ashamed
to be from this community

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.360
People know what kind
of people are around her

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.240
She asks who her father is

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.720
Where would I find his name?

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.040
No one openly calls herself a prostitute

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.360
Any children that result
can't bear the man's name,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.520
but, naturally, every girl has her man

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.880
- How many clients do you have?
- Just the one. He's a local

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.080
He is local. He owns a store where I did my shopping

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.320
He has two children, a son and daughter

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.280
I don't want to be a home-wrecker

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.760
I'm happy with him here,
I don't need his house

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Even if I went to his house, I'd still be branded.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.920
But he'll lose his reputation.
He has a wife...He is married, has kids

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.000
There's a saying,
'People prefer street pilaf to homemade'

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.160
I'm his street pilaf

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.880
This is a drawing of my mother

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.400
I felt the urge, so I'm doing it

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.560
I'll make a portrait, paint it, prepare it

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.880
It will take some time

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.360
Nothing compares to your mum

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.560
There's her, and there's everything else

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.640
Listen, the people here are desperate

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.000
They're stuck in this horrible place

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.360
Getting out, by finding a job for example,
would solve their problems

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.760
As soon as they find another
source of income,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.360
they won't want to return
to this accursed swamp

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.320
Destitution is why they are still here

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.880
- I don't want tea!
- Why don't you?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.120
Gimme, gimme!

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.040
- It's 2 rupees
- No, it's 5

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.400
Go buy something

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.120
As I said, a sex worker who
doesn't have relatives employs

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.680
a babysitter who looks after
her child while she's working

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.600
Not everyone has the money,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.560
so I opened a kindergarten for children

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.120
whose mothers can't afford a babysitter

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.200
The children here receive some education

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.920
Three little birds...

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.960
...were eating a pomegranate

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.480
One flew away...

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.480
Two are here to stay!

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.640
I'd like there to be a child care centre

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.840
where we could look after
kids from 9 am. to 9 pm

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.040
We could also teach the main
subjects and sports for free

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.560
And...

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.320
depending on their favourite hobby,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.080
singing, dancing or music

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.200
I'm eager to help those in need of education

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.160
I also like dancing very much

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.520
Not vulgar, half-naked
dancing, of course,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:04.720
but the classical forms
such as Kathak and others

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.600
It's classical dance that I'm interested in

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.920
I'm paying for everything

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.240
I bear all the expenses. 
And I don't refuse anybody if they ask for help.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.400
I'd like to help the locals,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.560
those who wallow in dirt
and vice, to live normal lives

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.080
It depends on the woman

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.840
They talk with clients and
go with them if they want

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.680
If a woman is pretty, it's 3-5 thousand rupees

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.880
My friend told me that I wouldn't
get anywhere if I did nothing

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.200
My dad was ill and the
situation was desperate. So I did it

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.920
I didn't want to do it, but...

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.920
What don't you want?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.720
To sell my body, to dance
and sing. It's all so dirty

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.680
The men are often drunk

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.280
No surprise in it. That's the business

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.640
I'd need support to be able to quit

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.760
Oh my sunshine! My beauty!

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.560
Wake up, baby, wake up!

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.640
My sunshine, come on, wake up!

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.400
How long will you sleep, baby?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.480
Is it true that you're pregnant?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.000
Yes

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.240
- Who's the father?
- Kankhaya.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.440
- Where does he live?
- He has a house in Suboli, Pipalkoti

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.320
But he's married, so...

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.720
My parents have never wondered...

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.400
where their daughter is.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.040
If they knew I was in that district, 
they'd never talk tome

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.920
I want to get on my feet

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.360
I don't want to be a slave
and I don't want to marry

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.200
I want to be independent

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.400
I hope to God I get my children an education

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.440
I want to send them to a good school,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.680
then I'll have my own house,
and quit dancing and singing

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.080
My family will live alone

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.200
Maybe I'll open a small shop to earn a living.
That's it
