00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:01.920
What we're going
to do in this video

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.190
is study a proof of
the Pythagorean theorem

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.590
that was first
discovered, or as far

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.695
as we know first discovered,
by James Garfield in 1876,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.070
and what's exciting
about this is

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.670
he was not a professional
mathematician.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.086
You might know James Garfield
as the 20th president

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:21.960
of the United States.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.950
He was elected president.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.070
He was elected in 1880, and then
he became president in 1881.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.930
And he did this proof while
he was a sitting member

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.889
of the United States
House of Representatives.

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.264
And what's exciting
about that is

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.390
that it shows that Abraham
Lincoln was not the only US

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.330
politician or not the only
US President who was really

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.280
into geometry.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.429
And what Garfield realized
is, if you construct

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.970
a right triangle--
so I'm going to do

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.310
my best attempt
to construct one.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.820
So let me construct
one right here.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.440
So let's say this side
right over here is length b.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.060
Let's say this side is
length a, and let's say

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.269
that this side, the hypotenuse
of my right triangle,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.150
has length c.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.860
So I've just constructed
enough a right triangle,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.200
and let me make it clear.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020
It is a right triangle.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.090
He essentially flipped and
rotated this right triangle

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.750
to construct another one that
is congruent to the first one.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.900
So let me construct that.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.420
So we're going to have length b,
and it's collinear with length

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.920
a.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.600
It's along the same
line, I should say.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.530
They don't overlap
with each other.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.070
So this is side of
length b, and then you

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.340
have a side of
length-- let me draw

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.460
a it so this will be a little
bit taller-- side of length b.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.210
And then, you have your side
of length a at a right angle.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.190
Your side of length a
comes in at a right angle.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.970
And then, you have
your side of length c.

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:57.940
So the first thing we
need to think about

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.190
is what's the angle
between these two sides?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.140
What's this mystery angle?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.787
What's that mystery
angle going to be?

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:08.620
Well, it looks like
something, but let's see

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.411
if we can prove to
ourselves that it really

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:12.570
is what we think it looks like.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.340
If we look at this
original triangle

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.030
and we call this
angle "theta," what's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.210
this angle over here,
the angle that's

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.840
between sides of
length a and length c?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.000
What's the measure of
this angle going to be?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.650
Well, theta plus this
angle have to add up to 90.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.900
Because you add those two
together, they add up to 90.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.149
And then, you have another 90.

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.080
You're going to get 180
degrees for the interior angles

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.640
of this triangle.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.360
So these two have
to add up to 90.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.950
This angle is going
to be 90 minus theta.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.850
Well, if this triangle
appears congruent--

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.110
and we've constructed
it so it is congruent--

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.600
the corresponding
angle to this one

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.850
is this angle right over here.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.430
So this is also going to be
theta, and this right over here

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.385
is going to be 90 minus theta.

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:54.760
So given that this
is theta, this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.550
is 90 minus theta, what
is our angle going to be?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.310
Well, they all collectively
go 180 degrees.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.010
So you have theta,
plus 90 minus theta,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.020
plus our mystery angle is going
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.770
The thetas cancel out.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.840
Theta minus theta.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.610
And you have 90 plus our
mystery angle is 180 degrees.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.840
Subtract 90 from
both sides, and you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.310
are left with your mystery
angle equaling 90 degrees.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.950
So that all worked out well.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.130
So let me make that
clear, and that's

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.940
going to be useful
for us in a second.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.960
It's going to be useful.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.840
So we can now say definitively
that this is 90 degrees.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.260
This is a right angle.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.780
Now, what we are
going to do is we

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.350
are going to
construct a trapezoid.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.490
This side a is parallel
to side b down here,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.190
the way it's been constructed,
and this is just one side right

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.960
over here.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.760
This goes straight
up, and now let's just

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.890
connect these two
sides right over there.

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.310
So there's a couple
of ways to think

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.940
about the area of
this trapezoid.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.090
One is we could just
think of it as a trapezoid

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.970
and come up with its
area, and then we

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.190
could think about it as the sum
of the areas of its components.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.900
So let's just first think
of it as a trapezoid

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.410
so what do we know about
the area of a trapezoid?

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.580
Well, the area of a
trapezoid is going

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.590
to be the height of the
trapezoid, which is a plus b.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.930
That's the height
of the trapezoid.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.500
Times-- the way I
think of it-- the mean

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.260
of the top and the
bottom, or the average

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.405
of the top and the bottom.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.510
Since that's this times one
half times a plus a plus b.

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:01.280
And the intuition there,
you're taking the height

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.030
times the average of
this bottom and the top.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.530
The average of the
bottom and the top

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.510
gives you the area
of the trapezoid.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.500
Now, how could we
also figure out

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.260
the area with its
component parts?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.470
Regardless of how we
calculate the area, as long

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.050
as we do correct things,
we should come up

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.900
with the same result.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.260
So how else can we
come up with this area?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.170
Well, we could say it's the
area of the two right triangles.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:37.260
The area of each of them
is one half a times b,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.260
but there's two of them.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.160
Let me do that b in
that same blue color.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.500
But there's two of
these right triangle.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.710
So let's multiply by two.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.170
So two times one half ab.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.360
That takes into consideration
this bottom right triangle

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.880
and this top one.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.400
And what's the area
of this large one

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.150
that I will color in in green?

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.200
What's the area
of this large one?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.920
Well, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.800
It's just one half c times c.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.280
So plus one half c times c,
which is one half c squared.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.560
Now, let's simplify this thing
and see what we come up with,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.360
and you might guess where
all of this is going.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.520
So let's see what we get.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.680
So we can rearrange this.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.670
Let me rearrange this.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:36.370
So one half times
a plus b squared

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.740
is going to be equal
to 2 times one half.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.280
Well, that's just
going to be one.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.855
So it's going to be equal
to a times b, plus one half

00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:49.355
c squared.

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.350
Well, I don't like these
one halfs laying around,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.770
so let's multiply both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.930
I'm just going to multiply both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.386
On the left-hand side, I'm just
left with a plus b squared.

00:07:05.386 --> 00:07:06.260
So let me write that.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.395
And on the right-hand
side, I am left with 2ab.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.530
Trying to keep the
color coding right.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.220
And then, 2 times
one half c squared,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.250
that's just going to be
c squared plus c squared.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.870
Well, what happens
if you multiply out

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.260
a plus b times a plus b?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.740
What is a plus b squared?

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:45.590
Well, it's going to be a
squared plus 2ab plus 2ab plus b

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.230
squared.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.080
And then, our
right-hand side it's

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.930
going to be equal to
all of this business.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.390
And changing all the
colors is difficult for me,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.009
so let me copy and
let me paste it.

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:01.300
So it's still going to be
equal to the right-hand side.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.440
Well, this is interesting.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.660
How can we simplify this?

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.427
Is there anything that we
can subtract from both sides?

00:08:07.427 --> 00:08:08.260
Well, sure there is.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.790
You have a 2ab on
the left-hand side.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.373
You have a 2ab on
the right-hand side.

00:08:11.373 --> 00:08:14.830
Let's subtract 2ab
from both sides.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.650
If you subtract 2ab from both
sides, what are you left with?

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.340
You are left with the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:31.040
So you're left with a squared
plus b squared is equal

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.120
to c squared.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.130
Very, very exciting.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.799
And for that, we have to
thank the 20th president

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.919
of the United States,
James Garfield.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.890
This is really exciting.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.490
The Pythagorean theorem, it was
around for thousands of years

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.160
before James
Garfield, and he was

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.900
able to contribute just
kind of fiddling around

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.206
while he was a member of the
US House of Representatives.
