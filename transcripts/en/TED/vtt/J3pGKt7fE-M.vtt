00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:14.943
It's 4am in the morning.

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.579
I'm waking up in a Boston hotel room

00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:20.501
and can only think of one thing:

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:23.142
tooth pain.

00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.607
One of my ceramic inlays
fell off the evening before.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:31.695
Five hours later,
I'm sitting in a dentist's chair.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.339
But instead of having a repair of my inlay
so that I can get rid of my pain,

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:41.279
the dentist pitches me on the advantages
of a titanium implant surgery.

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:43.891
Ever heard of that?

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:45.276
(Laughter)

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.021
It essentially means to replace
a damaged tooth

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:50.756
by an artificial one,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.669
that is screwed into your jaw.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:58.616
Estimated costs for the implant surgery
may add up to 10,000 US dollars.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:02.093
Replacing the ceramic inlay I had before

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:04.050
would come in at 100 US dollars.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.017
Was it my health or the money
that could be earned with me

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.767
that was the biggest concern
for my dentist?

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.403
As it turned out, my experience
wasn't an isolated case.

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:24.211
A study by a US national newspaper
estimated that in the United States,

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:27.537
up to 30 percent of all
surgical procedures --

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.117
including stent
and pacemaker implantations,

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.477
hip replacements and uterus removals --

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.652
were conducted

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:39.849
although other nonsurgical treatment
options had not been fully exploited

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.443
by the physician in charge.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.858
Isn't that figure shocking?

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:48.435
Numbers may be slightly different
in other countries,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.268
but what it means is that
if you go to a doctor in the US,

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:57.164
you have a not-insignificant chance
to be subjected to a surgical intervention

00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:59.521
without there being
an immediate need for it.

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.782
Why is this?

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:07.041
Why are some practitioners incentivized
to run such unnecessary procedures?

00:02:09.243 --> 00:02:14.514
Well, perhaps it is because
health care systems themselves

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:17.133
incentivize in a nonideal way

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:20.977
towards applying or not applying
certain procedures or treatments.

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.562
As most health care systems
reimburse practitioners

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:27.078
in a fee-for-service-based fashion

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:30.776
on the number and kind
of treatments performed,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.440
it may be this economic incentive
that tempts some practitioners

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:37.027
to rather perform high-profit
surgical treatments

00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.749
instead of exploring
other treatment options.

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:43.163
Although certain countries
started to implement

00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:45.212
performance-based reimbursement,

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:48.102
anchored on a quality and efficacy matrix,

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:52.824
overall, there's very little in today's
health care systems' architecture

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:54.932
to incentivize practitioners broadly

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:58.548
to actively prevent the appearance
of a disease in the first place

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:01.134
and to limit the procedures
applied to a patient

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.158
to the most effective options.

00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:05.459
So how do we fix this?

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:10.209
What it may take is a fundamental redesign

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.405
of our health care
system's architecture --

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.302
a complete rethinking
of the incentive structure.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.458
What we may need is a health care system

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:22.545
that reimburses practitioners
for keeping their customers healthy

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.018
instead of almost only paying for services
once people are already sick.

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:30.491
What we may need is a transformation

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:34.195
from today's system
that largely cares for the sick,

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:37.503
to a system that cares for the healthy.

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:41.426
To change our current "sick care" approach

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.742
into a true "health care" approach.

00:03:44.784 --> 00:03:49.387
It is a paradigm shift from treating
people once they have become sick

00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.998
to preserving the health of the healthy
before they get sick.

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:57.164
This shift may move the focus
of all those involved --

00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:02.403
from doctors, to hospitals,
to pharmaceutical and medical companies --

00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:05.804
on the product that this industry
ultimately sells:

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:08.156
health.

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.146
Imagine the following.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.130
What if we redesign our health care system

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:18.012
into one that does not
reimburse practitioners

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:20.837
for the actual procedures
performed on a patient

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.887
but rather reimburses doctors, hospitals,

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.069
pharmaceutical and medical companies

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:29.086
for every day a single
individual is kept healthy

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.770
and doesn't develop a disease?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.188
In practical terms, we could, for example,

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:38.529
use public money to pay a health fee
to an insurance company

00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:41.056
for every day a single individual
is kept healthy

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.552
and doesn't develop a disease

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:46.338
or doesn't require any other form
of acute medical intervention.

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:49.299
If the individual becomes sick,

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:54.037
the insurance company will not receive
any further monetary compensation

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:58.180
for the medical interventions required
to treat the disease of that individual,

00:04:58.204 --> 00:05:02.252
but they would be obliged to pay
for every evidence-based treatment option

00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:04.640
to return the customer back to health.

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:07.953
Once the customer's healthy again,

00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:11.056
the health fee for that individual
will be paid again.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:14.228
In effect, all players in the system

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:17.752
are now responsible for keeping
their customers healthy,

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:22.149
and they're incentivized to avoid
any unnecessary medical interventions

00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:26.929
by simply reducing the number of people
that eventually become sick.

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:30.925
The more healthy people there are,

00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:34.637
the less the cost
to treat the sick will be,

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:39.299
and the higher the economic benefit
for all parties being involved

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:41.989
in keeping these individuals healthy is.

00:05:43.323 --> 00:05:45.943
This change of the incentive
structure shifts, now,

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:48.228
the attention of the complete
health care system

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:52.506
away from providing isolated
and singular treatment options,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.776
towards a holistic view of what is useful

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.066
for an individual
to stay healthy and live long.

00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:04.426
Now, to effectively preserve health,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.593
people will need to be willing
to share their health data

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.125
on a constant basis,

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.236
so that the health care system
understands early enough

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.274
if any assistance with regard
to their health is needed.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:18.299
Physical examination,

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:20.656
monitoring of lifetime health data

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.982
as well as genetic sequencing,
cardiometabolic profiling

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.006
and imaging-based technologies

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.624
will allow customers to make,

00:06:28.648 --> 00:06:32.029
together with health coaches
and general practitioners,

00:06:32.053 --> 00:06:34.823
optimal and science-guided decisions --

00:06:34.847 --> 00:06:39.061
for their diet, their medication
and their physical activity --

00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:41.669
to diminish their unique probability

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:45.730
to fall sick of an identified,
individual high-risk disease.

00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:49.538
Artificial intelligence-based
data analysis

00:06:49.562 --> 00:06:51.712
and the miniaturization
of sensor technologies

00:06:51.736 --> 00:06:55.865
are already starting to make monitoring
of the individual health status possible.

00:06:57.118 --> 00:07:00.354
Measuring cardiometabolic parameters
by devices like this

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:04.649
or the detection of circulating
tumor DNA in your bloodstream

00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:06.998
early on after cancer disease onset

00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:10.018
are only two examples
for such monitoring technologies.

00:07:11.084 --> 00:07:12.234
Take cancer.

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:16.488
One of the biggest problems
in certain oncological diseases

00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:20.815
is that a large number of patients
is diagnosed too late

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.466
to allow them to be cured,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.879
although the drugs and treatments
that could potentially have cured them

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:27.720
are already existing today,

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:30.232
if the disease had only
been detected earlier.

00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:35.085
New technologies allow now,
based on a few milliliters of blood,

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:37.899
to detect the presence
of circulating tumor DNA

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:39.641
and thus, the presence of cancer,

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:42.032
early on in a really convenient manner.

00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:45.633
The impact that this early-stage
detection can have

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.450
may be dramatic.

00:07:48.893 --> 00:07:52.546
The five-year survival rate
for non-small cell lung cancer

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.488
when diagnosed at stage one,
which is early, is 49 percent.

00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:02.617
The same, when diagnosed
at stage four, which is late,

00:08:03.206 --> 00:08:04.705
is below one percent.

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:10.196
Being potentially able
to prevent a large number of deaths

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.660
by something as simple as a blood test
for circulating tumor DNA

00:08:15.684 --> 00:08:18.537
could make certain cancer types
a manageable disease,

00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:21.379
as disease onset can be detected earlier

00:08:21.403 --> 00:08:24.680
and positive treatment outcomes
can likely be increased.

00:08:27.593 --> 00:08:28.973
In 2012,

00:08:30.124 --> 00:08:34.760
50 percent of all Americans
had a single chronic disease,

00:08:34.784 --> 00:08:40.172
resulting in 86 percent
of the $3 trillion US health care budget

00:08:40.196 --> 00:08:42.558
being spent for treating
such chronic diseases.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.381
Eighty-six percent.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:53.366
If new technologies allow now
to reduce this 86 percent,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.465
why have health care systems
not reacted and changed already?

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:03.734
Well, a redesign of what today
is a sick care system

00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:07.696
into a true health care system
that focuses on prevention

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.886
and behavioral changes

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.740
requires every actor
in the system to change.

00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:16.072
It requires the political willingness
to shift budgets and policies

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:18.394
towards prevention and health education

00:09:18.418 --> 00:09:21.944
to design a new set of financial
and non-financial incentives.

00:09:22.902 --> 00:09:25.554
It requires creating
a regulatory framework

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:29.998
for the gathering, using and sharing
of personal health data

00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:32.502
that's at the same time
stringent and sensible.

00:09:33.157 --> 00:09:37.950
It needs doctors, hospitals, insurers,
pharmaceutical and medical companies

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:41.895
to reframe their approach
and, most important,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:45.029
it can't happen without
the willingness and motivation

00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:49.557
of individuals to change their lifestyle
in a sustained way,

00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.724
to prioritize staying healthy,

00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:55.854
in addition to opening up for sharing
the health data on a constant basis.

00:09:56.668 --> 00:09:58.791
This change may not come overnight.

00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:03.395
But by refocusing the incentives
within the health care industry today

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:05.958
to actively keep people healthy,

00:10:05.982 --> 00:10:09.863
we may not only be able to prevent
more diseases in the first place

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:13.508
but we may also be able to detect
the onset of certain preventable diseases

00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:15.276
earlier than we do today,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.738
which will lead to longer
and healthier lives for more people.

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:23.006
Most of the technologies
that we need to initiate that change

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.680
are already existing today.

00:10:25.327 --> 00:10:27.331
But this is not a technology question.

00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:30.410
It is primarily a question of vision

00:10:31.156 --> 00:10:32.306
and will.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.651
Thanks a lot.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:39.190
(Applause)
