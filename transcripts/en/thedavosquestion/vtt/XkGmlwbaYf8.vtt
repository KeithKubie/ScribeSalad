00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.750
&gt;&gt; So what is FGM?
It's very simply the removal of a girl's external

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.770
genitals, the
clitoris, the labia, and in severe cases,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.020
the wound that's left is sewn
up so there's only a tiny hole left.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.130
It's done simply to control women.
It predates religion, it's not done for religious

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.880
purposes.
Parents to do it because they feel that their

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
daughters will then be
married.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:43.739
They don't do it just to inflect pain on them.
And it's an incredibly difficult social issue

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.719
that has to be changed
through talking with communities.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.960
And what you're seeing there is the most intensive
form, which is

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.339
called infibulation.
You can see the impact this is going to have.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.960
Basically you're closing up and sealing the
entire genitals.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.080
What happens as a result is that a women's
virginity is ensured, that

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.840
she will remain chaste so her husband knows
that fidelity won't be an

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.220
issue.
It's a very, very complex issue.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.390
Yet it's also very straightforward.
