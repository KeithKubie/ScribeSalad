00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.750
So let's discuss the speedup numbers we can

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.320
get. We have already seen in the previous

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.058
quizzes that a speedup larger than one means

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:12.541
improved performance. Either through shorter execution time it takes

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:15.607
less to compute something than before, or higher

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:18.308
throughput, we can do more of something per

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:21.640
second than before. A speedup of less than

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.170
one means that we have worse performance than before.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.990
Either it takes longer to execute something, or

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.010
we get lower throughput that before. And finally, when

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.430
computing speed up, remember that performance is proportional

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.270
to throughput. So when computing speed up, we divide

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.410
the throughput of the new thing with the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.870
throughput of the old thing. However, performance is proportional

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.716
to 1 over latency. So, if we have

00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:50.912
something like, it takes two seconds to do something,

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:55.806
that's a latency. Performance in this case is 1 over that. So,

00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:58.497
when computing speedups, we actually divide

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.720
the old latency with the new latency.
