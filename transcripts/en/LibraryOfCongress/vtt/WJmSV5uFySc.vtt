00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.310
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Welcome to
the Books and Beyond, Young --

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.690
Program for young people sponsored
by the Center for the Book

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.500
and the Young Readers Center.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.900
I'm Karen Jaffe, head of
the Young Readers Center.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.240
And I'd like to start by welcoming
our very important guests,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.920
students from the District
of Columbia

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.260
and when I say your school
please raise your hands.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.720
Friendship Collegiate
Academy Public Charter School,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.700
Cesar Chavez Public Charter
School for Public Policy,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.640
Thurgood Marshall Academy,
Gonzaga College High School,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.860
Stewart Hobson Middle School,
and Washington School for Girls.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.510
Let's everybody give a hand.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:22.420
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.520
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: I'd like
also to take a moment

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.240
to thank Kathy Wineburg,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.030
a consultant to the Young
Readers Center for the second year

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.210
of our teen board program.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.080
The idea of this event
essentially came from Kathy

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.270
and my very able assistant
to the YRC, Kahim Mohammad.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.140
We're pleased to have
representatives from two

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.980
of our teen board schools,
Cesar Chavez and Stewart Hobson.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.270
We also want to thank the rest
of our staff and volunteers,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.680
without whom we could not
have produced this event.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.570
So, please if you're with
the YRC raise your hands

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.800
so everybody can see you.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.180
And we want to thank the
publishers of All American Boys,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.780
Simon and Schuster for sending
the authors Jason Reynolds

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.220
and Brendan Kiely.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.810
Both Jason and Brendan
are established writers

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.630
of teen literature.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm not going to steal
their own description

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.380
of the collaboration they produced,
except to say that this book

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.580
about race and police brutality
was inspired by many true

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.930
and recent events in too many
cities around our country.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.660
And since this event is
being held in a library,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.100
I want to take the liberty
in deference to the teachers

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.060
and librarians in the room to
reference an important Black author

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.210
by the name of Ralph Ellison,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.200
whose short story Battle
Royal became the --

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.250
which became the first
chapter in his very famous book

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.850
from 1952, "The Invisible Man".

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.600
Was included in the storyline
of All American Boys.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.800
So when you get back to
the classroom or even home

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.050
or in the library after
reading Jason

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.580
and Brendan's book you
might want to check

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.780
out "The Invisible Man" as well.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.340
Two important housekeeping items.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.820
This program is being
videotaped, you will have a chance

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.020
to ask questions later

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.950
and the authors will
explain how that will work.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.690
Essentially what's going
to happen is you have cards

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.350
in front of you, and pencils.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.610
As the program goes along you might
think of a question, jot it down.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.040
You have two options; you can put
it in a basket that will be passed

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.930
around to pick up the
questions before we start.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.090
And, you also have an
option of raising your hand

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.740
and speaking directly into the mic.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.070
So, you can decide when that
time comes which will be

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.870
at the end of the program.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.930
When the program is over, I
know we haven't started yet,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.270
but please remember I will
call the schools as you exit.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.890
Not everyone will get up and walk

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.610
out at the same time,
that's impossible.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.460
So, I will call the school and
you will exit when I call you.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.790
And lastly there's some schools
that have not picked up your books.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.900
They are at the table
right outside here

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.640
where the public book
signing is taking place.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.730
So, educators if you've
ordered a bag

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.090
of books please pick them
up after the program.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.000
And now it is my honor to
introduce Jason and Brendan.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
Thank you.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.140
[ Applause ]

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.210
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: So
with that -- you all good?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.990
Everybody good?

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.290
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: All right.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.460
So it is a -- I'm good?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.290
Here's the thing, my name is Jason.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.280
And to explain sort of what brought
me to this book, what brought me

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.840
to this book; I'm going
to tell you a quick story.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.140
1998, all right?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.440
So how old are you all?

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.240
Some of you all --
when you all born?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.070
[ Cross talking ]

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.890
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: So
none of you all were born.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.340
None of you all were born.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.990
But anyway, I was born.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.290
I was alive.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.680
1998, right?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.690
Here's the deal.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.460
Me and my homey's, it's
like four of us in the car.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.760
There was a car back in the
day called a Nissan Stanza;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.060
none of you all know what it is

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.360
because they don't
make them anymore.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.660
You know, it was a Nissan Stanza.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.330
What did it look like?

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.290
&gt;&gt; Like a little car.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Like a little car.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.890
It's like -- it's sort
of like a car.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.480
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: It's like a car.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.820
The Nissan Stanza was basically
like this strange little car

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.370
that they made back in the day,
but it was also sort of like a van,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.570
sort of like a truck, like a
weird little vehicle, right?

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.200
And it had a sliding door on one
side, but it was only like --

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.730
it was tiny little car
with a sliding door, right?

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.030
Very strange.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.330
Four of us are in the car.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.650
We're riding down 23rd and Parkway.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.020
You all know where
23rd and Parkway is?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.320
Around there right?

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.620
All right.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.920
So I'm from here.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.220
I'm from your neighborhood.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.610
I'm from Wheeler Road,
all right, right?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.620
All right, so we riding
down 23rd and Parkway.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.700
It's the middle of the day.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.300
I'm thinking like maybe
3:30, the music is blasting.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.890
We playing something crazy.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.000
I can't think of what the song was
now, but it's like the equivalent

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.850
like in today's time
which I would be playing,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.300
like Drake and Future, or whatever.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.860
Like something just wild, right?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.920
We blasting it.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.080
And we get to a yellow light,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.030
as the light turns yellow
as we're approaching it.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.190
And my homey who is driving
drives through the yellow light,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.520
right and makes the left turn.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.470
Technically he didn't
break no law, right?

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.900
He makes the left turn,
we see the sirens.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.200
Woot, woot.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.940
Now everybody in my neighborhood,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.680
everybody in my neighborhood
already knows what time it is.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.930
We were all raised to believe
like listen, "You ever get pulled

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.530
over by the cops, yes sir,
no sir, hands up", right?

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.210
My hands on the wheel, everybody
doing what they're supposed to do.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.470
The cop walks over to the car.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.980
Remember there's four
of us in the car.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.280 position:56%
He walks over to the car and he says

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.850
"Let me get your license
and registration".

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.820
My buddy is like "You why
we being pulled over"?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.300
The cop is like "Well
you ran a red light".

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.510
My ma is like "It wasn't
a red light.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.390
The light was yellow".

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.190
He's like "Doesn't matter; give
me your license and registration".

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.360
My friend can't find the
registration to his car.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.000
Now remember there's four of us.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.820
There's two people in the front
and two people in the back.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.690
Now the guy in the back seat,
behind the passenger side is one

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.880
of your homey's who is
like kind of stupid, right?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.100
You know everybody has the one
friend you're like "Dog", like --

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.730
it's like that guy, right?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.060
[ Laughter ]

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.290
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You
all know this guy, right?

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.150
So, so here's what happened.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.840
So here's what happens.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.140
So here's what happens, right?

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.440
We look -- we turn
around to our homey

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.480
and say "Listen check behind the
seat in the pocket behind the seat

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.900
and see if the registration
is there.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.360
If it is, don't open the door.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.730
Just pass it to me and
I'll pass it to the cop".

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.910
The cop has walked back to
his vehicle at this point

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.910
to run the license and do all
this, that and give him the time

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.210
to find the registration.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.970
So we're all digging through the
car, digging through the car.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.830
Finally, the dumb one, right?

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.620
He reaches in the back pocket,
he pulls out, he's like "Yo,

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.050
I found the registration".

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.410
Remember it's a sliding door;
this car has a sliding door.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.270
I don't know -- minivans are
really quiet these days, right?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.660
But like back in the day when
you opened a sliding door it was

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.120
like hearing a lion's roar, right?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.010
You opened the door
there was so much noise.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.790
So, he opens the door
and literally a second

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.880
into opening the door the
cop is like with his gun out,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.000
like gun in the car in our faces.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.600
Now here's the thing,
let's be clear.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.730
I'm not necessarily upset about
the fact the cop drew his gun

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.540
because my home boy opened the door
and that was a ridiculous thing

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.110
to do, and so the cop
obviously went on the defense.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.730
But what happens next is
ridiculous, true story.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.850
What happens after my friend
opens the door, the cop tells him

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.490
to close the door after
we're all scared to death

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.480
because the gun is in our faces.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.670
We sit in the car for
five more minutes.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.160
The next thing you know
there are four cops, right.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.250
Four cop cars pulling up behind us.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.820
They all come over to us.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.450
They say, "Do you have any guns?

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.880
Do you have any drugs"?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.090
We say "No, we're coming
from high school.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.390
We're coming from our school.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.360
We have no guns, we have no drugs.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.660
This is our neighborhood.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.960
We're just trying to get home;

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.030
we've done nothing but
run a yellow light".

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.290
The officers say "I don't believe
you, everybody out of the car".

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.410
Five minutes later we're all
out -- there's four of us,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.610
all out of the car with
face down, we're handcuffed

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.640
and they tear his car apart.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.180
I'm talking like everything, tear
the seats out, looking for --

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.140
looking for something
that's not there.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.120
Right, they took everything
out of his glove compartment,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.880
they look under everything,
they empty out his trunk,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.900
put everything on the street.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.860
They pull everything out
of the car and put it all

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.470
on the street while we laid there
on our stomachs in our neighborhood

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.760
with our friends walking
by, "Yo what, what's good?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.790
What's happening", this
that and the third.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.670
And finally after like
10 minutes of this,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.160
20 minutes of this they
don't find anything

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.760
of course because we're innocent.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.110
They uncuff us and tell
us to be on our way,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.630
leaving all of our
stuff on the street.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.100
They all get back in their cars
and they drive away, right?

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.400
True story.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.080
It shook me because it was
the first time that I realized

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.590
that oh man, it's real out here.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.250
My older brother had
gone through it.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.800
A lot of my other friends
had gone through it.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.100
But it was the first time that I --

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.860
it could have been
much worse, right?

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.190
Anything could have happened.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.960
Some of its home boys fault
for opening the door, right?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.840
But the rest of it was
totally unnecessary.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.610
We hadn't done anything but
run a yellow light, right?

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.470
I've got other friends who have had
their teeth kicked out, I've had --

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.930
I mean I have tons of stories,
some of which I'll share

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.330
with you guys another point.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.900
But that's what brought
me to this book.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.180
That was sort of my own
interaction as a young person.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.940
In this neighborhood, from D.C.
as a young person in my experience

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.160
with the police officers
when I was your age.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.910
And so when I sat down to
write this book that's sort

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.570
of what I was brining
to the table, right?

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.870
I remember what it felt like.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.430
I remember what it was like
to have your parents --

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.330
how many of you all had the talk
with your parents about what to do

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.420
if you ever have an
interaction with the cops?

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.120
And most of you all aint' even --

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.340
some of you all in high
school, some of you all aren't.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.350
That's a lot of people.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.190
So, young age to have that talk.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.780
And I was around your age
when my mom gave me that talk.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.140
So --

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.620
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: So,
I'm Brendan Kiely

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.710
and you can remember the
pronunciation of my last name

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.800
in a corny way, because
it's Kiely like smiley.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.590
And I come to this book
with a different angle.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:01.990
I'm from Boston and
don't hold it against me.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:07.450
And I, too have two ways into this.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:15.210
I too had interactions with the
police when I was in high school.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:21.700
I too drove a car, actually
a minivan with a loud door.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.820
It was maroon, it was a Chrysler.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:33.410
I too drove around with a bunch
of friends, goofing around.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.430
But I feel a moment
of pain as I begin

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.280
to share how different my story is.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.780
And I had two incidents.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.380
But the one that I want to share
is one where I did something wrong.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.060
I was speeding 30 miles
over the speed limit.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.360
That's insane, right?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.660
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: In a minivan.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.960
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: In a minivan.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.260
It's insane.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.560
Don't do it.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.180
Don't do it.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:08.840
And I got pulled over in my minivan
with a minivan full of friends.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.790
And I too didn't know
where my registration was.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.090
I knew what my license was.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.540
I didn't even know what
a registration was.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:23.650 position:56%
And my friend Adam, in the front
seat next to me was basically saying

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.180
"It's in the glove
compartment or somewhere",

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.380
like "You should know
this, you drive".

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.360
Finally we found it,
gave it to the cop.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.780
The cop asked me to
step out of the car.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.080
I get out of the car.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.220
The cop did give me the third
degree, "Where's the marijuana,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.520
where's the marijuana",
blah, blah, blah.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.940
Didn't have any of that.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.530
That wasn't part of the process.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.890
And I explained, "Oh I'm nervous,
I'm just driving kids home.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.700
We were supposed to go for ice
cream but that didn't work out.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.370
The mini golf place was closed.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.980
Oh my God, I'm just so scared".

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.680
And the cop said, "Look I'm going
to let you go with a warning".

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.970
Right? No, that's the
right thing to say.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.870
What? It's crazy.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.660
It's crazy.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.190
And so I want to, I want to come
to this project All American Boys;

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.070
I want to come to this
project being really honest

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.040
about those two differences, right?

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.010
I think it's important
for us to think about this

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.310
as a piece of literature.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.240
To think about the characters
involved in this book.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.990
Jason wrote Rashad's narrative;
I wrote Quinn's narrative.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.290
There are two narratives.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.520
There are two kids living
side by side in the same city.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.680
And their lives are so different.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.150
And I wanted to come to
this project because I want

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.760 position:56%
that to be a conversation that we're
all having, an honest conversation

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.550
that we're all having
and a conversation

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.650
that we can start having
in our classrooms

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.370
and hopefully we can start having
some larger conversations out there

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.980
in the rest of the world as well.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.160
Because I also worked
as a high school teacher

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.580
for a number of years.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.240
So, I recently have
stopped teaching.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.400
I hope to go back because
I really miss it.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.990
And as I looked around my
classroom, I see all these kids

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.660
and I taught kids from
all over New York City.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.060
I lived in New York City
for the past 15 years.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.500
So I taught kids from
all around the city.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.870
And it was really difficult
to think about how these kids

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.240
in the same classroom are having
such different experiences.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.880
And so I come to this
project wanting us

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.950
to really have an honest
conversation

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.560
about those different
experiences, does that make sense?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.680
It makes sense, yeah.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.780
So let me clarify because I
am still a type A teacher.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.800
You do have those note cards;
you do have those note cards.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.560
We do want to make sure we have a
lot of time for questions, right?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.330
And if anyone feels brave and just
wants to speak into a microphone

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.370
and ask a question, great.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.530
But if you feel like you have a
question that you don't want to say

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.170
out loud but you still
want to have us answer,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.810
that's what the cards are for.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.860
So you make sure you write that
down, get it into the basket

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.870
as it gets passed up and we'll try
to make sure we address it, okay?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: One of the things
that a lot of people always want

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.360
to know is how did
we write the book?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.170
Right? How did this happen?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.420
Why did the two of us decide
to sit down and do this, right?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.110
The question comes up pretty
often, is something that we always

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.930
like to talk about
because it's important.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.720
You guys remember Trayvon Martin.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.790
You guys remember what happened
with Trayvon Martin, right?

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.030
So when Trayvon Martin happened
the two of us were on tour,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.660
this is a little while ago.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.110
We were on tour for other books

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.510
that we were traveling
the country talking about.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.060
And then Trayvon happened, and
at first listen here's the truth.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.070
I had just met this dude, right?

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.560
And coming from where I
come from it took a minute

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.420
for me to like trust him.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.540
Because I wasn't used to sort
of having someone close to me

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.610
that wasn't black, that
wasn't from my neighborhood,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.660
that didn't know my family,
that didn't know my way

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.460
or my environment understand
or even want to talk about any

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.280
of the experiences that
I had as a young person.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.660
Any of the drama that we see
sometimes, if you growing

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.960
up in Anacostia, if you growing
up in some city, if you growing

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.280
up in the [Inaudible], right?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.820
Like if you're growing up in any
of those neighborhoods, right?

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.160
So it was tricky for me at
first because it was like

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.440
"Dude you're not even going
to understand the way I feel

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.480
when it comes to Trayvon
Martin", right?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.410
The way my mom feels.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.500
Right? My mother called me
crying when Trayvon's verdict,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.740
when the verdict happened
and George Zimmerman walked

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.040
and was found innocent.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.880
My mother called me crying because
she felt like that could be my kid.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.850
That could have been
my two sons, right?

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.020
All the kids in the neighborhood
that we grew up with, right?

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.860
And so the two of us
began talking about it

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.270
and I realized he was
as angry as I was.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.570
A different kind of anger, right?

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.320
He shared the anger in the loss
of a child, he shared the anger

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.370
in a not-guilty plea, but he also
had a different kind of anger

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.310
that I think is necessary
for you to speak about.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.230
And then what happened, as time
went on is, Mike Brown happened.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.980
We all know Mike Brown, right?

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.620
We all remember the
Mike Brown story.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.940
So when the Mike Brown story
happened that's when we realized,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.800
and all the stories
in between, all right.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.310
Let's not forget that there are
hundreds of stories in between

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.090
that happened before Mike Brown.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.470
And when Mike Brown happened
the two of us sat down --

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.100
well he came to me actually, right?

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.350
And he said, "Look we
need to do something.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.920
We need to write something".

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.820
And because Mike Brown, your age.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.810
Trayvon, your age.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.390
This ain't about us, right?

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.690
I'm in my 30's.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.090
It could happen to me.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.240
But who it's happening
to most often, kids.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.540
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: That's right.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Our kids.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.800
And so I want you to talk a
little bit about your indignation

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.810
about why you felt like
this was necessary.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.110
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Yeah.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:44.210
so it -- it was an honor and a
privilege to go on tour together.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.260
To begin having these
conversations, right?

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.490
To begin having conversations
about racism.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.360
To begin having conversations
about the structures in place

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.650
in our society that help
reinforce this racism.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:07.050
And as I began following these news
stories, last year in particular.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.420
It became really important
to me to think

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.230 position:56%
about how do we -- so we're artists.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.800
That's our bread and butter,
that's our soul, we're artists.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.880
So we want to respond in some way.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.300
But how do we respond in a way
that is honest, about this --

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.700
about the reality of the
lives of so many people?

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.730
And maybe the most honest
way to do that would be

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.470
to do something in partnership.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.970
Because I was boiling.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.510
I mean when we met
that first time to talk

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.690
about it, I mean it was like --

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.990
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
You were angry; yeah.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.290
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I mean I
don't want to pound the table

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.590
because I don't want
to spill water on you,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.520
but it was like table
pounding angry, right?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.820
It was table pounding angry.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.530 position:56%
But part of that anger, part of that
anger isn't just that this happens.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:59.300 position:56%
Part of that anger is that it's so
unjust, the imbalance in our society

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.040
about who it happens to and
who it doesn't happen to.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.760
So, that makes me mad as
a White person, right?

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.820
Because I think about
White privilege and I think

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.330
about how easy it is
for me to look away.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.300
How easy it would be for
me to say "Not my problem".

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.680
Right? But it is my problem.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.290
And that's part of what my anger
was about, is about finding a way

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.890
to say how can we get more of the
larger society across the country

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.720
to say "yes, this is in
particular also a White problem".

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.340
White people have to own this.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.480
So, I came into the project
with that kind of anger.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.290
But not wanting to just you
know, bang tables all day

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.620
because that's not going
to do anything, right?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.560
So we wanted to create
something productive,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.900
and so we wanted to
create this book.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.200
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: For sure.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.500
Let me ask you all something,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.080
how many of you all
are artists in any way?

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.380
All right, don't scream out.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.680
What you do?

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.980
What's your art?

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.280
You draw, all right.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.580

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.880

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.180
What you do?

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.480
You act and you draw.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.780
All right.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.080
What you, right here
sister what you go?

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.890
&gt;&gt; I act and I play the horn.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
You play the horn.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.490
I used to play the horn.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.790
What you got brother?

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.230
&gt;&gt; I draw and I play --

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.720
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
You drawing right now?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.320
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Get him out of there.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.620
All right, what you go?

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.140
&gt;&gt; I draw and I play the piano.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.810
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
You play the piano.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.230
In the back, what you got?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.530
&gt;&gt; I work hard.

&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You work hard.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.660
Boom. Drop the mic; she like
-- I work hard, word up.

Right here.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.080
&gt;&gt; I write poetry.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You write poetry.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.680
Ain't no rappers in here?

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.660 position:56%
There's always a rapper in the room.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.960
You a rapper?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.960
You MC? All right, let
me ask you all this.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.880
Let me -- hold, hold, hold.

got bars -- let me ask you all this.

Let me ask you all this.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.520
Who you all listening to, right?

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.310 position:56%
If you're a rapper, let's talk
about it and it keep it 100 with me.

Don't yell out, don't
yell out, don't yell out.

Don't yell out.

look it up; I don't even know.

Nobody, I don't listen to music.

know what I mean?

Yeah? Who is it?

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.510
Shy Glizzy, he's from D.C., right?

[ Inaudible ]

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: All
right, what you got?

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.800
Comment. You like old --
Comment my generation;

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.750
you too young to think
about Comment.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.050
Comment an actor now.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.350
What you go?

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.950
&gt;&gt; Feddy Wopp, right?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.080
All right, so here's the question.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.820
So here's the question,
here's the question;

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.700
here's why that's important.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.590
Here's why that's important, right?

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.920
Here's why that's important;
so all you all artists.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.990
Everybody in here like "I'm an
actor, I'm a writer, I'm a poet,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.860
I work hard" you know
what I'm saying?

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.970
Like whatever your art is.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.420

threw out to me right?

You got Feddy Wopp,
I'm good with it.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.650
Feddy Wopp, quality music
you know what I mean?

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.950
I got Drake.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.640
I got Shy Glizzy, who is it?

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.580
Little herb.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.750
I got Chief Keef, right.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.050
Who is this guy?

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.350
Who is this?

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.650
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I'm
looking this up tonight.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.950
&gt;&gt;Jason Reynolds: I know,
they yelling it at me.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.100
I'm supposed to know and
I'm like "I don't know".

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.400
All right, so here's the deal.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.950
Everybody that we named, of
everybody that we named how many

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.710
of them, how many of them
have songs about this?

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.520
About police brutality?

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.670
So, but you ain't named J. Cole.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.340
You named Kendrick, so we got
Kendrick and you named Comment.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.760
So we got 10 names, you all got
Keef, you all got Shy Glizzy,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.290
you all got Little herb you
all got somebody named slightly

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.590
or something.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.890
You all got --

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.830
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You all
got Drake; so what that --

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.600
hey so what that means,
so what that means is,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.340
what that means is --
don't get me wrong.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.490
It's okay, party music is
what's up; I'm with it, right?

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.870 position:56%
But it's important that we know that
if you guys are going to be artists

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.170
and if your artists of today aren't
doing their job in terms of talking

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.470 position:56%
about the things that are important,

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.320 position:56%
it's okay that they make party
music, because we need to party too.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.530
But somebody has to
do the work, right?

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.710
You work hard, my girl who is
the artist says "I work hard".

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.930
Well look we got to make
sure that we work hard

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.290 position:56%
on what's necessary to work hard on.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.590
Right? If we can party all day, if
we can do what time to be a live

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.820
and we can party and all
those things, that's cool.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.760
Let's just make sure that
you guys grow into artists

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.800
that you realize you
have responsibilities.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.280
Because if nobody tells your
story then it doesn't exist.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.720
No one will ever know.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.380
No one can give it any value.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.310
So, Brendan and I can write
this book and give it to you

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.610
and hope you read it and say "Like
it's okay that Drake ain't talking

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.920 position:56%
about it", Kendrick -- well
Kendrick is talking about it, right?

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.900
But Glizzy ain't talking about it.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.860
Fat Trail ain't talking
about it, right?

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.600
Whoever it is that you
all rock with, right?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.740
But at least there's something that
exists, at least there's something

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.200
that exists that's
talking about it and --

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.320
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: And this
is an invitation for you.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.040
Right? This book is also
an invitation for you.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.960
This is an invitation for you

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.100
to have these conversations
and start close.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.220
Make sure you're having those
conversations with your friends.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.070
Ask your teachers to
have these conversations.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.920
I think it's really
important to think

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.820
about this as a team effort, right?

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.210
This book -- I can't
write this book by myself.

I'd be an idiot if I thought I could
do that for a lot of reasons, right?

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.070
I can't do that.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.370
It's a team effort.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.670
It's a team effort for a reason.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.460
I think we would all
do ourselves a favor

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.870
if we took this invitation
to create teams right?

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.170
There's that old saying, right?

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.470
Like a network is a net, right?

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.780
It doesn't work if it's
just one person, it's a net.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.950
You've got to build
the network, right?

really honest conversations.

Like why does the White guy
want to talk about this?

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.750
Right? We want to have these
super honest conversations

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.980

a question right there,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.610
you should take it.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.910

we doing on time?

with a question, yeah?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:08.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.420
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
So the question is --

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.760
the question was why are people
defined by the color of their skin?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.930
And not by -- why are people
defined by the color of their skin?

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.440
The truth is, is that
people shouldn't be.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.740
Right? That's the truth.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.040
That's the issue.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.340
You know that's the issue.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.060
The reality is that everybody
in this room, we're all one.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.200
Everybody here talking
about the same things,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.330
we're all in the same space
having the same experience, right?

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.630
Having a good time.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.930
Everybody wanting to go home

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.230
and see their brothers
and sisters, you know?

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.870
Talk to their mama, talk to
their pops, have some dinner.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.390
Whatever it is you all
do, you know what I mean?

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.760
But everybody, whatever
it is you do,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.530
everybody in here wants the
same -- that's how it is.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.970
We got the same fears, we
got the same struggles.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.890
We think the same things
are funny most of the time.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.040
And so the issue is
that people shouldn't --

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.040
people shouldn't feel like
race is such a big deal.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.990
Unfortunately, historically --

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.680
unfortunately if I'm going to
be completely honest with you,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.290
historically this country was
sort of predicated and built

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.590
on that construct, right?

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:11.890
The racial construct.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.190
I know you guys study it in school.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.490
I hope you study it
in school in terms

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.740
of you know slavery and
all of these things.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.100
It doesn't mean it has to
exist today or that it needs

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.270
to exist today, but it still does.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.830
And while it does we have
work to do, you know?

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.830
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: I want to try to
answer that question honestly too

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.730 position:56%
because I think it's important to --

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.410 position:56%
as Jason is talking about it like it
shouldn't be and yet that happens.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.990
That is the case and for us

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.340
to pretend otherwise would be
doing everybody a disservice.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.380
So to think about that historical
construct that is at the root,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.680
we're talking about slavery, right?

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.090
We're talking about this construct
in our society, in our country.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.960
It is embedded in our history.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.550
It would be a lie; I think
it would be a like to pretend

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.720
like that doesn't affect
our lives today.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.650
And so in our book one of the
things that we're trying to talk

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.850
about is how that's
connected in fact.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:14.290
Why is it the case that Quinn,
the White character is thinking

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.230
for the first time in
his life that he's White,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.230
like what it means to be White.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.450
That's a weird, that's
a strange thing, right?

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:25.760
It's a strange thing for someone
to say out loud in his world.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.300
But it would be a lie to
say that it's not part

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.440
of hour our society works.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.010
So, we have to be honest first and
then I think we work from there.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.550
Does that make sense?

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.420
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.720
What else?

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.140
Let's start in the back,
because we always get to the

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.410
[ Inaudible ]

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.490
&gt;&gt; This is for Jason; when you sit
down and start to write the book,

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.900 position:56%
did you get emotional and how did
you get over that emotional feeling?

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.330
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Yeah, so good question.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.670
So, when I sat down to write the
book I was, it's funny, right?

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.760
At the time I -- at the time before
I started writing it I wasn't

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.060
as emotional.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.700
Because I hadn't really
thought about it, right?

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.580
I thought about Trayvon, I
thought about Mike Brown.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.790
It was all sort of bubbling, but
it was still sort of at a distance

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.150 position:56%
and because we had gone through this

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.500
so many times before you all
were born, I had already gone

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.080
through this a lot of times, right?

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.940
And so at some point you
start to unfortunately it --

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.840
you start to shake it
off a little quicker,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.040
which is really --
it's a terrible thing.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.170
It's like anybody -- it's like
people who have experienced death,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.080
if you've experienced a
lot of death in your family

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.630
and someone else dies, it hurts but
only for a moment and you're like

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.420
"That's what happens,
its life", right?

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.820
And so at the time I wasn't
really feeling any kind of way.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.530
But when I started to write
it and when I really started

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.220
to think about what was going on.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.380
I was broken down, it was terrible.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.680
It was terrible.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.880
And I started to think about things
that we don't think about, right?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.680
So a prime example,
social media, right?

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.980
Now here's the thing.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.020
I think social media is a
powerful, powerful thing.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.500
It's what spawned sort of "Black
Lives Matter" and all these things

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.210
that are happening now it's
come from like camera phones

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.270
and posting it to the
social media sites.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.950
But what we never stopped to
think about in the midst of all

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.380
of that is the family
members of the people

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.100
who -- of the people who died.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.580
So let's say you're
Trayvon Martin's mother

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.750
or you're Trayvon Martin's
little brother.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.160
And every time you go online
you see like 10,000 posts

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.940 position:56%
about what happened to your brother.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.280
Every time you turn the news on,
you see the news people playing

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.830
on loop what happened
to your brother.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.540
Every time you're on Facebook
or Twitter or Snapchat

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.180
or whatever it is you see, there's
hashtags with your brother's name

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.220
on it millions of people,
the constant sort of reminder

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.550
of what has happened
to your loved one.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.490
So I was thinking about
like the family members too.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.870
And what if Mike Browns mom
feels knowing for a fact

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.820
that every single time she gets
on the internet her sons picture,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.540
his footage, the footage
of his murder,

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.570
his dead body on the
street is played over

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.300
and over and over and over again.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.970
What does that feel like?

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.900
And those things sort of broke
me down and those things sort

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.890
of made me feel some kind
of way; so good question.

Yeah?

book All American Boys?

Because it's not just
only boys getting killed.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.520
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: That's
a great question.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.590
So Jason rightly had the first --

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.330
he wrote the first email back to
our editor when we were talking

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:25.220 position:56%
about this title, to say this is
not just a problem that boys suffer.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.000
This is a problem that
girls suffer as well.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.480 position:56%
It is true that in the book if you
read into the story and begin to see

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:42.870
who are the people who are
involved in the protests,

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.110
you'll see that girls
are involved as well.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.210 position:56%
And you'll see that there's some
conversation about that in the book.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.710
But I think your question
is a really great question

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:56.460
because this idea of
all American boys,

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.870
has anyone ever heard
that term before?

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.650
Like an all American boy?

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.730
Yeah. You what?

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.390
Like a cowboy?

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.980
Right, that image of a -- so
somehow there's that association

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.190
in our mind, an all American
boy is a cowboy, right?

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:17.590
So I guess in my mind, in my
mind teaching in New York City,

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:22.370
teaching in classes where there are
people whose first language is --

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.180
they're over 180 different
languages, right?

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.350
People from all over the
world are in these schools

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.480
where I was teaching in
New York City, right?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.370
And I'm thinking these are all
American Boys and girls, right?

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.520
So there's a real issue
out there in the world

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.600
if we think immediately
of that cowboy, right?

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.900
Because believe me, I do too.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.200
I'm right with you.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.970
That was my first instinct.

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.600
But we want to make sure
that everyone is talking

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.760
about why is that our instinct?

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.730
That's why we have All American
Boys as the title, right?

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.030
Because we want to open that up.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.910
It should include all of us.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.790
It's a term that shouldn't
just be that first association.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.950
So that's an awesome question.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.020
We have some others
on the cards as well.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.800
I want to do justice to some
of the folks who wrote cards.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.310
Because you know when
you're in class the people

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:16.050 position:56%
who are the loudest always get to
-- you know get their answers first?

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.120
So let's go to the people who
actually wrote some questions down.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:27.690
And one of the questions that I saw
in the deck was about the two of us

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.380
and writing and when we started.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.850
So, I just want to address some of
the birth of art kind of questions.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:38.130
I will be honest with you,

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.150
when I was in high school I had
a high school teacher tell me

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.830
that I wasn't so great.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.130
I'm not kidding.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.860
That I was not so great at writing.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.160
It was something that I loved.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.580
I -- believe it or not I actually
liked quite a bit of hip hop too

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.900
when I was in middle school and
that was my intro into poetry.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.830
And then I learned a lot more about
poetry and I was moving forward

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.480
and I said, "Look I want
to do some creative work".

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.590
My high school teacher said,
"No you're not so great".

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.140
That was a real -- that
was a real push for me

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.590
because I cared about it.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.740
So I started writing and I started
writing and I started writing

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.520
and I failed and I failed
and I failed and I failed

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:25.730
and I can't tell you how empowering
that was for me to keep at it.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.770
&gt;&gt;Jason Reynolds: I have
a similar story though.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:29.070
Here's the thing right?

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.110
So people always ask like "When
did you start", "Why do you write",

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.670 position:56%
"Were you writing your whole life",
"Were you reading a bunch of books"?

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:37.260
I didn't read any books
until I was 17.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.710
Zero, no novels.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.020
No -- you guys have
already read books.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.150
I read no books until I was
17 because back in the 80's

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.610
and 90's All American
Boys didn't exist.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.360
Those books, it wasn't
happening, right?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.930
We had Walter D. Myers, thankfully.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.760
Did any of you all
know Walter D. Myers,

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.190 position:56%
has anyone heard of Walter D. Myers?

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:56.750
The great Walter D. Myers.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.910
So, we had Walter D. Myers right,
so if you were a kid growing up,

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.910 position:56%
in a black neighborhood or with a
black family and that kind of thing,

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.250
he was pretty much one of
the only ones representing

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.510
for the younger people telling
their stories for the most part.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:14.000
And so I went all through school
without ever reading anything.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.100
Lord of the Flies, To Kill a
Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men,

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.860
I just was like "I'm not reading
it; I'm not doing any of that".

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.630
Like "Just give me a
C, let me move on".

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.930
I'm not doing it.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.110
So, what saved me was the same
thing, it was Queen Latifah, yo.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.790
Queen Latifah because back

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.750
in the day before Queen Latifah
was an actress, and a model

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.620
and a TV show host and all
this, that and the third.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.790
Queen Latifah was a rapper, I
don't know if you all knew that.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.300
Queen Latifah, not only was
she a rapper, she was like one

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.390
of the best rappers around.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.950
All you young ladies,
it don't matter.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.470
If you got balls, you got balls.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:55.440
Latifah was amazing and so I
remember going to the store

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.360
and buying Queen Latifah's album

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.070
and taking the plastic off,
it was a cassette tape.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.300
You all know what cassette
tapes, all right?

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.980
I was just trying to make sure.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.280
What's a cassette tape?

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.090
&gt;&gt; Them little tapes.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.930
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Them little tapes.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.080
That's where mix tape --
you know all you be talking

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.660
about a mix tape came out, that
was what a mix tape actually was.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.280
There ain't no such thing
as a mix tape no more

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.610
because tapes don't exist anymore.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.910
But that's what a mix
tape was, right?

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.490
That's where they come
from, like actual tapes.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.170
We had to like, we
call them pause tapes.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.420
You had to sit at a
radio and hit record.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.970
And like -- ask your parents
about it, you know what I mean?

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.960
So Queen Latifah had this album
come out called Black Rain,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.010
and I bought this record
and this was the one

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.460
where UNITY, UNITY, right?

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.470
And so I bought the album.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.220 position:56%
I take the plastic off and back then
every single album you bought came

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.160
with these things called
liner notes.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.460
And I know you all don't
know what no liner notes are.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.190
But what they were, were
basically pamphlets that came

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.650
in every single cassette tape.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.600 position:56%
A little teeny pamphlet was this big
but you could unfold it and it was

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.900
like this long, all right?

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.710
So you unfold it and
what was printed

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:02.460
on the pamphlet were the
lyrics to every single song.

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.230
I wish -- had they had
that with nothing coming --

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.950
ain't nothing on paper no more.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.660
It come with the album,
you can tap the album?

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.660
&gt;&gt; You have to download.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.040
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You got to
download it, who want to do that?

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.340
You all download liner notes?

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.790
No. You know what I mean.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.740
So and if you all did download
liner notes and read the lyrics,

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.430
most of you all --
they'd lose a lot of fans

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.550
because don't nobody know
what Future talking about

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.850
and if you all could
read it you'd all be like

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.150
"I don't know what he's saying".

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.450
He's saying nothing.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.750
He's mumbling.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.050
And we paying my man
for him to mumble.

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.380
But anyway, so I got Queen
Latifah, Queen Latifah's album.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.930
I listened to the whole
record, right?

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:36.110
The whole album and then
I listened to it again

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.120
but this time I was reading
along with the lyrics.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.680
And then the third time I just
read the lyrics by themselves.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.450
I was like 10 years old and it was
the first time I read it and I was

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.740
like "Oh man, all this stuff
they teaching me in school

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.600 position:56%
about like Langston Hughes and these
people, Queen Latifah was doing sort

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.250
of the same thing, except
it was connecting with me.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.650
And we had Pac right?

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.900
Pac was a poet, right?

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.490
We had Slick Rick;
Slick Rick was a poet.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.270
Right, we had [Inaudible], we had
Kool Moe Dee, we had Karis One,

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:07.050
we had all these people and
we had early Jay-Z, back in --

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.070
these people considered
themselves poets.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.310
And so studying hip hop for
the course of like my childhood

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.330
and all the way up through
college is what got me into writing

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.800
because all I wanted to do was
tell stories about what it was

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.550
like to be me, and tell stories
about my family and my friends

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.510
and my community because that's
what the rappers were doing.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.730
And then eventually I
discovered Richard Wright

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.070
and it changed my life
and that was it.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Just one more from
the cards because there are a number

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.680
of questions that are similar;

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.850
so just to address a
couple more of these.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.170
And I'm just going to read
a couple of these out loud

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:43.630
because you wrote them and when
I used to teach I used to --

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:49.100
when I handed papers back, I
used to like to read aloud lines

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.560 position:56%
from the papers that students had
written just to say "Look this is --

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.880
we're ready this aloud, just like
we're reading our books aloud

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.520
because you guys have
done some great work".

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.080
And so I appreciate just some
of these questions quite a bit.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.410
Here's a series of questions in a
row that I think are all related.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:06.570
How does police brutality
effect how you act

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.190
when you walk around outside?

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:13.220
And how does it affect how you feel
about being put in your own skin?

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.960
How does police brutality
affect those around you

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.830 position:56%
and how does it affect your friends?

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.680
How does your personal view

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.070
of police brutality
affect your relationships

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.970
with your friends who
thought differently?

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:33.070 position:56%
And that's a question that I really,
really appreciate quite a bit.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:39.770
This, this idea of how I
might feel about this, right?

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.930
About how I feel about
police brutality.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:48.910
I don't want to pretend that I
am someone who is also a victim.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:54.670
I want to instead ask the question
what can I do to help stop this.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.710 position:56%
What's my role in this conversation?

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.980
And I think it's inspiring
to think back

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.620
to all the marches
of last year, right?

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:08.380
I think it's inspiring to think
about how this was not a series

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.030
of marches that were started
by politicians, right?

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.580
These are things that grew
out of people who lived

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.510
in the neighborhoods where
this was all happening.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:26.890
And so my role, I feel like, is
to support those who begin some

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:31.460
of these movements, to help try
to inspire some of this protest,

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.760
to help inspire some
of this antagonism

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.290
and to join people when
they get out there.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.980
And to make sure that when
I'm walking down the street

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.750
and I see something going on,

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.340
like maybe for example I see
something happening down the road

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.430
and it's not necessarily a friend
of mine, but I just might make sure

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.280
that I don't turn this time.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.330 position:56%
Maybe I stay and watch, maybe I
pull out my phone, maybe I recognize

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:58.130
that I am not a bystander.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.250
You've heard that phrase, right?

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.960
Don't be a bystander,
be an upstander?

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.540
Right? As corny as that sounds,
I believe that is so true.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.690
And so I appreciate these questions
because I think it's important

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.460
for us all to recognize what we
can do in different situations.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.850
My role because of that
awful story that I told,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:26.180
right is that I might have that
privilege to stand in the street

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.900
and help make sure that
others see what's going on.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.410
And so I encourage
people to use power

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.640 position:56%
when they have it, in the right way.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.940
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: And for me,

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:41.010
you know the question
of what it feels like.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.610
Honest answer, it feels normal.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.590
And that's a problem.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.670
It feels normal for me.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.820
It feels normal for
a lot of us I think.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.100
And so what I'm tasking
you all to do is

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.400
to just let your voices be heard.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.100
Be aware, right?

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.540
This isn't about you
hating police officers,

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.680
because all cops aren't bad cops.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.100
That's the truth, right?

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.400
That's not what we're telling you.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.700
That's ridiculous.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.000
That's not -- not all cops are bad.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.300
There are good cops.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.240
Some of you have called cops and
they've come and helped you, right?

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.790
What I'm saying is just be aware
that these things are happening.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:24.230
If you are growing up and want to
be a police officer, be a good cop.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.170
You have an opportunity
to change things too.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.470
There's hope in you.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.450
We're looking at you like
you guys can be the future,

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:34.850
you guys can help, make your voices
hears, let your voices be heard.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.250
Don't be afraid you know?

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:39.120
Don't feel ashamed.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.890
Don't feel the need to have
to walk a different way.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:47.230 position:56%
Be who you are and push for a
better day, push for something more.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:50.060
Have these conversations,
talk to police officers

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.540
when they're not sort
of doing their thing.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.550
When they're not sort of
working in -- or in action.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.620
Walk up to a cop and ask him
questions, some fair questions.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.650
Have some discourse,
especially in your communities.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.880
If you've got beat cops in your
neighborhood, which are the cops

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.990 position:56%
who patrol the street, just
hanging out on your block and stuff.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.620
They in your neighborhood,
say "What's up?

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.940
How you doing"?

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.650
Create relationships,
it's what we need.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.950
How much time do we have?

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.250
I want to make sure --

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.550
&gt;&gt; Why don't we take
two more questions,

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.850
maybe one in the audience and --

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Perfect, it's your call man.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:26.310
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Who has
not yet had a chance to --

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.520
we got this one over here in
the glasses, right over here.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.430
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
And the [Inaudible].

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.510
We ain't doing that well though.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:45.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.980
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
buy Queen Latifah's album?

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.410
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: What inspired
me to buy Queen Latifah's album?

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.950
Yo it's hard to explain it

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.280
because at the time
everybody was buying Queen --

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.340
it's the same thing that inspires
all you all to buy Drake, right?

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.420
She was Drake of her time.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.000
She was a big deal man
and she was saying things

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.770
about the neighborhoods.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.530
So, like what she was
saying literally was like

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.090
"Look this is how we living around
here, this is what's going on".

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.070
She was telling boys to
respect girls, right?

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.890
In a time where you know no one
was saying it like that, right?

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.590
Because we had Salt N
Peppa out at the same time,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:19.730
and they were doing the same
thing, but in a different way.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.370
Latifah was like "Look I'm
big enough and I'm bad enough

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.310
to beat you, so you not about
to come at me like that",

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.800
what was her whole thing.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.860
And for some reason, I don't know
if it's because I have a sister

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.400
and for some reason I
was really attracted

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.480
to like her message and
what she was saying.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.280
And she just had -- she
was just a beast with it.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.720
She was so good, and so
that's why Latifah, yeah.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.640
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Let's sneak in
one more over there, in the coat.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.940
Yeah.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.750
&gt;&gt; Did the book ever make an
impact on your daily life?

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.050
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: Did this book?

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:51.650
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: We right here.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.070
This is an impact on
our daily lives.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.980
As of today this is the impact.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: No, you know why
I appreciate that is because I feel,

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:04.140
I feel really lucky that I get
to do something I care about.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.250
And I spent a lot of
time doing things

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.210
that I didn't kind
of really care about.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:13.530
And so I got this opportunity; so
yes this book has made that impact.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:18.080
but also I think the book makes an
impact because you know we stand

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.670
on stage, and we talk as if we're
expects of some kind or another

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.800
And I want to be clear that I
don't feel like I'm an expert.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:32.540 position:56%
My role and why I feel really lucky
to be a part of this project is just

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.960
to get out there and
do something, right?

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.610
I don't want to make a
claim that I'm an expert,

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.210
so the book makes an impact on
my life every day because I want

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:44.090
to learn a little bit
more every day.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:45.390
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Same here.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you guys.
