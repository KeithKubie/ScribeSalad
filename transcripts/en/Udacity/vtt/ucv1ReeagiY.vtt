00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When we are reasoning about a program, our reasoning follows these dependencies.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this case, if we want to know where C comes from or where quote comes from,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we follow the dependencies to the specific locations, and we can do so again.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we are up here, for instance,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we want to know where C comes from, well, C comes from S,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and S comes from up here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
S first goes down here, then defines C, and then C is being checked.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Likewise, if we want to know where quote comes from,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
quote comes from this statement.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So we see again, here quote is being written, here quote is being read.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So this statement depends on itself,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and quote, again, can either come from this location,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or it can come from the original assignment.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It is precisely along these relationships

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that we structure our reasoning.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Where does this value come from, and where was it set?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If we take a look at this statement, however,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we will quickly find that data dependencies are not enough

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because the value of quote in here may depend on the earlier value of quote,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but we also need to take into account

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that this statement had to be executed in the first place.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In order to be executed, it depends on earlier conditions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is the concept of control dependency.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If there is some statement which controls whether the statement B is executed or not,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
then B is being control dependent on that very statement.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In our example up here, for instance,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the condition in A controls whether statement B is executed or not.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Therefore, B is control dependent on A.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Again, such dependencies guide our reasoning.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We find that B was executed,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and we want to know why it was executed, after all.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
In order to figure out why it was executed,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we follow the control dependencies.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Here is a quiz.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Which other statement does B control depend upon?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is this for C in S?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Is this the first if statement?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Is this the first elif statement?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Or is this the last elif statement?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Check all that apply.
