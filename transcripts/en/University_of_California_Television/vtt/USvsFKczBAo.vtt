00:00:00.742 --> 00:00:03.409
(digital beeps)

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:09.904
(dramatic classical piano music)

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:12.621
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:15.121
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.986
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:25.768
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.351
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:31.557
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:35.202
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:37.782
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:39.865
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:44.023
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.023
of the past.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.443
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:53.465
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.132
and how we got here.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.936
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:00.769
like you.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.249
(digital chimes)

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:24.355
(rhythmic digital music)

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:38.387
- Well, it's left to me to wrap up before

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:39.850
but we're not really wrapping up,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.892
we're wrapping up before a
question and answer session that

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:44.484
Isabelle will start to lead in a second

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:46.416
but I do get to wrap up.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.022
It's kind of, you know,
I'm thinking and saying

00:01:48.022 --> 00:01:50.633
what can I do to wrap up
after some of these talks

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.211
which are extraordinary, right, and

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.146
you know I just was
thinking of a few things.

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:57.313
One of them is

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.939
we talk about genetic variation
and how it contributes

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.087
and we see that there's this
notion of a normal distribution

00:02:05.087 --> 00:02:08.107
and this idea that you
can have very, very rare

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:10.823
extreme abilities due to kind
of common genetic variation.

00:02:10.823 --> 00:02:12.560
At the same time

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.835
we have very rare syndromes in which

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.222
like Williams syndrome and
some of the other things

00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:20.434
that we heard about like KE family,

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:22.992
very rare genetic mutations
that instead of being

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:25.579
an additive of thousands of variation

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.601
that's coming through the population,

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.349
that kind of lightning hits
and that gives us insight.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.185
And so kind of as physicians,
scientists, and as

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:38.454
who are curious about these, you know,

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:41.637
when we see this, both of
those kind of provide us

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:45.804
with extraordinary ability or
potential to get insight so.

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:49.797
I thought that's an important
kind of point to bring out

00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:54.274
that the study of rare,
maybe rare genetic mutation

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.513
but it may be rare because
of common variation as well

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:01.053
and both are, you know,
kind of provide us with

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.822
exceptional insights as
I hope you heard from

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:06.221
the many talks today.

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.879
Really a lot of food for thought.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.871
And I'm really looking
forward to your questions.

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.021
But first I wanted to
thank all the speakers

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:14.623
number one for sticking to time,

00:03:14.623 --> 00:03:16.330
which is very, very hard

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.277
when you wanna talk about
your work and stuff.

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:20.037
(audience laughs)

00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:21.658
You know, your baby.

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:23.756
Really, everybody stuck to time and gave

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:26.543
an incredibly cogent,
beautiful, beautiful talk so I,

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:29.029
I wanna thank everybody for their talks.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.862
(audience and Daniel applaud)

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:39.246
And now I'm looking forward
to a good bit of beautiful

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:42.336
and very tough questions I'm sure.

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:43.253
- So I have

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:48.200
questions for, a lot of
questions for McGaugh

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.260
on the memory effect.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.233
And maybe I'll ask Jamie Ward
to come and discuss with him

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:57.181
answer to those questions.

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.181
But I'll start first for

00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:02.359
okay.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.627
I have two questions for Karen Berman.

00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:07.306
Well I have two questions,
maybe it's better

00:04:07.306 --> 00:04:09.501
that you read them.

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:11.415
Oh, okay, okay I'll do it.

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:15.582
Were Williams patients recognized
before genetics started?

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.222
- So that's a very good question.

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:23.972
Indeed they were
recognized, but not as such.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.251
I forget the year but decades ago

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:32.418
Williams and Baron whose
name I always mispronounce,

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:37.056
characterized a syndrome
that was typified by

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:41.912
infantile hypercalcemia,
failure to thrive,

00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:44.485
and elfin faces.

00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:48.375
And in fact when I was in medical school,

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.287
and I won't tell you
how long ago that was,

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:51.610
but a long time ago,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.141
that's what we had called it,

00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.089
was elfin syndrome.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.845
The genetic cause of this
disorder was discovered

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:02.011
in the 90s by my colleague Colleen Morris.

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.741
So it's been a very interesting evolution.

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:08.908
Since that time physicians'
sort of index of suspicion,

00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:14.992
their ability to pick up if
there was a failure to thrive

00:05:14.992 --> 00:05:18.558
or a particular facial
construct in babies,

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:21.184
in small children, has increased.

00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:25.020
And there's a much greater recognition now

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.187
and of course a great interest
in neurobiology and behavior.

00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:34.178
- Related questions.

00:05:35.113 --> 00:05:39.116
Very related is, can you
encounter cases where

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:41.964
you cannot check that
these are genetic defect

00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:46.121
but it is idiopathic kind of
form of Williams syndrome,

00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.454
like you can find in autism for example.

00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:52.415
That's not my question, eh.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.024
- I'm gonna try to address that.

00:05:55.024 --> 00:05:58.166
So Williams syndrome is pretty specific

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.339
and does depend at least these days

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.956
on the genetic underpinnings.

00:06:03.956 --> 00:06:08.123
I will mention, this is a
little bit of a tangent, but

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:11.153
in my slide I didn't emphasize this,

00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:15.762
but 96, more than 96%
of people with autism

00:06:15.762 --> 00:06:17.512
have almost the exact

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.254
same deletion on chromosome seven,

00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:26.731
and this is highly unusual
that it's so stereotyped,

00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:30.547
and this is because of what I explained,

00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:34.714
their flanking regions having
very similar sequences of DNA

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:38.776
and sort of getting mixed up.

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:42.865
However, there are very
rare people who have

00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:47.032
smaller deletions in that same
portion of chromosome seven,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.627
and they have only pieces
of the Williams syndrome

00:06:53.897 --> 00:06:55.922
clinical phenotype.

00:06:55.922 --> 00:07:00.089
For example, people who just
have a couple of genes deleted

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:05.837
called elastin and LEMK1
have the spatial problems

00:07:05.837 --> 00:07:08.237
but not the personality problems.

00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:11.959
So these very rare folks, and
we've now brought to the NIH

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.209
for study five families, five kindreds,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.427
and seven singleton children
who have these small deletions,

00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.694
and we hope that that will enable us

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:28.527
to sort of dissect the
genes that are involved

00:07:29.443 --> 00:07:32.111
in a more specific way.

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.875
My point in bringing this
up is that the people

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:37.621
who have these just several genes deleted,

00:07:37.621 --> 00:07:42.147
are not picked up because they
have the behavioral phenotype

00:07:42.147 --> 00:07:44.148
at all, they're actually picked up

00:07:44.148 --> 00:07:46.595
because they have a cardiac problem.

00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:49.892
Because one of the gene's
that's hemideleted is elastin,

00:07:49.892 --> 00:07:52.858
which forms the walls of our arteries.

00:07:52.858 --> 00:07:56.595
So they have a cardiovascular problem

00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:57.810
and they're picked up.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.462
And it's only apparent that
they have the visuo-spatial

00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:04.098
construct problem when they're tested.

00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:05.891
But they'll tell you if you talk to them,

00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:08.216
you know, gee I had problems in this area

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:11.517
in school, I wasn't very good in geometry,

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:14.188
and in other things like that.

00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:16.436
So, the short answer is no.

00:08:16.436 --> 00:08:18.227
I don't think that we pick up people

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:21.083
who have idiopathic Williams syndrome

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.405
because it is by definition
a genetic disorder

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:25.733
now that we know about it,

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:28.304
and it is related to the first question.

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:30.463
- So thank you, Karen.

00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:33.483
And now, Simon Fisher, I
have a interesting question

00:08:33.483 --> 00:08:35.900
for you, an easy one I think.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.135
Hmm?

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:40.047
- [Simon] You can answer it.

00:08:40.047 --> 00:08:43.459
- No, (laughs) I wouldn't
believe it to you.

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:47.316
What does a FOXP2
mutation do to a songbird?

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:49.335
- Oh, okay, okay.

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.163
That's great, cause I've got a whole,

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:54.166
there's a whole talk
on that which I didn't.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.583
So we don't know,

00:08:57.783 --> 00:09:02.422
we can't actually knock out
FOXP2 in songbirds because

00:09:02.422 --> 00:09:05.553
there's no, well, we don't
yet have the technology

00:09:05.553 --> 00:09:08.286
to knock it out completely
from embryos of songbirds

00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:10.157
although that's coming.

00:09:10.157 --> 00:09:14.400
But people have been
able to use viruses to

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.939
manipulate the levels of FOXP2
protein that the gene makes

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:21.416
in certain parts of the brain.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:23.523
And people have studied

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:27.409
one particular songbird
which is the zebra finch.

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:30.572
So male, young male zebra finches,

00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:34.907
they hear a song sung
by an adult male tutor

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:39.074
and they learn to make a
pretty accurate copy of that.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.572
And they're not the
prettiest songs in the world,

00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:43.960
zebra finch songs,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.324
but they have a certain
level of complexity and

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:50.476
different syllable types
and different structures.

00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:52.678
And the males sing to the females,

00:09:52.678 --> 00:09:54.049
and it's a learned thing.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:57.132
They have to be exposed to a template

00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:00.433
when they're young.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.527
And lots is known about the neurobiology

00:10:02.527 --> 00:10:06.694
of how the zebra finch males
are able to learn these songs.

00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:11.186
And they have particular
parts of the brain,

00:10:11.186 --> 00:10:14.722
particular kind of nuclei in the brain

00:10:14.722 --> 00:10:18.832
including one in the
striatum called Area X.

00:10:18.832 --> 00:10:21.409
That are important for
this learning process.

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:24.307
And so some researchers in Berlin,

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:27.604
led by Constance Shaff, noticed

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:30.727
that the levels of FOXP2
protein that were being made

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:34.840
in Area X were going up
around the developmental time

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.218
when the birds are learning their songs.

00:10:37.218 --> 00:10:41.328
So they interfered with
using these viruses

00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:45.481
they injected these viruses into Area X of

00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:46.314
young

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.917
birds learning these songs

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:52.676
and they knocked down the
amount of FOXP2 was being made

00:10:52.676 --> 00:10:55.691
and they found that the
songs were then not copied

00:10:55.691 --> 00:10:59.858
as accurately as the control
birds who had the gene

00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:03.236
knocked down in a different place

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:06.903
or ones that had a kind
of dummy knock down.

00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:09.820
And there's lots more work
that's been done on that

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.960
but it's interesting to see
that this is something that

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.343
this kind of auditory
guided vocal learning,

00:11:15.343 --> 00:11:18.001
the need to listen to something and then

00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.683
and reproduce a copy of
it can be interfered with

00:11:20.683 --> 00:11:23.850
in a songbird with FOXP2 knocked down.

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.463
- Several questions for James McGaugh,

00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:33.139
and I think it would
be more fun to ask also

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:37.306
Jamie Ward to come up soon
(laughs) soon (laughs).

00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:42.403
Let first ask, I mean,
they ask so many questions,

00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:45.100
I don't know where to start.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.933
Okay.

00:11:48.764 --> 00:11:50.911
Okay, maybe the first one.

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:54.281
What are the downsides of being, you know,

00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.281
such a HSAM.

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:02.841
In short, what, you know,
did evolution ensure we all

00:12:02.841 --> 00:12:04.954
have that opportunity?

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:06.252
- What's the downside?

00:12:06.252 --> 00:12:07.085
Well.

00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:12.113
The one first obvious downside

00:12:13.225 --> 00:12:17.780
is illustrated by the very
first subject who came to me.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.472
She contacted me because she is plagued

00:12:20.472 --> 00:12:22.805
by her strong, bad memories.

00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:26.047
She has awful memories.

00:12:26.047 --> 00:12:29.554
As a matter of fact, I
doubt that her experiences

00:12:29.554 --> 00:12:33.769
in life are much worse than
those that most of us have.

00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:35.879
But she remembers every one of them.

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:37.781
And so she dwells on them.

00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.763
I think that she contacted
me initially because

00:12:40.763 --> 00:12:42.806
she had some kind of an idea

00:12:42.806 --> 00:12:46.039
that if she could contact
me that they would go away

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:48.921
or that I would do something.

00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:51.115
She kept diaries, she didn't kept diaries

00:12:51.115 --> 00:12:53.267
for the reason that most people do.

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.439
They keep diaries because
they want to cherish

00:12:55.439 --> 00:12:57.592
the wonderful things in their lives.

00:12:57.592 --> 00:13:00.523
Her idea was that if she
wrote it down in her diary

00:13:00.523 --> 00:13:02.666
that it would go away.

00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:04.563
That was the plan on her part.

00:13:04.563 --> 00:13:06.331
So that's the downsize.

00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:09.581
For other people who have this ability,

00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:12.785
I don't see a downsize.

00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:17.023
Louisa Un, the professional violinist

00:13:17.023 --> 00:13:19.697
has a wonderful life
and she's not plagued,

00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:21.970
she's rather pleased that she can call up

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.470
these experiences of the past.

00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:27.757
Is this being filmed?

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:28.658
You know.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:30.121
(audience mutters in response)

00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:30.954
It is, oh.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.332
(audience laughs)

00:13:35.332 --> 00:13:38.967
Let me simply say that
it can sometimes make for

00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:41.855
difficult personal relationships.

00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:46.022
If you remember and the
spouse or the other does not.

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:48.498
Maybe you've had that happen.

00:13:48.498 --> 00:13:50.958
(audience laughs)

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:51.875
- Alrighty.

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:58.980
And, okay, I can see it has
an impact on the audience.

00:14:00.219 --> 00:14:01.917
No no, no no, no.

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:04.391
Okay the next question
is really related to

00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.405
something you have in common.

00:14:06.405 --> 00:14:09.541
Because there are many
questions but the fact is,

00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:13.371
is it only for calendar or for dates

00:14:13.371 --> 00:14:15.180
that they have this kind of memory.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.180
Or do they learn better,
you know, at school or.

00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:24.212
- First of all, they don't
learn better at school.

00:14:24.212 --> 00:14:26.066
For the most part they're quite average.

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:28.056
And they don't learn
better in a laboratory.

00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:30.806
They're quite average in learning

00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:34.064
in the laboratory.

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:40.053
But there are disadvantages as I said.

00:14:41.166 --> 00:14:43.832
In the laboratory, we've
tried to teach 'em all kinds

00:14:43.832 --> 00:14:47.379
of things and they really
don't do any better at it

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:50.129
than you and I do on the average.

00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:57.578
- So it's a special form of memory?

00:14:57.578 --> 00:15:00.070
- (sighs) It's a special form of memory

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.203
but there's a caveat.

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:04.784
In all of the work that we have done,

00:15:04.784 --> 00:15:07.181
and it's a very serious caveat,

00:15:07.181 --> 00:15:10.428
and that is we identify these people

00:15:10.428 --> 00:15:14.815
on the basis of us
telling us days and dates.

00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:16.632
That's how we get them.

00:15:16.632 --> 00:15:19.598
And we have about 100
people who can do that

00:15:19.598 --> 00:15:22.931
out of a U.S. population of 330 million.

00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:28.404
We have had as you probably
saw in one of the slides

00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:31.051
a large number of people
who claim that they have

00:15:31.051 --> 00:15:33.384
this ability but they don't.

00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:38.768
Now they don't maybe, maybe they don't

00:15:38.768 --> 00:15:42.151
because they don't tag
their memories with dates.

00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:43.685
And in order to be in our studies

00:15:43.685 --> 00:15:46.470
they have to be able to tag
their memories with dates.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.372
Now we're caught in a trap.

00:15:48.372 --> 00:15:52.289
If they can't assess
their memories with dates,

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:57.351
how on earth are we gonna validate them?

00:15:57.351 --> 00:15:58.875
You see, that's the problem.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.345
And so there maybe a lot of those people

00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:05.929
who failed our test may
have an ability like this

00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:08.507
but they don't tag it with dates.

00:16:08.507 --> 00:16:11.223
And so that's a big caveat.

00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:14.607
And we have tried to figure
out how to deal with that.

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:18.825
I get even today about two people a week.

00:16:18.825 --> 00:16:21.646
When this first opened
up I got, on one day,

00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:26.469
I got 600 people who claimed
that they had this ability.

00:16:26.469 --> 00:16:29.719
But most of them do not live in Irvine.

00:16:32.746 --> 00:16:33.959
If they all lived in Irvine

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.229
we could solve a lot of problems.

00:16:35.229 --> 00:16:37.407
(audience laughs)

00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:38.961
But they live all over the world,

00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:41.707
and we only bring the superstars to Irvine

00:16:41.707 --> 00:16:43.541
because it costs a lot
of money to bring them up

00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:46.571
and put them up for a week
while we're studying them.

00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:49.203
If we could figure out a
way of assessing people

00:16:49.203 --> 00:16:51.070
who claim they have this ability

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.320
but don't do dates we could learn more.

00:16:57.054 --> 00:16:58.387
- So, thank you.

00:16:59.492 --> 00:17:03.480
So, I see that Jamie doesn't
want to comment on this.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.548
Do you have your own
perspective on the same

00:17:05.548 --> 00:17:07.381
kind of phenomenon or?

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.153
- Not so much, I mean I
think I would agree with you

00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:13.921
that it strikes me that
it's the date stamping thing

00:17:13.921 --> 00:17:16.652
that's interesting about
them and that's what made me

00:17:16.652 --> 00:17:19.223
wonder whether some of
them have synesthesia.

00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:23.013
I think Jill Price does, but
whether it's a common trait.

00:17:23.013 --> 00:17:25.658
I guess, well, you can't
if I asked you a question,

00:17:25.658 --> 00:17:27.571
do you think that they
could tell you what date

00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:30.786
it's going to be say on
the third of June 2020?

00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:32.651
Could they do that?

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.306
Because that's not a memory attest

00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:37.577
that's something about the calendar.

00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:40.586
You think they could do
that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.291
Yeah that was kind of my hunch.

00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:45.085
So I think a lot of their
ability is around having

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:48.026
the calendar as a kind of a tool.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:49.977
- Just to mix it up a little bit.

00:17:49.977 --> 00:17:51.868
We do have a couple
questions for Isabelle.

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:54.873
And she didn't wanna ask
herself the questions.

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.350
And actually a few of them,

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.416
actually appeared here so
there's a very common question.

00:17:59.416 --> 00:18:01.830
Which is, Chinese is a tonal language

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.593
and I guess the question
is, is a general question.

00:18:04.593 --> 00:18:06.843
That is, do tonal languages

00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:11.739
there's this idea that

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.420
music ability and perfect pitch

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.905
is increased in tonal languages.

00:18:18.905 --> 00:18:22.157
So that's one question, is
that an old wive's tale or myth

00:18:22.157 --> 00:18:23.895
or whatever, or,

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.361
and then the other part of that is

00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:27.536
does amusia interfere with speech

00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.869
in learning tonal languages?

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:36.737
- Yes, I mean that's typically
the good questions of course

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:39.549
and typically I do address
them but I didn't have

00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:42.707
enough time, so for the first question.

00:18:42.707 --> 00:18:46.611
It makes so much sense to
check if you can find kids

00:18:46.611 --> 00:18:51.222
is if amusia in populations
who speak a tonal language.

00:18:51.222 --> 00:18:54.767
And when we say tonal language because

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:58.104
they use pitch as a way to convey meaning.

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:01.022
So it's very important
for them to pick that up.

00:19:01.022 --> 00:19:03.965
And it is a little bit more fine grained

00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:06.737
than what we use in everyday speech.

00:19:06.737 --> 00:19:10.904
In English and in French the
way we manipulate prosody

00:19:12.046 --> 00:19:15.240
is much coarse, not fine-grained,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.573
compared to tonal languages.

00:19:18.695 --> 00:19:21.858
So to answer the first question,

00:19:21.858 --> 00:19:26.145
and the other aspect
it's really leading to

00:19:26.145 --> 00:19:29.929
the other question related
to speech or intonation.

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:33.688
So among speakers of a tonal language

00:19:33.688 --> 00:19:37.625
you do find the same prevalence of amusia.

00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:41.971
So it does not protect, to
acquire a tonal language,

00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:45.005
does not protect you from developing

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:47.255
that neurogenetic disorder.

00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:53.501
First, and it has been documented
in many different papers.

00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:56.709
We did it first but it has been replicated

00:19:56.709 --> 00:20:01.284
in different countries and
for different languages.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:04.298
Of course, if you manipulate pitch

00:20:04.298 --> 00:20:07.303
so that it is really, really fine-grained

00:20:07.303 --> 00:20:09.623
like in certain tonal languages

00:20:09.623 --> 00:20:13.240
where pitch is really subtly changed.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.242
Then they do have a problem.

00:20:15.242 --> 00:20:17.909
Especially to identify the tones

00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:20.923
but not to produce it.

00:20:20.923 --> 00:20:23.513
So again we find a dissociation between

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:27.680
whatever it's related to
awareness, learning, the code and

00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:31.388
spontaneously using the code.

00:20:32.424 --> 00:20:35.160
Among speakers of tonal languages.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.381
So it is a very interesting avenue.

00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:39.385
Now related to speech.

00:20:39.385 --> 00:20:42.568
Of course we checked
intonation, and as I said

00:20:42.568 --> 00:20:45.883
in English and in French
the way we use intonation

00:20:45.883 --> 00:20:47.714
in every day life is rather

00:20:47.714 --> 00:20:49.464
a coarse use of pitch

00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:52.626
compared to what we do in music.

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.904
In music as I mentioned in my talk,

00:20:54.904 --> 00:20:57.576
it is really related to a semitone

00:20:57.576 --> 00:21:01.864
to one hundred cents,
the two adjacent keys,

00:21:01.864 --> 00:21:04.447
that's a meaningful difference.

00:21:05.988 --> 00:21:08.813
And we do perceive more than that,

00:21:08.813 --> 00:21:11.541
more refined than 100 cents,

00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:14.202
but in speech when I'm asking,

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:17.415
when I'm making a claim for example,

00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:20.736
my pitch would go down by seven semitones,

00:21:20.736 --> 00:21:24.311
and if I'm asking a question
or using a pitch accent,

00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:26.380
I'm using twelve semitones.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.735
So it's huge.

00:21:27.735 --> 00:21:29.885
And even if you have a poor system

00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:33.728
for tracking pitch differences
you will pick those ones.

00:21:33.728 --> 00:21:37.249
So that the reason they
don't really have a problem

00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.303
with their speech, intonation, and prosody

00:21:39.303 --> 00:21:41.876
in every day life but
if we do manipulate it

00:21:41.876 --> 00:21:46.022
and we have done it course
in the lab by a few semitones

00:21:46.022 --> 00:21:47.954
then they do have a deficit.

00:21:47.954 --> 00:21:49.546
They do show a deficit.

00:21:49.546 --> 00:21:51.227
So it's not specific to music.

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.310
It's just music relevant.

00:21:54.554 --> 00:21:55.915
- Isabelle stay up here for a sec

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:58.509
cause we have a couple
questions, and we have some time.

00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:00.222
So, have you found a correlation,

00:22:00.222 --> 00:22:01.077
can you hear me?

00:22:01.077 --> 00:22:03.578
Between those with amusia

00:22:03.578 --> 00:22:06.828
and difficulty in learning mathematics.

00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:11.745
- Okay, I have to be a little
bit more specific here.

00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:15.873
I am interested by those core currents now

00:22:15.873 --> 00:22:18.261
more than in the past because

00:22:18.261 --> 00:22:20.285
it's so similar

00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:24.452
to the other learning disorders,
specifically to dyslexia

00:22:25.668 --> 00:22:28.866
and to prosopagnosia, the fact that people

00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:32.116
don't recognize faces and I'm affected.

00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:36.317
So to go back to the questions.

00:22:36.317 --> 00:22:39.707
We studied and the form I described here

00:22:39.707 --> 00:22:42.834
is related to pitch, to pitch processing.

00:22:42.834 --> 00:22:46.851
There are other forms of
amusia related to rhythm.

00:22:46.851 --> 00:22:49.813
The reason I am bringing
that up is because

00:22:49.813 --> 00:22:52.760
we don't find any associated disorder

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.093
to the pitch form of amusia.

00:22:56.192 --> 00:22:57.275
But we do see

00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:03.568
differences for those who
have a rhythmic problem.

00:23:03.568 --> 00:23:05.829
They do have a problem with dyslexia.

00:23:05.829 --> 00:23:08.073
They do have a problem with other

00:23:08.073 --> 00:23:10.178
kind of learning disorders.

00:23:10.178 --> 00:23:11.818
I mean they seem to have it all.

00:23:11.818 --> 00:23:15.912
So if we study, I mean
I think that by studying

00:23:15.912 --> 00:23:18.973
those cases more we will learn more about

00:23:18.973 --> 00:23:21.544
the association between the disorders

00:23:21.544 --> 00:23:24.627
than by studying the one I described.

00:23:26.558 --> 00:23:28.484
- So Isabelle a couple more questions,

00:23:28.484 --> 00:23:30.447
I'll just throw them at you.

00:23:30.447 --> 00:23:34.753
What's the frequency of
amusia in Western populations?

00:23:34.753 --> 00:23:37.051
I guess there's a question
of how to diagnose it but

00:23:37.051 --> 00:23:39.696
so the frequency is a big question.

00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:41.773
And then there was one other
that's attached to that,

00:23:41.773 --> 00:23:42.690
let me see.

00:23:45.603 --> 00:23:46.839
Here why don't you ask
that, why don't you answer

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:48.372
that while I'm looking, yeah.

00:23:48.372 --> 00:23:52.006
- I thought I mentioned it
in my first slides, I'm sorry

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:53.195
if it went too fast.

00:23:53.195 --> 00:23:55.362
But the prevalence is 1.5.

00:23:56.275 --> 00:23:59.426
But of course it's always
depends on how you compute it

00:23:59.426 --> 00:24:02.252
and this is true for any kind of disorder.

00:24:02.252 --> 00:24:06.085
So for amusia, I mean it can go up to 4%,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.347
and it is fortunately we
all use the same battery

00:24:11.347 --> 00:24:13.824
of evaluation or the same tests.

00:24:13.824 --> 00:24:17.044
So that we can compare
from one country to another

00:24:17.044 --> 00:24:18.942
or from one lab to another.

00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:21.506
But if you are strict like we were

00:24:21.506 --> 00:24:26.028
and it was a very large based
testing, online testing,

00:24:26.028 --> 00:24:30.195
of more than 20,000 subjects,
or participants, volunteers.

00:24:31.875 --> 00:24:35.380
We could determine that
only 1.5% was affected,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.347
which is large, of course.

00:24:38.347 --> 00:24:42.108
Because we only selected
those who were impaired

00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:45.524
by two standard deviation below the mean

00:24:45.524 --> 00:24:47.451
for the pitch related tests.

00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:49.180
We used two different tests.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.321
So we used converging
evidence and they had to

00:24:52.321 --> 00:24:56.488
perform correctly on a third
test of related to rhythm.

00:24:57.541 --> 00:24:59.645
The reason we do require that

00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:01.734
is that there are attention deficit

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.909
there are other kind of deficits

00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:05.943
that are not really related to music

00:25:05.943 --> 00:25:08.995
but, you know, problems to
perform this kind of testing.

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:13.824
So we eliminate those by
using a control condition

00:25:13.824 --> 00:25:17.991
if you like, and by
doing that we found 1.5%.

00:25:18.935 --> 00:25:22.141
That's a long explanation
but it's a very good question

00:25:22.141 --> 00:25:26.308
because it's important to know
how we measure prevalence.

00:25:29.374 --> 00:25:31.551
- Thank you, I think

00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:34.066
well, we had a lot of
really interesting questions

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:35.610
I'm just trying to.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.316
Maybe, Adam Ockelford could answer this,

00:25:39.316 --> 00:25:42.010
although Isabelle probably could too, so,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.593
so maybe Isabelle will
start and then Adam.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.886
Why do people like music?

00:25:48.886 --> 00:25:51.067
What purpose does it serve?

00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:52.318
(audience laughs)

00:25:52.318 --> 00:25:54.293
And there's an evolutionary
question in there

00:25:54.293 --> 00:25:55.170
as well, right?

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.003
Yeah, so.

00:25:58.639 --> 00:25:59.806
Floor is open.

00:26:01.387 --> 00:26:02.220
- Well.

00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:06.953
Well this is the typical question, ah?

00:26:06.953 --> 00:26:09.143
And we cannot avoid it, so.

00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:12.156
I like to know what you
reply to those questions.

00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:14.437
I mean I have heard that
question for 30 years.

00:26:14.437 --> 00:26:16.399
Ah, what the purpose of music?

00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:17.663
We don't know.

00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:21.168
And your speculation is as good as mine.

00:26:21.168 --> 00:26:25.264
Except that nowadays
there are more and more

00:26:25.264 --> 00:26:28.264
scientific studies on that question.

00:26:29.248 --> 00:26:31.689
For many years we, I mean, it's just

00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:34.294
a philosophical question or it depends on

00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:37.302
what you believed and of course

00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:40.302
they were the kind of provocation of

00:26:41.524 --> 00:26:43.486
Steven Pinker who said, oh,

00:26:43.486 --> 00:26:46.451
music is like auditory cheesecake.

00:26:46.451 --> 00:26:49.692
Pure pleasure for the ears
but it serves nothing,

00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:51.837
I mean it's useless.

00:26:51.837 --> 00:26:54.705
So, this provoked a lot of work.

00:26:54.705 --> 00:26:57.788
Activity in the labs, and we did too.

00:26:58.697 --> 00:27:02.855
But what is really
compelling is that music,

00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:07.557
we don't really understand
the relation with pleasure,

00:27:07.557 --> 00:27:11.714
but this is a way to preserve the bonding

00:27:11.714 --> 00:27:13.558
and the group activity.

00:27:13.558 --> 00:27:16.391
Music is one of the best cement to

00:27:18.501 --> 00:27:21.125
to form a cohesive group.

00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:24.806
I presented my first
slide to be born musical

00:27:24.806 --> 00:27:27.306
the fact that children who are

00:27:28.153 --> 00:27:30.849
moved in synchrony with an adult

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.516
will be more social.

00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:37.214
I mean they will be more
cooperative with that adult

00:27:37.214 --> 00:27:41.687
than with someone who didn't
synchronize at the same time.

00:27:41.687 --> 00:27:44.584
And there are lots of studies like this

00:27:44.584 --> 00:27:48.151
that are coming up now every,
I wouldn't say every day,

00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:50.488
but really recently.

00:27:50.488 --> 00:27:53.516
It's something that now
we take very seriously

00:27:53.516 --> 00:27:55.622
in the lab and we try to answer.

00:27:55.622 --> 00:27:58.285
There is not much about the other idea

00:27:58.285 --> 00:28:00.844
that goes back to Darwin

00:28:00.844 --> 00:28:04.401
who said that music is
really like the peacock tail.

00:28:04.401 --> 00:28:07.068
Just to seduce the other gender.

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:12.384
For now, as far as I know,
maybe you know better.

00:28:12.384 --> 00:28:13.683
- [Daniel] I have an answer.

00:28:13.683 --> 00:28:15.592
- Oh, okay.
(audience laughs)

00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:16.425
Go head.

00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:19.031
- How many of you have a teenager?

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:20.783
It keeps you from killing your teenager.

00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:21.966
(audience laughs)

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:22.866
It's the only thing you can talk about

00:28:22.866 --> 00:28:25.638
with your teenager sometimes is music.

00:28:25.638 --> 00:28:27.423
Anyway that's a, sorry for that,

00:28:27.423 --> 00:28:28.813
I just couldn't help it.

00:28:28.813 --> 00:28:29.646
(audience laughs)

00:28:29.646 --> 00:28:31.321
Late in the afternoon.

00:28:31.321 --> 00:28:33.266
It's the only thing I have in
common with my 17-year-old.

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:36.623
- Yeah but that's bonding and social, too.

00:28:36.623 --> 00:28:40.492
Ah, ha, no I was talking
about something else.

00:28:40.492 --> 00:28:42.591
It's just the fact that, you know,

00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:46.255
when you play music it's hard to fake.

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:49.940
And so it's telling the other, the female,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.057
that really your genes are maybe better

00:28:52.057 --> 00:28:55.118
than someone who cannot really play music.

00:28:55.118 --> 00:28:56.051
(audience laughs)

00:28:56.051 --> 00:28:58.764
That the idea, I mean it's not stupid.

00:28:58.764 --> 00:29:00.061
But it's hard to prove.

00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:02.846
I mean some people have
computed the number

00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:06.204
of offsprings of very famous musicians

00:29:06.204 --> 00:29:08.291
but you know there is a confound.

00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:10.579
There is, okay, come Simon, please.

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:14.162
(man speaking in audience)

00:29:17.024 --> 00:29:21.191
Not many, I mean, Tim
Farconer has none. (laughs)

00:29:22.454 --> 00:29:26.265
Yeah, well, yeah, we can
go back, but believe me,

00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:29.034
they don't have many offsprings.

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:31.861
Do you want to add something?

00:29:31.861 --> 00:29:33.680
- Yeah there's interesting work by

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.804
Colwyn Trevarthen on
communicative musicality.

00:29:36.804 --> 00:29:39.935
Which I think goes back to
the early bonding between

00:29:39.935 --> 00:29:43.256
caregiver and babies, it seems that

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:46.059
being in synchrony with
little vocalizations

00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:47.764
that infants make very early on

00:29:47.764 --> 00:29:51.106
is a critical part of
that bonding process.

00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:52.848
And it seems to precede language as well.

00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:56.023
So it could be that music
is a vital building block.

00:29:56.023 --> 00:29:57.158
Cause the first way we communicate

00:29:57.158 --> 00:30:00.489
is not through words but
through emoting through sound.

00:30:00.489 --> 00:30:02.650
By mirroring that we can begin to get

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.555
a sense of what someone else feels,

00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:05.977
the beginnings of empathy maybe.

00:30:05.977 --> 00:30:08.601
So it could be both ontogenetically

00:30:08.601 --> 00:30:10.742
and maybe phylogenetically,

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:15.475
music was a crucial part on
the journey towards language.

00:30:15.475 --> 00:30:17.723
- Stay up here cause I wanna
explore that a little bit.

00:30:17.723 --> 00:30:19.555
It's an interesting idea because

00:30:19.555 --> 00:30:22.170
when I think of social cognition,

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.482
the first kind of disruption
in that seen in autism

00:30:25.482 --> 00:30:27.049
is this thing called joint attention

00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:30.438
that infants are developing and

00:30:30.438 --> 00:30:33.021
so it's almost paradoxical that

00:30:34.725 --> 00:30:37.138
kind of these, a lot of
these savant abilities,

00:30:37.138 --> 00:30:41.160
or autistic and even
non-verbal autistic children

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.620
might have very substantial
musical abilities

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.694
and in fact you can begin to teach people

00:30:46.694 --> 00:30:48.721
and people with, even acquired aphasias,

00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:51.683
can do quite well if you
begin to get them to sing,

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:53.299
you know using their right hemisphere.

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:56.453
So I wonder, you know,
if you could elaborate

00:30:56.453 --> 00:31:00.620
that connection a little bit
for the neurologist in me.

00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:04.101
- Yeah I've just written a paper on

00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:06.267
is there such a thing as musical empathy

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:08.252
as opposed to cognitive empathy

00:31:08.252 --> 00:31:10.417
and emotional empathy in everyday life

00:31:10.417 --> 00:31:12.606
and I think there is and I think

00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:14.674
the autistic children I work with

00:31:14.674 --> 00:31:16.056
often have musical empathy,

00:31:16.056 --> 00:31:20.116
so we can interrelate
humor, have teasing, have

00:31:20.116 --> 00:31:21.667
sadness, have joy,

00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:23.826
and yet they can't
empathize in everyday life,

00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:27.072
so I think that specifically
in the context of music

00:31:27.072 --> 00:31:28.393
there is that bonding

00:31:28.393 --> 00:31:30.914
but it doesn't seem to
transfer very easily.

00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:31.942
I think that's probably--

00:31:31.942 --> 00:31:33.825
- You know it's really
fascinating because they do

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:36.596
a lot of children would love to be hugged

00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:39.365
and show kind of some kind of

00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:41.546
you know those emotional relationships

00:31:41.546 --> 00:31:44.172
but without the norm,
you know, the typical,

00:31:44.172 --> 00:31:47.713
that's really, it's
interesting, thank you.

00:31:47.713 --> 00:31:50.288
Okay, let's change a little bit,

00:31:50.288 --> 00:31:52.455
let's go to Doctor Miller.

00:31:54.802 --> 00:31:58.368
In the case of Jack,
what significance may lie

00:31:58.368 --> 00:32:00.992
in the yellow and purple as colors

00:32:00.992 --> 00:32:03.643
that are simultaneously intensifying

00:32:03.643 --> 00:32:06.393
as elements of visual perception.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:10.710
- Yeah so a great question,
and thought a lot about it

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.009
and one of the most amazing
things about the patients

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:17.473
who do this is their
language and their thought

00:32:17.473 --> 00:32:20.469
is so disordered and impaired

00:32:20.469 --> 00:32:24.249
that they almost never
can tell you about this.

00:32:24.249 --> 00:32:25.166
But I think

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:31.343
our sense is that with these
diseases which are anterior,

00:32:31.343 --> 00:32:36.216
anterior temporal left, or
anterior inferior frontal left,

00:32:36.216 --> 00:32:41.044
that there is either release
of circuitry that is posterior

00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:44.877
or actually remodeling
of posterior circuitry.

00:32:47.752 --> 00:32:52.340
We're in the process of
analyzing all of our experience

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.100
with these patients
since I've been at UCSF,

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.552
which is about 18 years, and

00:32:57.552 --> 00:32:59.142
I do think there are certain colors

00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:00.883
that are thematically
used more and I think

00:33:00.883 --> 00:33:04.657
purple and yellow are two such colors.

00:33:04.657 --> 00:33:08.407
But I think we need
statistics on this, yeah.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.298
- Another, stay up here.

00:33:11.298 --> 00:33:12.965
I tried to organize.

00:33:14.277 --> 00:33:15.610
To some success.

00:33:16.705 --> 00:33:20.511
In your talk you have
mentioned people with semantic

00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:21.511
I think it's

00:33:22.694 --> 00:33:27.002
dementia making a mistake
about colors of animals.

00:33:27.002 --> 00:33:30.087
Does this imply that language determines

00:33:30.087 --> 00:33:32.156
that the thesis that language
determines our information

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:34.323
processing and categories.

00:33:36.417 --> 00:33:38.509
- I think yes, I mean.

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:42.916
I think we see really two
sort of degenerative models

00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:44.196
for this.

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:48.683
One is when the left side
of the brain degenerates,

00:33:48.683 --> 00:33:51.940
we lose lots of knowledge about things,

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.857
animals, I think, vegetables, food.

00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:59.247
When the right side degenerates we lose

00:33:59.247 --> 00:34:02.501
knowledge about people and
faces and the emotions.

00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:07.064
So very, very different
sort of presentations.

00:34:07.064 --> 00:34:11.633
And you know, I think the
anterior temporal lobe

00:34:11.633 --> 00:34:16.291
is a node I think for verbal
and semantic knowledge,

00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:19.851
the sort of knowledge that we
start layering on as children.

00:34:19.851 --> 00:34:24.458
And I think this is the
nidus of the degeneration and

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:26.905
semantic variant and you do lose

00:34:26.905 --> 00:34:30.405
these language-based concepts, absolutely.

00:34:31.315 --> 00:34:33.041
- So from that perspective then,

00:34:33.041 --> 00:34:36.994
if you lose the word frog
you've lost the concept of frog

00:34:36.994 --> 00:34:39.825
in that way, is that, you know, with that?

00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:41.909
- I mean in Alzheimer's almost never.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:46.026
So in Alzheimer's often
the anatomic lesion

00:34:46.026 --> 00:34:48.991
for losing the ability
to say the word frog

00:34:48.991 --> 00:34:52.108
is posterior temporal parietal.

00:34:52.108 --> 00:34:55.190
These patients are very different, so

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.107
Alzheimer patient frog, yeah, frog.

00:34:59.294 --> 00:35:01.535
So it's on the tip of the tongue.

00:35:01.535 --> 00:35:03.750
And it's very late in the
process that they lose

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.643
the concept for a frog.

00:35:05.643 --> 00:35:09.424
But when the degeneration is
left anterior temporal lobe,

00:35:09.424 --> 00:35:13.599
the loss of the concept
of frog, what a frog is.

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:17.218
These are people if you
give them an IQ test,

00:35:17.218 --> 00:35:21.037
the thing that they do worse
on is general knowledge.

00:35:21.037 --> 00:35:24.351
So they are losing, you
know, knowledge about

00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:28.528
what Shakespeare wrote,
what a table is made of,

00:35:28.528 --> 00:35:32.997
all of these facts that
are accumulated very early.

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:33.997
- Thank you.

00:35:36.548 --> 00:35:39.776
So here's a question for Simon Fisher,

00:35:39.776 --> 00:35:42.668
are there people born
with speech disability

00:35:42.668 --> 00:35:45.778
but who have normal
other verbal abilities.

00:35:45.778 --> 00:35:49.945
I'm assuming reading comprehension
abilities, for example.

00:35:50.872 --> 00:35:51.705
- Yes.

00:35:53.529 --> 00:35:57.544
There's a lot of different types of speech

00:35:57.544 --> 00:35:59.961
and language disorders,

00:35:59.961 --> 00:36:01.294
many of them are

00:36:02.405 --> 00:36:04.747
have high heritability.

00:36:04.747 --> 00:36:07.733
There are some speech problems that are

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:11.900
very predominantly just
about the kind of dysarthric,

00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:15.207
so you can have a developmental dysarthria

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:16.779
that means you actually have problems

00:36:16.779 --> 00:36:19.320
physically making the
right kind of sounds.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.872
In some cases you can
have a combination of

00:36:21.872 --> 00:36:24.712
speech apraxia and dysarthria,

00:36:24.712 --> 00:36:27.346
although it's hard to pull those apart.

00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:29.929
You can have children who have,

00:36:32.144 --> 00:36:34.485
there are many kids that we study who have

00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:37.683
language impairments,
expressive receptive kind

00:36:37.683 --> 00:36:39.595
of language impairments but

00:36:39.595 --> 00:36:42.069
they actually, their speech,

00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:44.695
their sequencing abilities are normal.

00:36:44.695 --> 00:36:48.513
So there's a range of different
profiles of different kids,

00:36:48.513 --> 00:36:51.102
and often it's quite messy.

00:36:51.102 --> 00:36:54.195
In the early days of studying,

00:36:54.195 --> 00:36:58.355
of looking for genes for
involved in language disorders,

00:36:58.355 --> 00:37:00.711
there were some people
who were really focusing

00:37:00.711 --> 00:37:03.528
on trying to find a gene
for grammar, for example,

00:37:03.528 --> 00:37:07.694
or finding specific
lesions that might just

00:37:07.694 --> 00:37:11.111
take out one aspect of language function.

00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:15.669
And I think most of that
has proved not to be true.

00:37:15.669 --> 00:37:17.566
So it's a kind of gray area between

00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:19.649
some kids have relatively

00:37:22.023 --> 00:37:23.190
profiles where

00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:27.502
certain aspects are more
impaired than others.

00:37:27.502 --> 00:37:29.565
Many kids have these
kind of messy profiles

00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:32.178
but speech problems can
definitely be disassociated from

00:37:32.178 --> 00:37:34.394
linguistic problems as well.

00:37:34.394 --> 00:37:35.725
I don't know if that's fully answered the,

00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:38.599
I've gone in a few different directions.

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:39.871
- Yeah, thanks.

00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:41.203
Let's stay up.

00:37:41.203 --> 00:37:44.572
Because you said, you're not
gonna say anything political.

00:37:44.572 --> 00:37:48.791
Thank you for this
question, whoever sent this.

00:37:48.791 --> 00:37:51.472
What would your diagnose
of the current temper

00:37:51.472 --> 00:37:52.465
of POTUS be?

00:37:52.465 --> 00:37:54.730
Temporary POTUS somebody said.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.730
Some have said malignant narcissism.

00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:00.556
Well, anyway, we'll move on from there.

00:38:00.556 --> 00:38:01.877
(audience laughs)

00:38:01.877 --> 00:38:02.794
- Actually.

00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:07.246
Actually I have to say we have a

00:38:07.246 --> 00:38:10.710
a student in my lab who's
a clinical geneticist,

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.467
so she's trained as a clinical geneticist.

00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:14.005
She studies all these different kids

00:38:14.005 --> 00:38:15.895
with different syndromes
like the Williams syndrome,

00:38:15.895 --> 00:38:16.728
there's lots and lots of these

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:18.809
different syndromes out there now.

00:38:18.809 --> 00:38:21.726
And it's almost like for every gene

00:38:24.045 --> 00:38:26.201
there might be a little mini
syndrome associated with it

00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:27.824
when you get mutation.

00:38:27.824 --> 00:38:29.444
And she was going through some examples

00:38:29.444 --> 00:38:30.787
of different types of speech disorders

00:38:30.787 --> 00:38:32.251
that we were studying at the time.

00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:34.429
And then she came up
with a kind of test case.

00:38:34.429 --> 00:38:36.364
This was just before
the American elections.

00:38:36.364 --> 00:38:40.219
And she basically described
this whole phenotype

00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:42.155
including the kind of mouth phenotype,

00:38:42.155 --> 00:38:44.658
things like that for their current POTUS

00:38:44.658 --> 00:38:46.349
and the behavioral things
that have been said,

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:50.374
and can anyone say anything
about the diagnosis, so.

00:38:50.374 --> 00:38:51.682
(man speaking in audience)

00:38:51.682 --> 00:38:53.129
Yes.

00:38:53.129 --> 00:38:54.630
- He doesn't have Williams syndrome.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.492
- No, definitely not Williams syndrome.

00:38:56.492 --> 00:38:57.832
(audience laughs)

00:38:57.832 --> 00:39:00.267
And not speech apraxia.

00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:01.600
- Thanks, Simon.

00:39:03.058 --> 00:39:07.108
So, there was a question
for Geschwind or anyone.

00:39:07.108 --> 00:39:08.691
And so anyone will.

00:39:09.958 --> 00:39:12.177
We have little difficulty
discussing human variation

00:39:12.177 --> 00:39:13.921
at the individual level,

00:39:13.921 --> 00:39:15.659
but at the group level things get dicey.

00:39:15.659 --> 00:39:16.877
Do we need to find a better approach

00:39:16.877 --> 00:39:19.026
to discussing group level differences.

00:39:19.026 --> 00:39:20.355
That's a really great question cause

00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:22.771
they often get confused and confounded.

00:39:22.771 --> 00:39:24.570
And of course there's an
enormous amount of human

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.109
individual variability,
and that's the point.

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:30.501
Is that you can't apply means, averages,

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.650
groups, to individuals.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:36.445
And that's where things kind of get off.

00:39:36.445 --> 00:39:38.068
I'll just leave it there.

00:39:38.068 --> 00:39:40.777
I mean that's, I think
it's a very good point,

00:39:40.777 --> 00:39:43.172
and I think it gets
confounded, those two things.

00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:45.731
When somebody is speaking
about individual differences,

00:39:45.731 --> 00:39:48.015
they're not speaking about the average,

00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:49.729
they're speaking about individuals,

00:39:49.729 --> 00:39:52.337
and when you apply an
average to an individual

00:39:52.337 --> 00:39:55.339
you're losing a lot, usually wrong.

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:56.172
So,

00:39:57.293 --> 00:39:58.918
let's see there are a couple more.

00:39:58.918 --> 00:40:01.135
Let's see, I think we have time.

00:40:01.135 --> 00:40:03.769
There are a couple more
interesting questions for

00:40:03.769 --> 00:40:05.352
for Doctor McGaugh.

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:07.820
Get ready.

00:40:09.203 --> 00:40:13.419
Can an HSAM remember where
he/she left his or her keys?

00:40:13.419 --> 00:40:16.252
(audience laughs)

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.244
- No, as a matter of fact
that's one of their complaints.

00:40:22.244 --> 00:40:24.863
They lose their keys and can't find them.

00:40:24.863 --> 00:40:29.030
And I tested a lot of them
on their personal details,

00:40:31.104 --> 00:40:34.027
and Jill Price has never learned

00:40:34.027 --> 00:40:37.662
her license plate number on her car.

00:40:37.662 --> 00:40:39.674
And she walks past it every day

00:40:39.674 --> 00:40:42.007
when she goes to the garage.

00:40:43.075 --> 00:40:46.634
So these kinds of incidental things

00:40:46.634 --> 00:40:48.593
are not picked up at all

00:40:48.593 --> 00:40:50.921
because that's not what they focus on.

00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:53.588
They focus on either their lives

00:40:55.431 --> 00:40:58.629
and the events in their lives that

00:40:58.629 --> 00:41:00.554
they wanna remember or don't,

00:41:00.554 --> 00:41:03.065
or even on imaginary lives.

00:41:03.065 --> 00:41:05.898
Some of them make up stories which

00:41:06.992 --> 00:41:09.443
they maintain, if I
could just say briefly.

00:41:09.443 --> 00:41:11.943
One of our subjects invented a

00:41:14.412 --> 00:41:17.469
college basketball team in his head

00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:19.771
when he was 13 years old.

00:41:19.771 --> 00:41:22.669
And he has kept that, as
a college basketball team,

00:41:22.669 --> 00:41:25.843
that in his imagination plays other

00:41:25.843 --> 00:41:28.641
real college basketball teams.

00:41:28.641 --> 00:41:30.402
And he does this on a regular basis,

00:41:30.402 --> 00:41:32.347
and he's done this
since he's 13 years old.

00:41:32.347 --> 00:41:34.501
He's now 60 years old.

00:41:34.501 --> 00:41:36.584
And from time to time I get a news release

00:41:36.584 --> 00:41:39.191
that say how well they did
in the NC two A tournament.

00:41:39.191 --> 00:41:41.304
(audience laughs)
And so on.

00:41:41.304 --> 00:41:44.753
And he spends an enormous
amount of time doing this.

00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:46.737
And you might say, why does he do it?

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:49.613
And one answer is because he can.

00:41:49.613 --> 00:41:51.954
That is, he has the ability,
and we have tested him

00:41:51.954 --> 00:41:54.571
on his ability to remember
all of the details.

00:41:54.571 --> 00:41:58.664
They live different kinds
of lives from people who

00:41:58.664 --> 00:42:00.692
don't have the ability.

00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:03.432
And if they have had pleasant
experiences in their life

00:42:03.432 --> 00:42:06.011
and they dwell on that then
they have one kind of a life.

00:42:06.011 --> 00:42:08.515
If they've had unpleasant
experiences that they believe

00:42:08.515 --> 00:42:11.132
they should remember that's another one.

00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:15.187
And if they have hobbies
that require a lot of

00:42:15.187 --> 00:42:16.913
this kind of memory,

00:42:16.913 --> 00:42:18.655
then they do very well with them.

00:42:18.655 --> 00:42:19.488
Thank you.

00:42:22.358 --> 00:42:23.191
- Thanks.

00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:26.458
I think we're kind of,
most of the other questions

00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:28.875
are kind of very similar, so.

00:42:30.022 --> 00:42:32.689
Isabelle had suggested
maybe some of the speakers

00:42:32.689 --> 00:42:34.293
wanna ask each other questions,

00:42:34.293 --> 00:42:36.618
or there are other questions
that people just wanna ask.

00:42:36.618 --> 00:42:38.443
I don't know if that's too far out

00:42:38.443 --> 00:42:40.540
of the realm of what we do.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.442
I know we're gonna have a whole
day of that tomorrow, but.

00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:44.867
I'll repeat that, yeah.

00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:48.045
So Doctor Miller wanted
to ask Karen Berman about

00:42:48.045 --> 00:42:50.462
empathy in Williams syndrome.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.047
- So the question is about empathy

00:42:55.047 --> 00:42:58.008
and are they more empathic
than other children,

00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:59.399
did I get that right?

00:42:59.399 --> 00:43:00.982
Okay, so empathy is

00:43:03.431 --> 00:43:06.335
a broad concept, it's kind
of one of these things that

00:43:06.335 --> 00:43:08.877
we kind of know it when we see it.

00:43:08.877 --> 00:43:13.078
But it can also be studied in
the laboratory experimentally

00:43:13.078 --> 00:43:14.826
in the behavioral lab.

00:43:14.826 --> 00:43:16.659
For example one of the

00:43:18.774 --> 00:43:20.941
very good papers was about

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.660
an investigator who would sit with a child

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.710
with Williams syndrome or other children

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.420
and bang his or her knee.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:35.122
And how many, what level of concern

00:43:35.122 --> 00:43:39.289
does the child have for that
and it's quite significant

00:43:40.162 --> 00:43:44.079
in comparison to typically
developing children,

00:43:45.537 --> 00:43:48.371
or children with various
developmental disorders

00:43:48.371 --> 00:43:50.689
like Downs or others.

00:43:50.689 --> 00:43:54.568
So it's there and it can
be measured experimentally.

00:43:54.568 --> 00:43:57.247
And we sort of do know it when we see it.

00:43:57.247 --> 00:44:00.878
If I show up to one of
my children with my cane,

00:44:00.878 --> 00:44:03.719
I get way more questions
about it than I would

00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:07.386
from anyone else and
expressions of concern.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.771
- Thank you.

00:44:11.771 --> 00:44:14.369
This question and answer
reminds me of the time

00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:16.495
when I was crossing a border somewhere

00:44:16.495 --> 00:44:18.945
and my youngest was about five years old,

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:22.309
and he saw all the guards
asking us, querying us

00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:24.560
for minutes, each of the adults.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.137
And he came up and he said,

00:44:27.137 --> 00:44:29.233
are you gonna ask me a hard math question.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.670
(audience laughs)

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.254
Always get worried about that.

00:44:33.254 --> 00:44:36.077
Anyway, I wanna thank
everybody for the questions.

00:44:36.077 --> 00:44:37.907
Are there any more remaining questions.

00:44:37.907 --> 00:44:41.403
I think we have three minutes and

00:44:41.403 --> 00:44:44.488
it's really time for closing remarks.

00:44:44.488 --> 00:44:47.046
So I'm gonna introduce
Margaret Schoeninger,

00:44:47.046 --> 00:44:49.501
who is the CARTA co-director

00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:51.328
to give us some closing remarks.

00:44:51.328 --> 00:44:52.266
Thank you.

00:44:52.266 --> 00:44:54.849
(audience applauds)

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:56.266
- Thank you, Dan.

00:44:57.535 --> 00:44:59.696
I just wanted to thank the audience,

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:02.248
those people who've stayed
throughout the whole afternoon.

00:45:02.248 --> 00:45:04.010
Thank you very much.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.280
I did wanna particular
thank the symposium chairs.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.436
This was an amazing collection of speakers

00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:12.786
and really fascinating talks.

00:45:12.786 --> 00:45:14.921
You have already thanked the speakers

00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:16.731
but I want to thank them again

00:45:16.731 --> 00:45:18.726
for coming here and giving us

00:45:18.726 --> 00:45:21.761
really fascinating things to think about.

00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:24.313
I would also like to thank our supporters,

00:45:24.313 --> 00:45:26.912
our individual supporters
who made this possible,

00:45:26.912 --> 00:45:28.978
including the Mathers foundation,

00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:30.968
but there are others,
individual supporters,

00:45:30.968 --> 00:45:33.526
some of whom really don't
want us to give their names,

00:45:33.526 --> 00:45:34.443
so I won't.

00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:38.704
But we do want them to know
we very much appreciate it.

00:45:38.704 --> 00:45:41.517
And then also the questions
that you all have asked,

00:45:41.517 --> 00:45:44.517
we very much, it's been a lot of fun

00:45:45.408 --> 00:45:47.290
to think about those things.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.544
I wanna highlight,
though, I wanna point you

00:45:49.544 --> 00:45:52.033
in the direction of this isn't the end.

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:56.442
We have many very interesting
symposia coming up.

00:45:56.442 --> 00:45:59.273
One is in September of next year.

00:45:59.273 --> 00:46:00.764
I mean this next fall.

00:46:00.764 --> 00:46:03.764
And that will be cellular
and molecular explorations of

00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:06.489
anthropogeny, the origin of humans.

00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:09.424
In the winter of 2018, I'm

00:46:09.424 --> 00:46:12.050
particularly interested in this one,

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.952
is the role of hunting
in the origin of humans.

00:46:14.952 --> 00:46:18.285
This will not be just the man the hunter

00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:23.988
redux, but we will be thinking
about the role of hunting

00:46:23.988 --> 00:46:27.738
and obtaining of a very
high quality protein,

00:46:28.735 --> 00:46:30.642
is the way I would look at it.

00:46:30.642 --> 00:46:33.627
In the spring of 2018 we're
looking at imagination

00:46:33.627 --> 00:46:35.131
and human origins.

00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:37.832
I had a conversation with
someone during the break,

00:46:37.832 --> 00:46:40.247
and I said, how do you
know what my dog imagines

00:46:40.247 --> 00:46:41.957
and what my dog doesn't imagine.

00:46:41.957 --> 00:46:45.860
So that's the kind of thing
someone is gonna tell us about.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.366
I think my dog has a great
imagination, actually,

00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:49.879
which he's asleep.

00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:52.709
In the fall of 2018 we're gonna look at

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:55.175
the impact of tools and technology

00:46:55.175 --> 00:46:57.663
on the evolution of the human mind.

00:46:57.663 --> 00:47:00.809
And we can think about all
kinds of different technologies.

00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:03.747
We talk about tools, and
many of them are stone,

00:47:03.747 --> 00:47:06.312
because they actually in
the very early period,

00:47:06.312 --> 00:47:09.610
those are the ones that are preserved.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.491
But we don't know exactly
what other tools were there

00:47:12.491 --> 00:47:15.508
in the very beginning and
we can begin to see things

00:47:15.508 --> 00:47:17.508
that are ephemeral later

00:47:18.572 --> 00:47:22.316
and that will not be preserved
in a long term fossil record.

00:47:22.316 --> 00:47:26.551
So please keep notice of what we're doing,

00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:29.551
and yes, I'm sorry, thank you Rusty.

00:47:30.397 --> 00:47:34.564
I wanna talk about the future
Kavli Institute symposia.

00:47:36.023 --> 00:47:37.345
Thank you.

00:47:37.345 --> 00:47:42.062
In December of 2017, we are
gonna have imaging the brain,

00:47:42.062 --> 00:47:45.249
from molecules to circuits and beyond.

00:47:45.249 --> 00:47:48.233
So we'll take it from all
levels in the brain and

00:47:48.233 --> 00:47:51.008
I hope you realize that
the drawing that you saw

00:47:51.008 --> 00:47:53.742
in the very beginning with
the yellows and the purples

00:47:53.742 --> 00:47:58.610
is the human brain, but
with gorgeous colors in it.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.352
Very similar to the parrot actually.

00:48:00.352 --> 00:48:03.398
When I saw the parrot I
thought of this picture.

00:48:03.398 --> 00:48:05.635
Thank you, Jesse, for that picture.

00:48:05.635 --> 00:48:07.325
Alright, thank you very much.

00:48:07.325 --> 00:48:09.236
And we hope to see you in the future.

00:48:09.236 --> 00:48:12.081
(audience applauds)

00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:15.331
(upbeat digital music)
