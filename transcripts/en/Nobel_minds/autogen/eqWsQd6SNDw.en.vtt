00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.720
Ja, hello
This is Adam Smith calling from Nobelprize.org

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.720
Hi, Adam, hello.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.230
Congratulations of course on the award of
the Nobel Prize.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.230
Thanks, thanks.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.080
May I ask just what you were doing when the
news came?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.290
I was reading a paper actually, and going
through the details of a paper.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.620
And, your initial reaction on hearing the
news?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.890
It was a total surprise.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.580
I couldn't believe it.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.700
The first moment I thought it was perhaps
a hoax or so.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.850
But I remembered the voice of Professor Normark,
and I realised there were other people around

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.430
and he said he would confirm by email, and
so it's serious.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.840
First of all I couldn't really believe it.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.550
But then I gradually realised that it's true.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.900
And what was the first thing you did after
you'd received the news and found out that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.900
it was true?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.790
Ja, I read the paragraph that I wanted to
read to the end.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.539
And then I called up my wife and tried to
reach some of the people who are close to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:12.539
me.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.549
But that's marvellous, that's true dedication,
staying with the paper.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.819
I guess that's what makes you successful.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:27.240
You defied conventional wisdom in thinking
that you could break the diffraction barrier.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020
What gave you the courage to try that?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.539
I think it was inside.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.600
So, I had realised that, that was my view
at least, that so much physics happened in

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.420
the 20th century that it is impossible that
there is no say phenomenon, or physical chemistry

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.349
phenomenon, that would allow you to overcome
the diffraction barrier that was coined in

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.099
1873 or so.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.939
So I felt that there must be something, a
kind of phenomenon that leads you beyond the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.939
barrier.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.249
And so I got kind of convinced that there
must be something, and so I tried to find

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.530
something and eventually I found ways to overcome
that limit.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.920
Clearly you are deeply passionate about science.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.170
Do you consider science fun?

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.900
Yes, absolutely.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.129
So I love to be a scientist.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.230
I've always enjoyed being curious.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.330
I've always enjoyed doing challenging things
and also challenging common wisdom.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.379
So, I think that's something a scientist can
do because a scientist works at a border,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.909
at the edge of science, at the edge of knowledge,
and so there's a lot of fun of reaching out

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.680
and thinking about things that other people
didn't think about.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.819
And so it has a kind of exploratory notion,
kind of adventurous part in it.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.739
I think people often neglect that, that really
you can be in the lab and be just as adventurous

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.380
as people exploring the deep ocean.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.790
Absolutely, and also creative.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.660
I mean, you can imagine that something works.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.830
I imagined there would be a way to crack the
diffraction barrier.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.300
But of course I didn't know exactly how it
would work, but I had a gut feeling that there

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.069
must be something and so I tried to think
about it, to be creative.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.329
And that initial phase of the development,
it was a creative act.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.439
In the end of course you have to prove that
it's not just imagination.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.310
It's not just a theory or just a thought - it
is true.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.230
And there is where the hard work comes in.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.450
And you have to really prove that the way
you think about it is right.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.079
And that took, of course, some time and a
lot of development.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.129
Thank you very much indeed.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.180
That's marvellous.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.780
I guess now that you're going to be swamped
by people like me asking you questions.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.799
How does that prospect?

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.299
Well, I locked myself in, and so I'm OK so
far.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.129
How very sensible of you.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.680
You sound like you're well in control of this
situation.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.290
So, I wish you a very enjoyable day.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.980
I hope the following hours are enormous fun.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.450
Thank you very much for speaking to us now.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.480
Thank you very much for calling.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480
My pleasure.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
Thank you.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
Bye bye.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.481
Bye.
