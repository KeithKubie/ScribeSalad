00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
So now we have this awesome new form for the equation of a parabola, y minus k

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.090
equals a times x minus h squared. What I want to know is what we should call

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.134
this form. I keep having to read it out each time I say it. And, as you know,

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:16.261
I'm really lazy and I don't want to do that. I just want to have a name for it.

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.934
So what should we call it? Should we call this the x-intercept form for the

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:26.796
equation of a parabola? The y-intercept form? Vertex form? Minimum form? Or

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:28.055
maximum form?
