so Peter you asked a really good

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920
so Peter you asked a really good
 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.950
so Peter you asked a really good
question about radiation perhaps being

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960
question about radiation perhaps being
 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.690
question about radiation perhaps being
the limiting factor in human exploration

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700
the limiting factor in human exploration
 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.030
the limiting factor in human exploration
and honestly this is something that

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040
and honestly this is something that
 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.499
and honestly this is something that
people are working on very hard right

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509
people are working on very hard right
 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.659
people are working on very hard right
now it is indeed a challenge the

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669
now it is indeed a challenge the
 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.429
now it is indeed a challenge the
astronauts on the space station are

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439
astronauts on the space station are
 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.049
astronauts on the space station are
actually fairly well protected from

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:25.059
actually fairly well protected from
 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.900
actually fairly well protected from
radiation the earth has a liquid metal

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910
radiation the earth has a liquid metal
 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.240
radiation the earth has a liquid metal
core that generates a strong magnetic

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250
core that generates a strong magnetic
 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.910
core that generates a strong magnetic
field around the earth and amazingly the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920
field around the earth and amazingly the
 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.590
field around the earth and amazingly the
space station which is about 200 miles

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600
space station which is about 200 miles
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.840
space station which is about 200 miles
above us is still in that protective

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850
above us is still in that protective
 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.180
above us is still in that protective
magnetic field so when you're just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190
magnetic field so when you're just
 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.530
magnetic field so when you're just
orbiting the Earth on the space station

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540
orbiting the Earth on the space station
 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.840
orbiting the Earth on the space station
the astronauts may get slightly higher

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850
the astronauts may get slightly higher
 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.310
the astronauts may get slightly higher
doses of radiation but they're actually

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320
doses of radiation but they're actually
 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.860
doses of radiation but they're actually
fairly well protected what happens if

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870
fairly well protected what happens if
 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.390
fairly well protected what happens if
you go beyond the Earth's magnetic field

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400
you go beyond the Earth's magnetic field
 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.190
you go beyond the Earth's magnetic field
though is that all of a sudden you're

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200
though is that all of a sudden you're
 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.460
though is that all of a sudden you're
vulnerable to the radiation of space and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470
vulnerable to the radiation of space and
 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.630
vulnerable to the radiation of space and
specifically it's our wonderful friend

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640
specifically it's our wonderful friend
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.100
specifically it's our wonderful friend
the Sun I mean none of us would be here

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110
the Sun I mean none of us would be here
 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.479
the Sun I mean none of us would be here
without the energy and the light of the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489
without the energy and the light of the
 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.850
without the energy and the light of the
Sun but the Sun actually outputs a lot

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860
Sun but the Sun actually outputs a lot
 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.250
Sun but the Sun actually outputs a lot
of high-energy particles and these

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260
of high-energy particles and these
 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.560
of high-energy particles and these
create high radiation levels anywhere

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570
create high radiation levels anywhere
 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.999
create high radiation levels anywhere
where there isn't a protective magnetic

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009
where there isn't a protective magnetic
 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.370
where there isn't a protective magnetic
field so for example if you went to the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380
field so for example if you went to the
 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.260
field so for example if you went to the
moon and in fact astronauts went to the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270
moon and in fact astronauts went to the
 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.450
moon and in fact astronauts went to the
moon in the 1960s and 1970s

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460
moon in the 1960s and 1970s
 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.179
moon in the 1960s and 1970s
had there been a very powerful solar

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189
had there been a very powerful solar
 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.279
had there been a very powerful solar
storm when the astronauts were there it

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289
storm when the astronauts were there it
 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.139
storm when the astronauts were there it
may have made them very sick and might

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149
may have made them very sick and might
 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.330
may have made them very sick and might
have even killed them so in some sense

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340
have even killed them so in some sense
 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.559
have even killed them so in some sense
it was good luck that when the

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569
it was good luck that when the
 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.539
it was good luck that when the
astronauts were up on the moon not

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549
astronauts were up on the moon not
 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.010
astronauts were up on the moon not
protected by the Earth's magnetic field

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020
protected by the Earth's magnetic field
 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.010
protected by the Earth's magnetic field
the Sun was relatively quiet

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
the Sun was relatively quiet
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.840
the Sun was relatively quiet
however on a trip to Mars which might

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850
however on a trip to Mars which might
 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.569
however on a trip to Mars which might
take months up to six months you're not

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579
take months up to six months you're not
 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.859
take months up to six months you're not
going to be able to rely just on good

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869
going to be able to rely just on good
 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.649
going to be able to rely just on good
luck there will be solar activity there

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659
luck there will be solar activity there
 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.870
luck there will be solar activity there
will be bursts of high-energy particles

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880
will be bursts of high-energy particles
 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.940
will be bursts of high-energy particles
from the Sun so how do you protect

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950
from the Sun so how do you protect
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.099
from the Sun so how do you protect
astronauts from that and we're working

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109
astronauts from that and we're working
 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.559
astronauts from that and we're working
on technology and in some cases it's a

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569
on technology and in some cases it's a
 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.389
on technology and in some cases it's a
special kind of sleeping bag that you

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399
special kind of sleeping bag that you
 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.919
special kind of sleeping bag that you
could get into and zip yourself up and

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929
could get into and zip yourself up and
 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.010
could get into and zip yourself up and
have some protection other ideas one of

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
have some protection other ideas one of
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.629
have some protection other ideas one of
the best protectors against radiation is

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639
the best protectors against radiation is
 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.550
the best protectors against radiation is
water so if you have the liquid water

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
water so if you have the liquid water
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.769
water so if you have the liquid water
tanks on one side of your spacecraft you

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:58.779
tanks on one side of your spacecraft you
 

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:00.149
tanks on one side of your spacecraft you
might be able to shelter from a solar

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159
might be able to shelter from a solar
 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.580
might be able to shelter from a solar
storm by putting the water tanks between

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
storm by putting the water tanks between
 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.409
storm by putting the water tanks between
you and the Sun but if you're actually

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.419
you and the Sun but if you're actually
 

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:05.699
you and the Sun but if you're actually
going to be living and working in space

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709
going to be living and working in space
 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.160
going to be living and working in space
for a long time this really is a problem

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
for a long time this really is a problem
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.469
for a long time this really is a problem
if we were to send astronauts to Mars

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
if we were to send astronauts to Mars
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.300
if we were to send astronauts to Mars
for example they wouldn't be protected

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310
for example they wouldn't be protected
 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.309
for example they wouldn't be protected
from the radiation unless they could dig

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
from the radiation unless they could dig
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.960
from the radiation unless they could dig
under the ground and actually build

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970
under the ground and actually build
 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.179
under the ground and actually build
their habitats even just as much as ten

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189
their habitats even just as much as ten
 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.240
their habitats even just as much as ten
feet down would be an

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250
feet down would be an
 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.400
feet down would be an
but that's hard you know the Martian

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410
but that's hard you know the Martian
 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.770
but that's hard you know the Martian
soil is is very hard and rocky and not

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
soil is is very hard and rocky and not
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.990
soil is is very hard and rocky and not
easy to dig through and before you could

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000
easy to dig through and before you could
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.490
easy to dig through and before you could
go there you'd have to send construction

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500
go there you'd have to send construction
 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.290
go there you'd have to send construction
equipment to actually build all of these

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300
equipment to actually build all of these
 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.440
equipment to actually build all of these
habitats so we understand that this is a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
habitats so we understand that this is a
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.390
habitats so we understand that this is a
problem it's one of the things that is

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400
problem it's one of the things that is
 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.190
problem it's one of the things that is
limiting our exploration of the solar

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200
limiting our exploration of the solar
 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.400
limiting our exploration of the solar
system the robots that we build that go

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
system the robots that we build that go
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.500
system the robots that we build that go
to Mars like the Mars rover or the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510
to Mars like the Mars rover or the
 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.030
to Mars like the Mars rover or the
spacecraft that there's one orbiting

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
spacecraft that there's one orbiting
 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.180
spacecraft that there's one orbiting
Jupiter they have to be extremely

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190
Jupiter they have to be extremely
 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.990
Jupiter they have to be extremely
protected and shielded from the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
protected and shielded from the
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.780
protected and shielded from the
radiation of space in fact our mission

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
radiation of space in fact our mission
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.580
radiation of space in fact our mission
to Jupiter right now is called Juno and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
to Jupiter right now is called Juno and
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.970

the instruments are inside a 700 pound

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980
the instruments are inside a 700 pound
 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.820
the instruments are inside a 700 pound
box of almost pure titanium to protect

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830
box of almost pure titanium to protect
 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.710
box of almost pure titanium to protect
it from the radiation of around Jupiter

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
it from the radiation of around Jupiter
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440
it from the radiation of around Jupiter
even with that protection we only expect

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
even with that protection we only expect
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.150
even with that protection we only expect
the instruments to last about two years

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160
the instruments to last about two years
 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.850
the instruments to last about two years
the radiation is that intense so you

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860
the radiation is that intense so you
 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.070
the radiation is that intense so you
know you could not go to visit Jupiter

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080
know you could not go to visit Jupiter
 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.290
know you could not go to visit Jupiter
in a spacecraft and just happily sit

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300
in a spacecraft and just happily sit
 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.610
in a spacecraft and just happily sit
there and watch this beautiful planet

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620
there and watch this beautiful planet
 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.890
there and watch this beautiful planet
below you you'd be dead and probably

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900
below you you'd be dead and probably
 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.230
below you you'd be dead and probably
something like a day so this really is a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240
something like a day so this really is a
 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.660
something like a day so this really is a
difficulty in sending astronauts out to

somehow tardigrades DNA knows how to
heal itself right back up so we're

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680
heal itself right back up so we're
 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.219
heal itself right back up so we're
studying how tardigrade DNA works in the

where you know dr. McCoy gives people a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
where you know dr. McCoy gives people a
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.249
where you know dr. McCoy gives people a
shot to protect them from radiation

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259
shot to protect them from radiation
 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.709
shot to protect them from radiation
could that someday happen well maybe and

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719
could that someday happen well maybe and
 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.779
could that someday happen well maybe and
we're gonna get there by starting to

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789
we're gonna get there by starting to
 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.760
we're gonna get there by starting to
look at these microorganisms that are

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770
look at these microorganisms that are
 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.770
look at these microorganisms that are
resistant to radiation figure out how

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
resistant to radiation figure out how
 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.649
resistant to radiation figure out how
they do it and could we do that too

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659
they do it and could we do that too
 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.500
they do it and could we do that too
maybe

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510
maybe
 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.769
maybe
