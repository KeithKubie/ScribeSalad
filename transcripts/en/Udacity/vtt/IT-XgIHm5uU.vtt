00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.130
So James, do you think we should go over the differences between

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.300
bracket notation, dot notation and object literal notation?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.870
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.130
I think that conversation would make this class a lot longer.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.690
Let's put a link in the instructor's notes to give students more information.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.100
Good news is, they're pretty similar.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's fair.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.860
Okay. So we're about to get into control flow in JavaScript.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.910
But, before we do, let's go ahead and finish all of our objects.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.440
The work object and projects objects needed to be created.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.980
And let's go ahead and finish up the biography and education objects.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.750
While we're at it, let's go ahead and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.790
clean out resumeBuilder.js too, so that way, it only contains the four objects.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.380
You might have some code in resumeBuilder.js from previous quizzes.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.670
If you want to keep it, that's totally cool.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.250
But you should comment it out with two slashes.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.160
These two slashes at

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.510
the beginning of any line will comment out the rest of the line.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.010
Or, if you don't want to comment out your code, you can just simply cut and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.350
paste all of it into a different file.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.650
&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.530
Let's start the next lesson with a clean file,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.940
with just our biographical objects.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.840
Click this box once you've created your bio, work, projects and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.380
education objects, and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.330
either have cleared out or commented out, all of your previous code.
