00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.970
- I hope you're having an
amazing day, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.790
I'm in Xochimilco, which
one of the southern

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.980
16 boroughs of Mexico City.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.950
And Xochimilco is very well
known for its ancient canals

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.610
where you can jump on a boat

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.900
and you can cruise around on a boat,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.150
and so the plan for today
is, I'm about to meet up

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.400
with my friend Lalo, from
La Ruta de la Garnacha,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.490
and we're going to start in the center,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.460
in the town of Xochimilco.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.040
We're gonna eat some amazing street food

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.820
and then after that we're
gonna go take a boat

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.500
and cruise around, this
should be a lot of fun,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.017
and I'm gonna share it all with
you in this video right now.

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:36.517
(salsa music)

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:40.040
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.960
We're in Xochimilco for this street food

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.520
of this small town inside the Mexico City.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.242
- It doesn't feel like
you're in Mexico City here,

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.260
but some history of
Xochimilco is that it was,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.360
before, it's own city, right?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.860
It was a former Aztec
city on the shores of

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.690
Lake Xochimilco, but Mexico
City eventually grew into it,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.120
so that's why it still has a
small city kinda feel to it.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.385
We are first heading over to the market

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.055
where we're gonna begin eating.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.555
(salsa music)

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.870
This walk through Xochimilco
towards the market

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.650
sorta feels like a carnival,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.290
it's like a,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.590
there are rides, there are

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.690
bubbles, you'll find clothes here,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.710
you'll find restaurants,
there's street food and snacks,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.834
but we're gonna head over
to the market first to eat.

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.110
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.200
While you're walking through

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.840
Xochimilco you'll find
a lot of pizza shops.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.955
Pizza is very popular here.

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:45.862
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:47.800
(salsa music)

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.320
We're just arrive to
Mercado de Xochimilco,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.350
and this is a manageable market,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.650
they have everything you want.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.410
There's clothes, there's food,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.760
there's fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.990
We came here, we're hungry,
we need to eat lunch,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.820
we need some food so that
we go to the boat prepared.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.450
At one of the main
entrances of the market,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.410
there's just a lineup
of ladies serving food

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.010
from baskets and they are packed.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.360
This is where we're gonna start eating,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.300
and they're serving a
bunch of different things,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.895
they all look very friendly.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:24.812
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:46.973 --> 00:02:48.495
- [Lalo] And this is huitlacoche.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:49.465
- [Mark] La-ko-che.

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:51.276
- You know what is that?
- No.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:53.543
- Huitlacoche its the mushroom,

00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:55.671
actually of the mazorca,

00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.070
mazroca is where the corn--

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.140
- Ohh.
- So when they pass it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.670
they cut it--
- Oh yeah.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.098
- The mushroom--
- It's the fungus of the corn?

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.060
- Yeah, exactly.
- Oh, I have to try that.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.237
Wait, does this one have it too?

00:03:06.237 --> 00:03:08.114
- This is mushroom and
this is huitlacoche--

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:08.947
- Oh, okay.

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:10.250
This is called Tlacoyo.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.720
When you order it, she
grabs one of the bases,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.740
she tops it with some salsa,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.980
and then she adds on some
tomatoes and some onions

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.470
and some nopal, which is the cactus,

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.370
and then she sprinkles it with cheese.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.920
The base is kinda like corn starchiness.

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.140
But you taste the mushrooms in there,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.570
and then you've got that
salty, crumbly cheese,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.100
you've got that salsa which gives it some

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.670
acidity and some sourness,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.740
and then you've got the
freshness of the tomatoes.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.573
It's wonderful.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.790
It's awesome. I got a big
mushroom in that bite.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.623
And you can see really close,

00:03:50.623 --> 00:03:51.720
you can see that it's,

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:53.840
the bottom piece is just
stuffed with mushrooms in there.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.610
Lalo and I are sharing both of them,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.270
and the next one that we
got is with the corn fungus

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.940
which is called huitlacoche.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.400
- I love the mushroom.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.672
- You like the mushroom?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.350
It's made it with the hands so

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.760
it's made it with love.
- It is, for sure.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.633
Motherly love.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.133
(salsa music)

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:16.598
Mmmm.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.030
Oh, the corn fungus is amazing.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.210
It has this crunchier texture,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.190
and more of a sour taste.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.150
Oh, this is delicious.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.540
- [Lalo] Yeah, and it's
unique flavor, too.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.580
- That was absolutely delicious

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.650
and we are never getting
far in this market.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.200
We are just going across the way.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.480
- Yeah.
- And we're eating this next.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.460
This is perfect then, we
don't even need to walk

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.790
to the next place, we just,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.637
we took about five steps--

00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:48.910
(laughter)
To eat our next food.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.230
- It's look delicious,
and look at all the--

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.790
- [Mark] Yeah, look at all these people.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.860
This is the busiest place in the--

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.006
- Enter--
- Entrance of the market.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:59.923
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.620
She has two different
things that she's serving,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.120
tostadas and quesadillas,
both with chicken.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.600
But she takes the tostada shell

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.670
and she puts a layer
of sour cream onto it,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.980
and then she adds on the stewed chicken,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.360
and then she adds on a handful of lettuce,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.755
followed by a handful of cheese.

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:22.672
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.990
She hands you your tostada
or your quesadilla,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.010
I got a tostada first,
and then it's self service

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.721
for the salsa, and she
said it's a spicy salsa.

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.070
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.870
I'm beginning with the tostada.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.390
- I'm beginning with the
quesadilla of, is it chicken?

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.870
It's chicken, Senora?

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:00.924
- Oh wow, oh.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.280
That chicken is just
stewed with so much flavor,

00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:06.050
and that salsa.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.210
That salsa is a little bit
spicy, but so flavorful,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.810
that's sensational.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.325
I honestly was not expecting
it to be that flavorful.

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:17.128
That's awesome.

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.878
(mariachi music)

00:06:25.824 --> 00:06:28.070
Outstanding. How's the quesadilla?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.900
- It's really, really amazing.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.487
At the beginning I feel like it's really

00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:37.940
unflavored, but when you
bite the chicken, wow.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.800
This is a fried quesadilla,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.200
normally they are not fried.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.600
This is kind of quesadilla.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.130
For the people that seeing this,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.650
we call it quesadilla,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.240
but only in Mexico City

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.839
we can try a quesadilla without cheese.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.350
But in Mexico you can try the
quesadilla without cheese.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.820
- Wow, I never knew that.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.410
Next up, my turn for the quesadilla,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.520
and as Lalo explained,
it's chicken on the inside,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.720
so it's not a cheese
quesadilla, and it's fried,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.930
and that salsa is just
blowing my taste buds

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.010
off of my tongue.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.980
That salsa is incredible.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.270
It is spicy, it burns
your lips and I love it.

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:21.893
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:25.800
- Oh wow.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.070
The quesadilla is equally as delicious.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.230
It's really crispy.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.620
The chicken, he actually
was explaining to use that

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.530
on the tostada it's pinga,
which is the name of the dish,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.000
it's like a stewed chicken.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.750
But this one is just plain chicken.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.090
It's just so unbelievably good.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.630
It is right at the
entrance of Puerta Cinco,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.710
gate number five, Mercado de Xochimilco.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.050
You have to come here.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.483
It's awesome.

00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:02.400
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:05.860
It's almost the same, it's
completely deep fried,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.470
there's beef in the center,
but then she does open it up,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.090
and there is, she does add
in a little bit of salsa.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.000
Oh, you can even see
that's deep fried beef

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.210
inside of there.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.110
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.103
The beef have a delicious flavor.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.029
- It does.

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:27.209
It almost tastes like a sausage.

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:28.659
- And the sauce is not spicy.

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:34.411
Mmmm.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.470
- That's tasty.
- And juicy.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.210
- Often, Ying and I like the Jamaica,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.811
which is hibiscus, or
roselle, it's roselle.

00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:04.077
And it's a great juice, it's refreshing.

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:07.660
We need some refreshment, some cold drinks

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.240
after all those salty tacos.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.540
I think I got one of those
straws with a hole in it,

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.970
because I can't suck up that much.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.803
But it is good.

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:23.950
It's sweet, it has a little
bit of a floral taste to it.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.551
Yup.

00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.051
(salsa music)

00:09:42.046 --> 00:09:42.879
Oh wow.

00:09:44.597 --> 00:09:46.803
(grunts)
(laughter)

00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:48.005
Hey we're actually running out of time

00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:49.370
because to Xochimilco in the afternoon,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.560
and we gotta catch the boat,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.500
but we're running out of daylight.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.900
But we chose to eat one more thing,

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.410
we're coming to eat carnitas,

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.460
this is the awesome-est looking stall ever

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.023
and he's so friendly,
he's such a character,

00:10:00.023 --> 00:10:03.480
and they just have this massive pile of

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.957
gnarly looking braised,
fried meat, carnitas,

00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:10.730
just heaping, it's a heap of meat.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.420
So this is a place we have to eat.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.250
They've just given us a
sample of the carnitas.

00:10:19.377 --> 00:10:20.210
Oh yeah.

00:10:22.072 --> 00:10:23.672
That is tender, greasy, supreme.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.450
You can trust this man with your pork,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.900
he knows what he's doing.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.110
He braises all that meat,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.448
and cooks all that meat
and then it sits out

00:10:36.448 --> 00:10:37.870
on the counter there,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.130
and then when you order he chops it up.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.100
And what he does is he
grabs that handful of meat

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.840
and he sticks it back
into the pork oil juices

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.290
and lets it boil again

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.263
to heat it and then also to

00:10:50.263 --> 00:10:53.770
inject it with more flavor,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.230
and then that goes into your taco.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.950
This thing is an absolute taco monster.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.220
Look at that, there's
so much meat in there.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.000
I dunno if there's gonna be any clean way

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.380
to eat this, so I'm just gonna go for it.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.060
- I'm ready.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.610
Oh, your amazing taco (laughs).

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.786
Huge.
- It's huge.

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:13.402
It's huge.

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:14.235
(laughter)
Okay.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.570
That is like tender, fatty, oily meat.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.410
And salty.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.790
And just falling all out the back end,

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.640
look at my plate.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.313
I'm losing things.

00:11:33.313 --> 00:11:36.500
(mariachi music)

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.600
Oh man, there was so much meat

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.050
in that tortilla, it was just,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.951
it was bloated with meat.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:45.400
We gotta run now, because
we're running out of sunlight.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.250
So this market, you have
been very good to us,

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.880
amazing food, very friendly people,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.710
and just a very cool, low key,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.660
easy to get around market.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.510
This is a great market to explore before

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.710
you get on a boat when
you visit Xochimilco.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.720
There are quite a few different boat docks

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.399
where you can catch a boat,

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.080
but we're walking to one
just down the road here.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:16.941
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.610
We are at Embarcadero Caltongo,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.310
which is the dock that
we're setting off from.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.130
So right now we're just,

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.824
Lalo is trying to negotiate for a boat.

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:40.574
(mariachi music)

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.430
I love the boats, how colorful they are.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.720
They're so iconic.

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:48.589
(mariachi music)

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.000
There are so many boats,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.635
so we have to walk all
the way to the end boat

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:02.310
to leave.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.250
That took a little negotiating but

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.190
we finally got a driver
and we're on our way.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.560
Oh, this is our boat.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.510
I think this is it.

00:13:13.962 --> 00:13:16.290
Oh, this is excellent.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.840
Micah, you're gonna love this.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.219
Micah has been looking
forward to this all day long.

00:13:22.219 --> 00:13:23.510
(laughter)
Yeah.

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:27.631
So like I was mentioning
before, Xochimilco,

00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:30.780
its a very historic area,
it's a Pre-Hispanic,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.010
it was a Pre-Hispanic town,

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.920
and they had created a very extensive

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.250
system of manmade canals,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.650
and so that system connected
many of the villages

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.610
throughout this valley.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.890
Today it's more of a party environment.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.610
People, families and
parties rent these boats

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.915
and they cruise around and
hang out and have parties,

00:13:53.915 --> 00:13:56.150
but it's really a fun environment.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.450
One of the great things about this is

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.635
there's no motors, there's
no engines on the boat

00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:05.000
so they row the boat by a big stick,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.480
just pushing the stick down.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.910
So it's peaceful,

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.540
you can definitely hear the
sounds of music and people

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.720
but the peace of the canal is beautiful.

00:14:15.768 --> 00:14:18.851
(lively banda music)

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.390
- I really love Xochimilco
because it's like a party,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.150
really party on the the
boats, on trajineras,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.850
it is amazing, just check it.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.770
- When we started off it seemed to quiet.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.620
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.600
- And then we got into the canal

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.230
and all of a sudden it's
like a giant party--

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.285
- And you say, no, it's so quiet,

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:43.139
you can (overlapping speech).

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:43.972
- A little bumper boat?

00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:45.780
- But now, it's--
- Yeah.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.740
It's like a canal highway.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.311
- Yeah.
(laughter)

00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:51.590
- And there's all sorts of different music

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.490
you can hear from every single boat.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.507
It's pretty cool, some of them

00:14:54.507 --> 00:14:56.960
are college parties,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.710
some of them are family get-togethers.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.940
- With Mariachis--
- Mariachi band right here.

00:15:03.818 --> 00:15:06.568
(mariachi music)

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.950
There's so much going on.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.565
(lively music)

00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:26.889
- Wooo!

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:28.273
(laughter)

00:15:28.273 --> 00:15:30.519
We're adults! We're not fun!

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:32.527
- We're the only ones not partying.

00:15:32.527 --> 00:15:34.777
(laughter)

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.360
Okay, so it is just about
pure dark right now,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.900
but the party continues,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.880
there's so many boats
out here on the canals

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.060
in Xochimilco,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.380
and our boat driver just said
that they'll go all night

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.680
if you want to pay for it.

00:15:49.693 --> 00:15:52.860
(lively banda music)

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.210
Traffic jam right here,
there's so many boats,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.470
there's about 25 different musics.

00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:01.072
(lively music)

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.400
So that brings us to the
end of this Xochimilco tour.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.990
Big thank you to Lalo.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.800
He's La Ruta de la Garnacha on Youtube,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.530
I'll leave his link in
the description box,

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.744
check out his awesome videos.

00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:16.830
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.280
The market is especially awesome,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.220
there's some amazing food,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.710
so if you come here, be sure
to go to the market first,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.840
eat some amazing food
and then come get a boat,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.170
and if you come, you can
come in the day time,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.690
and it will be a little
less of a party environment,

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.810
but you can still come 24 hours a day.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.880
- Mexico is waiting for you,
welcome to Mexico, Mark.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.560
- Thank you.
- It was a pleasure,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.874
it was an honor to be with you.

00:16:37.874 --> 00:16:40.090
(speaks in foreign language)
- So much fun, always fun

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.320
to hang out with Lalo.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.840
But that's it, thanks again for watching.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.450
