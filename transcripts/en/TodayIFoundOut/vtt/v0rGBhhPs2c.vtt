00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.250
Movies have been made in Hollywood since it
was incorporated into the city of Los Angeles

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.740
in 1910.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.860
These early flicks often featured military
equipment in the background, such as for an

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.860
air show.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.750
Nonetheless, prior to granting access to its
assets, the military ensured that each scene

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.910
and film reflected its values and presented
its soldiers in a positive way.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.690
As the nation entered the great wars, the
need to project American power and resolve

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.960
became paramount.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.921
Also satisfying the public’s desire for
high quality entertainment, military advisers

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:44.940
helped film industry professionals make realistic,
yet positive, films to support war efforts

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.920
for both World War I and World War II.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.890
In the lull between the two conflicts, the
relationship between Hollywood and the military

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.690
became fixed with the 1927 flick, Wings.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.264
With a cast that included 3,000 infantry and
featuring U.S. planes (and pilots flying them)

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:04.960
in the backdrop of a story of two pilots trying
to win the “it” girl, Clara Bow, Wings

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.750
not only won the Best Picture Oscar that year,
but it showed how cooperation between the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.420
corps and Hollywood provided huge benefits
to both: Hollywood created an authentic military

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.260
experience and enjoyed commercial and critical
success, and the military had what for them

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.620
was essentially a great recruitment film displayed
in theaters across the country.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.050
During and after World War II, Hollywood war
movies nearly universally featured brave men

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.421
whose causes always succeeded even if they
perished, and notable titles included: They

00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:43.530
Were Expendable (1945), Sands of Iowa Jima
(1949), The Flying Leathernecks (1951), Stalag

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.560
17 (1953), The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954),
The Longest Day (1962) and The Great Escape

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.750
(1963).

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.960
Likewise, films like From Here to Eternity
(1953), Mister Roberts (1955), South Pacific

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.640
(1958) and Operation Petticoat (1959) put
a positive human face on the war and its servicemen.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.470
And it is precisely this human face that led
author Lawrence Suid to coin the phrase “mutual

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.470
exploitation.”

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.470
According to Suid:

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.660
When I was getting my film degree it suddenly
occurred to me that people in the U.S. had

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.230
never seen the U.S. lose a war, and when President
Johnson said we can go into Vietnam and win,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.660
they believed him because they’d seen 50
years of war movies that were positive.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.900
So important was this relationship that since
the middle of the century, the Pentagon has

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.690
had a permanent liaison stationed in Hollywood,
and until 1989, that man was Donald Baruch.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.130
Having earned his chops as a theater producer
in New York, Baruch was given final script

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.720
approval on movies that needed military equipment
and personnel, and he asserted his authority.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.130
He insisted that the image projected of the
armed forces and its men be clean-cut and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.210
upright.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.040
After four decades at the post, Baruch was
replaced by Phil Strub, who had studied film

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.120
at the University of Southern California,
before developing a specialty in making movies

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.130
of medical procedures.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.150
He eventually made his way into the Army’s
medical research unit and worked as a Navy

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.980
videographer before moving into the entertainment
liaison post.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.599
Today, however, Strub is not alone in sifting
through scripts to determine which past muster.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.260
Service members from each branch are now stationed
in Los Angeles where they spend their days

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.970
studying television and film scripts, including
for shows like NCIS and Hawaii Five-O. Together

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.410
with Strub and the upper brass, their contributions
include everything from pitching ideas to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.460
ensuring the right equipment is employed.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.420
For example, the Secretary of the Navy was
reported to have persuaded NCIS to do an episode

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.209
on that branch’s efforts to stop sexual
assault.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.489
Likewise, Strub has claimed that he convinced
the producers of Jurassic Park III to re-write

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.470
their script to remove use of the Thunderbolt
warplane, (A-10), which was so overpowering

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.489
that in Strub’s estimation, it would have
“only generated sympathy for the dinosaurs.”

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.860
Of course, many war movies are made without
military help, and while some titles should

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.819
be expected, like Apocalypse Now (1979) and
The Thin Red Line (1998), others may be more

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.819
of a surprise.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.720
For example, help with Independence Day (1996)
was nixed because the invading alien’s overwhelming

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.730
technological superiority made the “military
appear impotent and/or inept.”

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.500
As a result, its battle equipment was produced
with methods such as CGI, as were some of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.419
the military crew in Zero Dark Thirty (2012).

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.979
It should be noted that although the military
gains a huge benefit from its positive portrayal

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.360
in films, it doesn’t spend any extra taxpayer
money on these projects.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.480
If the producers are directing personnel and
equipment outside of normal operations, they

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:57.340
pay the costs of operation (which can range
from $1,000/hour for a tank to $25,000/hour

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.340
for an F-15).

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.750
However, if all they want to do is film typical
activity that was happening anyway, once approved,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
they can do that gratis.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.229
Nonetheless, this is still a huge benefit
for movie-makers, who avoid the cost of CGI,

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.330
purchasing and leasing actual equipment and
Screen Actors Guild (SAG) minimum rates, since

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:25.680
“even in an age of special effects, it’s
exponentially cheaper to 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.619
film on actual military ships with real military
advisers.”
