ALI AFSHAR: Hi everyone.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.850
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.540
Today we're going to be talking
about the Google Drive

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.340
SDK Early Access Program.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.710
I'm joined today by Greg, and
my name is Ali, and we both

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.050
work on Google Drive Developer
Relations.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.960
So thank you for joining
in today.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.520
If you've attempted to come to
this video session in the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.400
past, you know that we've
actually failed

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.150
to put it on twice.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
So I'm figuring third
time lucky.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.230
And thanks for your patience
and thanks

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.060
for coming here today.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.070
I think this is evidence that
Google are capable of

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.820
recording a video and putting
it on the internet.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.530
So yes, yay, us.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.050
But anyway, thanks for coming.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.020
So what is the Early
Access Program?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.570
Well, we have a number of
features coming up with Google

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.400
Drive and we would like people
to use these in the real

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.890
world, real applications
to use them and give us

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240
recommendations on how
they should improve.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.280
We really take your feedback
seriously and we really need

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.500
to test this out in the real
world to see if the features

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.130
are what people need.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.940
I don't mean to test it as in
quality-- we test all the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.420
quality and make sure
everything works--

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.060
but we really want to know how
well this fits in with your

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.150
applications and whether it's
useful, how it could be more

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.140
useful, that kind of thing.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.060
GREG KNOKE: So what can
developers expect to see in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.550
the Early Access Program,
and what are the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.390
requirements for them?

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.040
ALI AFSHAR: So we will
take developers--

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.300
all kinds of developers,
actually.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.320
What they can expect is to be
part of the mailing list, have

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.290
access to all new features as
they come, so as they arrive,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.430
we indicate this, we send an
email to the mailing list and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.580
you'll know about it.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.200
And then you can be whitelisted

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.900
to use those features.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.420
So they're hidden to all
other developers.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.340
They won't be able
to use them.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.030
So that's what you'll see,
you'll see a regular stream of

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.340
new features added.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
What do we expect?

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.450
Well, we kind of expect
you to use them.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570
We hope that you will, and
that's the whole point of it.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.200
So there's no point in being on
the program if you're not

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.560
going to use the features
or you're not

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400
going to give us feedback.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.250
As I said, we're really
desperate to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.010
get this from you.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.410
So they'll be part of a list and
hopefully give us feedback

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960
after trying the features.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.830
GREG KNOKE: So what feature
should developers be most

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.260
excited about?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.020
What will they be able to
implement now that they

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.540
wouldn't have been able to
previously with their apps?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.580
ALI AFSHAR: So that's the other
side of it, and I'm glad

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.630
you raise that.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.380
This also gives your application
a jump on their

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.510
competition, really.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.150
So you get these features early
if you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.600
with Google Drive.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600
You'll be ready to launch this
feature to production when the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.700
feature itself launches
on Google Drive.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.390
So that gives you, I don't know,
a few month head start

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.780
over all the other
competitions.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.580
So that's the other benefit.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.290
What are the features we've
got at the moment?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.450
Well the first one is our
real-time collaborative API.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.430
We've spoken about
that in the past.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.060
It's a really cool thing, it
allows multiple locked-in

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.270
sessions to collaborate in
the same way that you can

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.050
collaborate over Google Docs
when you get the little cursor

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.390
that moves around the screen
telling you that Greg is also

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.110
editing this document.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.920
That framework is available as
a service for you to use on

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
your own files.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.960
All part of our commitment to
make your applications as good

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.250
and as complete and as
feature-rich as the Google

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.660
Docs applications.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.260
So that's the first one.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.730
The second one we've got going
at the moment is push

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.950
notifications, so when a file
changes in Google Drive we

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.380
will send your application a
notification of the change and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.630
then you can look up to see
what the changes happen.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.590
That's really, really important
for certain kinds of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.730
applications that are either
collaborative--

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.920
you want to see if someone
else has edited it--

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.740
or, for example, a synchronizing
or backup

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.450
application.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.380
You only want to perform
the backup when

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.460
something has changed.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.730
You don't want to keep
polling to see if the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.610
change has taken place.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.070
So you use push notifications.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.440
So we have the real-time
API, we have the push

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.940
notifications.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.190
And quite excitingly, the
features we're launching in

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.940
the next few weeks are all
based around using Google

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.780
Drive as a collaborative--

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.750
as an application platform
for your files.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.440
So what do I mean by that?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.640
We've added a way recently
to hide certain

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.000
files from the user.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.630
Your application will get a
folder of its own that is

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.640
something like a configuration
folder.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.890
The user owns it, so they can
delete it, but they can't look

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.840
at it and modify it.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.220
So that's perfect for putting
your configuration files or

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.200
any other files that are
associated with your

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.000
application that you don't
want user to edit--

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.700
backups of your applications
data from a mobile app would

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.880
be perfect use case for this.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.790
That's part of it.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.550
The other side of the apps
platform that we're building

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.840
is that you will have
the ability to

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.600
add data onto files.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.030
So you can decide, I
want to tag this

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.080
file with my own data.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.360
And that feature will be coming
soon and added to the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.620
Early Access Program.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.560
So rather than before when we
were going through individual

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.830
features and seeing who would
like to try this out, who

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.670
should we try this out, we're
opening this up to you.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.880
You can innovate how you like.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.490
We might not anticipate that you
would be interested in a

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.330
certain feature, so that's why
we're bringing them all

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.290
together and we're letting
you go for that.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.650
So push notifications, real-time
collaboration,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.420
application data, and meta data
associated with files.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.600
Those are the features
we've got at the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.990
moment, more to come.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.850
If you want to apply, you
need to go to our site--

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.680
developers.googl
e.com/drive/earlyaccess.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.710
One word, we'll publish
the link.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.350
There, you can fill
out a form.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.820
Thank you for all your
applications.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.080
As I said, we actually launched
this a few weeks ago

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.960
and we've only got round
to doing the video now.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.210
Thank you for your
applications--

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.050
we've had hundreds.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.420
So going through them, we have
quite strict criteria on the

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.810
kind of application that we
think would be suitable.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.020
So we're going through them and
we should have a response

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.610
for everyone by the
end of the week.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.000
So thank you very much.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.250
Those of you who haven't
applied, now is a really good

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.110
time to do it because we've all
got our reviewing hats on

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.640
so that will get done soon.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.500
So firstly, thank you.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.520
And secondly, we'll get back
to you soon, and thanks for

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.940
your patience.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.620
Right.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.780
Any questions, Greg?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.710
Anything to add?

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.770
GREG KNOKE: Sounds like
you covered it all.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.080
ALI AFSHAR: OK, brilliant,
right.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.000
Thank you all for coming.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.610
Again, sorry about the previous
videos that failed.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.310
And we'll see you soon on
Google Developers Live.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.550
Thank you.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.800
GREG KNOKE: Thank you.
