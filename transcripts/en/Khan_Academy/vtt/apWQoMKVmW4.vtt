00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's now parameterize
our surface.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.550
And then, we can figure out what
ds would actually look like.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.130
And so I will define my
position vector function

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.422
for our surface as r.

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:13.630
And I'm going to make it a
function of two parameters

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.750
because we're going to have
to define a surface right over

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.410
here.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.650
And I can actually use
x and y as my parameters

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.580
because the surface
can be defined

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.600
as a function of x and y.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.350
So I'll say that
my parameterization

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.700
is going to be a
function of x and y.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.210
And in my i direction,
it's going to be x times i.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.340
In my j direction, it's
going to be y times j.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.250
And then, in the k
direction, well, that's

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.370
just going to be z.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.180
And z is a function of x and y.

00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:47.750
And whenever you do a
parameterization of a surface,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.208
you have to think
about, well, what

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.909
are the constraints on the
domain for your parameters?

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.200
And so the constraints of
the domain for my parameters,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.310
I'm going to say that
every pair of xy-- every xy

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.540
coordinate-- it has
to be a member-- this

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.490
is the symbol for
member-- it has

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.180
to be a member of this little
region right over here.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.280
We could call this the
domain of the parameters.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.685
It has to be a member of r.

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:13.060
Actually, we assume
that up here.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.518
And actually, I
should have written

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:17.580
this as the coordinates
of xy-- the xy pairs that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.810
are a member of r-- that's going
to help define our surface.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.130
An xy that is not a
member of r, then we're

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.870
not going to consider
that the z of that

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.470
xy as part of the surface.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.150
Only the z of xy's where the
xy's are part of this region.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.030
So now that we have
a parameterization

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.290
for our surface,
we're ready to start

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.509
thinking about what ds might be.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.800
And we need to think about
this a little bit carefully.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.330
So first, I'll just
write something.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.210
And then, we can confirm whether
this really will be the case.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.550
ds-- and we've seen
this before about why

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.100
this is the case--
is going to be

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.630
the cross product of the partial
derivative of this with respect

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.680
to each of the parameters
times the little

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.970
chunk of area in that domain.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.820
You could view it as the partial
of r of this parameterization

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.540
with respect to x crossed with
the partial of r with respect

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.057
to y.

00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:19.890
And then, that whole
thing-- and we actually

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320
want this to be a
vector, not just

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.220
the absolute value or the
magnitude of this vector.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.920
We actually want
this to be a vector.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.810
That thing times-- we could
put in some order dx dy

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.715
or we could write dy dx.

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:32.090
And if we want to
be general just

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640
to say that it's a little
differential of our region

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340
right over here,
we can just write--

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.650
instead of writing dx dy or
dy dx-- we will write da.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.810
And the reason why I said
we need to be careful

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.470
is we need to make sure, based
on how we've parameterized

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.030
this position vector function,
based on how we parameterized

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.949
it, whether this cross
product really points

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.490
in the right direction,
the direction

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.450
that we need to be oriented in.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.150
Because, remember,
if we're traversing

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.220
a boundary like
this, we want to make

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.384
sure that the surface is
oriented the right way.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.800
And the way we
think about-- if we

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.540
were to twist a cap like
this, the cap would move up.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140
Or if you were to walk around
this boundary in this direction

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.090
with the surface to your left,
your head would point up.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.680
And so we need to make sure
that this vector, which really

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.720
defines the orientation
of the surface,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.120
is definitely going to be
pointed up or above the surface

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.059
as opposed to going
below the surface.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.850
And so let's think
about that a little bit.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.110
The partial derivative
with respect to x-- well,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.240
as x gets bigger,
it's going to go

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.660
in that direction
along the surface.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.410
And the partial with respect
to y, as y gets bigger,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.495
it's going to go in that
direction along the surface.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:50.830
If I take r cross y-- and we
could use the right-hand rule

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.370
here.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.560
We put our index
finger in the direction

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.960
of the first thing we're
taking the cross product of,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.350
our middle finger in the
direction of the second thing.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.180
So just like that.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.160
We bend our middle finger.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.710
We don't care what the
other fingers are doing.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.168
So I'll just draw
them right there.

00:04:04.168 --> 00:04:07.270
Then, the thumb will go in the
direction of the cross product.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.930
So in this case, the thumb
is going to point up.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.910
And that's exactly what
we wanted to happen.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.490
So this actually is
the right ordering.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.404
The partial with respect to y
cross the partial with respect

00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:20.070
to x actually would
not have been right.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.028
That would have given us
the other orientation.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.070
We would have done that
if this boundary actually

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.560
went the other way around.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.010
But this is the right
orientation given the way

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.520
that we are going to
traverse the boundary.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.080
Now, with that out
of the way, let's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.240
actually calculate
this cross product.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.040
So let me just rewrite it.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.430
So this is going to
be equal to-- well,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.410
I'll just focus on the
cross product right now.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.345
The partial of r with respect to
x crossed with the partial of r

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:53.576
with respect to y is
going to be equal to--

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:55.200
and we've done this
many times already.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.910
We'll just do it in
more general terms now.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.930
It's going to be equal
to the determinant

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.400
of this matrix-- i, j, and k.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.900
Let me do those in
different colors.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.430
I think that's a helpful
way of thinking about it.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.510
So i, j, and k.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.660
Actually, I'll use
this magenta color.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.180
i, j, and k.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.290
Let me write this
line right over here.

00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:32.440
We want to write the different
components of the partial

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.750
with respect to x.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.450
And so the partial of the i
component with respect to x

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.120
is just going to be 1.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.310
The partial of the j
component with respect to x

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.040
is going to be 0.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.870
And the partial of
this with respect to x,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.036
well, we can just write
that as a partial derivative

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:51.780
of the function z
with respect to x.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.670
And so r sub x-- or the
partial with respect

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.210
to x-- is the vector 1, i
plus 0, j plus z sub x, k.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.140
And we'll do the same thing
for this piece right over here.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.160
The partial with respect
to y-- it's i component,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.100
well, this is going to be 0.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.140
It's j component
is going to be 1.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.270
The partial of this
with respect to y is 1.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.120
And the partial of
this with respect to y

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.930
is the partial of z
with respect to y.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.690
And actually, I forgot to
write k right over here

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.480
in our parameterization.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.520
So now with all
of this set up, we

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.170
are ready to figure out
what the cross product is.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.590
The cross product is going to
be equal to-- so our i component

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.810
is going to be 0 times
the partial with respect

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.870
to y minus 1 times the partial
of z with respect to x.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.420
So we get negative partial
of z with respect to x.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.570
And then, checkerboard pattern.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.730
We'll have minus j times--
so ignore that column, that

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.750
row-- 1 times the partial
with respect to y.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.740
So that's z sub y--
the partial of z

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.360
with respect to y--
minus 0 times this.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.400
So we're just left with
that right over there.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.470
And then, finally, we're
going to have plus k.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.070
And here we have 1
times 1 minus 0 times 0.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.720
So it's going to be k times 1.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.240
So we can just
write k over there.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.770
And so we can write,
the cross product really

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:35.360
is just equal to negative z sub
x times i minus z sub y times

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.930
j plus k.
