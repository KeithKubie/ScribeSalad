Intro
We may all try to stay polite in our day to

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.519
day lives for survival, if nothing else, but
when we go to the movies, there's nothing

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.939
more satisfying than seeing the bad guy get
what's coming to him.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.570
But a good movie hero doesn't need bullets
or explosions to reduce their enemies to ash:

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.230
sometimes, all it takes is a brutal insult.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.199
Whether the audience is left just as stunned,
laughing in their seats, or quoting the same

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.810
slams for the rest of their lives, crafting
a truly crushing one-liner is an artform,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.930
not a science.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.070
That's a fact proven with our look at 20 Movies
With The Most Savage Insults of All Time.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.360
Anchorman
Whether you're on live television, or insulting

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.310
a loved one, Ron Burgundy knows the answer
is always saying the first thing that comes

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:57.660
to mind - but be prepared to take some shots
in return.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.690
Or if you're Brick Tamland, just make sure
you sell a half-baked insult with a condescending

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.330
smile (and friend to back you up).

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.579
Gran Torino
In Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood seems to do

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.960
more damage with his mouth, than with his
automatic weapons:

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.840
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
It's the movie that helped get Robert Downey

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:36.520
Jr. back into the spotlight, but it's co-star
Val Kilmer who dishes out the best insults.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.579
The Mist
Who says a Stephen King horror movie can't

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:48.960
find room for one of the simplest, rudest
digs from the person you'd least expect it?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590
Knocked Up
We usually expect that rudest mood swings

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.579
from the pregnant character, but this stream
of insults on the outside of a velvet rope

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.369
works no matter who's saying it.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.819
Good Will Hunting
It's not easy to use a goofy pun to crush

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.430
somebody into dust, but Matt Damon found a
way with one of the most quoted digs ever

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.170
delivered in a Boston accent.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.000
Snatch
Does an insult need to make sense to put the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.690
fear of God into someone?

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.890
This line from Guy Ritchie puts the idea to
the test.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.300
Gangs of New York
Daniel Day-Lewis wins an Oscar almost every

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.030
time he disappears into a role.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.330
But as "Bill The Butcher," every time he spoke
his mind was an award in itself.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.060
Christmas Vacation
Clark W. Griswold has a famous temper, but

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.090
it took the holidays to truly push him over
the edge, using his words like every father

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.610
should aspire to.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.820
Glengarry Glenross
Almost every sentence out of Al Pacino's mouth

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.220
sounds like a one-liner, but in Glengarry
Glenross, he turned insults into an artform.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.820
Uncle Buck
John Candy isn't known for a harsh temper,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:25.680
but most of us were too young to appreciate
the brutal insult from Uncle Buck.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.230
As Good As It Gets
Playing a famous author, Jack Nicholson showed

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.140
why his character couldn't tell the difference
between being clever, and insulting half the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.730
population of Earth.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.650
Blade Trinity
Long before the Merc With the Mouth, Ryan

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.040
Reynolds was taking on vampires with Blade's
help - and delivering dozens of Deadpool-worthy

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.480
lines along the way.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.260
Con Air
Even murderers have their limits - but if

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.400
you really want to insult a fellow inmate,
get as disgusting and relatable as possible:

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.790
"For me, you're somewhere between a cockroach
and that white stuff that accumulates at the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.270
corner of your mouth when you're really thirsty."

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.350
Clueless
Hardened criminals or foul-mouthed men don't

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:19.350
have anything on the teenage girls in this
classic, with lines that still make us wince.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.340
Home Alone
Sometimes, an insult is just for the audience

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.960
to enjoy - and repeat to themselves, and their
friends, for the rest of their lives.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.910
Bull Durham
There are classic insults, and then there

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:42.800
are the ones we'll never be able to deliver
like the stars - but we can dream, Mr. Costner.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.120
Ghostbusters
Two heads are better than one, and if duo

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:58.260
dissing was an Olympic sport, there's no question
Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd take home the gold.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.980
The Departed
You can insult people by disrespecting all

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.480
they stand for, or just by being clever.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:11.320
But if you're Mark Wahlberg, why not do both
at the same time?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.610
Wayne's World
Garth may not get much credit for his brains,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:26.030
but Wayne's World saw him deliver one of the
most polished movie metaphors we've ever heard.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.930
Deadpool
Deadpool is one anti hero who is not afraid

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.090
to shoot you in the head - or cut down some
of the most well-known X-Men with some truly

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.340
choice words: "If I ever decide to become
a crime-fighting shit swizzler, who rooms

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.210
with a bunch of other little whiners at Neverland
Mansion with some creepy, old, bald, Heaven’s

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.440
Gate-looking motherfucker… on that day,
I’ll send your shiny, happy ass a friend

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440
request."

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.590
Those are some of our favorite one-liners
and crushing insults that put movie villains

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.750
in their place, but which are your favorites?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.770
Should a truly great movie insult be impossible
not to recite among friends, or are the best

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.810
too good to ever imitate?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.810
