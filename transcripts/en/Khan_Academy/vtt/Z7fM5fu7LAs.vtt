00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm on problem number seven.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.250
Josephine's daily exercise
routine consists of swimming,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.720
cycling, and running
in that order.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.660
So swimming, cycling, and
running in that order.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:23.340
She runs faster than she swims,
and cycles faster than

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.990
she runs, like most people.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.900
If she does not rest between the
activities, which of the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.580
following could be the graph
of the distance she covers

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.650
during the entire time of
her exercise routine?

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.460
So I'm not going to even
look at the choices.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.060
And I'll just give you an
intuition and then you can

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.150
look for the choices
that match it.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:52.030
So if I were to graph distance
versus time, the slope of my

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.980
line is going to be
my speed, right?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.830
Because what is speed?

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.570
It's distance per time.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.550
And that's the same
thing as slope.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.320
It's rise over run.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.700
So in this context, that would
be the slope of the line.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.180
So what you want is a situation
where she swims

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.460
first-- which is her slowest--
then she cycles-- which is her

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
fastest-- then she runs-- which
is kind of in between.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.020
So what you're going to have
is a low slope, then a very

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.680
high slope, and then you want
kind of a medium slope.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.550
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.990
Because she swims first, so
that's the slowest exercise,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050
so maybe it'll be like that.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.693
Then she cycles, which is her
fastest exercise, so maybe it

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:28.180
will look something like that.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.250
And then she runs, which is
kind of an in-between

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.390
exercise, so maybe it looks
something like this.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.460
So which of the choices
looks like that?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.630
Where you start relatively
slow, you peak out pretty

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.090
fast, and then you do something
that looks a little

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.300
bit faster-- that has a higher
slope than this.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.730
And if I look at all
of the choices, it

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.040
looks like choice E.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.230
Choice E is actually pretty
close to what I drew.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.880
If you look at the other
choices, choice A she goes

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.960
slow, then medium, then fast.
So that's like if she cycled

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630
last, right?

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.920
In choice B she does her slow
thing last. That looks like

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.690
she's swimming last. Choice C
looks like she's swimming last

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.780
as well, because that's the
slowest. And then choice D

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.620
looks like she cycles, then
she swims, then she runs.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.390
So it's definitely choice E.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.150
You go slow, fast,
and then medium.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.400
Next problem.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.510
Problem eight.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.000
In the xy-coordinate systems,
square root of 6-- sorry, the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.600
point is square root of 6 comma
k-- is one of the points

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.075
of intersection of the graphs.

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.820
So these are the graphs.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.560
y is equal to x squared minus
7, and y is equal to minus x

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.890
squared plus j.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.640
Fair enough.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.860
Where j is a constant.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.930
What is the value of j?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.490
So we know the x-coordinate
where it intersects, right?

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.200
We know it intersects
at square root of 6.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.590
So intersection means that the
y values are the same for a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.670
given x value.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.210
That's what intersects.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.810
So we can set these two
equations equal to each other.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.080
So we could say, x squared--
we could set the y values

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.640
equal to each other-- x squared
minus 7 is equal to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.860
this: minus x squared plus j.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.940
Now we could keep things in
terms of x or we could-- well

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.690
let's just algebraically play
with this a little bit.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.300
And I hope you understand that
this is what we would do to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.700
solve for the intersection of
these two graphs, if we wanted

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.495
to solve for the x value.

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:40.960
And we could play with
this a little bit.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.010
We could add x squared
to both sides.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.530
You get 2x squared minus
7 is equal to j.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.340
And what's x?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.640
We know where these intersect.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.570
We know one of the points
where they intersect is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.930
square root of 6.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.150
So let's input-- let's replace
x with square root of 6.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.610
So 2 times square root of 6
squared minus 7 is equal to j.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.185
What's the square root
of 6 squared?

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:10.660
It's just 6, right?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.540
So it's 2 times 6 minus
7 is equal to j.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.079
So 12 minus 7 is equal to j.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.810
5 is equal to j.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.250
And that is choice A.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.210
Problem nine.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.850
If the absolute value of 2 minus
x is less than 3, which

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.270
of the following is a
possible value of x?

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.030
So this means that 2 minus
x is less than 3.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.840
Right?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.950
So I guess the way you can
think about is that the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.070
difference between 2 and
x is going to be

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.750
less than 3, right?

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.030
The other way you could view
it is that the negative of

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.920
this-- x minus 2-- is going
to be less than 3.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.520
Right?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.140
We could have also said 2
minus x is greater than

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.140
negative 3.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.470
That's the other thing we
could have written.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.080
And what I did is I just-- this
is either going to be a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.970
positive or a negative, right?

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.350
So if it's a positive, we just
say 2 minus x is less than 3.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.030
If x is going to be greater than
2, then we could say that

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.930
x minus 2 is less than 3.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.390
Because then it would be a
negative number and then it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.636
would become positive.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:36.420
Hope I didn't confuse you.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.220
So if this is true you would
get-- let's see-- you would

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.840
get, if I were to add x to both
sides I'd get 2 is less

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.050
than 3 plus x.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.020
Subtract 3 from both sides.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.040
You get negative 1
is less than x.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.360
This one, add 2 to both sides.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.110
You get x is less than 5.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.670
So x is greater than negative
1 and it is less than 5.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:11.840
So if you look at all of the
choices-- it has to be less

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.750
than 5 and greater than negative
1-- so out of all of

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.170
those choices, the only choice
that is less than 5 is choice

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.340
A, which is 4.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.410
And you could look at it.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.990
You could actually just
try out the numbers.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.770
And frankly, even if you got
confused by absolute value,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.250
you could have just tried
each of the choices.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.890
2 minus 4 is minus 2.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.280
The absolute value of negative
2 is just 2, which

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.070
is less than 3.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.150
So that's right.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.970
So you could have actually just
tried out the choices if

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:43.620
this confused you.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.160
And that actually might have
been faster because in the

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.240
worst case, you'd have to try
out five choices and each of

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.770
them would have taken a few
seconds to evaluate.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.700
But sometimes it's good to
do it mathematically.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.840
But I wouldn't wrong you for--
I wouldn't blame you for just

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.040
trying things out as well.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.840
Ten.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.560
OK.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.410
If all interior angles of the
polygon are congruent, then x

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.450
is equal to-- OK so this
is interesting.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.120
All of the angles of this
polygon are congruent.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.985
So it's a pentagon.

00:07:13.985 --> 00:07:24.790
So it's 1, 2-- like that--
3, 4, and 5.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.260
I didn't draw really
that congruent.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.395
And actually this line keeps
going like this.

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.490
And the important thing to
realize with any of these

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.460
triangles is, if I were to
draw-- there's a formula for

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.750
the angles of a polygon, but I
always-- so the way to think

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:49.920
about it is that these are all
going to be equal angles.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.490
So think of it this way.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.840
These are five equal
triangles.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.990
Let me think of it
the best way.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.880
So they're telling us-- we
want to figure out what x

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.050
degrees is, right?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.720
Well this x degrees
is going to be the

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.000
same as this x degrees.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.080
And how do I know that?
