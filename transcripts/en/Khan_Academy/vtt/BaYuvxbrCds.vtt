00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.020
A reflection acting on
the coordinate plane

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.000
takes point G to
point H and point

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.100
S to point T. What is
the line of reflection?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.970
So the line of
reflection is going

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.040
to look something like that.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.150
And it's going to go through
the midpoints of H and G,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.250
which is going to be
someplace over there,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.960
and the midpoint
of S and T, which

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.860
is going to be some
place over there.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.572
And I'm drawing it
very imprecisely.

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:35.030
And the way we
think about it, when

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.490
we take the reflection of
G over this line you would

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.300
drop a perpendicular and
then go the same distance

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.190
on the other side to get
the point H. Similarly--

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.720
I can never say
that word-- if we

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.220
were to take the reflection
of S around that line

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.010
we would drop a perpendicular
to that midpoint

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.970
and then keep going
the same distance to T.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.180
So let's think about
what these midpoints are,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.770
and actually I'll clear this
right now just so that I can

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.930
draw it a little
bit more precisely.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.970
So let's clear that.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.030
And so H is at the
point 2, negative 2.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.320
G is at the point negative
2 comma negative 6.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.060
So what's the midpoint?

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.844
Well, the midpoint
is going to be

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.260
the midpoint of
the x-coordinates.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.570
2 plus negative 2
is 0, over 2 is 0.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.360
So the x-coordinate
is going to be 0.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.960
The y-coordinate, the average
of negative 2 and negative 6

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.200
is negative 4.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.390
So our midpoint is going
to be right over here.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.630
It's the point 0, negative 4.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.080
Now let's think about the
midpoint of these two points.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.600
S is at the point 1.5 comma 5.5.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.480
And T is at the point negative
9.5 comma negative 5.5.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.180
So the midpoint is going to be
1.5 plus negative 9.5 over 2.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
That's the x-coordinate.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.810
I just took the average of
these two x-coordinates.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.850
And the y-coordinate is going
to be 5.5 plus negative 5.5

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.720
over 2.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.645
So what is this?

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:17.130
This is 1.5 plus negative
9.5 is negative 8 over 2.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.290
So that is negative 4 comma 0.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.300
So their midpoint is at the
point negative 4 comma 0.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.285
So that point right over there.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.300
Let me just write this.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.760
This is negative 4 comma 0.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.330
So the line of
reflection is going

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.145
to be the line that goes
through both of these points.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.200
And we can write it in the
traditional slope intercept

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.810
form, y is equal to mx plus b.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.600
So let's figure out its slope.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900
Let's figure out the slope
between these two points,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.130
to go from negative 4
comma 0 to 0, negative 4.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.770
Well, to go between those
two points, our change in y--

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.210
Actually, let me do this
in a different color

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.310
just to ease the monotony.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.180
So our change in y over
here is negative 4.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.970
As we go from this point
to that point we go 4 down,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.510
and our change in x is
equal to positive 4.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.520
So m, which is our change
in y over change in x,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.270
we see that when we
increased our x by 4,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.600
our y went down by 4, so
the slope is negative 1.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.780
And now let's think about
what the y-intercept is.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.863
Well we already know that.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:49.850
When x is equal to
0, y is equal to b.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.850
But we see over here
that this point is there.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.150
So when x is equal to
0, y is negative 4.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.530
So this is negative 4.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.230
So the equation of
our line of reflection

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.430
is y is equal to negative
1x, or I could just

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.690
write negative x minus 4.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.310
That's our line of reflection.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.390
Now they ask us what
are the coordinates

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.843
of the image of point
negative 2 comma negative 2

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:16.720
under this reflection?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.530
So the point negative
2 comma negative 2,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.380
that's this point
right over here.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.860
That sits on the
line of reflection.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.030
When x is equal to negative
2, negative negative 2

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.680
is positive 2, minus
4 is negative 2.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.530
This sits on this
line of reflection.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.590
So the coordinates of
the image of this point

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.090
under the reflection,
well it's just

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.250
going to map back to itself.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.480
It's going to be negative
2 comma negative 2.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.570
Anything that's on the line of
reflection, when you reflect it

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.160
across that line, since
it sits on that line,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.598
it's just going to
map back to itself.
