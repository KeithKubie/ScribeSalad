00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.650
CLIFF REDEKER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.830
Welcome to another amazing
Talks at Google event.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490
My name is Cliff Redeker
and I have the privilege

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.280
of discussing today
the new film out

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.510
called "Score," which is a
journey through the history

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.180
of film composing
and the interplay

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.562
between the visual
medium and the audio.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.020
And we're very
thrilled today to be

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.140
joined by both the
director, Matt Schrader,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.880
as well as one of the
composers featured

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.595
in the film, Joe Kramer.

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.720
So I'd like to invite them
both to join me on stage

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.661
and we'll have a few questions.

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:42.545

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.926
CLIFF REDEKER: Great.

00:00:47.926 --> 00:00:49.300
I think you'll
have to hit the on

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.850
button just on the
side there, just

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.830
to make sure that we're live.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.870
So I was wondering if
you could first tell me

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.540
a little bit about the film--
what the inspirations were,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.390
and probably most
importantly, since it's

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.580
a film about music film
composition, how did

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.080
you score the score?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.820
MATT SCHRADER: Yeah, we jumped
into this as, really, fans--

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.420
somewhat educated fans,
but not that educated.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.540
And we thought it would
be worthwhile to take

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.680
a plunge into this topic.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.520
It's something that
kind of amazingly

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.370
had not been done
before as a documentary.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.880
And we had several conversations
about a lot of this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.520
and realized there's
an incredible depth--

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.060
obviously, it's
such an immersive,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.500
kind of creative art
form in the first place.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.770
But it hasn't really--

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.790
hasn't really been
dived into before.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.470
And so we actually wanted to
try to allow some of the great

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.620
examples of film scores
throughout the years,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.950
throughout decades-- the really,
last 100 years probably--

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.910
be the focal point, the
thing that we share.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.890
We came into this
thinking we probably

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.320
don't need an original score.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.540
At the end, we realized
we kind of did.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.199
We needed something to at least
fill a few different areas

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.650
where it made a lot of
sense, especially where we're

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.330
explaining something that
needs something to carry

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.490
that just a little bit.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.740
But I think that's largely it.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.420
We wanted the
focal point of this

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.270
to really be the work over the
last many, many decades that

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.050
have made a big impact
on-- not just musicians,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.812
not just people in film,
but also all of pop culture.

00:02:34.812 --> 00:02:35.770
CLIFF REDEKER: Exactly.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.519
And I also want to
delve a little bit more

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.680
into the art form as well.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.660
If you approach it as one of the
largest employers of orchestras

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.870
these days, it's definitely
in the classical tradition.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.290
But at the same time,
how did that diverge

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.670
from pure classical music?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.140
You have Handel's
water music, you

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.200
have a few big capital
letter composers

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.090
that compose for
film, that then seems

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.440
to have split a little bit.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.023
And now it's actually
on the way back,

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:03.640
where you have Nobue
Uematsu in concert,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.190
or Hans Zimmer in an auditorium.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.595
So how did that journey happen?

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:09.220
JOE KRAMER: Well, I
think what happened

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.910
is that we saw a
decline in attendance

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.140
in classical orchestra concerts.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.170
So city orchestras
across America

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.590
were seeing radical
drops in attendance.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.450
At the same time,
the young concert

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.610
goers that they were
trying to attract

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.980
were interested
in seeing concerts

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.181
with music from "The Legend
of Zelda" or "Final Fantasy."

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:37.930
And that's where I
first saw it happening,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.520
was with video games.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.980
And so you'd go
to a concert hall,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.050
and there'd be the
audience filled

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.760
with people dressed as Link.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.820
You know what I mean?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.790
And they'd be there
to hear the score

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.470
from the Wind Waker performed
live with a symphony orchestra.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.950
And then at the 20th
anniversary of "E.T.,"

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.170
Williams did the
score live to picture.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.630
And it was the first time I'd
seen it done in a concert,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.650
ever.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.830
And it was a huge success
and it took a while

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.930
for all the studios'
legal departments

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.900
to make all the arrangements
but that became another thing.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.590
And so what we're seeing
now, the next step

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.040
was doing an entire
film live to picture.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.050
And the New York
Philharmonic is getting

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.050
ready to do four Star
Wars movies this fall.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.610
The Hollywood Bowl
every summer is doing--

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.090
last summer I think they did
"E.T." and "Harry Potter."

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.010
They're doing two or
three movies a year.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.395
I saw them do "2001"
live, which was amazing.

00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.520
John Williams, as the
conductor of the Boston Pops,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.270
was always incorporating
specially adapted suites

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.000
of his film music
into the show--

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.110
into the shows.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.350
And you saw once in a while,
like, "Gone with the Wind"

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.730
would be on a program.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.650
But they were
usually Pops concerts

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.810
that were divided from
the classical thing.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.610
And what I would think would
be interesting would be,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.320
that in a way, the classic--

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.170
they start sneaking
a classical piece

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.616
into one of these concerts
that's video game music.

00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.990
It wouldn't-- it would be
harder to do in a concert where

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.032
they're showing the film.

00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:10.490
But if you just
had a concert where

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.240
it was like two hours of music
from all the Star Wars movies,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.940
without visual,
and then you said,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.530
we're going to
throw some Mars in,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.780
some of the planets in there--

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.510
[INAUDIBLE] you know.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.440
That could be an interesting way
to then reignite kid's interest

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.780
in the classical composers.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.060
I mean, the challenge
is that the language

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.250
of contemporary film
music is so radically

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.060
different from the language
of classical music.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.930
There's a big gulf between the
kind of melodic contrapuntal

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.850
writing that
Beethoven was doing,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.100
and what you're hearing in
"Pirates of the Caribbean."

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.420
it's like Mitchell Loeb says.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.520
It's Led Zeppelin
with an orchestra.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.137
CLIFF REDEKER: And then also
I think it separates the art

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:52.720
form, as well.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.980
Like, composing for film
has inherent constraints

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.740
by definition.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.570
The movie is only so long.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.190
You're tying it
into certain clips.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.880
How do you work within
that constraint, expand it?

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.670
And then if you're doing
a suite or re-arrangement,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.480
what's your approach when you
cut out the visual component?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.620
JOE KRAMER: Well, Yeah.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.020
People always marvel at
how much John Williams

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.690
music works on its own terms.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.490
But-- and it's not to put it
down, he's sort of-- for me,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.760
he's sort of the
pinnacle of the art form.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.321
He makes specific
arrangements for concerts.

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:27.070
And they're versions
that you don't really

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.680
ever hear in the movie the way
you hear them at Symphony Hall.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.190
You know what I mean?

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.300
It's almost like making a hit
single out of a Broadway show,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.180
where the song is never
performed that way in the show

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.090
but you've made a single
of it for the radio.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.620
What was the--

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.350
CLIFF REDEKER: How you work
within the constraint itself?

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.830
JOE KRAMER: So, yeah--

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.590
CLIFF REDEKER: You
know, two hours--

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.320
JOE KRAMER: To me,
it's not a constraint.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.630
For me, actually, it's
a helpful skeleton

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.550
to hang musical ideas on.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.820
So say for example, in
"Mission Impossible,"

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.565
there's a sequence where
Ethan Hunt, played by Tom--

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.200
the opening scene where
he jumps on the wing

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.870
of that airplane and then
hangs on to it as it takes off.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.840
You have these sort of
signposts along the way

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.070
that guide, and for me
inform, the structure

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.270
of what I'm writing.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.010
So we have the studio cards
at the very beginning that

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.910
say Paramount Pictures, Sky
Dance Pictures, et cetera, et

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.430
cetera, Bad Robot.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.140
And then we have the
shot of the field.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.847
And then Benji pops up.

00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:32.430
And then conversation begins and
we're cutting back and forth.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.190
And all of those
events become markers

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.060
in my timeline in the computer
that I use to write my music.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.350
And it becomes sort of a
binary process of saying, well,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.420
is it fast or slow?

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.430
Is it brass or strings?

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.420
Is it light or dark?

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.215
Is it funny or tense?

00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:51.840
And before I know
it, I go, OK, so I've

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.080
got to write 12 seconds of funny
string medium tempo music--

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.580
go.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.580
And then-- and then--
but when you have that--

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.585
when you have a set of criteria
that you have to satisfy,

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:07.710
you know-- as programmers,
you would all know that.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.780
If you've got to make
a little applet that

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.070
does this specific
thing, you've got that.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.290
And in just the
same way that you

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.620
have APIs built into
however you're programming,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.920
and dialog boxes that
are built into the OS,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.020
I've got those tricks
in music that I

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.660
know will let me communicate.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.230
Because what I'm trying to do
is communicate to the audience--

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.530
essentially, a score is
a second language track

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.960
that you're hearing
underneath the dialogue.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.159
And it's telling the story.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.770
And it's informing the
audience of connections

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.990
between characters, of
where we are in the world,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.850
of how we're supposed to
be interpreting what we're

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.930
seeing on an emotional level.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.630
And I'm trying to get at your
subconscious using a shorthand

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.026
that's been developed--

00:08:57.026 --> 00:08:59.640
CLIFF REDEKER: It triggers
the emotional reaction, yeah.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.320
And of course, thank you for
calling programming an art.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.350
We like to think it's
an art here, too.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.980
So mission accomplished.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.570
But--

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.090
JOE KRAMER: Don't say that.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.340
CLIFF REDEKER: But then
I was also curious too,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.570
if you could describe just the
general process when you're--

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.640
are you approached
to score these films?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.586
Like is there-- are there
auditions or demo reel?

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:21.960
Like, what's the--
how does it go

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.510
from a germ of an idea to you at
the piano to you in the studio?

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.270
JOE KRAMER: Ideally,
what happens is,

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.760
somebody has heard music that
I've done for another film

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.050
and they're just
so in love with it

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.424
that they've got
to have me score

00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:36.704
their movie no matter what.

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:39.120
And they call me and say, we
want you to score this movie.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960
That never happens.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.517
What happens is, I hear
that they're making a movie

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:45.600
and I go, I think I'd like
to try to work on that.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.426
And I-- either I call them
directly or through my agent,

00:09:48.426 --> 00:09:50.550
we reach out to them and
see if they're interested,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.010
if they've hired somebody.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.890
It's not a business that is--

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.160
oddly enough, it's not a
career that is really driven

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.290
by the person who's doing it.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.240
I can't force a director to
hire me to score their movie.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.950
And I don't have the
means at my disposal

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.170
to write and direct
and make movies,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.530
just so I could score them.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.390
So I'm sort of at the mercy
of the people who are hiring.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.860
And in my experience, that's
principally directors.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.160
Studio executives obviously
play a part in that,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.970
producers play a part in that.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.270
In the case of
"Mission Impossible,"

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.650
Tom Cruise played
a part in that,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.220
because the franchise
is his baby.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.410
But ultimately, it was--

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.810
Chris McQuarrie is the
director of that film--

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.850
that made the decision.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.320
And similarly, I did the
score for "Jack Reacher"

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.050
with Chris McQuarrie.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.640
Tom-- Chris loved the
score, Tom loved the score.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.740
By all accounts,
everybody loved the score.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.810
When Ed Zwick was
approached to direct

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.780
the sequel, the first
thing he told everybody is,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.750
I don't want to bring anybody
back from the first movie.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.960
If I take this job, I want
to have a fresh start.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.010
Which means no-- new
photographer, new editor,

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.470
new production design, new
costume design, new composer.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.530
And no matter how much
I wanted to do the film

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.850
and how much maybe
even Tom or Sky

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.980
Dance or Paramount would
have liked me to do the film,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.690
it was the director's call.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.840
CLIFF REDEKER: Interesting.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.298
And I think it's also worth
pointing out that a lot of this

00:11:25.298 --> 00:11:28.624
comes under very short notice
from the time you get the call.

00:11:28.624 --> 00:11:30.540
You're in the studio
within a matter of weeks.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.810
You're recording it
within a matter of weeks.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.950
How do you work under those
deadlines and stay creative?

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.610
JOE KRAMER: You eat a lot.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.510
So there's-- and then
when you're not working,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.430
you drink a lot.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.320
There's a certain element
of craftsmanship to it.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.710
We all have in our brain,
maybe, the perfect game

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.240
that we want to
create for Chrome.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.540
We all have the idea of what
would be the perfect Google

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.640
App for the title page.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.360
And then when we get the call
to do it, we're suddenly like,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.860
I don't--

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.620
I don't know what to do.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.690
I had all these
great ideas and now

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.064
I suddenly can't
think what would

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.110
be the perfect game
for me to define myself

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.830
as a programmer for
the Google title page.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.830
You know what I mean?

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.410
Similarly, with composing,
I have all these ideas

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.770
and then I get the call and
it's a movie that I never

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.182
thought I would be asked to
work on, or a kind of music.

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.390
I'm like, how did they hear
what I've done and think,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.480
this is what I--

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.230
I'm the guy for this?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.310
What's nice is, it frees
up your thinking because

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.440
in any creative endeavor,
what you're trying to do

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.350
is get past the censor in your
head that saying that's dumb,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.990
that's stinks, that's
not going to work.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.950
So you're-- I I'm--

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.580
and I have the, like I said,
the craftsmanship tricks

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:59.140
or sparks, help spark my
memory, or my creative thinking,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.520
that I can rely on.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.320
Like, the binary decision--
fast, slow, light, dark, happy,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.710
sad.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.545
There's a whole evil concept
lurking beneath the whole film

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:14.420
world which the film
doesn't really get into,

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.140
which is temporary music
that's been cut into the film.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.520
And oftentimes that
can be instructive.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.730
It can also be hand-cuffs,
but at its best,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.070
it's instructive
in helping people

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.695
talk about something that's hard
to talk about, which is music.

00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:32.570
CLIFF REDEKER: And we
actually had a question

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.400
from Dave down in our
Los Angeles office

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.060
with that very same idea,
the idea of temp tracks.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.280
And what do you do
when the director says,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.370
I really love the temp track.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.330
Make something like it.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.260
Or-- how do you still infuse
your own voice into something

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.237
that you didn't
necessarily make yourself?

00:13:50.237 --> 00:13:52.070
JOE KRAMER: I don't
mean to be monopolizing,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.500
so any time you want
an answer, just--

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.375
MATT SCHRADER: No, you
take the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.350
JOE KRAMER: You nudge me.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.990
Well, I'm not a lawyer.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.230
And I trust the
production to have lawyers

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.950
that can vet what I submit.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:15.740
But there are aspects of
music that you can seize upon.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.240
Because what you're
trying to get at

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.320
is the feeling that
the music is creating.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.350
There was sort of a famous
lawsuit in the early

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:32.110
'80s against the video
game Jawbreaker, which--

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.520
Namco, I think, accused
of ripping off Pac-Man.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.540
And their argument
was essentially,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.980
if it feels like
you're playing--

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.545
even if it's not the little
yellow guy and it's not ghosts,

00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:46.510
if it feels like
you're playing Pac-Man,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.420
aren't you infringing
on our copyright?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.130
And I can't remember how
that thing was solved.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.830
What you have to do with
music is sort of go,

00:14:54.830 --> 00:15:00.330
what are the elements that I can
emulate without getting sued?

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.350
So chord changes-- you can't
copyright chord changes.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.960
Otherwise, every
single blues artist

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.690
would be suing every
other single blues artist.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.110
You can't copyright rhythm,
or else "Happy Birthday"

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.220
and "The Star-spangled Banner"
would be suing each other,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.270
because--

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.280
like, legend has
it, Robert Kennedy

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.810
was so tone deaf
that he couldn't

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.060
tell if it was the national
anthem or "Happy Birthday"

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.518
unless they were
singing the words.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.750
You can't copyright
what key something is,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.580
or what tempo it is.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.060
So right there, you've got
tempo, chord changes, key,

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.137
and rhythm.

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.970
Now obviously, if you
did all four of those,

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.540
you'd be really
pushing your luck.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.000
But those are four
aspects that you

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.470
can examine in a piece of
temp, and say, how can I

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.170
utilize those in
one way or another

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.700
to create the same feeling.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.440
CLIFF REDEKER: And you're also
interjecting your own expertise

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.940
as well.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.500
You can say like,
this works out OK.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.790
Here's how I want to
plus or expand it, or--

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:01.540
JOE KRAMER: Right.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.456
Well, and the other thing
is thematic writing,

00:16:03.456 --> 00:16:06.780
which I think helps a lot
because if you have themes

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.790
for characters, what
you're really then doing

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:13.477
is arranging those themes in the
style of the music in the temp.

00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:15.810
CLIFF REDEKER: So, Matt, I
guess, going back to the film

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.655
as well, you're interviewing
dozens of composers,

00:16:18.655 --> 00:16:21.810
you have a psychologist
that you interviewed as well

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.640
for the cognitive perspective.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.464
How did you wind up
selecting the list?

00:16:28.464 --> 00:16:30.630
What was it like working
with these different folks?

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:35.760
And also the-- the split between
film scores and TV scores--

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320
like, was that
something intentional?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.070
MATT SCHRADER: Yeah,
and video games, too.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.160
I mean, video games
have become a huge--

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.240
huge, I mean, that's a big
deal for composers now.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.590
And you have to
structure it differently.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.650
You have to make something
so that it's kind of--

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.410
the score is kind of maybe
collapsible or expandable

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.990
sometimes, and it fits
certain story lines.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.410
Yeah, so that's one of-- we
made the conscious decision,

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.250
because there's so many
other developing things that

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:10.109
take a very similar model to
what you see in the film score,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.099
including television.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.839
And they kind of
expand on it or they

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.760
kind of collapse a little bit.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.270
We thought the film score
is the easiest one to really

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.930
comprehend and to get
a sense of how it's--

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.359
how you develop something and
how you can come back to it.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.890
There is a certain
kind of rhythm

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.599
and a certain kind
of poetry if it's

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.410
done right, to the way
that the music should work.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.900
So that, I think
we wanted to narrow

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.480
in on that kind
of specific thing.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.560
In terms of the people that
we interviewed in the film,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.520
the music psychologist that
we interviewed is fantastic.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.100
She's one of the
foremost in her field

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.124
and has all of these crazy
studies that she's done--

00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:52.290
CLIFF REDEKER: The area in
the brain that lights up.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.165
MATT SCHRADER: Right.

00:17:53.165 --> 00:17:55.391
I mean, it's that, but it's
also-- it's eye tracking

00:17:55.391 --> 00:17:55.890
things.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.080
They've studied
how music effects

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.384
where you look on screen.

00:18:00.384 --> 00:18:02.550
And she's done some of these
really great tests that

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.305
aren't in the film
but she told us about,

00:18:04.305 --> 00:18:08.049
about how if you have
really scary music,

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:09.840
you're looking in the
shadows of something.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.464
You might miss
something else entirely.

00:18:11.464 --> 00:18:13.440
If you have happy
music-- and there's

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.350
this great example from
this film she told us about.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.560
But someone rowing
a boat across a--

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.100
across a river or a lake, and
the left side of the screen

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.600
is almost all in shadows.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.990
And the way that they studied
where people were looking

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.710
for this is, they
had some text pop up

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.810
in the shadow that's
like bright red.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.280
You're not going to miss it.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.170
You'll see it for sure.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.540
And when they play the scary
music, everyone saw it.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.580
They said, what's
that text there?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.910
But if they play happy music,
someone rowing their boat

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.700
across the water, you
never even look there.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.920
You're following a story
that kind of matches

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.420
the feeling that's there, too.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.919
So it shows a little bit about
how things can guide the eye.

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:55.961
And we thought that was
really fascinating stuff.

00:18:55.961 --> 00:18:57.668
CLIFF REDEKER: Well
it's also a testament

00:18:57.668 --> 00:19:00.300
to the craft that's been
developed over so many years.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.450
It's giving people
an emotional context,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.740
like playing with the theme.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.207
I mean it's operatic onscreen.

00:19:07.207 --> 00:19:08.040
MATT SCHRADER: Yeah.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.055
Just the stories that you
can feel through the music.

00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:12.180
CLIFF REDEKER: And I also--

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.680
you also spoke with the
session musicians, the editors.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.770
And Joe, you can
speak to this for you

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.140
personally, or more
broadly for the other folks

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.400
that you work with.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.710
Is there a sense of
a recurring team?

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.980
Do composers have
a choice of which

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.960
session musicians to work with.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.100
whether they go to Abbey
Road or down in LA, or--

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.520
how does that work?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.310
And does it influence
the process?

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.592
JOE KRAMER: It definitely
influences the process.

00:19:40.592 --> 00:19:41.550
You know, there's two--

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.530
I mean, I guess the
first way to answer

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.181
the question is, there's two
general ways that composers

00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:46.680
work.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.770
They either get a
creative fee, and then

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.270
the recording and all of that
stuff is handled by the studio.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.510
Or they get what's
called a package deal.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.130
And generally in a
package deal, it's

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.256
all the composer's
responsibility.

00:20:01.256 --> 00:20:02.880
They're given the
music budget and told

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.040
come back with the score.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.830
You'll find with a
lot of package deals

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.050
that composers have mixer,
orchestrator, musicians,

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.990
studio, everything
where they like to work.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.940
In this context, I mean
the recording studio

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.170
where they record it.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.590
And then you'll find
with a creative fee,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.930
it's often dictated by
if it's a union film we

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.709
need to use a union orchestra.

00:20:26.709 --> 00:20:29.250
If it was Princip-- like in the
case of "Mission Impossible,"

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.260
because it was all
done in London,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.420
it made the most sense to
record the score in London.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.120
If it had been done
in LA, there may

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.530
have been union
requirements that insisted

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.950
that we should score it in LA.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:50.680
And then if it's a smaller,
independently financed film,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.850
they're not going to have the
means to afford the union.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.424
And you do get--

00:20:56.424 --> 00:20:58.340
to a certain degree, you
get what you pay for.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.410
And when you go with a top
notch union orchestra like LA,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.190
you're getting top
notch performance.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.910
And when you have to
cut corners on the cost,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.310
you're usually
making up for that.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.935
CLIFF REDEKER:
Something's got to give.

00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:13.240
JOE KRAMER: Yeah.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.140
Something's got to
give, and then you're

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.930
going to spend more time mixing
and editing the performances

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.340
to get a usable recording.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.400
It helps to know who
you're writing for.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.030
Certainly in the case--
say, "Harry Potter,"

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.180
John Williams has a longstanding
relationship with a keyboardist

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.630
named Randy Kerber, and he's
got this crazy thing where

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.110
the guy's on the [INAUDIBLE]
going [MUSICAL SOUNDS]

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.090
for like, 30 seconds--

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.830
just all over the place.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.410
And he sent it to Randy like
a month before the recording

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.910
session and was
like, I think you're

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.634
going to want to practice.

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:51.300
But he knew he was
writing it for Randy,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.730
and there's a video on
YouTube somewhere of Randy

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.100
going like, I got it and it
was just all [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.690
I was like, ohh.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.680
Like, it was a lot
of notes, you know.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.440
But you wouldn't
necessarily take that chance

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.330
if you didn't know who
the keyboardist was

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.106
that you were writing for.

00:22:08.106 --> 00:22:09.480
Certainly on a
film, where you've

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.800
got to get it done in a fairly
remarkable amount of time.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.180
When it's a concert
piece and you

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.700
know that the orchestra
will have time to rehearse,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.181
you can take more chances.

00:22:19.181 --> 00:22:21.180
CLIFF REDEKER: And the
film also made a big deal

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.340
about the composer in the
studio looking at the recording

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.310
as it's happening,
versus the composer right

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.370
out there leading
the orchestra along.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.760
Do you have any preferences?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.860
Do folks come into
familiar styles?

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.380
Does it really have an
impact on the output,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.380
whether you control more
from the studio or not?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.088
MATT SCHRADER: Well,
composers definitely

00:22:44.088 --> 00:22:46.080
hear it differently
in different places.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.920
In some-- Joe's an example
of someone who gets--

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.010
I mean, I guess I'll
let you answer this.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.540
There are some
composers that want

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.430
to hear what is being
recorded through everything,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.080
so that they know
what you're getting.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.550
They maybe know
what they can work

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:08.790
with in all of their editing
and mixing and everything else.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.550
But there's also, I mean--

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.530
Joe gave an example
of this in the film

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.810
and also John
Debney did as well.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.170
But there is a feeling
among a lot of composers

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.750
still that they really
want to conduct,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.840
because you are there
with the orchestra

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.570
and you develop a little
bit of a connection

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.080
and can influence the way
they play certain things

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.960
and can correct things if
they're not necessarily

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.050
being done the completely
the way you want.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.270
I'll let you explain it.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.170
CLIFF REDEKER: Cuts out
the middleman, I guess.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:39.930
JOE KRAMER: Yeah.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.071
I was just going to say it.

00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:42.570
If I'm sitting in
the booth and I've

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.360
got Pete Anthony conducting,
and I want something

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.320
changed I have to tell Pete,
who then tells the orchestra.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.490
And that can work.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.620
And that does work
for a lot of people.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.770
But personally-- there's two
things for me, personally.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.420
One is that, just
how many chances

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.330
am I going to get to
conduct symphony orchestras?

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.500
So every chance I get,
I'm going to take.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.910
And then the second thing
is, I wrote it and I know

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.890
how it's supposed to go.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.607
And when they play it and it's
not right, I can address that.

00:24:15.607 --> 00:24:17.190
And it's not because
they don't know--

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.050
I mean, they're sight
reading this stuff.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:24.210
I'm throwing-- if you've
seen "Mission Impossible"

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.220
Rogue Nation," there's
a three minute sequence

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.990
with a motorcycle chase.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.780
And I wrote that on Saturday
at 2:00 in the afternoon,

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.420
and we were recording it
Sunday morning at 11:00.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.160
And the orchestra
was sight reading it.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.890
And take one could
have gone in the movie.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:41.630
I mean, these guys
are top notch.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.242
But they're sight reading.

00:24:44.242 --> 00:24:46.200
And so what I'm trying
to give them technically

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.352
as a conductor,
that a person who

00:24:48.352 --> 00:24:50.310
didn't write the music--
because the conductor,

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.766
then, is sight reading, too,
if they're not the composer.

00:24:52.766 --> 00:24:55.140
What I'm trying to give them
is, this is what's going on.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.540
They are looking at
50,000 notes, playing.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.555
They're hearing a click
in their headphones.

00:25:02.555 --> 00:25:05.180
They're playing along-- diddle,
diddle, diddle, diddle, diddle,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.510
diddle, diddle, dana nana
nana nana nana nana--

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.920
and then just, out of
the corner of their eye,

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.550
they're keeping an eye on
me as I'm going like this.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.450
Dana na nana nana, dana na.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.450
And what I want them to
get in that split second

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.140
that they look at me is, if I'm
going, then they go, oh, wait,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.880
I've got to back way off.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.950
It's communicate--
it's almost like dance.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.340
Like, I'm communicating
through physical motion

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.460
where they should be on a
sort of emotional VU meter.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.380
And if everybody's
sight reading,

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.211
you're now losing a take,
essentially, to that.

00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:41.210
Do you know what I mean?

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.830
And time is money.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.210
And you're trying to record--

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.720
I did a score for a
television program last month,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.630
and I recorded two hours
of music in two days.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.880
I mean, we had to fly.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.180
So every five minutes I
can save by not having

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.270
to do an extra take,
that means in the end

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.870
I got an extra episode
done, essentially.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.380
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.490
Nice.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.500
And I guess also, to move on
to another part of the process,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.620
is the creation
of the soundtrack.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.150
I personally find the remade
"Thomas Crown Affair" one

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.050
of my all time favorite movies.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.920
I loaded the soundtrack,
and there was maybe

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.740
a hint of the melody, but not
a whole lot of what I actually

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.570
remember hearing on film.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.120
How do those decisions get made?

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.610
What are you influenced
by when you're

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.670
creating the soundtrack
versus the movie score?

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.430
MATT SCHRADER: We
encountered-- this

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.810
is one Joe can answer for sure.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.299
I think you talked about
it briefly in that--

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:38.840
in the scene.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.000
But there is a different
mix that you have.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.540
And we've actually encountered
a lot of people, as we've--

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.200
as this film has started
to be released that say,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.300
I love that the
end of whatever it

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.930
is, "Space Cowboys" or
whatever-- but the soundtrack

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.132
is completely different.

00:26:55.132 --> 00:26:56.090
It's not the end of it.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.140
That's not the right music.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.140
They did something else.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.530
They took out this,
they took out this.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.550
And there is a different way
that that typically composers

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.190
will treat a soundtrack
as opposed to the film.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.540
JOE KRAMER: Yeah I mean, the
movie has to work as a film.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.910
And there are--

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.490
Douglas Adams, I think,
made a great comparison

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.460
of film making--

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.100
the guy who wrote "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy,"

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.058
where he said, getting
a film made in Hollywood

00:27:22.058 --> 00:27:25.020
is like cooking a steak by
having 100 people walk past it

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.730
and breathe on it.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.350
And it is like that.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.710
It's slow, and it's tedious,
and you never see any progress,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.810
and then suddenly
the thing is done.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.680
But 100 people have all breathed
their shtanky breath on it.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.860
You know what I mean?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.900
And the music is no exception.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.760
So the director has
what they want for the--

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.760
start with the composer.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.620
The composer has a
vision for the score.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.690
The director has how they
want the music to be.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.300
The picture editor has been
working with the director

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.700
since the beginning.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.110
They're going to chime
in their two cents.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.820
In the case of
"Mission Impossible,"

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.500
Tom Cruise is both producer
and star, so he has an opinion.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.780
The producer-- but the
production company, Sky Dance

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.770
has an opinion.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.940
Paramount has an opinion.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.004
Perhaps they--
somebody at Paramount

00:28:08.004 --> 00:28:09.420
might think, oh,
would be so great

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.980
if we get to have Sting
do a song in this movie.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.700
So now suddenly
Sting is in the mix.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.320
And it's-- nobody's necessarily
got a sinister motive.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.870
But they're all thinking
of ways, and what they see,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.100
and how they could help.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.920
So if you have a vision as a
composer for a piece of music,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.830
film music is not for you.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.670
It's very much like, if
you're a painter, they go,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.780
I want that wall blue.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.510
And you go, well, I really
think it should be red.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.750
I don't care what you think,
I want that wall blue.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.087
The scene needs it to be blue.

00:28:43.087 --> 00:28:45.170
And you have to trust that
the director is looking

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.010
at the whole big picture and
understanding, yeah, OK, that

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.120
is blue for a reason.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.000
So the soundtrack album,
which has nothing to do--

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.210
necessarily have anything to
do with pleasing a director

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.050
or pleasing producers, it can
exist to please the composer.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.730
And so I look at
the soundtrack CD

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:08.030
as an opportunity to show
my vision for the score,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.456
or as close as I
could get to it.

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.580
MATT SCHRADER: Do you think
that reveals something?

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.142
Do you think that
reveals something?

00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:13.850
JOE KRAMER: Yeah.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.266
In "Mission
Impossible," I recor--

00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:17.600
I sometimes recorded two
different versions of a queue.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.450
I recorded the one that I
liked, and I recorded the one

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.670
that the director
wanted for the film.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.930
So for example, right in
the beginning of the film,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.680
there's a scene where
a character pops up.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.096
And I had a little tune that
went like bum, dabadum, daba

00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:31.790
dabadum, dabadum bum, dabadum.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.472
And it drove the
director crazy--

00:29:35.472 --> 00:29:37.430
for whatever reason, he
couldn't different-- he

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.030
couldn't listen to the dialogue
with that tune playing.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.010
And what finally
satisfied him was

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.650
to have it go bum babadump,
diba dabadum, babadam bum--

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.260
so it didn't change notes.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.690
Which underneath the
dialogue you didn't really--

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.354
it worked OK.

00:29:51.354 --> 00:29:53.270
But on CD, I was like,
I'd rather have the one

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.520
that changes notes because it's
more interesting when there's

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.820
no dialogue on top of it.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.270
So a great example,
too, is the movie

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.920
"Alien," where the
score in the film

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.870
is a hodgepodge of rewrites,
and music cut from other films,

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.170
and classical music.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.860
And the CD is actually sort
of Gerry Goldsmith's vision

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.500
for what he thought the
score to "Alien" should be.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.130
Now it can be frustrating as
a fan, when you see a movie

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.930
because you just see the movie.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.000
You don't know all this
other stuff took place

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.500
and you're going,
I love that music!

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.150
And then you get the
album and it's not there

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:23.900
or it's different.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.030
And you're like-- you know.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.156
And the other thing that's
not so much an issue now

00:30:29.156 --> 00:30:30.530
but used to really
be an issue is

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.540
that you used to have to
pay the orchestra twice.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.497
Once to use the
music in the film,

00:30:35.497 --> 00:30:37.080
and then if you
wanted to put it on CD

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.820
you had to pay them
again, the same amount.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.760
That was called the reuse fee.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.760
And one of the reasons
that London started

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.120
becoming an attractive option
for American film studios

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.890
was that they--

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.870
they got rid of the reuse fee.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.520
So if you recorded
a score in London,

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.950
you could do whatever
you wanted with the music

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.080
when it was done, whereas
in America you could only,

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.330
you know.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.220
So a lot of soundtrack
albums, the movie

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.550
would have 90 minutes of score.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.130
And they'd put 28
minutes on the CD

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:06.360
because that's all they
can afford to repay.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.370
So you'll see a lot
of [INAUDIBLE] scores

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.020
from the '90s, they're
like 28 minutes

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.990
long because that was the sweet
spot where they could afford

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.260
to pay, but still make a profit
enough to make more scores.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.470
CLIFF REDEKER: So then do
you write that in the liner

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.261
notes or something?

00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:22.560
Like, this was my vision--

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.165
how can the casual fan
understand or realize

00:31:27.165 --> 00:31:27.790
all that stuff.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.373
JOE KRAMER: Well, I would argue
there are no casual film music

00:31:30.373 --> 00:31:31.567
fans.

00:31:31.567 --> 00:31:32.400
I would argue that--

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.060
CLIFF REDEKER: Ringtones.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.685
JOE KRAMER: Yeah, well, I would
say if you're a film music fan,

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:38.591
you're probably somewhat
fastidious about that stuff

00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:39.090
anyway.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:42.650
And it depends.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.510
I mean like a
movie like Titanic,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.190
most people probably bought--

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.530
the reason that had
phenomenal sales

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.290
is not because of the score,
no offense to the composer.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.037
It's because of the song.

00:31:53.037 --> 00:31:55.370
Like "Beauty and the Beast,"
everybody bought that album

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.440
really for the songs,
not necessarily

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.310
for Menken's
admittedly great score.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.140
So when you're part of--

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.930
it's very rare that you have a
thing like the original "Star

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.940
Wars" LP that goes whatever
it did, double platinum

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.440
or whatever.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.398
I mean, i was the best
selling soundtrack album

00:32:11.398 --> 00:32:12.980
until "The Bodyguard" I think.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.760
And there were no songs,
you know what I mean?

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.237
But that was very rare.

00:32:18.237 --> 00:32:19.070
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.903
So we have time for
some audience questions.

00:32:20.903 --> 00:32:21.787
So feel free to--

00:32:21.787 --> 00:32:23.120
I guess we have one off the bat.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.810
We're short on mics, so tell
it to me, I'll repeat it,

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.078
and we'll go from there.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.420
So the question, just
to repeat for the folks

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.790
at home was, about the scores.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.560
Are they becoming
less memorable?

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.820
Is that a trend?

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.900
Is that intentional versus
"Wizard of Oz" or something?

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.174
JOE KRAMER: How nerdy do you--

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:47.090
an answer do you want?

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.080
CLIFF REDEKER: We
are a nerdy bunch.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.705
JOE KRAMER: OK.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.540
Steven Spielberg used
to make films on Super 8

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.010
in his neighborhood
in New Jersey,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.290
in his neighborhood in Arizona.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:03.500
He'd make-- he'd make
his version of Iwo Jima.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.980
And it was a bunch of
13-year-old kids in blue jeans

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.530
and green t-shirts with like
a plastic helmet that they got

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.180
at the Woolworth's.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.850
And then when he'd
show his silent movie,

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.970
he'd play the record with
the orchestral score.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.030
And you had to make such a
cosmic jump in suspension

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.460
of disbelief to buy
that these kids were

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.450
fighting on the sands of
Iwo Jima that the score--

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.460
he needed all the
help he could get.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.990
So having this score
play worked for him.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.740
And that became a kind of
musical scoring for his films

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.670
that he was comfortable with.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.490
What happened is, in the
'80s, with like, "Sex, Lies

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.310
and Videotape" and
then the explosion

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.770
of independent cinema, you
had people making movies

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:51.300
where these homemade
movies were starting to be

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.070
acceptable on their own terms.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.070
Instead of trying to make
an assault on Iwo Jima,

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.560
they were making a movie
about five guys hanging out

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.120
at the diner.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.690
And so these films actually
could get released.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.550
And in order to get
released, needed

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.350
music that could be cleared.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.310
So you couldn't just track it
with sophisticated film music.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.820
You had to find somebody who
could write the music for you.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.610
And so you found somebody
from a rock band,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.560
generally, down the
street who played

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.050
keyboards, who could
write instrumental

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.580
music for your film.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.230
And they may not
have ever thought

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.999
of being a film composer.

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:29.699
They may have just thought,
I'm the keyboardist

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.780
in the bar band.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.550
And they end up scoring
a movie by basically

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.650
writing instrumental songs.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:40.290
Not necessarily writing
a theme and counterpoint,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.100
thinking about orchestration and
arranging in the sort of sense

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.139
that Goldsmith and John
Williams and Elmore

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.330
Bernstein were raised in.

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.030
They're coming at it
from three chord rock.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.760
And the epitome of
that was Hans Zimmer,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.570
who really rock and
rolled the film score.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.450
And the strings are
the rhythm guitar,

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.330
the horns are the lead singer,
and the percussion section

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:04.710
is the drummer.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.556
And the bottom of the
low strings are the bass.

00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:09.930
And then there's
synthesizers and

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:13.330
actual, literal, electric
guitars in there, too.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:18.620
And in conjunction
with that approach

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.610
from the composing point of
view, the filmmakers got--

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.300
their musical voice became
this rock and roll vocabulary

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.370
rather than operatic film music,
classic golden age film music

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.420
vocabulary.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.970
So they didn't think that--
they didn't make films

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.130
with that sound in mind.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.930
Spielberg makes a
film, he's thinking

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.210
of what John Williams
is going to bring to it.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.920
When Soderberg
makes a film, he's

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.535
thinking about what
Cliff Martinez is

00:35:44.535 --> 00:35:45.410
going to bring to it.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.530
You know what I mean?

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.430
And they're going to bring
two totally different things.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:54.020
So I think in that
long winded answer

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.230
is the germ of what
you're hearing, which

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:01.980
is that the approach now is
much more about background

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.320
instrumental music
than necessarily about

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.350
thematic storytelling from a
more conservatory, educated

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.569
musician.

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:14.110
And I hope I said that without
insulting that other approach,

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.140
because I'm not knocking
the other approach.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.970
They're just two
different approaches.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.920
And I think the memor--

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.170
what makes music
memorable is a theme.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.300
I think first and foremost,
it's the theme, or the tune,

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:33.060
not necessarily supportive
string sustained chords.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:37.620
That's a texture more
than a memorable theme.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.650
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:38.880
Cool.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.463
All right, so there's
three questions.

00:36:40.463 --> 00:36:42.280
We'll go here and
then back around.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.759
So--

00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:56.084
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:04.742 --> 00:37:06.610
CLIFF REDEKER: The
cook's in the kitchen,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.290
and how much input you have
when you create a score,

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.150
pre-packaged versus voices?

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.620
JOE KRAMER:
Christopher McQuarrie,

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.590
who directed "Way of the Gun,"
"Jack Reacher" and "Rogue

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.000
Nation Mission Impossible."

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.750
So three-- three biggest movies
I've done have been with him.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.990
He had some experiences
where he was really

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.020
frustrated on films
that he'd written,

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.290
where the score sounded
a lot like the temp.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.340
And so he devised, as a film
maker, and approach-- at least

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.510
when I worked with
him-- of no temp at all.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.150
He cuts the film based on
the performance of the actors

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:47.500
and the writing of the
dialogue, and gives it

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.760
to me with no music.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.530
And what's liberating
about that is,

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.600
I can make my own statement.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.370
What's daunting about that is,
there's no guidance whatsoever.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.250
And if I start barking up one
tree and Chris hates that tree,

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.750
I've got to come all the way
back down and find another tree

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.020
and start working up that one.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.630
So there's a lot of--

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.910
there can be a lot of--

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.110
not wasted energy, but
there's a lot of work

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.840
that is done that
never goes anywhere

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.510
because it was the wrong route.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:27.210
Where temp can really help
is when it gets rid of--

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.970
when the filmmakers have
explored their options

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.880
and have decided no, this is
the direction we want to go.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.970
That can help a lot.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:38.185
So OK, we know it's going to
be orchestral symphonic music.

00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:39.810
It's not going to be
jazz, and it's not

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.480
going to be rhythmic
electric guitar rock music.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.730
OK, well, that helps a
lot just to know that.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.200
I'm trying to think
of a film where

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.340
we had so many people on
it with differing visions

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.140
and I'm actually kind
of drawing a blank.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:56.990
I mean--

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.740
CLIFF REDEKER: They're
probably weeded out

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.080
before the process had started.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.130
People jump on the ship.

00:39:04.681 --> 00:39:06.180
MATT SCHRADER: The
studio heads have

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.072
stories like that, where even
they noticed that they've

00:39:09.072 --> 00:39:11.280
had input from this person,
this person, this person,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.180
this person.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.810
It all ends up being kind
of this mish mash of idea.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.390
Something that maybe you
could see some potential,

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.760
but it never kind of came to
fruition because everyone's

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.070
like, you do that, you do that.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.290
Robert Kraft at
Fox would tell us

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:28.920
how everyone thinks
they're an expert in music

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.720
because we all like
music for the most part.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.660
So we're all like, oh,
well, I would do this.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.620
I like this.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.510
I would do this.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:41.280
And to a composer,
that is sometimes

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.190
something that kind of
restricts what you can do,

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.690
if someone says,
well, I really like

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.820
this that's what we should do.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.167
JOE KRAMER: The other
mistake is thinking

00:39:50.167 --> 00:39:52.500
that you have to-- either as
a composer or a filmmaker--

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.580
like the music.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.870
The job is not to make music
that we like, necessarily.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.000
It's to make music that works.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.650
So I heard an anecdote about
one of the Star Wars films

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.812
that wasn't directed
by George Lucas.

00:40:07.812 --> 00:40:09.520
And somebody who was
brought on was like,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.320
but I don't really like
that John Williams music.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.600
And they were like, it doesn't
matter if you like it or not.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.440
It's not about that.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.600
That's the kind of
music these movies need.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.950
Whether you like it or
not, it's been proven,

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.230
that's the voice of these films.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.697
So maybe you like--

00:40:22.697 --> 00:40:24.280
maybe you don't
listen to that for fun

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.571
and maybe you don't enjoy that.

00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:27.305
But that's irrelevant.

00:40:27.305 --> 00:40:28.930
If you're making an
action film but you

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.730
don't like to drive
fast, that doesn't

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.830
mean you'd make
everybody drive slow.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.337
Do you know what I mean?

00:40:35.337 --> 00:40:36.170
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:37.628
And so we had some
other questions,

00:40:37.628 --> 00:40:39.430
we'll do the back,
back, and front.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:40.380
So go, you, yeah.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:49.180
Yeah.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.380
MATT SCHRADER: It's
very similar, yeah.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.463
CLIFF REDEKER: And just
to rephrase the question--

00:40:52.463 --> 00:40:54.930
and so, to rephrase the
question, the idea of remakes

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.880
is composers imitating
themselves, taking extracts

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.100
from one film,
putting it in another.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.520
We had some other
examples listed.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.480
JOE KRAMER: Well, as a
composer-- and then I'll go--

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.409
we have a voice.

00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:07.075
You know, I have a
way of saying things.

00:41:07.075 --> 00:41:08.620
When David Mamet
writes a script,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.540
and he writes another
script, there's--

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.450
or Sorkin, you know.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.980
There's a voice behind that.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.790
And there are certain
gestures, you might say,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.800
or musical ideas that
are going to recur.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.180
To give maximum benefit of
the doubt to the filmmaker--

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.070
to the composers in the
situations you mentioned,

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.410
I would say that
they were probably

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:35.680
encouraged-- heavily
encouraged-- by the filmmakers

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.700
to stick as close to a piece
of temp music as they could.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.854
And sometimes it's easier
when it's your own stuff,

00:41:41.854 --> 00:41:43.270
and sometimes it's
harder actually

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.895
because you can't see
the forest for the trees.

00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:45.580
See what I mean?

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.280
Now, I'm going to show
some ignorance here.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.770
The Max Richter stuff was
written as concert music,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.490
wasn't it?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.470
And then tracked into the film.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.450
So that's-- right, so
that's slightly different,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.100
because I think it's also
in "Shutter Island," right?

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.040
Do you know?

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.100
But I think it was--
it's like Arvo Part.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.920
It was written for the
concert hall, I believe.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.060
I could be totally wrong.

00:42:14.281 --> 00:42:14.780
Right.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.820
So I mean, like you'll
see Habanera from Carmen

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.920
is in every-- dan dan
danan, dadan da dadan.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.800
You'll hear that.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.740
It was in "Scent of a Woman,"
but it's in everything.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.615
You know what I mean?

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.020
Where they take a piece
of classical music

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.610
that they love and
they use in a film.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.260
But then somebody sees that
and loves that and goes,

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.230
oh, that's classical music?

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.060
I could just use that?

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:35.559
Great!

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:42.790
And then you'll see cases where
the composer was encouraged

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.800
to copy the temp and
they just couldn't do it,

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.690
so they've gone and
bought the temp.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:52.147
So like in the movie "Die Hard,"
when the blond bad guy jumps up

00:42:52.147 --> 00:42:53.980
at the end of the movie,
you think he's dead

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.290
and he jumps up with the
gun and starts going nuts--

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.120
they just bought the
music from Aliens

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.460
that they had temped
in, because for whatever

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.320
reason, the director
and the composer

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.740
could not come up with
a solution together.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.360
CLIFF REDEKER:
Actually there is a--

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.350
on the topic of voice,
because we entered this film

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.190
with the idea of, OK, I
know what a Hans Zimmer

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.940
score sounds like.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.439
I know what-- you know, there
are a certain number of people

00:43:18.439 --> 00:43:19.180
I can always--

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.940
almost always, I should
say, identify John Williams.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.670
I can, a lot of the times
identify, Danny Elfman.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.520
I can usually identify
Thomas Newman.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.610
A lot of these guys have a
very kind of a signature style

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.732
if they're given--

00:43:32.732 --> 00:43:34.690
you can do anything in
the world for this film,

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.800
it's still going
to sound like them.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.530
And we tried to tap into
that a couple of times,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.380
including at Hans--
we kind of wanted

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.730
to know what Hans sounded like.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:46.240
And so we-- but we thought
about this with a few composers.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.370
Some composers
struggled with it,

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.030
but we asked them to
just play something

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.840
and didn't give them
any direction, really,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.590
but kind of wanted to
see where they went.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.930
And a few of them--

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.600
usually on a piano-- but a
few of them, including Hans,

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.480
you can tell--

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.896
and it's in the
end of our movie--

00:44:03.896 --> 00:44:06.850
but you can tell from
the chords that he picks,

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.890
it sounds very Hans Zimmer.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:11.620
It's a lot of long, kind
of sustained chords.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.540
But even the direction that
he goes in making something up

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.130
for-- this is
something for nothing,

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.800
it's just some people with
cameras pointed at him.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.630
It's never going
to air anywhere.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.600
But it sounds like
the progression

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.980
that he would use in a movie.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.217
So you can almost
identify even that,

00:44:30.217 --> 00:44:32.050
something that's 30
seconds long-- oh, yeah,

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:33.370
that sounds like Hans Zimmer.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.670
So I think a lot of composers
do have that unique voice

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.940
that you can pick up on
even if sometimes it's

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.720
directly used in another
film, but even if it's not.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.770
CLIFF REDEKER: And speaking
of the unique voice,

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.710
too, if you look at the
"Mission Impossible" suite,

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.620
how do you approach
composing each one?

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.100
Like, there's a core
theme from the TV show

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.180
that kind of has to be there.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.689
But are you-- do you
feel forced to make

00:44:57.689 --> 00:44:59.230
something sound
completely different,

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.000
or do you like a
sibling relationship

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.640
between the films, or--?

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.020
JOE KRAMER: Well, to speak
specifically about Mission,

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.300
I actually-- it
drives me nuts when

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.150
you go to one of these
reboot or sequels

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.670
and they've gotten
a different composer

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.080
from who did the original.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.900
And they try to put the
music from the original in.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.180
And it usually ends up
sounding like they've literally

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.667
just gone and gotten the sheet
music from the first movie

00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:23.500
and handed it to all
the musicians and said,

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.730
just play this.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.880
As opposed to
actually organically

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.300
integrating that
into this new score.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.030
And so with Mission, it was
really important to me--

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.866
it didn't necessarily
help my career,

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.240
but it was really
important to me

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.950
that you couldn't
necessarily tell

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:40.661
where Lalo ended and I began.

00:45:40.661 --> 00:45:42.160
Because I didn't
want it to be like,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.860
oh, it's Joe Kramer, Joe Kramer,
Joe Kramer, Lalo Schifrin!

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:45.430
Brilliant!

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.455
Joe Kramer, Joe Kramer,
Joe Kramer-- you know.

00:45:47.455 --> 00:45:50.790
So I worked really hard to--

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.090
when Lalo would come in and out.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:55.960
So, I mean, I embarked on a
sort of reverse engineering

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.100
of the theme.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.130
And breaking it down
into its core pieces,

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.160
and then using those core
pieces kind of like refrigerator

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.930
magnet poetry to create
new music for the film.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:11.995
And as a result, my hope was
that what you would get is--

00:46:11.995 --> 00:46:15.850
yeah, it's the same words,
but I'm making new sentences

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.080
with those words.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.210
CLIFF REDEKER: And for the
documentary "King Cohen"

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.330
that you're working on, too,
it's an historical perspective.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.790
It's things that
appeared on screen,

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:27.320
so it suggests
something already.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.960
In a sense it's a
documentary medium.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.220
Do you just feel compelled
to go with the flow?

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.570
Or how would you
strike out on your own?

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.330
JOE KRAMER: Well, you
know, that was a movie--

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.760
to the gentleman who had been
asking about too many cooks.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.540
It wasn't necessarily that
we had too many cooks,

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.810
but there were two interesting
things on that film.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.320
One was that the filmmakers
were big film music fans.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.870
And so they were very excited
to finally get a chance

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.550
to actually help create--

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.562
participate in the
creation of a score.

00:46:50.562 --> 00:46:53.020
And I kept having to tell them
like, guys, this film, we're

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.750
not necessarily going to be
making music you actually like.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.760
Like, I just wanted
to warn them.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.420
And in a documentary, music
can often be just practical.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.910
What we're doing is, we're
cutting in and out of a movie.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.690
And we cut-- we have
a scene from a movie,

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.730
then we have a
talking head, and then

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.272
we have another
scene from the movie,

00:47:08.272 --> 00:47:10.730
then a talking head, and then
another scene from the movie.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.370
And it sounds weird
to have the score--

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:13.786
because a lot of
these movies were

00:47:13.786 --> 00:47:15.880
done so long ago and so
cheaply that we don't have

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.434
the original elements anymore.

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:18.850
We've only got the
finished movie.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:21.110
So there was no way to get the
dialogue without the score.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:21.985
You know what I mean?

00:47:21.985 --> 00:47:23.902
It was all or nothing.

00:47:23.902 --> 00:47:26.110
So what I had to do was
composed little bits of music

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:27.820
that could go under
the talking head

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.260
to glue the whole
thing together.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.260
So that you'd come out
of a clip from the movie,

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.480
I'd have the music in
a sympathetic chord

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.330
and a similar sound
play under the dialogue,

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.191
and then come back for the
thing, for the next clip.

00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:42.190
And sometimes they liked
that and sometimes they

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:43.570
didn't, and then--

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:45.800
I actually haven't
seen the finished film.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.674
So I don't know how
they ended up doing it,

00:47:47.674 --> 00:47:49.340
because I gave them
a couple of choices.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.945
But yeah, it was a
practical thing there

00:47:51.945 --> 00:47:54.444
of just trying to make
stuff glue together.

00:47:54.444 --> 00:47:56.110
There was another
film I worked on where

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:59.419
they had a thing from SNL,
and they could get the clip.

00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:00.960
It was for a Ralph
Nader documentary.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.680
They could get a
clip of him talking,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.070
but they couldn't
use any of the music.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.320
So when they came back from
commercial with the screen

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.520
and it's the bluesy sax
stuff, I'd make all that

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.350
and then figure out
a way to get out

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.810
of that and into the
dialogue from Nader.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:14.800
So it's practical.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.070
CLIFF REDEKER: Right.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:16.694
So I think we have
two final questions.

00:48:16.694 --> 00:48:20.230
So we'll go with Bob Hurby, the
president of the Mountain View

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.925
Film Society first.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.090
True or not, did
Hitchcock hate the--

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.965
JOE KRAMER: I haven't
heard that he hated it,

00:48:31.965 --> 00:48:35.370
but I do know that he was
really happy with what--

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.710
and Hitchcock's a great
example of what I talk about.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.620
In modern film, this--

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.280
the hauteur has
sort of run rampant.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.970
And now everybody on a film is
there to realize the directors

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.140
vision.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.030
And what I'm supposed
to do is write music

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.790
that the director would write,
if he could write music.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.040
And what Hitchcock did was,
he was like, I'm not even

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.206
going to try to write music.

00:48:57.206 --> 00:48:58.850
Bernard Hermann knows
what he's doing.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.350
Let him write music, and even
if it's not what I'm expecting

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:05.580
or what I want, when I hear
it, oh, yeah, that's great,

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.730
I never-- you know.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.590
So I do think that he
was impressed with that.

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.740
I do know they had
a falling out, so--

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.160
but I can't say for sure
that he hated the shower

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.630
scene until he saw it.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.220
I do know that Joe
Stefano, I think

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.660
it is, who wrote the book--

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.520
they had a screening
of the rough cut

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.110
before the score
was done and Stefano

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:25.443
after the screening was like,
oh, my god, it's terrible.

00:49:25.443 --> 00:49:27.354
And Hitchcock was
like, no, no, no, wait.

00:49:27.354 --> 00:49:28.270
This is the rough cut.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.145
When you see it with
the music and the sound,

00:49:30.145 --> 00:49:32.320
you won't-- it'll be
a different movie.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.319
CLIFF REDEKER: So our
last question in the back.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.040
How do you [INAUDIBLE]
your workload?

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.110
JOE KRAMER: I work
in Sonar on a PC.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:47.150
I'm the only composer I know
who does that, but I learned it

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.950
when I was young and I just--

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.180
old dog can't--

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.380
I could learn logic.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.370
I could learn-- my music editor
is constantly on me to learn

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.320
Cubase and maybe I will.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.559
But for now, I fly on it,
because I have all my hotkeys

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:01.850
programmed that all that stuff.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:03.694
So what I do is,
I watch the film.

00:50:03.694 --> 00:50:06.110
We have what's called a spotting
session, where we discuss

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.235
where we think music will
be and where it should go

00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:11.610
and where it'll be quiet, and
what the music will kind of be.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:13.910
Will it be a sad score?

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.060
will it be-- is it a sad movie
where we want a happier score

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.500
to help offset that?

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.190
Or is it a comedy, where we want
the music to actually be like--

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.150
again, this latest
project is a comedy.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:29.120
It's a sort of satire on
cop shows from the '80s.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.960
So I did everything
acoustically like a late '70s,

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.340
like "Rockford Files" or
such, you know, "SWAT."

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.965
And the music is very straight.

00:50:39.965 --> 00:50:41.804
If you hear the music
away from the film,

00:50:41.804 --> 00:50:43.220
much like the score
to "Airplane."

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.970
If you hear that score
away from the film,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.870
it sounds like it's a disaster
movie, not for a comedy.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.120
So we'll have that discussion.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.960
Then I live with the film.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.530
I watch the film as
much as possible.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.594
Sometimes with the temp,
more often without the temp,

00:50:57.594 --> 00:50:59.510
and just start to learn
the rhythm of the film

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.980
and pick up on connections.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.410
Something the character says
here that pays off there,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:04.500
you know what I mean?

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.930
And I start thinking about--

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.350
I have a whole series
of sort of mnemonics

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.540
that I go through
in my brain to help

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.340
me start coming up with ideas.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.251
So if it's a heroic
character, the theme

00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:17.000
is probably going to
be kind of uplifting,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.780
and it's going to have
intervals in it of leaps.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.390
If it's a sad movie,
then it's obviously--

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:27.290
if it's a laconic sort
of dour theme, that

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.836
might be almost like a waltz,
but a sad, minor key waltz.

00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:32.210
And I develop this
material and I

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:34.730
keep a journal on
the piano, where

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.290
I write all this stuff down.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:39.447
And then usually when
they're so mad at me

00:51:39.447 --> 00:51:41.530
that I haven't shown them
anything to picture yet,

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.785
I then finally start
working to picture.

00:51:43.785 --> 00:51:46.160
And I've got-- what I've got
is like a cheat sheet of all

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.010
this thematic notation
that I've done.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.990
And I start drawing
stuff up against it

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:53.240
and seeing what sticks.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.620
And then I start
making the cues.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.420
And at that point,
I've got my time line

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.040
where I go, OK,
I've got to do 15

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.067
seconds of contemplative
music, and then

00:52:00.067 --> 00:52:01.025
he makes the decisions.

00:52:01.025 --> 00:52:03.620
So then it becomes 20
seconds of definitive music

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.050
as he marches down the
hall to talk to his boss.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:08.180
And then he goes in
the boss's office

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.360
and the boss is running
around with the secretary,

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.050
so it's funny music
for a few seconds.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:12.950
You know what I mean?

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:18.550
So at that point-- and I'm
doing all this stuff in Sonar.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.490
And I may-- I have a template
set up that mimics a symphony

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.620
orchestra or whatever
ensemble I'm using

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.420
for this particular assignment.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.850
And then I create a
mock-up that sounds

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:32.500
as real as I could make it sound
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.520
And I then do as much of that as
I can for as much of the movie

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.210
as I can.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.880
And then I have the
director come over,

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:44.300
and we just watch it, from
beginning to end, like a movie,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.070
with as little
interruption as possible.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.590
Then we roll back and
start going through,

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.700
measure by measure,
scene by scene,

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.520
however it used to
be done, to discuss

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.340
what works for the director
and what doesn't work.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.050
Now what I found
recently is helping

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.810
a lot is to actually
just email it to them.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.460
Have their editors
put in the film

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.001
and let them live with it for
a week before we talk about it.

00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:06.440
Because often what happens
is, the first thing they think

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.279
is, it's not the temp.

00:53:08.279 --> 00:53:09.820
It's not the temp,
and now everything

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.650
I hate about the
scene, I hate again,

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:14.600
because the temp fixed it all
and this isn't fixing it all.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.462
And it's not that.

00:53:15.462 --> 00:53:17.920
It's that they're just seeing
all the flaws, because that's

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.830
what they--

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:20.470
they made this thing
and they can see

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:24.100
all the cracks in the paint.

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.050
John Lennon hated
Sergeant Pepper, but he

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.900
was the only one, because
he could see all the--

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.790
he could see behind the curtain.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:35.840
So what I find is, if I let
them live with it for a week,

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.451
then a lot of that panic
that they got goes away

00:53:38.451 --> 00:53:40.700
and they actually start
looking at it on its own terms

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.380
and saying, no, all right,
I see why you did that.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.660
I see why you-- and we
couldn't do that with the temp,

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.326
because no one else
had done that before

00:53:46.326 --> 00:53:48.770
and we couldn't find a piece
of temp that turned that way.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:51.110
There's a back and
forth of revision.

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:52.455
When the queue is locked up--

00:53:52.455 --> 00:53:54.080
I'm sorry this is so
long winded-- that

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.050
is sent to the orchestrator
as a MIDI file.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.390
They open it up in
Sibelius or Finale,

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:03.230
and they then adapt
my MIDI performances

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.600
into notation which is then
printed out and distributed

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.269
to the musicians at the session.

00:54:08.269 --> 00:54:10.810
And that can happen, like in
the case of the motorcycle chase

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.601
in "Mission Impossible,"
that had to happen

00:54:12.601 --> 00:54:14.956
in less than 12 hours.

00:54:14.956 --> 00:54:16.910
MATT SCHRADER: The
orchestrator doesn't sleep.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:17.762
Not very much.

00:54:17.762 --> 00:54:18.845
JOE KRAMER: But they know.

00:54:18.845 --> 00:54:22.102
It comes with-- they
get paid for that.

00:54:22.102 --> 00:54:23.310
CLIFF REDEKER: Awesome stuff.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.880
Well, I invite you all to
check out the documentary.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.020
We'll have it up on Google
Play, wherever movies are shown.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.560
And of course, now
I hope you have

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.470
an even deeper
appreciation for the music

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:38.000
and the themes behind
the score of the film.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.007
So, Matt, Joe, thank you
very much for speaking

00:54:40.007 --> 00:54:40.590
with us today.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:41.060
MATT SCHRADER: Thank you.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:41.480
CLIFF REDEKER: Thank you.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.521
MATT SCHRADER: Thank you.

00:54:42.521 --> 00:54:47.200
[APPLAUSE]
