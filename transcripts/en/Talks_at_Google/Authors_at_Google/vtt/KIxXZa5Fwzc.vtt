00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.670
&gt;&gt;Kent: Good morning everybody.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.690
It's my honor to introduce Secretary Robert
Reich to Google today.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.550
Secretary Reich, as I'm sure all of you know,
served with three different administrations

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.240
including most notably being Secretary of
Labor in the Clinton Administration.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.590
In taking a look at some background notes,
I saw that Time Magazine had named him one

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.140
of the top ten cabinet members of the last
century, which is pretty remarkable.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.980
Although as my wife told me this morning maybe
not at remarkable as the fact that he actually

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.970
dated Hillary Clinton before Bill did.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.629
[laughter]
[applause]

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.999
We are delighted that Secretary Reich after
having taught at Harvard and Brandeis has

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:45.870
now moved to Northern California where in
our sort of latte- sipping, Prius-driving

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.769
ways I'm hoping we're treating him better
than Governor Perry's Texas might these days.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.609
[laughter]
And he has written a new book, after a series

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.229
of very interesting books, this latest one
which compliments some of the ways we've come

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.350
to know him as a commentator on NPR is titled
Aftershock, let me make sure I get it right,

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.280
The Next Economy in America's Future.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.840
And obviously we at Google hope to have a
part in building that future, but I guess

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.530
we'll find out during the course of his talk
whether or not some of the knowledge economy

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.579
will work in a good way with his commitment
to building a robust and sustainable, labor-based

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.630
economy where we really focus on finding good
jobs for people across America and the world.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.610
So with that, Secretary Reich.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.970
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Thank you.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.340
[applause]
Well thank you very much Kent and it's nice

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.510
to see all of you.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.770
As you can see the economy has worn me down.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.329
[laughter]
I was six foot two --

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.700
[laughter]
about four years ago.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.319
[laughter]
I'm gonna talk about maybe a half an hour

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.540
about the economy and politics, maybe longer
than that, but I'm most curious to get your

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.009
questions and try to respond to them because
I know what I think.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:12.209
Let me just say that we are in far worse economic
predicament than most people had predicted

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.709
when we went into the Great Recession of 2008.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.819
Let's talk about 2008 as the Great Recession
although it started before and it ended after.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.760
There are many causes for our economic predicament
and there are many ways out.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.530
This is not something that is difficult to
do, the problem is political will.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.000
And having spent a big chunk of my life in
politics, by the way Kent, I only had one

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.959
date with Hillary --
[laughter]

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.069
Clinton.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.600
In fact I didn't even remember that date until
she was running for office and a reporter

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.090
for the New York Times called me and he said,
"I understand from some of her friends that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.110
you went out with her once as an undergraduate.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.239
Can you tell me was there anything about that
date that struck you that might bear some

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.209
light on how she would do as a President?"

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.970
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kent: It was a Presidential Summit.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.240
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: It was a President Summit;

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.829
she was a president [chuckles] of her class
at Wellesley, I was president of my class

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.989
at Dartmouth and that was an easy way to get
a date saying, "Oh well we'll have a Presidential

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.400
Summit."

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.150
[laughter]
But let me just put it to you very, very clearly

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.129
and as clearly as I possibly can.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.370
In 2008 the economy fell off a cliff particularly
and importantly in terms of consumers; consumers

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.901
are workers, workers are consumers obviously
and if consumers can no longer, because they

00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:52.579
are 70 percent, their spending is 70 percent
of the economy, if consumers can no longer

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.751
borrow against their homes because of the
housing bubble bursting, because of 7.7 trillion

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.859
dollars of loss in the housing market.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.079
If consumers can no longer borrow against
their homes and they see their major asset

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:15.829
which is their homes shrinking to really almost
a third less than it was worth in 2006 then

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.280
most people, and combine that with worry about
jobs because everybody's losing jobs around

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.520
them, most people are going to pull in their
spending.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.180
That's not surprising.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.300
And if most people are pulling in their spending
and consumers are again 70 percent of the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.330
economy in terms of consumer spending and
GDP then we're going to have a problem on

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.970
the demand side.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.810
And businesses are not going to hire unless
there are customers.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.720
Businesses are right now sitting on almost
two trillion dollars of cash and a lot of

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.140
people scratch their heads and say, "Well,
why is that?

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.110
Why aren't businesses just using that to expand
and hire?"

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.630
Businesses are not going to expand and hire
if there are not customers out there.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.940
And there's a great deal of understandable
worry that there are not going to be enough

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.820
customers out there because consumers don't
have the purchasing power.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.570
This again is not, at least at the level I'm
talking to you about it, it's not all that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:23.410
complicated and there's not very much discord
or disagreement about this fundamental reality.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.270
The question is what to do?

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.900
There is a gap right now, if you think about
the economy as having a certain production

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.150
capacity at or near full employment and you
see where we are now, we're about, and the

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.970
data are not terrifically good but we can
make a reasonable estimate, we're about five

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.280
percent below where we otherwise could be
at or near full employment.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.340
Well, who's gonna make up the difference?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.850
If consumers can't and won't, can exports?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.460
Well, exports can do it theoretically but
we're not a net exporter we're actually a

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.860
net importer.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.620
So to get to the point where we're a net exporter,
and exporters could provide the oomph to get

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.770
the economy going, well that's gonna be if
ever years from now.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.990
I mean the dollar would have to drop and what
do a lot of the big global exporters do if

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.990
we become a net exporter?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.870
I mean not everybody can be a net exporter.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.832
That's gonna take a huge change, a tidal wave
change, in the entire structure of the global

00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:27.832
economy.

00:06:27.832 --> 00:06:31.210
So don't count on exports anytime soon, if
ever.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.110
So if consumers can't do it and businesses
won't do it and exports certainly can't make

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.970
up the difference where does the demand come
from at least in the foreseeable future?

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:43.970
Class?

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.840
[laughter]
[audience murmurs in response]

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.800
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well who's the spender of
last resort?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800
Who else can spend?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.800
&gt;&gt;male #1 : The government.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: It is government.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.810
And when you say the word government in this
environment everybody it's as if you put a

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.480
shock in the room because people have very
strong opinions about government.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.190
Politics is not the same as government.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:13.400
Politics comes from the Greek root 'poli'
meaning many and 'ticks' small blood sucking

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.400
insects.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.820
[laughter]
No I do not really mean that because I --

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.820
[laughter]
I have great respect for everybody who is

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.180
in government and I was in government and
most people are there for the right reasons.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.690
They can make much more money and have much
easier lives if they were not there fighting

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.990
the fights that they are fighting on either
side of the aisle.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.940
But the point is that government is the spender
of last resort.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:48.330
Keynesianism from 1946 up until the late 70s
was basically the idea that we had.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.460
Richard Nixon purportedly said, "We're all
Keynesians now."

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:57.570
And that was because the fundamental problem
with the economy in those three decades was

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.300
how do you get sufficient demand?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.270
Now after 1977-78 the Arab oil embargo, it
happened too late for most of you.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.300
I can look at you and see most of you were
not even born.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.850
[laughter]
But in the 30 years after the late 70s the

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.050
biggest problem was inflation.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.120
And so Keynesianism sort of went into quiescence.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.170
It was not how to get enough demand it was
basically how to restrain and control costs.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.219
And so monetarists and neoclassical economists
and others kind of took the center stage.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:38.140
But after the great crash of 2008 the problem
once again is adequate demand.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.409
How do you get and insure adequate, aggregate
demand?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.580
And that's why, when I said to you and you
said back to me, actually I asked you and

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:52.300
you said back to me government, that's why
government has got to be the spender of last

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.300
resort.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.209
There is really no issue here.

00:08:55.209 --> 00:09:01.230
Most economists, most policy analysts, most
experts understand this.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.279
It's a political problem right now that we're
having.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:10.060
But it's larger than that and I don't wanna
spend our valuable time on Keynesian economics

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:16.040
I want to go to a higher and more subtle level
of analysis.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:24.290
Economics, by the way, is on offshoot of a
field that in the 19th century was called

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.300
political economy.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.800
And not until Alfred Marshall, the great economist
Alfred Marshall wrote his Principles of Economics,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.550
did it become a separate science in 1890.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.740
But most of the 19th century it was all called
political economy because people understood

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.680
you could not talk about economics without
talking about politics.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.470
They were inextricably connected.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:52.590
And in the 18th century what did Adam Smith
call himself a political economist, an economist?

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.590
No.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.310
He called himself, because there was not in
the 18th century even a discipline called

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.620
political economy, it was moral philosophy.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.930
[laughter]
Adam Smith was a moral philosopher.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:15.120
Because the question was what is a good society
and how do we recognize it and how do we achieve

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.210
it?

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.249
And Adam Smith himself thought his most important
work was not the wealth of nations, it was

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:29.550
actually The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which
I hope all of you have read.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.389
[laughter]
Again the question fundamentally was what

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:34.459
are the ties that bind people together?

00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:45.230
How do people work together to create a good
society, ideally one that operates for everyone?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.029
[pause]
Which brings me to the more complicated issue

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:53.490
with regard to the current economy.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:59.339
And I want you to come back with me three
decades, come back three decades.

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:06.959
[laughter]
We're back now in about 1981-82 and what we

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:14.680
see if we are paying attention to the American
workforce is that wages, which up until now

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.029
at least for 30 years after the second World
War until 1981-82, wages had grown in tandem

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:24.740
with American productivity; productivity went
up, wages went up.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:31.130
Over the 30 years from the second World War
to 1981-82 in fact the economy doubled in

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.019
size and wages doubled.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.580
Everybody was gaining, everybody was growing
and gaining together, the rising tide really

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.399
was lifting all boats.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:47.029
And then the median wage started to flatten.

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:54.480
Male workers actually today if they are hourly
workers that is 80 percent of the workforce

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.470
are hourly workers, male hourly workers today
adjusted for inflation are earning today less

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.779
than they earned in 1981.

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.019
[pause]
Something fairly fundamental must have happened.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.889
[pause]
And before we get to that, because that really

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:17.279
underlies a great deal of what's happening
now, we have to understand why what happened

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:23.059
then was kind of masked, m-a-s-k-e-d, masked
until very recently.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:28.829
It was masked because American workers and
American consumers, who are the same things,

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:41.519
used three coping mechanisms to maintain their
purchases as if male wages had not stagnated.

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:46.019
Coping mechanism number one' begun in the
late '70s actually if you look carefully,

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:51.829
but then a huge increase in the 1980s and
then an increase in the 1990's, was wives

00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:55.700
and mothers into paid work.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.190
[pause]
Go back to the 1960's and a very, very small

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.759
proportion of wives and mothers particularly
of young children were in paid work.

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:10.230
[pause]
Something in the order of 20 percent.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.769
Go to the 1990's is was 60 percent.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:15.240
Huge, huge difference.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.559
That was a coping mechanism.

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:21.980
I wish I could tell you that it was because
of the barriers to professional women suddenly

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.959
dropping because of all of the wonderful opportunities
there were for professional women.

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:32.339
No, the primary reason women went into paid
work in those years was to prop up family

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:37.670
incomes that were declining because male wages
were under so much stress.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:42.930
But there was only a limit to how long and
how much that coping mechanism could work

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.860
which brings up to coping mechanism number
two and that was everybody working longer

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.670
hours.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.360
When I was Secretary of Labor I used to go
out around America, talk to people, and everybody

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.800
was complaining not about joblessness.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.990
Certainly by '95, '96, '97 they were talking
about the hours they were putting in.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:08.410
[pause]
Overtime if they were hourly workers, billable

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.329
hours if they were professionals.

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:14.790
Everybody was working, in fact the data showed
the typical American worker in those years

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:21.180
putting in more hours than the typical hugely
industrious Japanese worker.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.589
[pause]
But that coping mechanism number two obviously

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:25.760
also had a limit.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.100
You couldn't just keep on working forever.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.800
In fact if you had both parents working as
you did in those days long hours how did they

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.870
ever see each other, they were kind of ships
passing in the night.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:45.100
I used to use a demographic term to describe
these families: dins, d-i-n-s, double income,

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.480
no sex.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.309
[laughter]
And then you come to this past decade and

00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:57.570
what's the third and final coping mechanism?

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.279
Remember wages are still flat.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:04.850
In fact since 2001 the median wage in the
United States adjusted for inflation has actually

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.439
been going down.

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:13.920
So what is the third and final coping mechanism
to continue to spend as if, as if you're actually

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.550
your wages were going up?
[several voices speaking at one time]

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.600
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Debts, yes class.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600
[laughter]
Debt.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.319
And it was actually relatively painless because
those housing prices were bid upward.

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:32.480
You could just get home equity loans or you
could turn your house into a kind of ATM and

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.499
many people did that.

00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:39.779
Trillions of dollars pulled out of houses
during those years, but with the housing bubble

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:48.240
finally bursting, as all bubbles eventually
do, that third and final coping mechanism

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.209
is now exhausted.

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:54.910
[pause]
And so what we face today is not simply a

00:15:54.910 --> 00:16:02.170
Keynesian demand management problem in which
government can prime the pump, it's more profound

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.610
than that.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.130
[pause]
The American middle class has now run out

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:16.149
of ways to deal with a crisis or a problematic
situation, the word crisis is overused, a

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:22.449
problematic situation that actually goes back
30 years.

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:27.619
[pause]
Shortly after the President was elected he

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:32.949
called together some of the people who had
been advising him to find out sort of their

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:33.949
opinions.

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:35.040
What should he do now?

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.990
And what was the fundamental problem?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:42.720
You know in your work defining the problem
is almost the most important stage.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:50.180
In public policy, as I teach my students and
as my experience has indicated over my career,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:56.420
defining the problem, getting the problem
right is 90 percent of the issue.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.779
And the President wanted to know what's the
problem?

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:05.620
And he went around the table and various people
had various views and Paul Volcker was there,

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.810
he's very tall --
[laughter]

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.640
when we talk it's.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.160
And he said, "The problem Mr. President is
that the American public, the vast middle

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.290
class, is and has been spending beyond its
means."

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.610
[pause]
That statement is a mirror of what you hear

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.070
very often.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:28.450
We have been spending beyond our means.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.200
And that is literally true if you followed
the logic that I gave you over the last 30

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.990
years we eventually did, we borrowed, we spent
beyond our means.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.470
But there's a different definition of the
problem which I think is more accurate and

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:46.350
more important and that is the means of most
Americans have not kept up with what a growing,

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:52.330
burgeoning economy could have and should have
been able to provide them as it did in the

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.930
30 years after the second World War.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.370
[pause]
And so that if we're going to do anything

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:06.300
fundamentally sustainable about the economy
we've got to do something about this underlying

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:13.560
issue having to do with the stagnation of
wages for most people.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.920
[pause]
Interestingly when I, yes, yes.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.200
&gt;&gt;female #1: This is the rule right?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200
We all know it well.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.370
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well let me just finish my
point and then I'll get to your questions

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:33.450
'cause this is really the point that I have
to make and I'm giving myself another 10 minutes.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:39.110
[laughter]
You see the question I just asked you has

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.520
a lot to do with widening and equality because
remember the economy continues to get more

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.230
and more productive through most of this period
apart from the fact that, and the GDP continues

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.630
to grow, so the question is if the median
wage is stagnant and if households even with

00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:00.830
women in paid work, even all of these coping
mechanisms still are not doing all that better,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.040
well then where are, where's all the money
going?

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:09.510
And the answer is the money is going to the
top.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:16.040
[pause]
In the 1970s the wealthiest one percent of

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:23.770
Americans were getting about 11 percent of
total national income.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:29.620
[pause]
By 2007, just before the crash, the top one

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:36.170
percent was getting 23 1/2 percent of total
national income.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:41.510
[pause]
The last time, incidentally, the top one percent

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:49.440
got anything close, in fact not coincidentally
exactly 23 1/2 percent of total national income

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.850
was 1928.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:20:00.890
[pause]
Marriner Eccles, a man who I urge you to find

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:08.990
out more about, he was the head of the Federal
Reserve Board from 1934 to 1948, did a study

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.610
in the early 50s and tried to determine the
causes of the Great Depression.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:24.050
And his conclusion was that you had such inequality
by the time of the middle and late 1920s that

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:31.160
the only way the vast middle class of America
could continue to spend on a scale required

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.310
to keep the economy going was by going deeper
and deeper and deeper into debt and that was

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.190
not sustainable.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.740
[pause]
And therefore that debt bubble eventually

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.920
burst.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.250
Meanwhile the people at the top, given that
vast fortunes income and wealth were becoming

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:53.440
more and more concentrated by the late 20s,
the economy was prone, was more fragile, prone

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.740
to boons and busts because the investor class
was getting, although at the margin there

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.400
were a lot of other people investing but the
basic, the big investment class they were

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.530
getting smaller and smaller and they were
all making the same kinds of investments and

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.340
there was a speculative boon going on as well.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.860
[pause]
And you read Marriner Eccles and it is exactly

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.090
as if you were reading about ?
[pause]

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:23.390
the 1990's and 2000's in America.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.700
[pause]
So let me end by just talking about the question

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.780
I left on the table which is what happened
in the late 70s and early 80s that might have

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:41.080
led to this fundamental change in the structure
and earnings of the labor market here in the

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.080
United States?

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.260
What does that teach us once we understand
that?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:52.300
And does it have anything to do with what
happened in the first decades of the 20th

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300
century?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.930
What happened --
[pause]

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:07.710
in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing on has
a lot to do with your field.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:14.520
It has a lot to do with technology because
by the 1970s certain technologies were coming

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.680
on stream:
[pause]

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.270
cargo ships, containers,
[pause]

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:28.420
satellite communication technologies, automated
technologies.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.710
You see some of these technologies allowed
for the first time --

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:36.310
[pause]
American companies and foreign companies to

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:42.370
sell in the United States at relatively low
cost transportation and communication technologies.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:50.010
Other technologies led to automation eventually
computers, eventually the Internet really

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.460
displaced an awful lot of people from jobs
that had been relatively high paid and relatively

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.780
unionized; they were service jobs.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.330
[pause]
It doesn't matter what you were talking about

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:07.690
if you were in routine work, if you were an
American worker in routine work, day to day

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.210
did the same thing over and over again, and
don't get me wrong I'm not recommending we

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:15.450
go back to those days because those were boring
jobs many of them.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.480
But if you were doing the same thing over
and over again you were either replaced by

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.660
foreign workers who could do it more cheaply
or by automated machinery that could do it

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.500
more cheaply --
[pause]

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.440
leaving two categories of job--
[pause]

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.880
left.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:40.410
The largest category by far were personal
service jobs that could not be done by automated

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:49.820
machinery because the essence of the job was
attention and service: retail, restaurant,

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:59.470
hotel, hospital, teaching, a lot of jobs that
are basically still there in fact most of

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:05.470
our wage and payroll and job growth in the
last 30 years has been in the personal service

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.500
sector of the economy.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.090
The problem is these jobs don't pay very much.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.730
Supply and demand; the supply is very large,
demand is not all that large, productivity

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:19.690
is limited in terms of productivity enhancements
and the educational background is not very

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.500
necessarily high --
[pause]

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.500
except for teachers.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.110
I am a teacher --
[laughter]

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.100
very hard to be a teacher.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.100
But then the other job category much fewer,
many, many fewer people and you all fit into

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.030
this other category, these are people with
enough education and the right kind of education

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:45.800
and the right connections to really take advantage
of globalization and technological change.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:52.570
[pause]
Their productivity, their importance in the

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.260
economy kept on increasing.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.370
[pause]
We went from an economy based on high volume,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.990
standardized, stable, mass production, economies
were scaled --

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.170
[pause]
to an economy based on innovation in which

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.420
the major barrier to entry was continuous
innovation.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.720
Making these people, the innovators, well
educated, well connected, able to identify

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.240
and solve problems the most valuable people
around, i.e., Google.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.840
[laughter]
[pause]

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.480
So this story that I'm telling you is not
about blame --

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.440
[pause]
this is about progress.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:46.030
[pause]
The problem is that the fruits of our productivity

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:51.660
increases and they have been dramatic partly
because of you guys.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.600
The fruits of those productivity increases,
instead of being shared as they were in the

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:03.140
first three decades after the second World
War, are now not being shared.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.890
Almost all the gains from economic growth
have gone to the top and that is not sustainable

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.150
economically.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:18.120
It may not be sustainable politically and
it may not be sustainable morally, but it's

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.320
not sustainable economically either.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.010
[pause]
What we see now across the country is a degree

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:32.230
of insecurity, economic insecurity that I've
not seen in my lifetime.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:38.290
And economic insecurity translates, remember
politics, economics, politics, economics,

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:46.970
moral philosophy, economic insecurity translates
into fertile ground for demagogues who want

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:53.250
to channel those angers and frustrations at
easy targets.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.710
[pause]
Immigrants --

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:59.420
[pause]
the poor, the rich --

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:07.070
[pause]
government, foreigners --

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.930
[pause]
the French --

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:16.410
[laughter]
[pause]

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.320
So the stakes here are really very, very high.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.200
And when I was invited to come down and talk
with you I jumped at the chance because you

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:32.490
are problem solvers, you have generated huge
productivity increases in terms of information

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:41.990
technology and I beseech you, I urge you,
to take on what I consider to be, along with

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:48.180
environmental change, climate change, the
other big issue in our society and in other

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.170
societies not just happening here for the
same reason it's happening all over the world,

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:59.910
and that is widening inequality and it's social,
political, and economic consequences.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:04.680
[pause]
And report back to me.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.180
[laughter]
Thank you.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.180
[applause]
Now ,

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.680
[applause]

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:21.530
now we have a half hour for your questions
and hopefully my comments.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.530
Yes.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.030
&gt;&gt;male #2: So one of your measures was median
wages, I assume you're only talking about

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.620
American median wages and you said that they
went stagnant; you added more women, you worked

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.090
longer, we acquired debt.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.620
But I can think of at least two other ways
that we can, actually let me phrase it this

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.260
way: I don't know if wages is the right metric.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:49.280
I think a better metric would be post-taxes
purchasing power.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.020
So even though I'm making the same amount
of money on wages, I may still have a better

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.680
standard of living because some of my costs
have gone down.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.730
So if we shift the argument to that metric
--

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.660
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yeah, let's call it disposable
income after taxes.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: Right.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.370
I also wanna throw in there though the efficiency
of the dollar that I get to spend as well

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:14.440
because productivity may allow me to buy more
for that dollar as well.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.890
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yep.
&gt;&gt;male #2: So does your argument of stagnation

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.760
change under that other metric?

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:26.200
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well the two things you put
on the table: one, disposable income after

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200
taxes.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:33.690
What we've seen is that the tax system if
you include payroll taxes which have become

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:42.860
more regressive and also state sales taxes
which are quite regressive and also state

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:51.310
property taxes which on balance are pretty
regressive and tolls and all the service fees

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:56.940
that we now see being imposed, which are very
regressive, but we have an income tax that

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.940
is pretty progressive.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:05.260
If you add it all together the whole system
is almost a wash.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:13.120
Now I say that advisedly because the Bush
tax cuts really did make the income tax system

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.120
more regressive.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.360
And as you know if we have a 15 percent capital
gains tax and a lot of people at the top are

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:25.120
gaming their income so that more and more
of it appears as capital gains, so obviously

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.070
Warren Buffett says truthfully he's paying
17 percent tax.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:34.940
And you've got the top 400, the wealthiest
400 Americans last year according to the IRS

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.740
paying 17 percent tax because they gamed the
system.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.890
So if you include all of that the system is
quite regressive.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.890
Back to your question.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:49.450
Is there a way of making after-tax income
more progressive making up for the stagnation

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.600
of median wages?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.510
Yes, tax reform I think is going to be a huge
battle and a very important battle but all

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:02.290
we hear is you can't raise taxes on the rich
and you have to in fact lower taxes on the

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:08.170
rich which is exactly what we don't wanna
do for obvious reasons [chuckles] and it's

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.970
kind of absurd anyway given what has happened
to the labor force.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:19.800
The second point you asked had to do with
how expensive goods are.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.410
If goods really become less and less expensive
then the dollar goes further.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:30.580
The answer is that our measures of inflation,
and when I say inflation adjusted income,

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:37.160
should but don't really do terribly well,
but should take into account the average costs

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.350
for people.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.950
It's complicated, messy business.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:51.250
A computer today, a laptop or a tablet obviously
is going to have much more power than anything

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.020
sold three or four or five years ago and how
do you measure that?

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:04.510
They're two different products but how does
the Bureau of Economics, Commerce Department,

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.360
and others measure that?

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:12.800
The most important point there to know is
that medical costs have risen dramatically

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.910
for most people.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.890
If you count in co-payments, deductibles,
and the fact that companies are saying to

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.240
them, "You bear more and more of the cost
of your health care."

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.850
Housing costs have soared for most people,
that's not gonna be the case much longer because

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.870
housing prices are going down.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:36.990
But if you wanted to get into the housing
market or even a renter today still in areas

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.000
like this area, in the Bay Area, it's still
paying a huge amount.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.320
Food and fuel we never know, they are wild
cards but they're long term trend of fuel

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.570
has been up, the long term trend of food has
been down.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.770
[pause]
Other questions?

00:32:54.770 --> 00:33:00.441
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #3: So you talk a lot about you know

00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:01.441
obviously now there's greater concentration
--

00:33:01.441 --> 00:33:04.070
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: You have, I can hear you but
I think you have to flick --

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.280
[pause]
[sound of tapping on microphone]

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.760
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #3: Sorry --

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.530
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: You just destroyed--
[laughter]

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.530
that microphone.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.530
Yeah.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:17.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #3: You talked a lot, wow this is loud.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.800
I guess now seeing how wealth is really concentrated
at the top and I think the statistic has been

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.370
that amongst mature, modern economies the
U.S. has the greatest disparity of wealth

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:34.200
almost akin to emerging economies, so I guess
what are the mechanisms that will allow for

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.930
the transfer of wealth between the wealthiest
to achieve a better distribution?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:44.880
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well this country doesn't
like direct redistribution, we never have.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.880
As I suggested we could have a more progressive
tax system combined with something I did not

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.470
mention and that is a bigger earned income
tax credit.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:59.970
The EITC is now essentially the biggest anti-poverty
program we have in this country.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:06.200
And that would be the closest we could possibly
get if we ever got there to a quote redistribution

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.510
although don't use that word.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.599
[laughter]
Over the longer term there are many things

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:15.919
we could do starting with the word education,
early childhood education for example we know

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:23.099
has a huge return in terms of the ability
of people to have more fulfilled and fulfilling

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:28.309
lives and also contribute to more value and
get higher wages.

00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:34.679
And what concerns me right now is that we
seem to be going in the opposite direction

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.740
even there.

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:43.619
State budgets are whacking public higher education
and public K-12 education all over this country

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:49.210
and actually reducing early childhood education
or even childcare.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:59.539
It's as if we have kind of an invasion of
the body snatchers problem in which for some

00:34:59.539 --> 00:35:04.440
reason collectively we are doing exactly opposite
of what needs to be done.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.880
[pause]
How's that for an upbeat message?

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.880
[laughter]
Yes.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.349
&gt;&gt;male #4: So the changes the 70s, 80s, 90s
changes were all structural changes and they

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:22.730
had the effect of making it easier for everything
to flow to and from the rest of the world

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:27.420
creating a more level playing field and so
we're still trying to reach equilibrium there

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:35.339
and you see it showing up in China and other
third world countries as increased exports

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:39.019
and standard of living.

00:35:39.019 --> 00:35:42.470
You didn't say what was the structural change
leading up to 1928 and I'm guessing --

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.779
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well yeah --
&gt;&gt;male #4: it was people running away from

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:48.779
the farms.

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:49.779
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yeah.

00:35:49.779 --> 00:35:51.119
Let me get to that.

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:55.029
You have two questions on the table and I
wanna make sure there's enough time for everybody's

00:35:55.029 --> 00:35:56.029
question.

00:35:56.029 --> 00:36:01.650
Your first question I take it is are we moving
to a kind of equilibrium state worldwide in

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.970
which we're leveling the playing field and
does that, I'm reading into your question,

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:10.040
does that necessarily mean that a lot of Americans
are going to have to settle for a lowered

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.070
living standard in the future?

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.509
&gt;&gt;male #4: Not actually that but if that's
the case what can be done?

00:36:16.509 --> 00:36:18.450
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Okay.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:24.710
And I think the answer, the answer there is
that it is not a zero sum game.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:30.559
China's improvements or productivity gains
or however else we wanna measure their competitiveness

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:33.349
does not come at our expense.

00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:39.960
In fact what we have learned, and I hope we
learn this very profoundly and explicitly,

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:47.470
is there is no limit to the needs of human
kind that need to be met and there is no limit

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:53.809
or finite limit that we've identified to the
ingenuity of the human mind in meeting those

00:36:53.809 --> 00:36:54.809
needs.

00:36:54.809 --> 00:37:03.049
China will grow and we could if we had, and
hopefully we do have the ingenuity, to generate

00:37:03.049 --> 00:37:08.119
all sorts of answers to human problems including
problems that China has.

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:12.980
So there is not an equilibrium it is a non,
we never reach equilibrium, we've never reached

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.759
equilibrium there's a constant process of
dynamic change.

00:37:16.759 --> 00:37:25.450
The question is how many of our fellow countrymen
and women are going to be brought along on

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:31.769
the tides, the positive tides of that change
or are we going to split even more than we

00:37:31.769 --> 00:37:32.769
have split now?

00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:38.069
How do we get back to where we were in terms
of everybody enjoying the fruits of economic

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:41.140
growth and productivity enhancing technologies?

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.840
The second part of your question was, I've
already forgotten.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.059
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #4: What happened in the 20s --

00:37:49.059 --> 00:37:50.730
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Oh, yeah.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.059
&gt;&gt;male #4: both here and in China?

00:37:53.059 --> 00:37:57.940
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: What happened between 1900
and 1928 that led to the huge disparities

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.859
and it was partly a move from farms to factories.

00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:06.670
Remember one of the things propelling the
move from farms to factories in this country

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:12.749
as well as in China and around the world at
different time areas is the increasing productivity

00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.630
of agriculture.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:19.690
That was a good thing it was not a bad thing,
but it did mean that there were not that many

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.700
jobs for people on farms that paid all that
much.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:29.529
They were attracted to better jobs in urban
areas but they didn't pay relative to, and

00:38:29.529 --> 00:38:31.990
here's the answer.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:43.799
We had huge consolidation around economies
of scale between 1900 and 1928.

00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:50.640
And those huge consolidations in the giant
mega businesses and mega industries generated

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:59.670
a lot of wealth at the top for those entrepreneurs
and those heads of large corporations and

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:05.890
their owners, but also a lot of squalor.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:12.339
Social costs of urban poverty between 1890
and 1920 were enormous.

00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:18.819
[pause]
And so again we saw even the middle class

00:39:18.819 --> 00:39:25.549
without unions, without social supports, without
safety nets starting to fall and depend more

00:39:25.549 --> 00:39:31.829
and more and more on debt until that debt
bubble burst.

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:37.809
Henry Ford was one of the few and I'm not
in any way extolling the virtues of Henry

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:41.230
Ford, in many ways he was not [chuckles] terribly
virtuous.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:46.579
But in one respect he understood something
that we do understand today and that is when

00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:56.060
he in 1914 at his Model T Ford plant offered
his employees five dollars a day which in

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:01.869
those days was three times, almost three times
the typical factory worker's salary.

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:08.589
The Wall Street Journal excoriated him as
being non-American and a socialist.

00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:14.730
But Henry Ford knew something that other CEOs
and other entrepreneurs did not know and that

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:22.539
is that his factory workers if they earned
enough would turn around and buy Model T Fords.

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:24.200
&gt;&gt;male #4: Uh-huh.
[laughter]

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.210
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: And he was right.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:34.309
Workers are consumers, consumers are workers
getting back to the fundamental economic problem

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:36.769
of widening and equality.

00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:38.809
Other questions?

00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:43.250
[pause]
Can we have a female please?

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.079
[laughter]
I don't mean literally I just mean --

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:48.651
[laughter]
a question by a lady.

00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:49.651
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #5: Can you tell us where we can hire

00:40:49.651 --> 00:40:50.651
some?

00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:51.651
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;female #2: There was a question over there.

00:40:51.651 --> 00:40:55.609
&gt;&gt;female #3: I have a question --
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yeah.

00:40:55.609 --> 00:41:02.989
[pause]
&gt;&gt;female #3: specifically about the role that

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:11.339
you think the finance industries had and I
think as an outsider it seems like that there's

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:18.470
not being a lot done as to like the role that
finance played in creating this predicament

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:26.450
specifically like Goldman Sachs, big financial
firms and how that conundrum people in this

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.670
room could maybe work towards improving.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:29.760
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yeah.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.180
Well you know there are two kinds of entrepreneurs
and innovation that we've seen in this country

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.140
take off over the last 40 years.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:46.690
One are the technological or product entrepreneurs
of which Google is one of the best examples,

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.890
and then there are the financial entrepreneurs.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.790
And unfortunately, and I say unfortunately
advisedly and I'll come back to why I say

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:59.430
unfortunately, the financial entrepreneurs
have really dominated in terms of entrepreneurship

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:04.099
and innovation in this country partly 'cause
that's where you can make a huge amount of

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:10.190
money relatively easily because all you have
to do is be in a place and in a spot where

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.960
you can nick off a little bit of, a little
percentage of a huge amount of money that

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.529
is passing by you.

00:42:18.529 --> 00:42:20.660
It's like owning the casino.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.690
[laughter]
And that is what has happened.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.940
A financial deregulation has proven a complete
disaster.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.519
We knew it and learned it in the 1930's that's
why we passed the Glass-Steagall Act separating

00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:38.690
commercial from investment banking and that's
why we actually did have a Federal Deposit

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.710
Insurance Corporation, we made sure that you
could not over leverage the financial system

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.559
because we knew that was dangerous.

00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:50.880
And yet beginning with the Clinton Administration,
this happened in late years of the Clinton

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.760
Administration, there was deregulation, we
got rid of Glass-Steagall, we continued to

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:01.309
get rid of banking regulations, and what do
you expect, what do you expect?

00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:08.450
One of the real underlying problems which
I have not got into is the political power

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:12.800
that comes with having all of this money at
the top.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.509
And the financial community has basically
been one of the major contributors to both

00:43:17.509 --> 00:43:25.009
Democrats and Republicans and so even when
we get so-called financial reform we get financial

00:43:25.009 --> 00:43:32.799
reform with loopholes so large that anybody
on Wall Street can drive their --

00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:35.720
[pause]
[laughter]

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.369
their Porsches through it.

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:45.319
[laughter]
So it's a, that is a continuing big problem.

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:49.950
[pause]
Yes, who else?

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:50.950
Yes.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:57.170
&gt;&gt;male #6: Do you think that large transfer
payments like in Sweden and Denmark with progressive

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:02.530
taxation and then a labor market that's service
and innovation at separate parts would be

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.789
enough to improve equality or do you think
we would need more changes to the labor market?

00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:11.720
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: As I said before I think transfer
payments are very difficult to pull off, particularly

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.720
in the United States.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:21.420
There's a lot of easily churned up resentment,
you get a particular point of view advanced

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:27.400
which does have merit but not nearly the [chuckles]
amount of merit it claims it has and that

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.700
is, for want of a better term, the Laffer
curve.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:37.660
Obviously people need to have incentives,
inequality to some extent is a natural and

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.930
inevitable byproduct of a dynamic economy
in which you want to give people appropriate

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:49.249
incentives to invest and to invent and work
hard.

00:44:49.249 --> 00:44:53.339
But the question is how much incentive they
need.

00:44:53.339 --> 00:45:03.779
Between 1946 and 1979, 1980 the economy was
growing faster with a higher marginal tax

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:06.089
by far --
[pause]

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:10.040
than we've had ever since when the economy
since then has grown slower and the marginal

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.809
taxes have been half on the top incomes what
they were.

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:19.650
And marginal taxes in the first 30 years after
World War II were always above 70 percent

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.869
on highest incomes.

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:25.259
[pause]
And even after you got rid of deductions and

00:45:25.259 --> 00:45:30.779
credits still the highest income people in
the United States were paying a marginal income

00:45:30.779 --> 00:45:34.950
tax that was way above 50 percent.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:40.190
Now we're battling, we're going to battle
over whether we keep it at 35 percent or go

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.420
to 39 percent which was what it was under
Bill Clinton, the highest marginal income

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.170
tax.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:54.680
Now I don't know about you but all the economic
data show that economic growth since taxes

00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:04.950
have been reduced on the top has not generated
huge spur in economic growth and indeed after

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:13.230
the Bush tax cuts of 2001, 2003 what we've
seen is median wages dropping and far fewer

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.140
jobs being created in the United States.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.140
Over George W. Bush's two terms 8 million
jobs.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:26.290
Over Bill Clinton's two terms 22 million new
jobs.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.140
And I was Labor Secretary and I deserve credit
for every --

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.150
[laughter]
one of those.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.670
[laughter]
Thank you.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.180
[laughter]
Thank you.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.700
[laughter]
Thank you.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.940
[applause]
Other questions?

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.940
Yes.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.450
&gt;&gt;male #7: So in terms of fixing structural
problems.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.000
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Oh we have to get a mic to
you.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.570
&gt;&gt;male #7: Yeah in terms of fixing the structural
problems you brought up rather than just establishing

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:54.170
redistribution, would you say that education
is the key to expanding the top as opposed

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.529
to having the amount of people stagnating
in the middle?

00:46:56.529 --> 00:47:00.609
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Yeah education is about 70
percent of it.

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:06.099
But let me just emphasize it can't possibly
be only education.

00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:11.940
That is I've been in communities where you've
got young people going to school whose stomachs

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:18.109
are empty and who have tooth decay problems
and have been up all night because of noise.

00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:22.069
They're not learning and it's not the school's
fault that they're not learning it's because

00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:25.910
they are in an environment and they don't
have the proper health care, they don't have

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:29.400
the proper environment to learn.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:38.739
So we've got to conceive of this as a package
of problems in terms of the, creating genuine

00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:44.019
equal opportunity in this country which we
used to talk about a lot and we sort of lost

00:47:44.019 --> 00:47:45.019
sight of.

00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:47.109
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #7: So would you say the solution is

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:53.470
through direct support to those people like
social outreach or it is to getting them enough

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.869
redistribution payments to allow them to have
a standard of living that lets them lift themselves

00:47:56.869 --> 00:47:57.869
up?

00:47:57.869 --> 00:47:59.039
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Well I would do several things.

00:47:59.039 --> 00:48:04.359
I would strengthen as I said early childhood
education, I would make the public schools

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:09.359
much better, now to some extent that means
teachers have got to be paid for performance,

00:48:09.359 --> 00:48:13.470
but I'll tell you something that means we
also have to increase teacher pay.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:18.450
The law of supply and demand is not eliminated
at the school house door.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:23.890
If we want talented people to go into teaching
we've got to pay them enough to compete with

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.579
other places where talented people are needed
in society.

00:48:27.579 --> 00:48:30.200
Thirdly, access to public higher education.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.829
I teach at the University of California Berkeley.

00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:39.970
I teach at the best, I believe, institution
of public higher education in the world but

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:46.170
it is systematically being attacked and maybe
dismantled because of what is happening in

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.829
this State.

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:53.150
[pause]
Does an organization like Apple or Facebook

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:58.740
or Google or the major entertainment industries
or the major venture capital centers of the

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:05.749
State of California do they have any responsibility
with regard to education, early childhood

00:49:05.749 --> 00:49:11.589
up through access to public higher education
in this State which used to be preeminent

00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:13.749
in public education?

00:49:13.749 --> 00:49:15.410
Well it's a rhetorical question.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.180
[laughter]
[pause]

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.599
&gt;&gt;male #8: There we go.

00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:28.559
Now I know you've written a bit about manufacturing
and how the manufacturing base in this country

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:34.059
has shrunk quite a bit because of the, well
technology.

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:40.059
I think you talked about going to a factory
in Indiana where there were very few workers

00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:42.050
because everyone was working on computers.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:47.339
Now if we accept that in the short run we're
not going to have a large proportion or a

00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:52.509
majority of Americans going to college and
getting the better education that you're talking

00:49:52.509 --> 00:49:57.509
about, what can we do for these people, what
kind of jobs can we create for them that would

00:49:57.509 --> 00:50:00.579
have been in the manufacturing base before?

00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:07.420
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: The question you're raising
again it's complicated and given the time

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.660
constraints I'm gonna try to just highlight
the most important issues.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:19.960
I think we do have to go from a system of
K-12 universal hopefully high quality, we're

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:27.220
not nearly there yet, education to K-14, where
11th and 12th grade and maybe, and then the

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:33.059
following two years which could be called
junior college or community college or whatever

00:50:33.059 --> 00:50:41.619
are like the German example focused on high
tech skills and learning to learn skills.

00:50:41.619 --> 00:50:50.029
So that a far larger proportion of our population
really is able to engage in a variety of tasks,

00:50:50.029 --> 00:50:52.200
precision manufacturing would be one.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:58.789
People say to me sometimes, "What you say
makes sense but that golden age, that so called

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:05.190
golden age from 30 years after the second
World War to 1980 we'll never get that back

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:09.960
again because in those years we didn't really
have to compete very hard with Japan and China

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.049
and Europe."

00:51:11.049 --> 00:51:14.859
And I say back, "You have it wrong.

00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:21.210
If you want an example right now of a country
that is doing pretty well it's Germany."

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:25.690
And how is Germany doing well even though
it is integrating all of the East German very,

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:31.890
very difficult social and economic, financial
problem, Germany is doing well because it

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:38.420
has a first class educational system not just
for the elite but for a large portion of its

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.960
middle class and its so called working class.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:47.809
It also has very powerful trade unions that
have prevented the top one percent from grabbing,

00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:54.690
that's a pejorative term, erase that, scribe
that, from getting the 20 or 23 percent of

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.229
the total national income.

00:51:56.229 --> 00:52:01.470
In Germany the top one percent gets, receives
11 percent of total national income.

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:07.410
So there is a much more equitable distribution
of gains from economic growth.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:10.109
Germany is a major exporter of manufactured
items.

00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:14.650
Well how can that be when manufacturing is
centered in China?

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:23.680
Because Germany's focused on precision manufacturing,
the highest end of manufacturing and system

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.329
integration that goes along with that high
end precision manufacturing.

00:52:28.329 --> 00:52:29.329
Yes.

00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:35.059
I don't wanna keep you longer, we'll just
go five more minutes, alright?

00:52:35.059 --> 00:52:36.059
Yes.

00:52:36.059 --> 00:52:39.220
&gt;&gt;male #9: You started out your talk by saying
the government is the spender of last resort

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:46.200
but of course the debt hysteria seems to be
ruling out fiscal stimulus but the modern

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:53.239
monetary theorists have come up with an alternative
plan which is to not issue treasuries for

00:52:53.239 --> 00:53:00.130
the government to just spend like [bad audio]
a good idea or --

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.440
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: The Weimar Republic is their
model?

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.670
&gt;&gt;male #9: No --
[laughter]

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:04.789
obviously not.

00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:09.249
No [laughs] the people who disagree with the
modern monetary theorists say that we'll go

00:53:09.249 --> 00:53:11.799
the way of the Weimar Republic if they do
this.

00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:16.079
The people who agree with them say that because
we are in a balance sheet recession with the

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:18.259
output gap that this can be safely done.

00:53:18.259 --> 00:53:19.660
What is your opinion on --
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: I,

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.660
&gt;&gt;male #9 this question.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:25.339
&gt;Robert Reich: I wanna, this gives me a good
opportunity to summarize and we don't have

00:53:25.339 --> 00:53:29.789
much time so let me just do a quick three
minute summary.

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:37.700
In my view when you have this great a gap
between the productive capacity of the economy

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:43.410
at or near full employment, and define full
employment in the same way we defined it in

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:48.119
the late 90s, we got down to four percent
unemployment.

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:53.779
There's such a gap between that and where
we are today in terms of production and aggregate

00:53:53.779 --> 00:53:58.339
demand that you don't wanna risk inflation.

00:53:58.339 --> 00:54:04.979
If you expand monetary policy at the same
time you will have an expansive fiscal policy.

00:54:04.979 --> 00:54:11.119
And indeed both of them can help you grow
the economy and the most important thing you

00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:17.229
want right now in terms of dealing with the
long term debt is growth because what really

00:54:17.229 --> 00:54:23.980
drives the debt is not so much debt per se
it's the ratio of the debt to the GDP.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:29.779
When I was a small boy my father used to say
to me, "Bobby, your children and your grandchildren

00:54:29.779 --> 00:54:34.690
will be paying down the debt of Franklin D.
Roosevelt throughout their lifetimes."

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.880
So I was only six years old I didn't know
what the debt was but I had nightmares --

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.309
[laughter]
about this.

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.680
[laughter]
Well it turned out that my children never

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.970
mentioned FDR's debt and my --
[laughter]

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:50.049
and my grandchild, the last thing she has,
will ever be on her mind, not because we reduced

00:54:50.049 --> 00:54:53.900
the amount of public spending that much.

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:58.559
Remember went from the second World War to
a Cold War, we had a Korean War, we rebuilt

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:02.670
Japan, we rebuilt Europe, we had a highway
building program.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.579
No, it was because we grew so dramatically.

00:55:06.579 --> 00:55:11.309
And unless we restore growth and the easiest
way of restoring growth is through an expansive

00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:16.460
fiscal and monetary policy, we're going to
make that long term debt even worse.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.319
But --
[pause]

00:55:20.319 --> 00:55:28.410
here's the big b-u-t, the big but is that
fiscal and monetary policy will only carry

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:31.219
us so far.

00:55:31.219 --> 00:55:38.259
That is you can only prime the pump if there's
enough water in the well to begin with.

00:55:38.259 --> 00:55:44.039
And if the middle class, as I've been suggesting
today, if the vast middle class of America

00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:49.969
including what we used to call the working
class, if the vast middle class is not sharing

00:55:49.969 --> 00:55:58.079
in the gains from productivity growth, if
they have exhausted their means of continuing

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:03.079
to spend, and by the way, don't mix up consumption
and consumerism.

00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:08.160
When I say spend it could be spending on --
[pause]

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:14.349
art and music and a cleaner environment and
better health, it doesn't mean necessarily

00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:15.519
stuff.

00:56:15.519 --> 00:56:23.619
But unless they have the wherewithal to have
a higher standard of living in the future

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:29.079
and share the productivity gains there is
just not going to be enough aggregate demand

00:56:29.079 --> 00:56:37.630
in the system even if we have adequate fiscal
and monetary policy.

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:44.519
So putting to one side all of the moral and
ethical and political and systemic problems

00:56:44.519 --> 00:56:49.150
that come from widening and equality even
if you put all that aside, and my argument

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:53.950
to the richest members of society is you will
do better --

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:58.650
[pause]
with a smaller share of a rapidly growing

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:07.540
economy in which people feel comfortable,
they're not angry, they won't resort and support

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:14.680
demagogues then you will having a larger share
of an economy that's almost dead in the water

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.769
and a politics that's getting steadily angrier
and meaner.

00:57:18.769 --> 00:57:21.339
[pause]
&gt;&gt;female #4: Whoo-hoo.

00:57:21.339 --> 00:57:23.171
&gt;&gt;Robert Reich: Thank you for your time.

00:57:23.171 --> 00:57:23.181
[laughter]
[applause]
