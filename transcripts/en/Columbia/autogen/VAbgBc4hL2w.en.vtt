00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.330
part of the issues in this field are
that there aren't general standards for

what the problem is so what is research

this may seem like an obvious but in

this may seem like an obvious but in
fact I think that when we discuss

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000
fact I think that when we discuss
 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.480

in terms of what publishers institutions

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630
in terms of what publishers institutions
 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.630
in terms of what publishers institutions
and other bodies can do to some weed out

and other bodies can do to some weed out
 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.430
and other bodies can do to some weed out
misconduct but maybe what we as a

scientific community can also do to try

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930
scientific community can also do to try
 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.340
scientific community can also do to try
to prevent misconduct in the first place

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350
to prevent misconduct in the first place
 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.870
to prevent misconduct in the first place
so defining the problem what is research

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880
so defining the problem what is research
 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.240
so defining the problem what is research

not just science publishing but in
 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.840
not just science publishing but in
science and that fraud is rampant

to is just fraud running rampant in the

rise is it on the riser is this just a
 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:48.149
rise is it on the riser is this just a

overview piece from carl zimmer in the
 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.149
overview piece from carl zimmer in the
New York Times earlier this year that

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159
New York Times earlier this year that
 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.100
New York Times earlier this year that
has looked at retractions and

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110
has looked at retractions and
 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.319
has looked at retractions and
attractions are sort of documented to be

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:01.329
attractions are sort of documented to be
 

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:03.089
attractions are sort of documented to be
on the rise so one number that's been

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099
on the rise so one number that's been
 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:05.279
on the rise so one number that's been
put out is that retractions have gone up

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.289
put out is that retractions have gone up
 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.040
put out is that retractions have gone up
tenfold while the number of publications

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050
tenfold while the number of publications
 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.899
tenfold while the number of publications
has gone up only forty percent so

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909
has gone up only forty percent so
 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.009
has gone up only forty percent so
retractions are certainly on the

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:11.019
retractions are certainly on the
 

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:13.139
retractions are certainly on the
increase some other studies have looked

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:13.149
increase some other studies have looked
 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.629
increase some other studies have looked
at sort of in cases where retractions

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639
at sort of in cases where retractions
 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.429
at sort of in cases where retractions
can be analyzed through various meta

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439
can be analyzed through various meta
 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.489
can be analyzed through various meta
analyses and documented as to what the

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:20.499
analyses and documented as to what the
 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:23.399
analyses and documented as to what the
retraction stemmed from are the

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409
retraction stemmed from are the
 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.859
retraction stemmed from are the
instances of fraud leading to retraction

00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:25.869
instances of fraud leading to retraction
 

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:28.439
instances of fraud leading to retraction
up on the rise and that's less clear as

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449
up on the rise and that's less clear as
 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.189
up on the rise and that's less clear as
a percentage as you know as indicated

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199
a percentage as you know as indicated
 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.899

retraction statements still only less

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550
retraction statements still only less
 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.609
retraction statements still only less
than forty percent sometimes less than

00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:38.619
than forty percent sometimes less than
 

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:40.379
than forty percent sometimes less than
thirty percent of retractions or through

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389
thirty percent of retractions or through
 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:42.509
thirty percent of retractions or through
something that's documented as fraud or

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:42.519
something that's documented as fraud or
 

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:46.799
something that's documented as fraud or
misconduct as opposed to honest errors

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:46.809
misconduct as opposed to honest errors
 

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:48.419

issues of reproducibility and things

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:48.429
issues of reproducibility and things
 

00:07:48.429 --> 00:07:52.409
issues of reproducibility and things

so one as I've already told you it's

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:04.959
so one as I've already told you it's
 

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.449
so one as I've already told you it's
difficult to measure how much misconduct

00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:06.459
difficult to measure how much misconduct
 

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:09.600

there is we can talk about publications

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:09.610
there is we can talk about publications
 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.969
there is we can talk about publications
but publications are only one part of

as it happens the number of retracted
 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.240

now and as I said digital electronic

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.220
now and as I said digital electronic
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.680

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.690
media makes it easier to detect some
 

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.330
media makes it easier to detect some
kinds of fraud and plagiarism but I

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:24.340
kinds of fraud and plagiarism but I
 

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.740
kinds of fraud and plagiarism but I
think it's important to point out that

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:25.750
think it's important to point out that
 

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.290
think it's important to point out that
there's at types of fraud and plagiarism

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.300
there's at types of fraud and plagiarism
 

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.510
there's at types of fraud and plagiarism
that are much deeper than what you can

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:30.520
that are much deeper than what you can
 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.510
that are much deeper than what you can
detect with the current online resources

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:32.520
detect with the current online resources
 

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.040
detect with the current online resources
and I think there's some evidence you

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.050
and I think there's some evidence you
 

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.230
and I think there's some evidence you
know perhaps anecdotally that there are

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240
know perhaps anecdotally that there are
 

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.180
know perhaps anecdotally that there are
more minor cases of quite what we would

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.190
more minor cases of quite what we would
 

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.040
more minor cases of quite what we would
call questionable conduct so sloppiness

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.050

honest errors and more of these are

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.330
honest errors and more of these are
 

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.180
honest errors and more of these are
coming to light and certainly I think as

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.190
coming to light and certainly I think as
 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.070

an editor I'm seeing more of those in
the pre-publication review process and

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620
the pre-publication review process and
 

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.200
the pre-publication review process and
you know again some forms of ethically

this so it seems to be okay large

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:47.810
this so it seems to be okay large
 

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.660
this so it seems to be okay large
collaborations I mean how many people

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:49.670

well enough to know whether you should
trust them scientific blindsight there's

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:58.460
trust them scientific blindsight there's

trust them scientific blindsight there's
been some credible cases of this in the

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:01.430

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.050
larger communion I haven't seen so much
 

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.200
larger communion I haven't seen so much
of this in cell press but this idea that

well i'm sure my conclusions are right
 

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.470
well i'm sure my conclusions are right
and so it's okay for me to take

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480
and so it's okay for me to take
 

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.850
and so it's okay for me to take
shortcuts because this needs to get out

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:09.860

around what constitutes fraud and
 

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.190
around what constitutes fraud and

fraud or I think should be used as an
 

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000

excuse but they're worth considering
 

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.880

whether they contribute and maybe I will
 

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.950
whether they contribute and maybe I will

community as a whole you know a few
points that I would put out there is

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:57.920
points that I would put out there is
 

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.060
points that I would put out there is
that we can't let even minor cases of

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.070
that we can't let even minor cases of
 

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.390
that we can't let even minor cases of

there needs to be a hard and fast policy
that these are the ethical lines you

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:07.280
that these are the ethical lines you
 

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.620
that these are the ethical lines you
don't cross them people need to know

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:08.630
don't cross them people need to know

talks to students I make that really
 

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.430
talks to students I make that really
clear that just don't cross even the

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440
clear that just don't cross even the
 

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.830
clear that just don't cross even the
little line because it's your rep your

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840
little line because it's your rep your
 

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.120

these cases of fraud you know really
 

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.480
these cases of fraud you know really
need to pay close attention to their own

there was pasting that went on and so we

there was pasting that went on and so we
 

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.730
there was pasting that went on and so we
were able to decide ultimately sadly to

in this paper did he or she do it
 

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.440
in this paper did he or she do it
elsewhere and so our editor did a search

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:12.450
elsewhere and so our editor did a search
 

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.240

discovered duplicate bands pasting of

ferreted out prior to the publication

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:21.950
ferreted out prior to the publication
 

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:26.500
ferreted out prior to the publication
process and so is it a problem I think

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:26.510
process and so is it a problem I think
 

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:29.230
process and so is it a problem I think
it is it's a real problem if you look at

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240
it is it's a real problem if you look at
 

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.700
it is it's a real problem if you look at
all the number of all the OA journals

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:30.710
all the number of all the OA journals
 

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.500
all the number of all the OA journals
that are coming to the forefront some of

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:40.190
post-publication peer review which
 

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.190

suggests that a paper could be put out
 

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.670
suggests that a paper could be put out
there become part of the literature

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680
there become part of the literature
 

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:49.630

the previous two talks this is a major
 

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.960
the previous two talks this is a major
source of scientific misconduct and it

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:42.970
source of scientific misconduct and it
 

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.480

to address image manipulation at the
 

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.090
to address image manipulation at the
journal means we can address a lot of

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:51.100
journal means we can address a lot of
 

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.700

there are actually some practical

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:04.120
there are actually some practical
 

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.210
there are actually some practical
solutions that publishers can and should

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:06.220
solutions that publishers can and should
 

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.320
solutions that publishers can and should
take to address image manipulation so

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.330
take to address image manipulation so
 

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.090
take to address image manipulation so
you've already seen some statistics

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:12.100
you've already seen some statistics
 

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.930
you've already seen some statistics
about cases of image manipulation I want

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:15.940
about cases of image manipulation I want
 

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.720
about cases of image manipulation I want
to show another example here so this is

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:18.730
to show another example here so this is
 

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.790

office of research integrity looking at
the number of cases that Ori is dealing

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:26.260
the number of cases that Ori is dealing
 

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.900
the number of cases that Ori is dealing
with that have to do with questioned

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:27.910
with that have to do with questioned
 

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.390
with that have to do with questioned
images so these data were collected in

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400
images so these data were collected in
 

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.230
images so these data were collected in
two year period starting in 1989 and the

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240
two year period starting in 1989 and the
 

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.940
two year period starting in 1989 and the
latest data came out from two thousand

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:35.950
latest data came out from two thousand
 

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.130
latest data came out from two thousand
seven to two thousand eight so you can

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:38.140
seven to two thousand eight so you can
 

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.840
seven to two thousand eight so you can
see that in 1989 there were very few

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:39.850
see that in 1989 there were very few
 

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.820
see that in 1989 there were very few
cases less than five percent of the

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:41.830
cases less than five percent of the
 

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.470
cases less than five percent of the
cases that they were looking at they

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480
cases that they were looking at they
 

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.600
cases that they were looking at they
were dealing with questioned images but

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:45.610
were dealing with questioned images but
 

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.150
were dealing with questioned images but
look now ahead to 2007-2008 and you're

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160
look now ahead to 2007-2008 and you're
 

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.190
look now ahead to 2007-2008 and you're
talking about more than sixty percent of

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200
talking about more than sixty percent of
 

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.220
talking about more than sixty percent of
their cases so image manipulation is not

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.230
their cases so image manipulation is not
 

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.260
their cases so image manipulation is not
a new phenomenon but something like this

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:55.270
a new phenomenon but something like this
 

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.610
a new phenomenon but something like this
tells you it's an increasingly visible

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:56.620
tells you it's an increasingly visible
 

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.130

00:48:59.130 --> 00:48:59.140
 
 

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.880
 
so why do scientists manipulate images

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:02.890
so why do scientists manipulate images
 

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:04.590
so why do scientists manipulate images
some of this has already been touched on

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:04.600

on it I think one of the major

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:08.470
on it I think one of the major
 

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.410
on it I think one of the major
contributors is that we live in a

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:10.420
contributors is that we live in a
 

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.450

manipulation happens is that it's

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960
manipulation happens is that it's
 

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.840

sort of two flavors first of all there's

sort of two flavors first of all there's
 

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.570
sort of two flavors first of all there's
a lot of misunderstanding on the part of

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:24.580
a lot of misunderstanding on the part of
 

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.640
a lot of misunderstanding on the part of
scientists in terms of where the line is

and then as other people have mentioned
 

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.890
and then as other people have mentioned
there is probably in some cases a

scientists are manipulating images but I

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:47.470
scientists are manipulating images but I
 

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:48.570
scientists are manipulating images but I
do think that this is probably the

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:48.580
do think that this is probably the
 

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.130
do think that this is probably the
minority

whether we like it or not and the

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:55.470
whether we like it or not and the
 

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.140
whether we like it or not and the
question then is whose responsibility is

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.150
question then is whose responsibility is
 

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.180
question then is whose responsibility is
it to detect it and i would say that

00:50:59.180 --> 00:50:59.190
it to detect it and i would say that
 

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.799
it to detect it and i would say that

in a much smaller number of cases we see

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920
in a much smaller number of cases we see
 

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.550
in a much smaller number of cases we see
what we call fraudulent manipulation so

00:56:58.550 --> 00:56:58.560
what we call fraudulent manipulation so
 

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.109
what we call fraudulent manipulation so
this is fabrication or falsification

00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119
this is fabrication or falsification
 

00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:02.450
this is fabrication or falsification
that actually affects the interpretation

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460
that actually affects the interpretation
 

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.640
that actually affects the interpretation
of the data and this is why a scientist

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:04.650
of the data and this is why a scientist
 

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:06.380
of the data and this is why a scientist
has to be involved to actually look at

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.390
has to be involved to actually look at
 

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:08.210
has to be involved to actually look at
those data look at the manipulation and

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220
those data look at the manipulation and
 

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.920
those data look at the manipulation and
ask whether it has undermined any of the

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:09.930
ask whether it has undermined any of the
 

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.770
ask whether it has undermined any of the
conclusions if we find that any

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:12.780
conclusions if we find that any
 

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.599
conclusions if we find that any
conclusion in a paper is undermined by

00:57:14.599 --> 00:57:14.609
conclusion in a paper is undermined by
 

00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:19.760
conclusion in a paper is undermined by
the manipulation we revoke acceptance so

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:19.770
the manipulation we revoke acceptance so
 

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:21.170
the manipulation we revoke acceptance so
now the question is how big of a problem

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180
now the question is how big of a problem
 

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.500
now the question is how big of a problem
is this actually and is this worth doing

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:23.510
is this actually and is this worth doing
 

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:25.460
is this actually and is this worth doing
so JCB has been doing this

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:25.470
so JCB has been doing this
 

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.560
so JCB has been doing this
systematically for 10 years and to my

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:27.570
systematically for 10 years and to my
 

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.170
systematically for 10 years and to my
knowledge this is the only set of data

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:30.180
knowledge this is the only set of data
 

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.710
knowledge this is the only set of data
that a systematic study of image

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720

manipulation at a journal over time in
 

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.359
manipulation at a journal over time in
an unbiased manner what we've seen over

00:57:38.359 --> 00:57:38.369
an unbiased manner what we've seen over
 

00:57:38.369 --> 00:57:40.490
an unbiased manner what we've seen over
these ten years is that about half of

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500
these ten years is that about half of
 

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.230
these ten years is that about half of
our authors have to remake at least one

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240
our authors have to remake at least one
 

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.300
our authors have to remake at least one
figure and that can be for a simple

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:44.310
figure and that can be for a simple
 

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:46.970
figure and that can be for a simple
reason as one of the images isn't high

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980
reason as one of the images isn't high
 

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.589
reason as one of the images isn't high
enough resolution for us to actually do

00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599
enough resolution for us to actually do
 

00:57:48.599 --> 00:57:50.210
enough resolution for us to actually do
our screaming or it can be something

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220
our screaming or it can be something
 

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.720
our screaming or it can be something
much more complicated more than fifteen

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:53.730
much more complicated more than fifteen
 

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.700
much more complicated more than fifteen
percent of our authors have to provide

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:55.710
percent of our authors have to provide
 

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:57.410
percent of our authors have to provide
some level of original data for

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420
some level of original data for
 

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.510
some level of original data for
assessment and this can be anything from

00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520
assessment and this can be anything from
 

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.970
assessment and this can be anything from
a single film to dozens and dozens of

00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980
a single film to dozens and dozens of
 

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.270
a single film to dozens and dozens of

images it really depends on the case and
 

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.920
images it really depends on the case and
then the critical number here is that

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:06.930
then the critical number here is that

paper once we start asking questions so

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:17.310
paper once we start asking questions so
 

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.470
paper once we start asking questions so
that might not seem like a very big

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480
that might not seem like a very big
 

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.599
that might not seem like a very big
number but let me give you the actual

00:58:20.599 --> 00:58:20.609
number but let me give you the actual
 

00:58:20.609 --> 00:58:23.810
number but let me give you the actual
raw numbers here so in 10 years we have

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:23.820
raw numbers here so in 10 years we have
 

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.170
raw numbers here so in 10 years we have
screened 3478 papers we've requested

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180
screened 3478 papers we've requested
 

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.829
screened 3478 papers we've requested
original data in 572 cases and we have

00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839
original data in 572 cases and we have
 

00:58:30.839 --> 00:58:32.300
original data in 572 cases and we have
revoked acceptance so the authors have

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:32.310
revoked acceptance so the authors have
 

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:35.300
revoked acceptance so the authors have
withdrawn 37 papers so in asking how big

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:35.310
withdrawn 37 papers so in asking how big
 

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:37.339
withdrawn 37 papers so in asking how big
of an issue this is I would ask you what

00:58:37.339 --> 00:58:37.349
of an issue this is I would ask you what
 

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:38.930
of an issue this is I would ask you what
the ramifications the scientific

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940
the ramifications the scientific
 

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.940
the ramifications the scientific
community might have been if JCP had

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:40.950
community might have been if JCP had
 

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.740
community might have been if JCP had
published about four papers per year and

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:42.750
published about four papers per year and
 

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.599
published about four papers per year and
it we in which at least one of the

00:58:44.599 --> 00:58:44.609
it we in which at least one of the
 

00:58:44.609 --> 00:58:48.830
it we in which at least one of the
conclusions was not supported by the

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:48.840
 
 

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.970
 
so there's a point I want to make about

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:50.980
so there's a point I want to make about
 

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.140
so there's a point I want to make about
these data that we've been collecting

00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:52.150
these data that we've been collecting
 

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:55.050
these data that we've been collecting
over 10 years and that is that this one

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:55.060
over 10 years and that is that this one
 

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.760
over 10 years and that is that this one
percent this frequency of fraudulent

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:56.770
percent this frequency of fraudulent
 

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.070
percent this frequency of fraudulent
image manipulation has remained

00:58:59.070 --> 00:58:59.080
image manipulation has remained
 

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.490
image manipulation has remained
completely constant over 10 years at JCP

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:02.500
completely constant over 10 years at JCP
 

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.320
completely constant over 10 years at JCP
despite the fact that we are very very

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:04.330
despite the fact that we are very very
 

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.950
despite the fact that we are very very
vocal of other image screening policies

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960
vocal of other image screening policies
 

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.600
vocal of other image screening policies
so one interpretation of that might be

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:09.610
so one interpretation of that might be
 

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.070
so one interpretation of that might be
that systematic screening is not

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:11.080
that systematic screening is not
 

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.380
that systematic screening is not
actually a deterrent and so that might

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:13.390
actually a deterrent and so that might
 

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:14.880
actually a deterrent and so that might
discourage some journals from doing this

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:14.890
discourage some journals from doing this
 

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.730
discourage some journals from doing this
but I would like to emphasize that the

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:17.740
but I would like to emphasize that the
 

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.290
but I would like to emphasize that the
fact that it's not a deterrent does not

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:19.300
fact that it's not a deterrent does not
 

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.910
fact that it's not a deterrent does not
undermine the responsibility that

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920
undermine the responsibility that
 

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.500
undermine the responsibility that
journals have to protect the scientific

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:22.510
journals have to protect the scientific
 

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:23.940
journals have to protect the scientific
record so this is something that needs

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:23.950
record so this is something that needs
 

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:28.560
record so this is something that needs
to be done so I just want to briefly

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:28.570
to be done so I just want to briefly
 

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:30.330
to be done so I just want to briefly
mention another initiative we have at

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:30.340
mention another initiative we have at
 

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:34.380
mention another initiative we have at
JCB to promote image integrity JCB

this is a browser based system for
 

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.830
this is a browser based system for
actually hosting the original image data

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:40.840
actually hosting the original image data
 

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.950
actually hosting the original image data
that underlie are published images so

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960
that underlie are published images so
 

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.110
that underlie are published images so
now instead of readers just having to

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:46.120
now instead of readers just having to
 

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.510
now instead of readers just having to
look at a small 2d version of a figure

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520
look at a small 2d version of a figure
 

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.670
look at a small 2d version of a figure
in a PDF they can actually go in and

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680
in a PDF they can actually go in and
 

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.920
in a PDF they can actually go in and
look at interact with the original data

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:52.930
look at interact with the original data
 

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:55.620
look at interact with the original data
underlying some of those figures which

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:55.630
underlying some of those figures which
 

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:57.840
underlying some of those figures which
really allows the reader to ask do these

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:57.850
really allows the reader to ask do these
 

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:00.060
really allows the reader to ask do these
data represent what the authors actually

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.070
data represent what the authors actually
 

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.290
data represent what the authors actually
are showing

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:03.300
 
 

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.860
 
so as was mentioned before image

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:06.870
so as was mentioned before image
 

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.300
so as was mentioned before image
manipulation is just one kind of fraud

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.310
manipulation is just one kind of fraud
 

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.130
manipulation is just one kind of fraud
and I really want to emphasize although

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140
and I really want to emphasize although
 

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.750
and I really want to emphasize although
there are very very very practical

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760
there are very very very practical
 

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.700
there are very very very practical
things that journals can do to look at

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:13.710
things that journals can do to look at
 

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.710
things that journals can do to look at
image manipulation and prevent it and

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720
image manipulation and prevent it and
 

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.420
image manipulation and prevent it and
although this is a major source of

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:17.430
although this is a major source of
 

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:19.280
although this is a major source of
scientific misconduct this is only a

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:19.290
scientific misconduct this is only a
 

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.920
scientific misconduct this is only a
fraction of what is out there so what

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:21.930
fraction of what is out there so what
 

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:23.120
fraction of what is out there so what
I've been talking about here is

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.130
I've been talking about here is
 

01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:25.460
I've been talking about here is
detecting post-acquisition image

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:25.470
detecting post-acquisition image
 

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.830
detecting post-acquisition image
manipulation but image manipulation can

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:19.690
terms but like I said this is really how
 

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.600
terms but like I said this is really how
the federal regulations define these

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:21.610
the federal regulations define these
 

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:24.170
the federal regulations define these
terms and as federally funded

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180
terms and as federally funded
 

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.640
terms and as federally funded
institutions we're obligated to have

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:26.650
institutions we're obligated to have
 

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.110
institutions we're obligated to have
policies that conform to the regulations

01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:30.120
policies that conform to the regulations
 

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.960
policies that conform to the regulations
so what is not research misconduct is

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:33.970
so what is not research misconduct is
 

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.760
so what is not research misconduct is
just as important and again because as

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:37.770
just as important and again because as
 

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:41.850
just as important and again because as
an institution we have very specific and

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:41.860
an institution we have very specific and
 

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.370
an institution we have very specific and
structured processes that would follow

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:44.380
structured processes that would follow
 

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.400
structured processes that would follow
for research misconduct it's important

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:47.410
for research misconduct it's important
 

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.410
for research misconduct it's important
for us to be able to explain what is not

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:49.420
for us to be able to explain what is not
 

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.450
for us to be able to explain what is not
included and so you've heard about

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:51.460
included and so you've heard about
 

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.040
included and so you've heard about
honest error and differences of a pin

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.050
honest error and differences of a pin
 

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:57.070
honest error and differences of a pin
over data interpretation authorship

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:57.080
over data interpretation authorship
 

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.910
over data interpretation authorship
disputes are not issues that

01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920
disputes are not issues that
 

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.990
disputes are not issues that
institutions typically will handle

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000
institutions typically will handle
 

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.360
institutions typically will handle
through a research misconduct process

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:04.370
through a research misconduct process
 

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:06.970
through a research misconduct process
and we don't other kinds of violations

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:06.980
and we don't other kinds of violations
 

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:10.960
and we don't other kinds of violations
are bad behavior again not research

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:10.970
are bad behavior again not research
 

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.630
are bad behavior again not research
misconduct where we have very specific

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640
misconduct where we have very specific
 

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.200
misconduct where we have very specific
processes these issues those kinds of

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:17.210
processes these issues those kinds of
 

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:18.940
processes these issues those kinds of
violations need to be addressed through

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:18.950
violations need to be addressed through
 

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:22.660
violations need to be addressed through
an appropriate institutional channel but

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:22.670
an appropriate institutional channel but
 

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:25.750
an appropriate institutional channel but
it just wouldn't be this one so what is

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760
it just wouldn't be this one so what is
 

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.990
it just wouldn't be this one so what is
that process that I've been alluding to

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.000
that process that I've been alluding to
 

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.600
that process that I've been alluding to
well it is um it has a number of phases

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:33.610
well it is um it has a number of phases
 

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.120
well it is um it has a number of phases
that will begin with a written

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.130
that will begin with a written
 

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:41.320
that will begin with a written
allegation and in at our institution we

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:41.330
allegation and in at our institution we
 

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.020
allegation and in at our institution we
require a written allegation it must

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:44.030
require a written allegation it must
 

01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:48.340
require a written allegation it must
include some basis for why there's a

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:48.350
include some basis for why there's a
 

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.010
include some basis for why there's a
belief that the issue that's been

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:51.020
belief that the issue that's been
 

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.220
belief that the issue that's been
observed or the concern instant factor

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:54.230
observed or the concern instant factor
 

01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.950
observed or the concern instant factor
could be could be research misconduct

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960
could be could be research misconduct
 

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.490
could be could be research misconduct
and when we get an allegation like that

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:00.500
and when we get an allegation like that
 

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.500
and when we get an allegation like that
after we do kind of an initial

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:02.510
after we do kind of an initial
 

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.630
after we do kind of an initial
assessment to make sure that it really

01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640
assessment to make sure that it really
 

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.090
assessment to make sure that it really
they really are talking about potential

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:07.100
they really are talking about potential
 

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.430
they really are talking about potential
research misconduct and not one of those

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440
research misconduct and not one of those
 

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.060
research misconduct and not one of those
other kinds of issues the first step is

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.070
other kinds of issues the first step is
 

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:17.530
other kinds of issues the first step is
to convene an inquiry committee and so

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:17.540
to convene an inquiry committee and so
 

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.900
to convene an inquiry committee and so
the first phase of this process is what

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:19.910
the first phase of this process is what
 

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.420
the first phase of this process is what
we call an inquiry again it's a

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:22.430
we call an inquiry again it's a
 

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:24.010
we call an inquiry again it's a
regulatory term it's a preliminary

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:24.020
regulatory term it's a preliminary
 

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:28.150
regulatory term it's a preliminary
review it's a quick look to determine

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160
review it's a quick look to determine
 

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.470
review it's a quick look to determine
whether there's a need for further

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480
whether there's a need for further
 

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.600
whether there's a need for further
investigation then a potential second

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:34.610
investigation then a potential second
 

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:37.930
investigation then a potential second
phase is an investigation after that

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:37.940
phase is an investigation after that
 

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.720
phase is an investigation after that
there's an adjudication which is where

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:40.730
there's an adjudication which is where
 

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:43.960
there's an adjudication which is where
the institution ultimately the vested a

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:43.970
the institution ultimately the vested a
 

01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:46.120
the institution ultimately the vested a
person with vested with authority to do

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:46.130
person with vested with authority to do
 

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.910
person with vested with authority to do
so adjudicates whether there's an actual

01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920
so adjudicates whether there's an actual
 

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.380
so adjudicates whether there's an actual
finding or not and if there is a finding

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:52.390
finding or not and if there is a finding
 

01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:54.740
finding or not and if there is a finding
our institution there may be an appeal

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:54.750
our institution there may be an appeal
 

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.900
our institution there may be an appeal
so I want to spend a little bit of time

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:57.910
so I want to spend a little bit of time
 

01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:59.759
so I want to spend a little bit of time
just describing what happens at

01:07:59.759 --> 01:07:59.769
just describing what happens at
 

01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:02.519
just describing what happens at
particularly Lee the inquiry phase and

01:08:02.519 --> 01:08:02.529
particularly Lee the inquiry phase and
 

01:08:02.529 --> 01:08:05.880
particularly Lee the inquiry phase and
then the investigation phase and each of

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:05.890
then the investigation phase and each of
 

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:09.450
then the investigation phase and each of
these are are carried out by a faculty

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:09.460
these are are carried out by a faculty
 

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.349
these are are carried out by a faculty
committee so we find people with the

01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359
committee so we find people with the
 

01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:16.229
committee so we find people with the
relevant expertise we assure that they

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239
relevant expertise we assure that they
 

01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:18.450
relevant expertise we assure that they
do not have conflicts of interest and we

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:18.460
do not have conflicts of interest and we
 

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.379
do not have conflicts of interest and we
have a an SOP that we follow for that

01:08:21.379 --> 01:08:21.389
have a an SOP that we follow for that
 

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:26.309
have a an SOP that we follow for that
and and and they are doing this in

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319
and and and they are doing this in
 

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.530
and and and they are doing this in
addition to their full-time work at

01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:28.540
addition to their full-time work at
 

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.620
addition to their full-time work at
Columbia and sometimes this can be very

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:31.630
Columbia and sometimes this can be very
 

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:36.840
Columbia and sometimes this can be very
time consuming and it can it can even

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:36.850
time consuming and it can it can even
 

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.640
time consuming and it can it can even
just the scheduling alone can be

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:38.650
just the scheduling alone can be
 

01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:41.820
just the scheduling alone can be
challenging so at the inquiry stage as I

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:41.830
challenging so at the inquiry stage as I
 

01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:43.620
challenging so at the inquiry stage as I
said it's a quick look it's kind of like

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:43.630
said it's a quick look it's kind of like
 

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:46.289
said it's a quick look it's kind of like
the grand jury it's looking to see

01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:46.299
the grand jury it's looking to see
 

01:08:46.299 --> 01:08:48.689
the grand jury it's looking to see
whether the allegation has substance and

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:48.699
whether the allegation has substance and
 

01:08:48.699 --> 01:08:51.300
whether the allegation has substance and
whether a full investigation is

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:51.310
whether a full investigation is
 

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:54.720
whether a full investigation is
warranted and we have a committee that

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:54.730
warranted and we have a committee that
 

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.910
warranted and we have a committee that
look at that and ultimately draft a

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920
look at that and ultimately draft a
 

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.430
look at that and ultimately draft a
report with a recommendation at our

01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440
report with a recommendation at our
 

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.559
report with a recommendation at our
institution we have an overarching

01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:01.569
institution we have an overarching
 

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:04.140
institution we have an overarching
standing committee that then can accept

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:04.150
standing committee that then can accept
 

01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:07.169
standing committee that then can accept
or reject that report so if there's a

01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:07.179
or reject that report so if there's a
 

01:09:07.179 --> 01:09:09.209
or reject that report so if there's a
recommendation to carry out a full

01:09:09.209 --> 01:09:09.219
recommendation to carry out a full
 

01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:12.629
recommendation to carry out a full
investigation when we move into a much

01:09:12.629 --> 01:09:12.639
investigation when we move into a much
 

01:09:12.639 --> 01:09:16.700
investigation when we move into a much
more formal and exhaustive examination

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:16.710
more formal and exhaustive examination
 

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:20.700
more formal and exhaustive examination
of the research record and in parallel

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:20.710
of the research record and in parallel
 

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.919
of the research record and in parallel
with that inquiry in fact one of the

01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:22.929
with that inquiry in fact one of the
 

01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:24.789
with that inquiry in fact one of the
very first things that we do

01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799
very first things that we do
 

01:09:24.799 --> 01:09:27.579
very first things that we do
upon receiving an allegation is figure

01:09:27.579 --> 01:09:27.589
upon receiving an allegation is figure
 

01:09:27.589 --> 01:09:30.609
upon receiving an allegation is figure
out what are the research records here

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:30.619
out what are the research records here
 

01:09:30.619 --> 01:09:33.339
out what are the research records here
and how can we collect them so there is

01:09:33.339 --> 01:09:33.349
and how can we collect them so there is
 

01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:34.959
and how can we collect them so there is
an obligation again under the

01:09:34.959 --> 01:09:34.969
an obligation again under the
 

01:09:34.969 --> 01:09:37.510
an obligation again under the
regulations and in our policy for us to

regulations and in our policy for us to
go out and collect whatever research

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040
go out and collect whatever research
 

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.099
go out and collect whatever research
records may be relevant to this case

01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:42.109
records may be relevant to this case

records may be relevant to this case
that could be lab notebooks that could

01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:44.839
that could be lab notebooks that could
 

01:09:44.839 --> 01:09:48.549
that could be lab notebooks that could
be copies of somebody's hard drive that

be copies of somebody's hard drive that
 

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:52.720
be copies of somebody's hard drive that
could be printouts there are any number

findings of research misconduct or even
an allegation of research misconduct can

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920
an allegation of research misconduct can
 

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.840
an allegation of research misconduct can
be so significant and that's why

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:46.850
be so significant and that's why
 

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:50.390
be so significant and that's why
confidentiality of this process is also

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400
confidentiality of this process is also
 

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.580
confidentiality of this process is also
so critical so there can be a period

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:55.590
so critical so there can be a period
 

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:58.129
so critical so there can be a period
where a journal may come to us with a

where a journal may come to us with a
 

01:13:58.139 --> 01:14:01.459
where a journal may come to us with a
concern and we may say okay we're going

01:14:01.459 --> 01:14:01.469
concern and we may say okay we're going
 

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:03.740

to we have a process we have a policy
 

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.720
to we have a process we have a policy
here it is we're going to treat your

and then we may not be able to say
 

01:14:10.619 --> 01:14:14.419
and then we may not be able to say
anything until we complete this process

01:14:14.419 --> 01:14:14.429
anything until we complete this process
 

01:14:14.429 --> 01:14:17.209
anything until we complete this process
and you'll see when I a little later

01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219
and you'll see when I a little later
 

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.790
and you'll see when I a little later
i'll talk about the notifications that

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800
i'll talk about the notifications that
 

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.160
i'll talk about the notifications that
an institution may be involved with at

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:22.170
an institution may be involved with at
 

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.919
an institution may be involved with at
the end of the process but there can be

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:24.929
the end of the process but there can be
 

01:14:24.929 --> 01:14:27.590
the end of the process but there can be
this sort of lag time and it can be

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600
this sort of lag time and it can be
 

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.109
this sort of lag time and it can be
frustrating too many people involved

01:14:30.109 --> 01:14:30.119
frustrating too many people involved
 

01:14:30.119 --> 01:14:32.390

01:19:03.949 --> 01:19:03.959
think institutions will typically reach
 

01:19:03.959 --> 01:19:06.169
think institutions will typically reach
out to the corresponding author assuming

01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179
out to the corresponding author assuming
 

01:19:06.179 --> 01:19:09.589
out to the corresponding author assuming
that person is not necessarily involved

01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:09.599
that person is not necessarily involved
 

01:19:09.599 --> 01:19:12.919
that person is not necessarily involved
with the case and and you know it's an

01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:12.929
with the case and and you know it's an
 

01:19:12.929 --> 01:19:14.810
with the case and and you know it's an
awkward position in some ways for the

01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820
awkward position in some ways for the
 

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.640
awkward position in some ways for the
institution because we typically don't

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:16.650
institution because we typically don't
 

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:19.009
institution because we typically don't
involve ourselves between authors and

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:19.019
involve ourselves between authors and
 

01:19:19.019 --> 01:19:21.469
involve ourselves between authors and
journalists we typically rely on authors

01:19:21.469 --> 01:19:21.479
journalists we typically rely on authors
 

01:19:21.479 --> 01:19:23.390
journalists we typically rely on authors
and journals to talk to each other so

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400
and journals to talk to each other so
 

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.000
and journals to talk to each other so
there's some awkwardness for the

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:26.010
there's some awkwardness for the
 

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:28.609
there's some awkwardness for the
institution to on the one hand ensure

01:19:28.609 --> 01:19:28.619
institution to on the one hand ensure
 

01:19:28.619 --> 01:19:31.100
institution to on the one hand ensure
that the scientific record the

that the scientific record the
 

01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:35.540
that the scientific record the
literature is appropriately remedied

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:35.550
literature is appropriately remedied
 

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:37.819

stepping on the toes of the authors and
the journals in their process so we will

may remain confidential so the journal

may remain confidential so the journal

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.010
there and at many institutions including
Columbia we have a compliance hotline

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:39.020
Columbia we have a compliance hotline
 

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.950
Columbia we have a compliance hotline
where people can make anonymous reports

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960
where people can make anonymous reports
 

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.590
where people can make anonymous reports
so there are avenues and I think it's a

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600
so there are avenues and I think it's a
 

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.830
so there are avenues and I think it's a
very difficult situation to be in so

01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840
very difficult situation to be in so
 

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.370
very difficult situation to be in so
folks should know they're not alone this

01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380
folks should know they're not alone this

folks should know they're not alone this
is the only picture and my slides this

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:58.110
is the only picture and my slides this
 

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:00.590
is the only picture and my slides this
is our website and there's lots of

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600
is our website and there's lots of
 

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.160
is our website and there's lots of
information about how this process works

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:04.170
information about how this process works
 

01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:09.669
information about how this process works
here

01:24:09.679 --> 01:24:11.859
 
so I'd like to invite our panelists to

01:24:11.859 --> 01:24:11.869
so I'd like to invite our panelists to
 

01:24:11.869 --> 01:24:14.830
so I'd like to invite our panelists to
take seats up in front and then we'll

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840
take seats up in front and then we'll
 

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.589
take seats up in front and then we'll
open the floor for questions and

01:24:17.589 --> 01:24:17.599
open the floor for questions and
 

01:24:17.599 --> 01:24:20.379
open the floor for questions and
discussion there's a microphone now in

01:24:20.379 --> 01:24:20.389
discussion there's a microphone now in
 

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.060
discussion there's a microphone now in
the center of the room so if we have a

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:22.070
the center of the room so if we have a
 

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:30.720
the center of the room so if we have a
question move to microphone

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:30.730
 
 

01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:42.610
 
well everyone

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:42.620
 
 

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.770
 
communicate with journals and it might

01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780
communicate with journals and it might
 

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.780
communicate with journals and it might
be very helpful for us if your

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:47.790
be very helpful for us if your
 

01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:49.610
be very helpful for us if your
committees did communicate with journals

01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620
committees did communicate with journals
 

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.670
committees did communicate with journals
didn't just rely on the authors to

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:51.680
didn't just rely on the authors to
 

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.290
didn't just rely on the authors to
communicate with actually I didn't say

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300
communicate with actually I didn't say
 

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.020

we don't I said that we do it in

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:57.030
we don't I said that we do it in
 

01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:59.990
we don't I said that we do it in
coordination with the authors so what

01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000
coordination with the authors so what
 

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.990
coordination with the authors so what
can happen and has happened is a letter

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000
can happen and has happened is a letter
 

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.990
can happen and has happened is a letter
might go to a corresponding author and

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000
might go to a corresponding author and
 

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.270
might go to a corresponding author and
another letter might go to the editor of

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280
another letter might go to the editor of
 

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.970
another letter might go to the editor of
that journal outlining the same issues

01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980
that journal outlining the same issues
 

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.020
that journal outlining the same issues
just so that that editor is aware and

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:15.030
just so that that editor is aware and
 

01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:17.630
just so that that editor is aware and
then we would work together with the

01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640
then we would work together with the
 

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.060
then we would work together with the
corresponding author hopefully to try

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:20.070
corresponding author hopefully to try
 

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:23.020
corresponding author hopefully to try
and address the issue but if there is

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:23.030
and address the issue but if there is
 

01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:25.760
and address the issue but if there is
you know I mean ultimately the

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:25.770
you know I mean ultimately the
 

01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:28.160
you know I mean ultimately the
institution is very concerned that the

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:28.170
institution is very concerned that the
 

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:31.160
institution is very concerned that the
literature be corrected and if there's a

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:31.170
literature be corrected and if there's a
 

01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:33.730
literature be corrected and if there's a
lack of responsiveness then we will go

01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:33.740
lack of responsiveness then we will go
 

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.890
lack of responsiveness then we will go
directly to the to the journal if we

01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900
directly to the to the journal if we
 

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:42.230
directly to the to the journal if we
need to so my kind of asked my my

01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:42.240
need to so my kind of asked my my
 

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.140
need to so my kind of asked my my
question so let's get different one

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:44.150
question so let's get different one
 

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:50.780
question so let's get different one
which is the Marty you commented a bit

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:50.790
which is the Marty you commented a bit
 

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:54.380
which is the Marty you commented a bit
about the the open access policy would

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:54.390
about the the open access policy would
 

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:58.400
about the the open access policy would
you say that and you know that that that

01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:58.410
you say that and you know that that that
 

01:25:58.410 --> 01:26:00.350
you say that and you know that that that
was a question of the journals being

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360
was a question of the journals being
 

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.200
was a question of the journals being
open access that allowed for this or

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:03.210
open access that allowed for this or
 

01:26:03.210 --> 01:26:06.940
open access that allowed for this or
that there was in those cases a lower

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:06.950
that there was in those cases a lower
 

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:09.710
that there was in those cases a lower
threshold for some kind of review

01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:09.720
threshold for some kind of review
 

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.020
threshold for some kind of review
process that was going on and that that

process that was going on and that that
 

01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:15.980

could happen open access or not hey it

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:15.990
could happen open access or not hey it
 

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.350
could happen open access or not hey it
could happen whether it's open access or

01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360
could happen whether it's open access or
 

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.540
could happen whether it's open access or
not clearly it's a function of the rigor

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:20.550
not clearly it's a function of the rigor

went through the process together it was

extremely difficult for all authors

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.560
extremely difficult for all authors

just fortuitously and I mean think the

just fortuitously and I mean think the

case that showed this quite well was the

there were tons of corresponding authors
on those papers and they just fell off
