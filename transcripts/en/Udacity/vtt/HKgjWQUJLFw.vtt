00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.870
There are six stages or
modes of a design sprint.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.810
And each of these stages solves
an important part of the design process.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.890
The first phase is the understand phase.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.000
In this phase, you're trying to
get clarity on the business goals,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.640
the problem you're solving for,
technical feasibility, the market, and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.120
user needs.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.940
You've actually already been working on
some of this throughout the first two

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.430
lessons of the course.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.260
And there are other activities that
you can do, which I'll cover later.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.130
The second stage is the define stage.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.700
In this stage, you might define the goal
for the product or certain features.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
This might include the positioning,
a user journey, or

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.460
metrics related to the product or
those certain features.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.050
We'll cover more about
metrics in lesson 4.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.900
Now, this stage is similar to what
Richard Fulcher was talking about when

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.230
he mentioned tasks that
are related to a user's goals.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.430
For example, a user may search for
a particular grocery item

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.090
in our shopping app, which would be
then added to the cart for purchase.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.080
The third stage is the diverge stage.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.320
In this stage, you want to create
as many solutions as you can

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.560
to the original design challenge.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.090
And this is the stage where you really
get to unleash your creativity.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670
It's the fun part.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.190
The fourth stage is the decide stage,
and in this stage,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.210
you really just want to deliberate
about the ideas that you came up with

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.895
in the previous diverge stage, refine
those, and then choose the best one or

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:28.605
some combination of the ideas so that
way you get a best possible product.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:32.735
The fifth stage is
the prototyping stage.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:36.145
In this stage, you want to actually
create and build the wireframes,

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:40.625
the mockups, or the prototypes that
you'll actually test with real users.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.685
These are the deliverables
of the design sprint.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.410
And finally,
the last stage is the validation stage.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.770
In this stage, you really want to
test your products with real users.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.080
You're testing your wireframes,
your mockups, or your prototypes, to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.050
determine whether or not the hypotheses,
or your risky assumptions are true.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.890
You're trying to figure out whether or
not you have the right product, and

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.790
whether or not it's usable.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.690
So there you have it,
the six stages of a design sprint.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.190
Understand, define, diverge,
decide, prototype, and validate.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.480
Throughout this lesson, Amir will
interview a design sprint master

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.200
at Google and
talk more about each of these stages.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.300
I'll follow those videos by
describing activities that you can do

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.660
with each of these stages.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.590
As you watch the videos, think about
which activities might be helpful for

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.100
your specific design challenge.
