On behalf of the Emory
Libraries and the Stuart A. Rose

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.100
Manuscript, Archives,
and Rare Book Library,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm thrilled to welcome you to
tonight's special event, Sister

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.735
Writers: An Evening with
Pearl Cleage and Tayari Jones.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.570
Round of applause is in order.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.980
My name is Jennifer Meehan.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.010
I serve as interim director
of the Rose Library.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.030
Our mission in the Rose Library
is to collect and connect

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.530
stories of human experience
to promote access and learning

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.290
and to create
opportunities for dialogue

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.440
for all wise hearts
who seek knowledge.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.550
As part of our mission we offer
programs such as this one,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.790
and we put on exhibits to
explore and share stories

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.550
from the collections
such as the exhibit which

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.380
inspired this program.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.100
She Gathers Me: Networks
Among Black Women Writers

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.010
curated by Gabrielle Dudley,
instruction archivist

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.040
in the rose library and
our moderator here tonight.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.980
Another round of applause.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.040
She Gathers Me explores the
networks among black women

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.490
writers through an examination
of the connections found

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.450
within their letters, journals,
calendars, and photographs.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.610
One story explored
in the exhibit

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.190
is the intimate connection
between our guests

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.480
this evening.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.810
New York Times bestselling
author and new Emory faculty

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.150
member, Tayari Jones--

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.850
We're just going
to keep applauding

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.940
--and nationally recognized
playwright, poet, novelist,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.190
and social activist,
Pearl Cleage,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.165
whose papers are amongst the
Rose Libraries collections.

00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:51.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.570
In discussion together
they will share

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.150
more of the story of
their intimate connection

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.800
of mentorship and writing.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.620
We hope that you will visit
this exhibit which is currently

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.020
on display in the Rose Library
now through next Wednesday,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.730
October 3.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.400
So its final days.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.920
Just a few logistical notes
before we start our discussion.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.190
I want to let everyone know
that the event is being streamed

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.980
through Facebook Live on the
Emory University website,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.302
and we're also
videotaping the event.

00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:21.760
Following the
discussion there will

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.172
be time for questions
from the audience.

00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:25.630
If you wish to ask
a question we're

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.810
going to ask that you line
up at one of the two mics

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.780
that will be set up for you.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.890
And then following the
program the authors books

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.420
will be for sale
and the two authors

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.610
will be signing
books in the foyer

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.200
and we'll ask you
to line for that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.910
at the back of the ballroom.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.580
So without further
ado, it's my pleasure

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.364
to introduce Gabrielle Dudley.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:48.703
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.290
Gabrielle M. Dudley is
the instruction archivist

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.570
in the Stewart A. Rose
Manuscript, Archives,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.860
and Rare Book Library.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.020
In this role she
partners with faculty

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.380
to develop courses and research
assignments that draw heavily

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.930
from the materials
in the Rose Library.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.920
Gabrielle recently facilitated
a grant funded project

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.420
that use the papers
of black women writers

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.000
to teach archives research
skills to students

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.130
at Emory and Spelman College.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.310
And she's curator of the
exhibit She Gathers Me:

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.680
Networks Among
Black Women Writers.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.295
Gabrielle, turning
it over to you.

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:23.770
Thank you.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.670
Thank you so much Jennifer
for that great introduction.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.945
I want to thank you both so much
for being here this evening.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:37.870
I'm really excited to have
the two of you on this stage

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.850
here at Emory tonight.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.850
This conversation,
it's really been

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.880
something that's been
years in the making for me.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.770
And I'll give you a sort
of a brief story about why.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.490
So in preparation for the
She Gathers Me exhibition,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.580
I knew that most people's
interactions with writers,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.130
specifically black
women writers,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.847
would probably come from
their published works.

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:07.930
But it was actually through
looking in your papers

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.670
Pearl that I began to see how
looking at your correspondence

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.730
you had extensive relationships
with other black women writers,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.750
and of course,
people like Tayari.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.260
And this really sparked
this idea of exploration

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.560
between writing networks
with black women.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.600
Then I became curious
about whether black women

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.530
writers in Rose Library
also had these relationships

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.870
visible within their
personal papers.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.400
And they actually did.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.560
So it was basically you
and Tayari's relationship

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.770
that was a springboard for a
personal and professional sort

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.910
of endeavor for me.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.640
So thank you both for that.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.420
Could you start by telling us
a bit about how the two of you

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.090
met and how your
relationship has

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.080
grown over the years for those
that might not be familiar?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.740
Do you want me to start?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.830
I think you may
should start to say

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.380
that we met before
we met because Pearl

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.870
was a friend of my parents.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.340
And so when I met Pearl she was
the first writer I ever met.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.300
I love to say I met a writer
and she was my teacher.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.180
And I mentioned her to
my dad and he called her.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.574
He said, young Pearl?

00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:35.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.380
Reverend Cleage's from Detroit?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.160
So we were connected
before we were connected.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.720
But she was teaching
creative writing class

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.940
at Spelman College.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.570
We're both graduates of Spelman,
and I wanted to take the class.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.880
I wasn't old enough to
take the class because you

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.610
had to be I think a junior or
something to take the class,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.260
but I always wanted
to be a writer.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.840
I had never seen a writer
and there was a writer,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.130
and I wanted to take a class.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.660
So I weighed my
options and I decided

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.555
that I had no choice but to--

00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:10.120
I think forge is too
strong of a word for it.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:15.700
--to approximate the
signature of my advisor--

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.740
--allowing me to take the class.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.610
And I will let Pearl
take over from here.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.640
I don't even think I ever knew
that that was a forced thing.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.450
I didn't want to make an
accessory after the fact.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.750
I hadn't been teaching
long and I really

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.030
didn't know what I was doing.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.610
So that I had way too
many people in that class.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.030
Wasn't your class a huge class
where I had so many people?

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.688
So many.

00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:45.730
Because whoever came to
me and said, oh, I really

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.830
want to take your
class, I would say OK.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.700
So I mean it was ridiculous.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.000
But most of the
young women in there

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.180
they may have read something
that I had written,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.980
or they kind of had a
vague idea that they

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.050
were interested in writing.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.640
But then I had one student
who was so determined

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.910
to be a writer.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.897
She was so serious
about it so that when

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.480
we would have this huge class--
and there were a lot of people

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.700
in the class who
were so not serious

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.100
and they would try to divert
attention as students will

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.300
do when they haven't
done the writing

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.450
they were supposed to do.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.617
So they want you to talk
all over here and all that.

00:07:22.617 --> 00:07:24.640
And that used to
drive Tayari crazy.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.590
So she came up to me
after class one day

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.390
and said these girls
are not serious.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.540
You should make them be quiet.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.880
I'm trying to learn from
you and they won't be quiet.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.713
They won't be quiet.

00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:36.650
I said, OK, here's
what we're going to do.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.887
You're going to be a writer.

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:39.220
They're not going to be writers.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.020
So what you need
to do is to come by

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.470
and see me a couple of
times a week by yourself.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.850
We'll talk about your writing.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.300
I'll give you assignments
and we'll do this between us

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.940
because I'm already a writer and
I know you're going to be one.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.790
And she was so relieved
that she wasn't

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.410
going to have to suffer through
all of the non serious writers.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.025
But it was really a
wonderful thing for me

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:06.430
as a young teacher to
come across a student who

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.140
was so determined to know
what it took to be a writer.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.460
So I had the
wonderful experience

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.160
of being pushed by a
student to figure out a way

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.240
to effectively communicate what
I knew because she so wanted

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.470
to know so that it was
a wonderful teaching

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.300
experience for me.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.590
And we got to be friends.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.710
After she was no longer my
student, we kept in touch.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.650
I was publishing a magazine
called Catalyst at the time.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.799
And I'm always proud that
I'm the first person who

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.165
published a short story
and sent her a check.

00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:42.460
Sent her a check.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.580
She sent me a check for $100.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.880
I was like, what should I do?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.980
Should I invest it?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.920
How can I manage all this money?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.130
But that was very important to
me as an editor of a magazine

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.930
because it was funded
by Fulton County,

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.860
and I appreciate it to this day
that they invested in the arts

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.870
in that way.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.860
But I wanted to be clear that
part of the money that they

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.860
were giving me was going to be
used to pay writers because I

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.010
don't care if it's a little
tiny three sentence poem,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.960
you need to get paid
for it if you wrote it.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.360
If it's a short story,
you should get paid for it

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.490
so that we always pay writers.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.480
Exactly.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.030
Exactly.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.640
So that, it was
really wonderful.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.228
And then once she went
off to graduate school

00:09:25.228 --> 00:09:26.770
we stayed in touch,
which is probably

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.060
where some of those
letters came from.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.820
A lot of the letters.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.570
I'm out here in the
middle of the prairie.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.450
What am I doing here?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.950
Why did I decide to do this?

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.030
But always writing.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.700
Always writing.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.872
I'd love those letters because
there's all of the personal,

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:42.080
I'm a young woman away from
home in southwest Atlanta

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.705
for the first time
and this environment

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:45.730
does not have a lot of
people that look like me.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.520
What should I do?

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.890
I feel crazy, all of that.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.890
And then under that was, and
this is what I'm writing.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.120
This is what I'm working on.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.160
This is what I'm
trying to figure out.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.980
And that's the two
tracks that are always

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.410
going to be the two tracks
you're on I think as a writer.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.420
One is, my life is
driving me crazy.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.500
What am I going to do?

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.140
And the other one is,
what am I writing and why?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.420
So that she was already
asking those questions.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.610
And the more we talked
and the more she'd

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.730
became the writer that she was
going to be, the closer we got.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.030
So we had the
wonderful experience

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.560
of realizing we were friends.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.170
It's been 30 years.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.290
There you go.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:22.880
I was a kid.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.270
I was like 16.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.390
But when you were talking
about how you paid the writers,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.760
you paid me that
$100, but you also

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.890
told me something about
money and writing.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.790
And you said you want to
be paid for your writing,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.410
but you don't want to
have to write for money.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.700
And I've always kept that.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.920
I don't want to have
to write for money

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.820
has been as or even more
important to me than making

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.660
sure I get paid.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.300
Although I do want to get
paid, don't get me wrong.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.590
But this idea of you're
being paid for your work,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.890
but you're not selling it.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.140
And that was really important.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.800
I mean there are just so many
things over all these years

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.580
advice that you've given me
because I mean when you said

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.390
that about these connections
between black women writers,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.523
our numbers are few.

00:11:10.523 --> 00:11:11.940
You're having an
experience that's

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.570
so unique and very
few people have had it

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.870
and black women writers tend to
have also really short careers.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.790
So there are very
few people who've

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.660
been there long enough that
are ahead of you to give you

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.700
the pass advice back.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.870
So I really treasure this.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:34.035
I was on the internet and I
was asking writers about advice

00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:35.410
they've gotten
from their mentors

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.202
and I was surprised at
how many people were

00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:40.120
saying I never had a mentor.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.250
I don't even know how I would be
doing this without the example.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.650
I mean, you talked about how
you helped me with my writing,

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.920
but you also modeled for me
what a writing life of purpose

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.210
could look like.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.180
And it helped me when I became
a writer and I moved to New York

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.880
and everyone was
like living and dying

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.340
by who's nominated
for what awards, who's

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.330
in what magazines.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.450
I always say Pearl never
trained me up on awards.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.000
We never ever said
the word awards.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.240
We never talked about them.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.200
So we never talked about
who's getting reviewed where.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.690
We talked about the books
and the authors we love

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.670
and why we love
them, but we never

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.020
talked about that other stuff.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.170
So it wasn't imprinted on me
when I was a young writer.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.170
So when I got to be an
older writer in that world

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.100
it didn't turn my head.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.730
Wow.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:30.230
Excellent.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.370
One of the other
things you were talking

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.230
about those kinds
of networks and that

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.420
when you started looking
you saw there's so many

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.420
of the black women writers
had those networks.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.230
And since I'm of
a generation older

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.110
than you, that I remember
when I'd started writing

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.680
and how helpful it was to me
to have the women writers who

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.930
were a generation
or so older than me

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.510
to be supportive of what I did.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.190
All of them were--

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.490
I remember going to a party at
Dr. Richard Long's house who

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.898
used to be here at Emory
who I miss every single day.

00:13:06.898 --> 00:13:08.440
And it was one of
those great parties

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.200
that Richard Long used
to have where it was just

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.050
all the people that
you loved were there

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.800
and the food was good
and there were books

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.450
that you want to
steal in his library.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.280
And it was just wonderful.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.500
And he was having a
party for Maya Angelou.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.140
And so I got to the house
and I didn't know her.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.800
I knew of course of her and who
she was, but I didn't know her.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.470
And I came to Richard's house
and she was in the kitchen.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.540
She was cooking.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.580
And I was like so
nervous about meeting her

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.620
that I was trying to
hide in the living room

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.940
because she was in the kitchen.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.130
And he came out and
said to me, Maya

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:40.570
will see you in the kitchen now.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.186
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:44.050
So I was like OK.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.648
So I went to see
Maya and she was

00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:47.190
standing over the
pots and everything

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.650
and she looked up at me and
said, ah, there you are.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.550
How is your work going?

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.460
And I've never forgotten it
because she actually wanted

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.530
to talk to me about my writing.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.090
She took it seriously.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.298
And I'm sitting there
having the conversation

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.840
and my brain is
saying you're talking

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.965
to Maya about your writing.

00:14:02.965 --> 00:14:04.900
You're talking to Maya
about your writing

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.930
because it means everything
to have the writers that you

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.880
admire, to have
Alice Walker tell me

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.030
that she thought something I had
written was wonderful to have.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.040
Bebe Moore Campbell, who
is my contemporary who

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.810
has passed away now, asked
me the critical question.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.570
When I turned in my
manuscript for my first novel

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.600
and my editor who kept it for
like six months, eight months,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.420
and then finally called me and
said this is the worst book

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.370
I've ever read.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.840
We can't possibly publish it.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.600
And don't send it to anyone
else because if someone else

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.150
publishes it you will
never publish another book

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.470
as long as you live.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.990
And I said wow, I
kind of like the book.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.960
I thought the book was a
little better than that.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.687
So I called Bebe and told
her this heartbreaking news

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.520
that the woman said
this was the worst book.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.770
The characters are unlikeable.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.970
Everything you wouldn't
want to hear as a writer.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.700
And Bebe let me kind
of moan on for a while,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.950
and then she said what
did your agent say?

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.780
And I said I don't
have an agent.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.390
I didn't know anybody who was
a writer who had an agent.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.370
The writers I knew
self published,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.060
had little old Volkswagen's
and went around to communities

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.660
and read their poems.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.260
So she was asking me who
was doing business for me,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.660
and I didn't understand
that you needed somebody

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.850
to do business for me.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.382
So she sent several black
women to me who were agents.

00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:21.340
I called the first one.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.048
She wasn't there.

00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:25.030
I called the second and she
became my agent for years.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.420
But that was why when it
came time to talk to you,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.187
I could talk to you about
doing business for yourself

00:15:31.187 --> 00:15:32.770
and finding someone
who could look out

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.010
for you because someone
had done that for me.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.010
And it was so important
to me because it

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.010
made all the difference.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.160
I mean, the agent told me how
to get the manuscript back,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.020
how she would get
someone else to give me

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.210
an advance so I could pay
back that advance, which

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.780
I had spent of course.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.410
So that they sold
the book in one day

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.915
and it became what looks like
crazy on an ordinary day.

00:15:53.915 --> 00:15:56.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.790
So I always tell
young writers that

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.490
don't believe because
one person in Manhattan

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.160
tells you the book
sucks, don't believe it

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.920
because that book did
so well and people still

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.690
stop me in the
publics and tell me

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.850
how much they love that book.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:13.990
It's a great book.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.790
Thank you.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.020
But I wanted to take
all those things

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.830
that I had learned from
the generation above me

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.600
and from my
contemporaries, and then

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.400
to find a younger writer who
really was serious about it.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.460
It allowed me to kind of say,
OK, now I'm going to tell you.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.170
Now you've got to
tell somebody else

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.670
and then they'll
tell somebody else.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.060
We were just in the car today
and she said put your agent on.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.920
That's right.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.640
Just like about 20 minutes
ago that was her advice.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640
Because I'm protective.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.640
I think that's part of it
that we protect each other

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.080
as black women writers.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.970
When I've got an
opening I write plays.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.160
So when I have an opening
and I'm going crazy

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.680
I know my sister
writers will know

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.105
to say it's going to be fine.

00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:56.230
It's going to be wonderful.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.340
It's going to be fine.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.590
And when I saw the schedule
for Tayari's book tour,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.260
I was really afraid
for her because it

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.960
was every day somewhere else.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.500
And I said you can do this.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.557
I will send you a text every
morning and say good morning.

00:17:09.557 --> 00:17:10.849
Everything's going to be great.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.738
And I did for the whole tour.

00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:15.280
And sometimes she'd be like I
know everything is going great,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.613
and sometimes she'd be like,
oh, everything is terrible.

00:17:17.613 --> 00:17:18.640
I'm far from home.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.660
But the knowing that you've got
somebody who's got eyes on you

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.329
and who wants you to do well who
is not pulling against you, who

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.390
is not saying if her
book does well my book

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.500
isn't going to do well.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.270
If she gets that job
I won't get that job.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.240
Black women writers that I've
known don't tend to do that.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.632
We tend to say there's
a job open over here.

00:17:36.632 --> 00:17:37.840
I think Marie should take it.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.640
I think this one
should be it and then

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.080
we help each other move forward.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.850
When you think
that in generations

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.510
past when black women were
not under consideration

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.270
for major awards
and other things

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.070
that people looked as
landmarks of success.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.250
It's only in very recent
history that black women

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.810
have been in the
running for things

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.980
that because of this we made
our own ways of assessing

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.550
our value that was
about not impressing,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.170
or just communicating with
each other in a different kind

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.670
of way.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:19.528
That if you didn't have support
from other black women writers,

00:18:19.528 --> 00:18:20.570
you didn't have anything.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.640
We were our world.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.140
I think that now
things have changed

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.110
more because of
more opportunities

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.150
and things that people--

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.200
sometimes I feel almost like the
connection between black women

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.620
writers and black
writers because I

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.120
think it's like
with a lot of things

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.630
that because it's not considered
a necessity in the same way,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.210
that the connection
is not as it once was.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.130
I think that's true, and
I think it's a shame.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.130
I think it's kind of like
when integration came,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.055
people left all
the black resorts

00:18:51.055 --> 00:18:52.430
and left all the
black businesses

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.440
and went elsewhere
because we could.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.560
Rather than adding on, we
figured we had to give up one.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.580
And I think that there is a
much greater willingness now

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.470
to kind of step on and
step over each other

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.030
because we want to be on
the New York Times list.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.140
We want to get this award.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.580
We want to get this and that.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.380
And it's a very different
way of looking at the work

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.130
that we do that I don't think
necessarily lends itself

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.420
to us doing our best work
and certainly not toward us

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.420
working with each other.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.670
The other thing that
I think it's broken

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.620
is because we didn't
used to even think

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.380
about being on the New
York Times Bestseller list.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.990
We didn't think about
having a show on Broadway.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.740
So that now when people
ask you questions like,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.930
aren't you hoping you'll
get a show on Broadway?

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.730
And I say I don't care.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.080
I'm a working playwright.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.150
I have plays all
around the country.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.068
Broadway doesn't
mean anything to me.

00:19:44.068 --> 00:19:46.610
Don't you think you want to have
a New York Times bestseller?

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.280
It's wonderful because you
can pay your rent for a year

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.000
and make your parents proud, but
it doesn't mean that now you're

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.260
a real writer.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.500
You knew you were a writer
before you ever sold a book.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.510
You told me you were a writer
when you were 16 years old.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.410
So now that people are telling
you that, you don't take it

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.660
the same way like,
I never knew it

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.550
before the New
York Times told me.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.170
You say back to
the New York Times

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.082
I told you all I was a writer,
which is a different thing.

00:20:13.082 --> 00:20:16.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.930
So Pearl, you
talked about giants

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.990
like Bebe Moore Campbell,
Alice Walker, Maya Angelou.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.660
Tayari, I'm curious to know if
you have current black women

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.140
writers that sort of helped
to sustain you as a writer,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.420
as a woman, as a friend.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.330
Well I went to
Spelman, so I do have

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.820
a different kind of
orientation to understanding

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.960
black women as mentors.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.360
That's what I've
known from the start.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.600
I didn't have to have kind of
moment of revelation for it.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.620
But I do think that black
women have been helpful to me.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.190
I literally ran into Jewell
Parker Rhodes in an elevator

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.360
like, oh, excuse me.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.760
Like I ran into
her and she invited

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.830
me to come to Arizona State and
work with her to get my MFA.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.180
And she took care of me.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.810
I worked as her assistant
and she demonstrated to me

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.880
a way of living as a
writer that I had not

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.810
known before in those two
years that I was her assistant.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.820
The first award I
ever received was

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.410
from the Hurston
Wright Foundation

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.210
which is run by Marita Golden.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.020
So black women have
always been there.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.590
When I published my
first book Nikki Giovanni

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.960
invited me to her
house for the weekend

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.400
to talk to me
about what it would

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.140
be like to be a public person.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.860
And I was thinking, oh, I've
just written this one book.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.150
I didn't think I was ever
going to be a person that

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.260
would need Nikki Giovanni's
helpful hints on the writing

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.010
life.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.432
But I will say in the last
year I have done everything

00:21:45.432 --> 00:21:46.890
because she said
to me it's coming.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.360
You don't know it,
but it's coming.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.402
And I didn't believe it,
but I was like yes ma'am

00:21:50.402 --> 00:21:52.650
because she's Nikki Giovanni.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.760
But she had me to her
house for a whole weekend.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.010
I had my little overnight bag.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:56.580
I was so nervous.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.330
I was like, what am I
going to talk about?

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.730
We played Scrabble.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.940
But there's always been that.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:08.590
And also, though, every
generation in some ways

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.240
is living an unprecedented life.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.250
And so your mentors can tell you
what it was like 20 years ago.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.055
But every generation faces
completely new challenges.

00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:20.680
So you have your
mentors that help you,

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.070
but then there's also
kind of figuring it out.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.350
And I feel like one
thing I've really

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.870
been grateful for in my
relationship with Pearl

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.410
is that, Pearl, you're
always open to figuring out

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.460
this new challenge.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.210
You don't say, well,
this is how we did it

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.020
and this is how it's done.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.092
Like even negotiating
the internet,

00:22:41.092 --> 00:22:42.550
what does that mean
to be a writer?

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.610
How do you negotiate
questions of privacy

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.750
and what really matters?

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.820
And the internet
makes it so hard

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.890
to stay out of other
people's business.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.585
And the key, I think, to sanity
as a writer is like-- remember

00:22:54.585 --> 00:22:56.793
when you were in grade school
and they would say keep

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:58.690
your eyes on your own paper?

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.100
Keep your eyes on
your own paper.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.900
Stop looking at other
people's careers.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.190
Look at your own.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.010
But the internet has made that
an entirely different kind

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.355
of thing.

00:23:08.355 --> 00:23:09.980
I mean, you've read
all of our letters.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.120
Did you give them
all the letters?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.090
Oh goodness.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.250
I have to say that when
I was up in the library

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.740
and I saw that postcard
with my handwriting on it,

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.890
I was like, oh my goodness,
which one is that?

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.500
That was one of my favorite
items from the exhibit.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.280
Because I would say we probably
exchanged 20 letters a year

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.260
at least.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.050
Yeah.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.690
So when I saw that my letters
were in the collection,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.900
I was thinking it really
could be anything.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.063
I have most of the more
recent ones, so I got you.

00:23:39.063 --> 00:23:40.790
I got you.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.350
So you both have been writing
for many years and you

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.600
have a distinct literary voice.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.850
Are there any up and coming
writers that you're really

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.790
excited about?

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.510
Oh my goodness,
there are so many.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.340
There's so many up
and coming writers.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.980
I mean one thing that's
really exciting to me

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:02.320
is that there's
kind of a missing

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.690
in the generations of
black women writers.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.960
When it came time for me to get
blurbs for my novel An American

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.540
Marriage, I realized
that there were

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.390
black women writers who are
say 10 years older than me--

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.100
I'll just tell you all I'm 47.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.520
So the ones who would be like
in their late 50s, early 60s,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.660
that whole generation
they're not

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.840
publishing the
way they once did.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.920
Something was short
circuited and we've kind of

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.270
misplaced a lot of writers
that used to be active.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.110
I didn't provide
blurbs for everyone,

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.860
but I would read the books
because this younger generation

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.160
would say they really wanted
a black woman to blurb

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.930
their book.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.500
And there were not that many
who were actively publishing

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.960
who could blurb their book.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.030
And so I was always
busy reading and I

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.750
would let any of
them call me and I

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.750
would talk to them for a
couple hours about what

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.330
it's going to be like to
have your first book out.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.420
But now it's so many of them,
they could blurb each other.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.370
They could give
each other advice.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.440
And that has been
really exciting to see

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.550
that there are so many
up and coming writers

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.580
in all different genres.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.610
That's another thing too.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.480
There's so many different
ways of black women writers

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.520
doing their thing that
there isn't that pressure

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.900
to tell the one story.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.740
So like in the world of
mystery we have Attica Locke.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.620
I just adore her mysteries.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.140
I really love The Turner
House by Angela Flournoy.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.210
I really like the short stories
Heads of the Colored People

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.670
by Nafissa Thompson-Spires.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.520
Spires.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.390
Yes.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.867
I really loved her book.

00:25:42.867 --> 00:25:45.200
I love there's a collection
of short stories called Meet

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.150
Behind Mars by Renee Simms.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.040
I mean I could
just go on and on.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.750
I just love Danielle Evans.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:56.270
Her book is called Before You
Suffocate Your Own Fool Self.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.560
You must love that book.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.573
So I mean I love that this
next generation, it's so big.

00:26:03.573 --> 00:26:04.490
And it's funny though.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.573
There's so many of them
and there's such a delight

00:26:06.573 --> 00:26:07.970
in there being so many of them.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.930
But then I do think that they
will not be quite as close knit

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:18.660
because I mean it's both
the pleasure of progress,

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.700
and also the other side
of it is that each of them

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.840
is not as unique and
special to the other

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.070
as you would in a smaller group.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.370
But I think that also
gives them more freedom.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.672
I mean I don't know.

00:26:33.672 --> 00:26:35.130
Does this makes
sense if I say they

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.730
have the freedom that they don't
have to all like each other?

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.030
You know what I mean?

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.860
There is a freedom
in that I think.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.360
Yes.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.027
I think that's very true because
it's not so much that there was

00:26:45.027 --> 00:26:46.740
a rule that you
had to like people,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.650
but there were such
a small number of us

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.890
that when you went on tour,
when another black woman

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.530
writer lived in that town
and heard you were coming,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.190
we went to find each other.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.000
And we would always, do you
want to come back to my house

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.540
and eat?

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.330
What do you need?

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.130
What do you need?

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.650
Because we knew the person
was out there, usually

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.220
alone, not traveling with agents
and managers and all of that,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.430
so that it was more
of a we're going

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.090
to surround you with sisterhood
on this journey that you're on.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.680
But it is true.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.910
It isn't necessary because
there's so many more of them

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.300
and they have so many
more support systems--

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.030
And it's sisterhood like
sisterhood is in real life, not

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.050
metaphorical sisterhood.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.290
No.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.830
I mean for real.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.330
Yeah.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.410
Sisterhood in real
life is complicated.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.390
So yes, you would be
surrounded in sisterhood.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.490
I would say we're
all like a family

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.750
and I mean that for
better and for worse.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.670
That's right.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.570
That's right.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.690
But the good parts
of that would be

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:44.487
after Bebe had given
me this great advice

00:27:44.487 --> 00:27:46.320
and I had a bestseller
and I was on the road

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.530
and I was exhausted, I had been
on the road for three weeks

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.330
and I got to LA, which
is where she lived,

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.670
and she called me up and
said-- and we had never met.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.020
We had just talked on the phone.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.578
She said, OK, I'm going to come
and pick you up at the hotel

00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:00.870
and bring you back to my house.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.340
I know you need a
home cooked meal.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.150
So I said, OK, that
would be great.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.850
Because the book was doing well
they had me at the Four Seasons

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.650
in Beverly Hills.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.090
So that was really fun
to see people coming back

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.443
from shopping trips with
just lots and lots of stuff.

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:17.610
But she said, OK, I'm going
to come and pick you up.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.150
I said, fine.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.150
I'll meet you out front.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.410
She said I'm in a cherry
red Cadillac convertible.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.160
And I laughed.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.510
I thought she was kidding.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.340
She cruised up in
front of my hotel

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.070
in a cherry red
Cadillac convertible.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.890
I jumped in the car and we
headed off into the LA night

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.268
and I said we are
writers now for real.

00:28:34.268 --> 00:28:38.880
We are really writers
because it's an adventure.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.120
It's hard and it's
grueling being

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.190
on the road and all
of that, but it's

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.110
such a wonderful adventure.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.610
I mean, wouldn't
you say that it is?

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.130
It's all the good stuff
and all the bad stuff,

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.045
but the adventure of it
is something that remains.

00:28:52.045 --> 00:28:53.420
And you're in the
midst of a tour

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.760
so I probably shouldn't ask you.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.340
I mean, I do think that the
most exciting thing to me

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.190
actually has--

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.790
I love meeting other writers
and it's very exciting

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.590
to meet people
you've only heard of,

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.600
and now you know them
and you can call them.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.190
But to me the best part about
being a black woman writer,

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.675
a black woman
readers, are readers--

00:29:14.675 --> 00:29:16.550
You probably don't even
remember this, Pearl.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.880
We did this reading together.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.880
This is about 15 years ago.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.147
And I read, she read.

00:29:22.147 --> 00:29:22.730
I was signing.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.160
She had this long signing
line all around the corner

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.770
and I signed my few people
who were interested in me.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.480
And this woman came
and she brought Pearl

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.010
this jewelry box
she had made and it

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.120
was full of all these
hand beaded earrings.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.970
And she was showing Pearl the
earrings and she looked at me

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.960
and said, oh, you poor thing.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.460
She said you don't
have any fans.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.607
And she said Pearl, do you mind?

00:29:45.607 --> 00:29:47.940
And she went in the jewelry
box and got this little pair

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.357
and said, here,
these are for you.

00:29:49.357 --> 00:29:51.045
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:51.045 --> 00:29:51.920
And I said thank you.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.615
I put them on.

00:29:53.615 --> 00:29:54.740
Because that's what you do.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.160
And I thought that's the most
generous readers, the most

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.610
generous who would hand-make
all these earrings for her,

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.140
share some with little me.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.570
I mean, when I
moved to New Jersey

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.680
I received a hand knitted
Afghan from one of my readers

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.110
who said it's really
cold up there.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.957
I had a time when I was
in between contracts.

00:30:16.957 --> 00:30:18.540
I couldn't get a
contract for my book.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.715
I was in terrible
shape, but I always

00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:23.090
knew that I had black women
readers who would write to me

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.040
and say hope the
book is going well.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.510
We're looking forward to it.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.520
So that even when the
publishers were telling me

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.290
there was no
audience for my work,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.000
I knew there was an
audience for my work

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.680
because they had told me so.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.240
And that has been
the thing that's

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.350
really unique because
being black publishing it's

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:45.120
hard to make the same amount of
sales as your white colleagues.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.150
It's just racism pretty much.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.650
You don't sell as many books.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:56.030
But I feel that your readers
appreciate you so much.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.810
None of your readers
take you for granted

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.310
and you don't take
them for granted.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.530
So you have this connection.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.000
So there's a program
called Book Scan.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.065
This thing is the
bane of my existence.

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.690
They can put your
name in the book scan

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.468
and see how many books you sell.

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:12.260
So if you want to go
up for an opportunity,

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.700
they can just punch it in there.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.310
Before Book Scan you used
to could just act successful

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.160
and people would take
your word for it.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.150
But now they can actually
pull up the numbers.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.340
So my book scan may not be the
same as my white colleagues,

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:32.480
but I feel that my heart and my
writing life with my readers,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.178
I have twice the
life that they do.

00:31:36.178 --> 00:31:37.169
Excellent.

00:31:37.169 --> 00:31:37.669
Nice.

00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:41.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.590
And I'm sure you both have a
huge following of black women

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.040
readers here in Atlanta.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.000
I know that my book club
reads you all quite often.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.410
I'd like to shift
gears a bit and talk

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.360
about you both as writers.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.250
So Pearl, you are a writer
and figure that synonymous

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.280
with the city of
Atlanta; and Tayari,

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.210
when the news broke that you
would be coming here to Emory,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:12.420
it felt like a homecoming
that was sort of long overdue.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.610
And Atlanta has loomed so
large in both of your works.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.570
Can you talk a little bit
about what's special to you

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.110
about the city of
Atlanta as a writer?

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.860
Well, I think it's
interesting that people

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.198
are surprised that you can set
a bunch of books in Atlanta.

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.240
I mean I have six novels
that are set in Atlanta.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.930
I have a number of plays
that are set in Atlanta.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.660
Because a lot of people
who live in New York think

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.570
there isn't really a real
life outside of New York.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.070
If you're going to
write a real book

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.390
you have to write
about New York.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:44.350
If you're going to
write a real book

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.760
you have to write
about New York.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.080
Well I don't live in New York.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.270
I live in southwest Atlanta.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.430
So I don't even live
all over Atlanta.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.190
I live in southwest
Atlanta, so that my books

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.650
are set in southwest
Atlanta because that's

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.540
the community I know.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.240
And I always want to
write about what I know,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.850
which isn't to say all
writers have to do that.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.588
I mean some people can transport
themselves to someplace

00:33:07.588 --> 00:33:08.380
they've never been.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.940
And I admire that,
but I really want

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.900
to get it right by writing about
something that I know well.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.180
And I know that I have
had people come to me

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.700
and talk to me about the
books as if they really

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.190
expect to run into these
people on the street, which

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.022
is a wonderful thing for me.

00:33:29.022 --> 00:33:29.980
A woman came up to me--

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.180
I want to run into Blue.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:31.450
I know.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.117
People always looking
for Blue Hamilton.

00:33:33.117 --> 00:33:34.420
Always looking for Blue.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.670
A woman came up to me and
said, I love your new book--

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.020
and it was one of the novels.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.180
I love your new book, but
you got something wrong.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.070
And I said, well,
OK-- because that's

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.160
the other thing about our
readers, they will tell you.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.720
I said, OK, what
did I get wrong?

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.520
And she said the
Krispy Kreme is not

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.900
across from the Marta Station.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.690
The Krispy Kreme is
further down Cascade Road

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.760
because in between
the time I wrote

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.920
the book and the time
the book was published,

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.700
the Krispy Kreme moved from
where it was down the block.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.860
And the woman was
highly indignant

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.350
that I had misplaced
the Krispy Kreme.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.173
So I explained to her
the process of publishing

00:34:08.173 --> 00:34:10.090
and that the reason was
the time that it took.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.037
And I said, I swear
to you next book

00:34:12.037 --> 00:34:14.370
I will make sure the Krispy
Kreme is in its right place.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:15.600
And I did.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.830
I put somebody in there
going through the drive thru

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.000
and talked about how the drive
thru was just the devil's work

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.880
because you could
get donuts so easily.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.250
But I loved her for being so
protective of the neighborhood

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.739
that we both live in and
that we both love that she

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.210
wanted me to get it right.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.699
If you're going to write
about our neighborhood then

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.170
write about our neighborhood.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.230
Get it right.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.239
So I've always found that
to be a tremendous level

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.170
of satisfaction to write about
the neighborhood where I live,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:49.120
to write about people who could
inhabit those places where

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:49.659
I live.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:53.320
So it's been wonderful for me
and it's always funny to me

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.430
that people who live in New York
will be surprised that people

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.670
outside of New York like us
can set a book in Atlanta

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:05.240
and it can actually be a
good and interesting book.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.990
I mean I was living in New
York up until like about 10

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.417
minutes ago and I found
that when I was in New York

00:35:11.417 --> 00:35:13.000
I would tell people
I was from Atlanta

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.800
and it would be kind
of confusing to them

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.953
because when you say
you're from the south

00:35:16.953 --> 00:35:19.120
they act like you got to
Brooklyn on the Underground

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.620
Railroad.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.120
And they expect you to
have this super tragic life

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.520
story because they don't
know how we live in Atlanta.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.820
I mean I feel like Atlanta
has more opportunities for me

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.690
as a black woman than New York.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.690
But they can't believe
that because just the way

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.370
that they've constructed
their identity

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.630
and their understanding
of politics.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.690
And so when I
wrote my first book

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.930
about growing up in Atlanta
during the child murders,

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.430
I wanted to write
about it because I

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.570
felt like the generation
that grew up at that time,

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.555
that our experience
had been forgotten.

00:35:55.555 --> 00:35:57.850
Even here at home that no
one really talked about it

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.000
and I wanted to write that as
a love letter to my generation

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.290
as a remembrance.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.940
So I wrote that for that reason.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.370
But then I kept setting
the books in Atlanta

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.610
because I feel like
one, it's what I know,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.110
but also I feel
like there's a space

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:15.640
in southern literature,
the black urban southern

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.510
experience.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.550
People think that
southern literature is

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.460
about grandmothers and mules.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.830
I've never even seen
a mule in my life.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.380
I wouldn't know one
if it walked in here.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.750
And so I started kind
of self consciously

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.070
writing toward that.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.530
And also I'm very
interested in the ideas

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.760
of the way black people
negotiate questions of class.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.470
And I read somewhere that
they say the most people don't

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.560
know anyone that is from a
different class background

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.225
as they are.

00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:46.600
But I feel that
with black people

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.630
we have so much class mobility
in a generation because

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.950
of civil rights.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:54.040
My father literally
picked cotton as a boy

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.550
and he's in his 80s
now and he has a PhD.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:02.020
So just imagine what the class
range of that is in the family,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.198
and we have just
a lot of movement.

00:37:04.198 --> 00:37:05.990
And so I always wanted
to write about that.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.470
And I felt like the south,
Atlanta in particular,

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.070
gives a lot of space to talk
about black upward mobility,

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:16.670
downward mobility, all the
ways that we know each other.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.810
And so that's why
I choose Atlanta,

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.360
and also I want to
write a book where

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.880
the people seem familiar to me.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.713
I want to write a book
where the people feel

00:37:26.713 --> 00:37:28.000
like they live on the page.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.400
That they live in the
world, not on a page.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.650
I mean that's just a
different style of writing.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.380
But I want to feel like if
something were to happen,

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.510
the apocalypse were
to happen, that we

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.810
would leave our books behind and
people could see what happened.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.050
That's very powerful, especially
as someone from the south

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.190
and definitely appreciating
you all depicting the south

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.570
in a certain way.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.740
Basically everything that
you've said that there is life

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.208
here in the south
that's not rural.

00:38:03.208 --> 00:38:05.125
Do you all consider
yourself southern writers?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.020
I do now.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.500
I didn't for a long time
because I grew up in Detroit.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.950
So for a long time I was
one of those transplants

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.582
who would say I'm from Detroit.

00:38:17.582 --> 00:38:18.290
I'm from Detroit.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.300
I'm from Detroit because
that's where I grew up.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.790
And then of course because
all the real Atlanta

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.620
people would never
let you forget

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.390
that you weren't from here.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:30.330
It's like no, you've only
been here 10 years, 20 years,

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:30.830
30 years.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.340
They still won't let
me be from Atlanta.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:40.775
So for a long time southern
writer to me meant Faulkner.

00:38:40.775 --> 00:38:43.130
It was not something
that I thought about

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.530
because I didn't
identify with the region.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.300
I identified racially.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.880
I identified as a black writer.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.890
I grew up in a black
nationalist household

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.310
so that we were less focused
on the region we were living in

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.530
and more focused on
the race that we were.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.410
So that it took me
a long time to get

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.170
my mind comfortable with
the idea of calling myself

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.280
a southern writer.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.940
But I live in the south
and I write in the south

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.920
about a southern place.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.820
So I don't think I can deny it.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.880
I mean I think if we're
going to do definitions

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.625
I would have to call myself a
black woman, southern writer

00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:18.125
feminist.

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:20.422
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:20.422 --> 00:39:22.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.800
So it's kind of like, OK,
how many kinds of labels

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.580
can you have?

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.040
But I'm comfortable
with that one.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.312
I guess that's fine.

00:39:33.312 --> 00:39:34.520
I mean I'm a southern writer.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.410
It's not even complicated.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.758
But I am a member of the
Fellowship of Southern Writers,

00:39:38.758 --> 00:39:39.800
which is an organization.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.920
There are 50 southern writers
and they induct another--

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.970
they only bring in a new writer
if another writer passes away.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.660
And I'm one of the few black
people in the Fellowship

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.920
of Southern Writers.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.400
And I've always wanted to
be called a southern writer,

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.800
and up until very
recently I just was not.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.560
I was called a black writer
because they will only

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.660
let you be one thing at a time.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.660
And a lot of my white
Southern colleagues,

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.060
they are trying to
break out of that.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.670
They feel like that's
a pigeonhole or a niche

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.040
for them to be called
a southern writer.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.160
They want to break out and
I'm trying to break in.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.640
But it is important for
me that black writers

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.182
identify as southern.

00:40:21.182 --> 00:40:21.890
This is our home.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.640
We have so much history
here in the south.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.640
It's very specific to the south.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.200
And I just hold it up and when
there's a southern writers

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.695
event and I'm not
invited, I'm mad.

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.320
As a matter of fact,
I was on the phone

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.600
today with a guy
from Time Magazine.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.333
They had that
issue on the south.

00:40:37.333 --> 00:40:38.750
He called me about
something else.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.542
I was like, well, before
we go any further,

00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:42.530
we need to talk about
why you didn't call me

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.900
about this southern thing.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.030
And he said, oh, it was
by no means comprehensive.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.947
I was like, obviously.

00:40:46.947 --> 00:40:48.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.632
But he promised me I'll
be in the next one.

00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:53.480
Excellent.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.770
In closing, I'd like to bring
us back to where we started

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.850
with the concept of mentorship.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.310
And I think that you all have
really dropped some gems for us

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.850
in terms of the advice that
you've received from a mentor.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.700
But what advice might you
give to your younger self

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.750
about being a writer?

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.420
I would say don't worry so much.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.180
But I would say that about
every area of my life, not just

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.420
writing.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.360
But I was so intensely
focused on being a writer,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.480
but I was also worried about
how I would make a living,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.363
whether or not I
had anything to say,

00:41:32.363 --> 00:41:33.780
whether or not the
boys would ever

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.600
move aside so that we girls
could have something to say.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.680
All of those things that
I worried about a lot.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.200
And I think that
the idea of being

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.070
able to relax into what you are
as early as you possibly can

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.715
is always something wonderful.

00:41:50.715 --> 00:41:52.295
And you can't control that.

00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:53.670
Sometime you can
know who you are

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.620
and relax into it
when you're 25.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.870
Sometime you have
to be 70 to do it.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.520
But whenever you
do it it's going

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.860
to be that moment when you say,
oh, this is what I'm doing.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.480
So I think that
the biggest thing

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.570
would be not to worry
because I've always

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.500
been very disciplined.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.870
I've always been able
to meet a deadline.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.005
I've always found
opportunities and pursued

00:42:15.005 --> 00:42:15.880
them and all of that.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.425
So I think it's basically just
the relax and do your work.

00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:20.550
Don't drive yourself crazy.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.180
You'll be fine.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.960
Thanks.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.615
I think I would give myself
the advice, which actually she

00:42:27.615 --> 00:42:29.490
gave me the advice, but
I would have given it

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.100
to myself before she had a
chance to give it to me, which

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.860
is that it's OK to quit things.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.450
When I went to graduate
school I didn't

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.700
want to be in graduate school.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.790
I only went to graduate
school to get a PhD because I

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.070
was being discouraged
from every side

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.982
from trying to be a writer
because they weren't my family

00:42:46.982 --> 00:42:48.690
and some of my other
mentors-- everyone's

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.920
worried about how I was
going to make a living.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.950
And so they said go get the PhD.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:57.330
Go do that and you can do your
writing, whatever this is, you

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.940
can do that on the weekends.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.763
And I took the--

00:43:01.763 --> 00:43:03.180
what is that test?
--the GRE and I

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.055
made a good score so I
was given a fellowship

00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:06.430
to go get this PhD.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.870
I was 20 years old
and I was so unhappy.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.000
It just wasn't what
I wanted to do.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.958
And I wrote Pearl this long
letter about how unhappy I was

00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:17.250
and how I had other plans
and I wanted to write a book,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.833
maybe about the
Atlanta child murders.

00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:21.150
I wrote her all this
long, long, long letter

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:27.231
and she sent me back a postcard
and she said leave that place.

00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:29.877
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:32.630
It said something
like you can quit.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.010
Nothing's going to happen.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.660
It's your life.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.103
And I said, really?

00:43:39.103 --> 00:43:40.520
Because I had
always been told you

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.960
have to finish what you start.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.840
And I quit, and guess what?

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.810
Nothing happened.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:46.980
It was fine.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.390
So I think I would have told
myself that earlier, that you

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:54.427
may feel like the responsibility
for yourself, for the race,

00:43:54.427 --> 00:43:56.010
for everyone that's
on your shoulders.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.260
But it's really not.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.960
Do what you need to do
to make your life better.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.120
And I remember that
because I remember

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.690
feeling like the responsible
thing for me to do

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.110
was to say stick
it out, and I knew

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.610
that Mack and Barbara would
kill me if I told you you should

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:12.020
drop out and all of that.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.270
But it was like trying to
write the responsible letter

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.180
and then saying this woman
is a writer like you.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.980
She's dying out there.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.870
So that's why it was
down to the postcard.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.910
So it was like, what do
you really want to say?

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.428
And all I really wanted to
say was leave there now.

00:44:25.428 --> 00:44:27.470
Get on the plane, pack
your stuff, and come home.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.580
Just imagine me reading
it and I start packing.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.190
That's right.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.510
Pack your stuff and come home.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.770
That's right.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:34.850
That's right.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.690
Well, we're so glad
that you're home now.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.600
Thank you both so much for
sharing this evening with us.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.720
This has been so
lovely and getting

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.020
to know more about your
relationship to one another

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.100
and how black women
writers, either

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.880
in your own personal life
or ones that you've read

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.380
or your readers have impacted
your own work, is so amazing.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.830
And I'm so honored to have
you all with us this evening.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:05.810
Thank you.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.380
So now what we are going
to do is actually give you

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.590
all the opportunity
to ask questions.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.690
We'll take questions
from Facebook Live

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.600
and then we will
also take questions

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.880
from those of you that
are in the ballroom.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.050
So there are two microphones
right here in the front.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:31.820
So you can begin to line
up there for your question

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.150
so that we can take as
many questions as possible.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.940
Please do take a few moments
to formulate your question.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.020
Her microphone is not
here, so let's do this one.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.260
All right.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.260
Well, we're going to
start maybe on this side

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:01.760
where the microphone
is [CUTTING OUT]..

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.360
So I want to first
say thank you this.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.234
I absolutely mean it.

00:46:07.234 --> 00:46:10.270
I have been holding onto two
books for about seven years

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:14.910
because the publishing company
that I sent it to basically

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.960
told me that it wasn't
worth publishing.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.225
So what do I do?

00:46:20.225 --> 00:46:21.600
I don't even know
where to begin.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.660
I've been having this
story for so long that I'd

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.193
like to present and I don't even
know where to begin with it.

00:46:28.193 --> 00:46:29.610
Have you written
the book already?

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.110
Yes.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.000
So you're looking for
a publisher basically?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.163
Is that where I begin?

00:46:34.163 --> 00:46:36.330
Do I look for an agent or
do I look for a publisher?

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:37.560
Do you have an agent?

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.160
I don't.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.120
OK.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.520
It's better to have an agent
before you have a publisher,

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.830
but those are real specific.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.980
Can you just stop and talk to
me for a second afterward--

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.550
Sure.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:53.370
--because you need all of that
in order to protect yourself,

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.950
or you can look at the whole
idea of self publishing,

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.260
which is much more possible
now than it used to be.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.330
So let's talk a
little bit after.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:01.830
OK, great.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:02.340
Thank you.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.920
And I appreciate you're
saying you needed this

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.690
because I needed this a lot.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:24.460
I've been watching the hearings
all day and I think all of us

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:28.120
as Americans and as
people who believe

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.780
in freedom and as people
who believe in truth,

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.330
I think we have to think
deeply about what's

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.290
happening to our institutions.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.130
I think we have to think
deeply about our responsibility

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.480
as American people.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.090
And if you didn't see any
of that hearing today,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.100
just look at a little bit of it.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.380
Look at what the woman
who stepped forward

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.180
against all sanity to tell
the truth as a good citizen.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.040
Look at what she had
to say and then look

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.090
at the response
of Republican men

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.460
on that committee who
had something to say.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.670
Because as American
people-- and Tayari

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.130
will tell you how long it
took me to even call myself

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.740
an American person.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.070
--but we have to think deeply
as Americans about what

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.460
that mess that went on today in
Washington means for all of us.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.827
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.980
So we're going to take a
question from Facebook Live.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.880
This is a question for
both you Pearl and Tayari.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.745
What is your all time
favorite book or novel?

00:48:36.387 --> 00:48:38.220
And we don't have to
say each other's books.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.120
Not required.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.950
It's like what book or novel is
speaking to me at the moment?

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.950
About five years ago I was
kind of obsessed with Tar Baby

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.007
by Toni Morrison.

00:48:56.007 --> 00:48:57.590
And I think it's
because I was writing

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:02.240
a novel that was raising some
of the same questions with it.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.090
And right now I'm writing
something about Ann Petry's The

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.230
Street.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:10.310
And it was published
I want to say in '47.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.210
She sold a million
copies and she's kind of

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:15.350
fallen off the radar.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.298
She was the first
black women to sale--

00:49:17.298 --> 00:49:18.965
this is a million
copies before Twitter.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.660
There weren't even
as many people

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.490
in the country to buy
the million copies,

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.260
and she did this.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.150
And I've been really
obsessed with her career

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:32.918
and that novel The Street.

00:49:32.918 --> 00:49:34.210
Because it's hard to pick one--

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.920
I mean I have many
that I like, but I

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.010
think one that made a
big impression on me

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.070
was The Temple of My
Familiar by Alice Walker

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.010
because it was so not what I
expected from Alice Walker.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.420
Which I've learned not to expect
anything from Alice Walker

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.022
because she's going
to give me what

00:49:50.022 --> 00:49:51.730
she's supposed to give
me at that moment.

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:55.240
But that book was
so expansive and so

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.343
able to go beyond what
people had kind of put

00:49:58.343 --> 00:50:00.760
in the box of this is what
black women writers are allowed

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.690
to write about.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.370
She was writing
about reincarnation.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.528
She was writing about all kinds
of things, a 500-year-old woman

00:50:06.528 --> 00:50:07.570
walking through the book.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.970
And it was just a
wonderful, amazing book.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.160
So I would have to say
The Temple of My Familiar

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.460
is one that really
continues to be one

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.400
that I go back to just for the
pleasure of opening to any page

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.458
and saying, oh, I
remember that's the story

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:21.250
about the feathers.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.810
Oh, I remember that's the
story about this and that.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.460
Thank you.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.050
Hello, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.415
I'm a senior at Spelman College.

00:50:28.415 --> 00:50:29.730
Oh, at Spelman.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.200
Yeah.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.360
I want to say thank you
so much for being here.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.800
I love An American Marriage.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.230
It's by far my favorite novel.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.040
But I wanted to ask
as someone who's more

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.870
like comfortable with
academic and stiff writing,

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:45.910
how should I nurture my
creative writing skills?

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.710
Just practice.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:48.670
Do you keep a journal?

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.210
I do it every day.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.460
Are you stiff in your journal?

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:51.960
No.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.460
But more so just like capturing.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.590
I guess similar to what
you all talked about

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.180
and capturing the
city of Atlanta.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.890
Like how do I capture stories?

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.320
I'm into sociology so I do a
lot of type of ethnographies.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.350
So I want to know
how do I really tell

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:09.910
the stories of other people in
I guess like a free way that

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:14.110
is not just jaded or bias?

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:15.880
You're going to be
bias, and that's OK.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.860
Your bias is your point of view.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.292
And that's a good thing.

00:51:20.292 --> 00:51:22.000
So I think that's one
thing, is don't try

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.837
to run from your point of view.

00:51:23.837 --> 00:51:24.670
What is it they say?

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.340
It's not a bug, it's a feature?

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.380
Yeah.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.510
That's what that is.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.100
But just don't worry.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.660
It sounds like you're worrying
about what someone else is

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.577
going to say about it.

00:51:32.577 --> 00:51:35.040
You're critiquing it
as you're writing it.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.200
Writing and publishing
are two different things.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.610
Writing is where
you can be free.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.180
It's just between you and
the page, and later on worry

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.930
about what someone
else is going to think.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.400
Worry about an audience later.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.440
But just write for
your own pleasure.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.710
Write a story that
speaks to your heart,

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.490
and once you do that
it will be free.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:52.980
It will not be
stiff and you just

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.960
worry about all that
other stuff later.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.740
Thank you.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.180
And eavesdrop on people.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.050
Listen to people.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:59.383
You want to write about Atlanta?

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:03.000
Go someplace in a public place
and sit and listen to people.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.980
I mean that's a
great story you have

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.360
about in American Marriage.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.790
But just listen to people
because not only will you

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.270
get great stories,
but you also will

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:16.590
be able to be more familiar with
the rhythms of how people talk.

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.150
Listen to a conversation
and then see

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.590
if you can reproduce it.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.180
Listen to what people
are saying when

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.730
they're arguing
in a public place,

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.105
trying to keep
their voices down.

00:52:25.105 --> 00:52:27.438
What did they say when they're
arguing in a public place

00:52:27.438 --> 00:52:29.580
and don't care about
keeping their voices down?

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.200
But just listen to people.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.720
Listen to what they say
and try to figure out

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.518
how much you can glean
from what they actually say

00:52:36.518 --> 00:52:38.310
and then from the things
they're not saying

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:39.240
and put it in your journal.

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:39.823
Write it down.

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.420
Thank you.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.040
Good evening.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.240
I'm Dr. Karla Booker.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.070
I'm former faculty at
Morehouse School of Medicine.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.980
And I want to just
say I'm just moved.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.990
I'm moved by the
warmth in the room

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.810
by the personal
relationship I feel

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:57.620
I have with you having
never met either one of you.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.140
And I'm really curious
because I really

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.210
feel that there's something
about the mentorship

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.930
and the sisterhood and the
auntie and the mother/daughter

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:08.630
that is going on on
this stage that we

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.490
need to have in this country.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.010
I'm a physician here in Atlanta.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:15.930
I'm 55 years old, so on
the end of my career.

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:19.520
And so there were no
black female physicians,

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.040
and I was here in Atlanta at
Georgia Baptist or Atlanta

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.840
Medical Center
during my residency.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.090
So I'm trying to
figure out, how is it

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.520
that we're in the
same generation

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.402
and that mentorship was not
there for me as a physician?

00:53:33.402 --> 00:53:35.360
And I want to be able to
give it going forward.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.830
So how is it that, what?

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.430
20 years ago?

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.930
30.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.450
30 years ago that
you all had this

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:45.290
and have this warm powerful
humility that I just

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.000
feel like we want to
have as black women.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.375
And I feel like
sometimes there's

00:53:48.375 --> 00:53:52.280
this something that says,
yeah, it's mutually exclusive.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.470
I can't have it and
you have it too.

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.970
And how can we do
that for ourselves

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:59.120
as black women and also to do
it for ourselves as Americans

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.020
and human beings?

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.120
Because that's the
end to all this stuff

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.040
you're talking about
that's going on today?

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.320
So I want to acknowledge that.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.600
When I teach, I tell my
students when they find out

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.975
about opportunities, they'll
try to hoard an opportunity.

00:54:14.975 --> 00:54:16.970
They'll find out
there's a fellowship

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:20.600
and they won't tell the
others because that'll lessen

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.170
their own chance of getting it.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.280
And I have to tell
them that's OK.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.640
You have to let the
others try, even if it

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.750
means that it could cost you.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:34.640
I mean the students,
they know that the more

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.340
people who apply the lesser
your own chances of getting it.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.450
That's just the truth.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.130
So the reason you
share with others

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.047
is not that we can both
have it, because there

00:54:42.047 --> 00:54:44.005
are going to be some
things we can't both have,

00:54:44.005 --> 00:54:45.060
but that's not the point.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:47.747
The point is that we can
all have the opportunity,

00:54:47.747 --> 00:54:49.580
and that's what I think
is a thing to learn.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.918
People are so afraid
of losing something,

00:54:52.918 --> 00:54:55.460
but I don't think the answer is
to tell them they won't lose.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.280
The answer is that
you might lose that,

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.560
but what you gain
from helping someone

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.260
is more valuable than
that thing you might lose.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.100
Perfect.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.100
I also think the
thing about mentoring

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.850
is that the word itself
sounds so formal.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.270
And I'm sure that I've
played a mentoring role,

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:19.070
but the fact is I don't think
of myself as her mentor.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.660
We're friends so that there's--

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.880
But she is my mentor though.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.760
I feel like she just
kicked me out the nest.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.000
No.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:26.500
No.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.320
No.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:27.820
No.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.200
No.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:28.570
Never.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.040
Never.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.310
No.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:29.550
No.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:30.070
No.

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:37.350
But I have run into lots
of talented young women

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.100
and I try to give them
the benefit of what

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.600
I can give them.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.430
And then it's just
like in life and then

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.320
you meet somebody
who actually is

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.210
going to be a friend of yours.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.340
So that of course the
mentoring will always go

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.530
on because I'll always be older,
but it's like there's things

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:54.310
that you know and have
experience that I haven't.

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:57.190
I mean I can't even figure
out the password on my phone.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.390
So it's just the whole idea
of talking about social media

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:02.150
and all of that.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:05.350
So I think if you're trying
to pass on some of what

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:07.720
you longed for and didn't get--

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.160
don't think of it so much in the
abstract as a mentoring thing.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.840
Find a young woman that
you like and then tell her

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.010
what you know.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:16.720
Take her out to
have a cup of tea

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.720
or a glass of wine or
whatever and talk about things

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.440
because I don't think
it becomes after a while

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.780
a formal thing of, OK, now
you're home from your trip.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.437
How did it go and I'll tell
you how I'm feeling about it.

00:56:28.437 --> 00:56:30.520
It's kind of like let's
go have dinner and tell me

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.450
how it's going.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.000
So find somebody that you like
and tell them what you know.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.500
Fabulous.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.250
Thank you so much.

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:39.680
Hi.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.110
I'm Carolyn Jackson, and I
write for a couple of blogs

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.240
that I'm going to
plug in a little bit.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:51.460
But in those groups that I've
worked with, a couple of times

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.230
it'll come up, who's
your favorite author?

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.810
So they don't really like
to ask me that anymore

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.060
because they knew I'm going
to say Pearl [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.143
What's your favorite book?

00:56:59.143 --> 00:57:01.480
What Looks Like Crazy
on an Ordinary Day?

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.920
So who knows how many
books I've sold for you.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.420
Thank you.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.680
Just simply buy every single
time they ask me that.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.310
I plug you all the time.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:11.680
So here's my question.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.900
The book cover,
the original, which

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.330
I would love to have had you
autograph that particular one,

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:21.880
but I bought a new one, that you
can autograph that one for me.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.400
What was the
inspiration with that?

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.350
The book caught my
eye, one, because Oprah

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:31.120
told me to read it, and then,
two, the cover was so unique.

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.710
What was the
inspiration behind that?

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.510
And then here's my
part two question.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:40.420
Can I have Blue and is Ava
your favorite character?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:43.490
Because she's actually
my favorite hero.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.530
Is she my favorite--

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:45.700
Ava Johnson.

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.350
Ava Johnson is my
favorite shero.

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.390
And so those are all
my questions for you.

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.240
OK, great.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.630
So the first question
is about the cover,

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.648
the cover of the first
edition where she's

00:57:57.648 --> 00:57:58.940
lassoing the moon or something?

00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.230
Absolutely.

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:00.820
What was the
inspiration behind that?

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.770
Totally not my choice.

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.640
Didn't have any input
into that at all,

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.390
and actually didn't
like that color at all.

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.480
But people have liked it a lot.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.690
So I was wrong because
people did embrace it.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.200
Yeah.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.590
So oftentimes the
author doesn't have

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:20.350
much to say about the
cover of the book.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:24.000
And that was their
design, not mine.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.957
But it was all right.

00:58:24.957 --> 00:58:26.290
It did fine and people liked it.

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:27.345
So it was fine.

00:58:27.345 --> 00:58:28.970
And what'd you ask
me about the other--

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:30.160
Shero.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.700
About?

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.270
Shero.

00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:35.730
Like my favorite shero?

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:38.890
Is Ava my favorite one?

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:40.890
Of all the women that
I've written about?

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.360
I can't really pick like that.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.180
I love Ava so much,
but I also love

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.340
some of the other women
who have done other things.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.507
I love the women in my play.

00:58:48.507 --> 00:58:51.510
So that's kind of like
picking among your kids.

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:52.302
So I love them all.

00:58:52.302 --> 00:58:53.843
I'd let them all
stay in that circle.

00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:55.220
And one last one for Tayari.

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.950
What's your inspiration
for writing?

00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:59.630
Your inspiration for writing?

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:00.470
In general?

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.410
Yes.

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:01.910
Oh.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:03.330
It really varies.

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.430
I mean it varies with my mood.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.630
I think consistently the
inspiration is always

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:12.560
to try to figure out an answer
to a question that's bothering

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.310
me in my own life and I then
I use the stories to try

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:17.990
to work it out.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:21.727
But I don't write books
about people I know.

00:59:21.727 --> 00:59:23.810
Sometimes people say, who
are these people really?

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.810
And I'm like they're
actually not anyone.

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.270
They think I'm lying, but
they really are imaginary.

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:31.310
But the questions
that they raise

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.960
tend to come from my own life.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.160
I'd like to prattle
around in your head.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.660
OK.

00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.740
Thank you so much.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.650
So we are going to take one
final question over here

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.600
on this side.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.200
Good evening.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.890
I just want to seize the
opportunity to say how--

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:48.258
I can kind of feel your
kind is coming for--

00:59:48.258 --> 00:59:49.550
you probably don't remember me.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.450
But my mother had passed
away and I met you

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:55.790
at the Nordan Juice
Bar and I had told you

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.780
about all I wanted was my
mother's letters my father had

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.790
written her from World War II.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.160
And he must have written
something provocative

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.118
and he would say I
can't wait to get home

01:00:07.118 --> 01:00:08.160
and then he'd cut it out.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.575
So there was this letter
with all these holes in it.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.700
And so you said, you know
that's a book, don't you?

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.420
And I said, it is?

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.920
And you said I'm
going on book tour.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.398
Write something and when
I get back I'll help you.

01:00:18.398 --> 01:00:19.940
So I used to see
you out and I'd hide

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.315
because I hadn't
written anything

01:00:21.315 --> 01:00:23.870
and you said I'm not going
to bug you about writing.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.580
If you want to
write I'll help you.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.080
And I just thought
that was so kind.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.788
And then one time you
said the material--

01:00:28.788 --> 01:00:31.402
Do you mind add going for
it with your question?

01:00:31.402 --> 01:00:33.110
I just wanted to thank
her for being kind

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.480
and I'd never got started.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.850
But since I saw how
you mentored her

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.640
I really would take the
opportunity to write.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.410
It's been very inspiring to me.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.060
Thank you.
