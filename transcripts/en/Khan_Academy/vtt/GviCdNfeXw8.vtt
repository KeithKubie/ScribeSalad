00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, problem 42.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.270
So say for the system of
equations given, and this is

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.240
the system of equations they
give, they say x minus 4 is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.460
equal to z.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.760
They say y minus x is equal
to 8, and that 8 minus

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340
z is equal to t.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990
So they say for the system
equation, what is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.060
the value of z?

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.070
So we're trying to figure
out z in this.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.170
Statement number one: they tell
us that x is equal to 7.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.580
Well, if we know x is equal to
7, we can solve for z right

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.020
here because x is 7 and 7 minus
4 is z, so 7 minus 4 is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.130
3, so z is equal to 3.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.380
That was pretty straightforward.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.910
So one alone is sufficient just
using this first equation

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.410
in the system.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.690
So let's see if two
is of any use.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.940
t is equal to 5.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.990
Well, this is an
easy one, too.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.180
You put t is equal to 5 right
here and then you could easily

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
solve for z, right?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.050
You get 8 minus z is equal to
5 and you can solve for it,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.650
but I'm not even
going to do it.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380
You just have to know
that you can.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.140
So this alone is sufficient
as well.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.050
So the answer is D.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.500
Each statement alone
is sufficient.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.040
Problem 43.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.570
Is x equal to 5?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.690
In statement number one,
they say x is greater

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.760
than or equal to 5.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.710
Well, that doesn't tell me
whether x is equal to 5.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.080
It just says it's
greater than 5.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.900
Statement number two tells us x
is less than or equal to 5.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.600
Once again, that does not tell
me whether x is 5, but if I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.230
told you that both of these are
true, x is greater than or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.020
equal 5, and-- not or-- and x
is less than or equal to 5,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.340
well, actually, that still--
well, the only x that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.120
satisfies that equation,
that satisfies both of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.980
these, is 5, right?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.170
I mean, you put 3 in, 3 will
not satisfy this one.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.010
If you put 7 in, 7 will
not satisfy this one.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.120
So the only thing that satisfies
this is 5, so you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.260
need both of these.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.270
So the answer is both statements
together are

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.490
sufficient, C.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.370
That one's confusing because
it's so simple on some level.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.950
44.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.230
The table above shows that
this-- let me see if I can

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.480
draw this table.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:05.325
And they write R, S T, U,
and R, S, T, and U.

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:06.930
They have a bunch of things.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.780
I don't even know what
these are yet.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.960
I haven't read the question, but
let's see, 0, y, x, 62, y,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:30.130
0, 56, 75, x, 56, 0, 69.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.910
And then 62-- that's a 6--
62, 75, 69, and 0.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.100
And what are they
going to ask?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.710
They're saying the table above
shows the distance in

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.740
kilometers by the most direct
route between any two of the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.760
four cities.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.920
For example, the distance
between city R

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.740
and city U is 62.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.030
Or if you said between U and
R, it's going to be 62 as

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.430
well, right?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.530
That's the same thing.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.700
Fair enough.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.620
What is the value of x?

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.490
So the value of x is the
distance between T and R.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.010
Let me circle that.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.600
They want to know what
the value of x is.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.195
It's the distance between T
and R, so it's that one.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:14.390
And another way to look at
distance between T and R,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.660
that's this one so,
these are both x.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.750
Fair enough.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.510
OK.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.100
So statement number one tells
us, by the most direct route,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.920
the distance between S and T,
so we could say the distance

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.300
between S and T, I'll just say
it's line segment ST, is equal

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.450
to twice the distance
between S and R.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.000
It's equal to two times SR.
So let's see, do we

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.670
know what SR is?

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.230
SR is equal to y, right?

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:56.320
And ST is equal to 56.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.180
So 56 is equal to 2 times SR.
The distance between S and R

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810
is y, so it equals 2y.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.590
And so we can solve for y.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.050
y is equal to 28.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.290
And we didn't have to solve
it, but let's see.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.010
I'm just trying to see
where this goes.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.630
But that still doesn't help
me figure out the distance

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.440
between R and T.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.880
That just tells me solve
for y. y is 28.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.210
Statement number two, see
where this is going.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.970
By the most direct route the
distance between T and U is

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.510
1.5 times the distance
between R and T.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.670
So the distance between R and
T, this is the interesting

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.450
thing, because R and
T is x, right?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.420
So they're saying the distance
between T and U is equal to

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.760
1.5 times x.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.450
And what's this between
T and U?

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:09.410
The distance between T
and U is 69, right?

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.210
You don't even have
to solve it.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.790
You just know that you can
usually solve for x if you

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.260
know statement number two.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.270
So statement number two
alone helps you

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.000
figure out what x is.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.120
Statement number one
is fairly useless.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.020
So the answer is B.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.905
Statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:28.040
Let me draw a line here.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.022
I don't want to--

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:34.790
OK, problem number 45.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.180
What is the value of the
two-digit integer x?

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.310
So 2-dig integer x equals,
who knows?

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.560
All right.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.730
Statement number one: The sum
of the two digits is 3.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.600
So let's that x is equal to the
number AB where this is

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.820
the tens digits and this
is the ones digit.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.540
So statement number one says the
sum of the two digits is

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.400
3, so A plus B is equal to 3.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.430
Well, that doesn't help us.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.170
There's a lot of-- well, you
know that these are going to

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.990
be positive numbers, but we
don't know whether they're two

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.860
different numbers.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.360
Two: x is divisible by 3.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.440
x is divisible at 3.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.960
Well, I don't know if you
learned that trick in school,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.170
but any number that is divisible
by 3, the sum of

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.320
their digits are also
divisible by 3.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.430
So once again, that just means
that A plus B is equal to some

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.110
multiple of 3.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.520
Well, if you keep adding them,
they eventually add up.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.700
So if you had a two
digit number, so

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.330
this is-- let's see.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.770
Let's think.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.650
Just A plus B is equal to 3.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.290
This could be a couple
of different things.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.170
It could be a two-digit
number.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.610
It could be 30.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.100
It could be 1.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.300
It could be 12.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.670
It could be 21.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.850
I think those are all of the
possibilities that we can have

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.760
just off of statement
number one.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.380
And x is divisible by three,
well, all of these are

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.170
divisible by 3, so really, both
statements give you no

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.860
information.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.060
So the answer is E, that both
statements combined still give

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.970
me nothing.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.540
But all of these are
possibilities.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.220
And actually, this one leads
to many, many more

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.200
possibilities that x is
divisible by 3 because then

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.100
you could have things
like-- I don't know.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.230
This would have been a
valid number as well.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.400
This would actually
give a lot more.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.460
This is a little bit
more strict.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.559
But anyway, either way, we can't
figure out what x is.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.090
It could be 30.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:39.669
It could be 12.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.090
It could be 21.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.559
It could be anything.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.429
All right.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.650
Problem 46.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.540
What is the tenth digit in the
decimal representation of a

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.120
certain number?

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.760
So the tenth, that's the
number right behind the

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.170
decimal point.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.490
So the number-- let's just
call it x-- so statement

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.620
number one says x is
less than 1/3.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.790
And two says that x is
greater than 1/4.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.080
So this is enough to figure out
what the tenth digit is.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.950
So what's the number that's
less than 1/3?

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.060
Let me to think of
a couple of them.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.440
Well, 1/3 is like 0.333
repeating, so if I just write

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:26.870
0.32 that satisfies one and
it satisfies 2, right?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.800
0.32 is greater than 1/4.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.790
But what's another?

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.920
And then in this case, a tenth
digit would be a 3, but let me

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.720
try to find another one that
would satisfy these both.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.660
Well, let's see, greater than
1/4, what about 0.26?

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.920
0.26 is definitely greater than
1/4 and is definitely

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.050
less than 1/3, but both of these
have different tens.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.970
One has a 2, one
has a 3 there.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.150
So even both statements combined
still do not allow me

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.030
to solve the problem.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.230
There's not enough information
given.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.410
So once again, E, together I'm
still not getting enough

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.620
information.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.840
Oh, I'm almost at 10 minutes.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.280
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
