went through together so I think
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.889

do you think of when you think of
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.899

you know the office definitions are that

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
you know the office definitions are that
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.290
you know the office definitions are that
you find something that was unexpected

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300
you find something that was unexpected
 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.370
you find something that was unexpected
is useful but I would say it's the aha

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380
is useful but I would say it's the aha
 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.630
is useful but I would say it's the aha
moment that you get while you're having

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
moment that you get while you're having
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.160
moment that you get while you're having
it so it's not what you think

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170
 
 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 
vibrant creativity so of course I agree

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
vibrant creativity so of course I agree
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.440
vibrant creativity so of course I agree
with these people but I think going back

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
with these people but I think going back
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.420
with these people but I think going back
to science where I like to be then you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
to science where I like to be then you
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.570
to science where I like to be then you
become creative if you have the ability

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580
become creative if you have the ability
 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.420
become creative if you have the ability
to listen to other people that have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
to listen to other people that have
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.940
to listen to other people that have
different views from yourself but throw

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
different views from yourself but throw
 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.000
different views from yourself but throw
don't throw the baby out with water so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
don't throw the baby out with water so
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.310
don't throw the baby out with water so
you have to keep something for yourself

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320
you have to keep something for yourself
 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.310
you have to keep something for yourself
and then select what is good and what is

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320
and then select what is good and what is
 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.160
and then select what is good and what is
not so good from what other people try

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
not so good from what other people try
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.550
not so good from what other people try
to tell you and then you should be able

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560
to tell you and then you should be able
 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.110
to tell you and then you should be able
to see the pattern that is coming in

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
to see the pattern that is coming in
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.100
to see the pattern that is coming in
front of your eyes but you can talk

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110
front of your eyes but you can talk
 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.090
front of your eyes but you can talk
about the same thing in music we come

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100
about the same thing in music we come
 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.060
about the same thing in music we come
from Toronto which is the town for jazz

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070
from Toronto which is the town for jazz
 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.699
from Toronto which is the town for jazz
and jazz is to put different pieces of

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709
and jazz is to put different pieces of
 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.040
and jazz is to put different pieces of
music together that wasn't combined

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050
music together that wasn't combined
 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.130
music together that wasn't combined
before but you can't do that if you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
before but you can't do that if you
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.360
before but you can't do that if you
haven't played beautiful music so you

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370
haven't played beautiful music so you
 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.650
haven't played beautiful music so you
need something there and then as you say

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660
need something there and then as you say
 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.280
need something there and then as you say
combine it in new ways I think we should

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290
combine it in new ways I think we should
 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.630
combine it in new ways I think we should
get everyone's comments on this so it's

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640
get everyone's comments on this so it's
 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.720
get everyone's comments on this so it's
not somewhat similar I think it's about

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
not somewhat similar I think it's about
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.780
not somewhat similar I think it's about
putting together pieces of information

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790
putting together pieces of information
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.509
putting together pieces of information
that your brain has collected over long

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519
that your brain has collected over long
 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.460
that your brain has collected over long
times which haven't been seen together

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
times which haven't been seen together
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.600
times which haven't been seen together
before and using that to solve some

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610
before and using that to solve some
 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.040
before and using that to solve some
either solve the problem or just create

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050
either solve the problem or just create
 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.740
either solve the problem or just create
an insight so I think it's somewhat like

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
an insight so I think it's somewhat like
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.330
an insight so I think it's somewhat like
dreaming what this happens to I mean

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340
dreaming what this happens to I mean
 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.430
dreaming what this happens to I mean
random pieces of information occur

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
random pieces of information occur
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.710
random pieces of information occur
together sometimes that even leads to a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720
together sometimes that even leads to a
 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.030
together sometimes that even leads to a
new insight yeah

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040
new insight yeah
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.009
new insight yeah
tackle is benzene ringing yeah come it's

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019
tackle is benzene ringing yeah come it's
 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.620
tackle is benzene ringing yeah come it's
so naturally when I was thinking about

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630
so naturally when I was thinking about
 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.449
so naturally when I was thinking about
teaching and learning studying this not

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459
teaching and learning studying this not
 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.650
teaching and learning studying this not
quite a bit early I'm thinking about it

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660
quite a bit early I'm thinking about it
 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.150
quite a bit early I'm thinking about it
in it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160
in it
 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.210
in it
and I think it's it's with it it always

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220
and I think it's it's with it it always
 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.190
and I think it's it's with it it always
really has to be within the context of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200
really has to be within the context of
 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.730
really has to be within the context of
kind of an existing issue or question in

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740
kind of an existing issue or question in
 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.520
kind of an existing issue or question in
it so it's very much in scientific

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530
it so it's very much in scientific
 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.100
it so it's very much in scientific
creativity is very much residing in a

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110
creativity is very much residing in a
 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.690
creativity is very much residing in a
discipline and kind of all the things

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700
discipline and kind of all the things
 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.060
discipline and kind of all the things
you know about it but it's then coming

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070
you know about it but it's then coming
 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.670
you know about it but it's then coming
as other people said sort of recognizing

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680
as other people said sort of recognizing
 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.390
as other people said sort of recognizing
a different pattern or some new

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400
a different pattern or some new
 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.320
a different pattern or some new
information from somewhere else that's

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330
information from somewhere else that's
 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.620
information from somewhere else that's
relevant really just and what the real

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630

test is it's things that turn out to be

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
test is it's things that turn out to be
 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.200
test is it's things that turn out to be
useful but other people haven't seen yet

little plug that what we came to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280
little plug that what we came to
 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.030
little plug that what we came to
recognize was the the educational system

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040
recognize was the the educational system
 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.390
recognize was the the educational system
really teaches anti creativity because

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400
really teaches anti creativity because
 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.850
really teaches anti creativity because
it's really about you know teachers are

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860
it's really about you know teachers are
 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.670
it's really about you know teachers are
giving students problems to solve and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680
giving students problems to solve and
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.500
giving students problems to solve and
the goal is to have an answer that looks

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510
the goal is to have an answer that looks
 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.780
the goal is to have an answer that looks
like what the teacher was looking for

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790
like what the teacher was looking for
 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.470
like what the teacher was looking for
and that's exactly not being creative

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480
and that's exactly not being creative
 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.500
and that's exactly not being creative
and so when we tied the experiments of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510
and so when we tied the experiments of
 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.600
and so when we tied the experiments of
giving problems that didn't have answers

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610
giving problems that didn't have answers
 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.980
giving problems that didn't have answers
the teachers were looking for the

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990
the teachers were looking for the

responders we gathered of positive about

responders we gathered of positive about
 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.190
responders we gathered of positive about
the idea that we will be more creative

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200
the idea that we will be more creative
 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.500
the idea that we will be more creative
in 30 years that humans will be there

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510
in 30 years that humans will be there
 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.940
in 30 years that humans will be there
either think it's likely all extremely

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950
either think it's likely all extremely
 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.780
either think it's likely all extremely
likely do you think that's the case

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790
likely do you think that's the case
 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.850
likely do you think that's the case
adversity I think will be creative in a

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860
adversity I think will be creative in a
 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.560
adversity I think will be creative in a
different way you didn't have a box for

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570
different way you didn't have a box for
 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.710
different way you didn't have a box for
that apparently so I think it's not more

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720
that apparently so I think it's not more
 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.380
that apparently so I think it's not more
or less but we will interact much more

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390
or less but we will interact much more
 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.510
or less but we will interact much more
with computers and use in the

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520
with computers and use in the
 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.700
with computers and use in the
information that can pop up within

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
information that can pop up within
 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.190
information that can pop up within
milliseconds of course that will make us

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200
milliseconds of course that will make us
 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.620
milliseconds of course that will make us
think and act in a different way but I

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630
think and act in a different way but I
 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.230
think and act in a different way but I
think it's not a more-or-less question

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240
 
 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.200
 
that's how nature works too because you

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210
that's how nature works too because you
 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.050
that's how nature works too because you
know not creativity that has a positive

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060
know not creativity that has a positive
 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.260
know not creativity that has a positive
value ER for us but but nature is filled

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270
value ER for us but but nature is filled
 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.050
value ER for us but but nature is filled
with mutations and that is how we get

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060
with mutations and that is how we get
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.440
with mutations and that is how we get
variation and we get new species we get

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450
variation and we get new species we get
 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.700
variation and we get new species we get
new behavior so we need this

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710
new behavior so we need this
 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.670
new behavior so we need this
and of course for us to be creative then

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680
and of course for us to be creative then
 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.980
and of course for us to be creative then
it's more positive that we think that we

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990
it's more positive that we think that we
 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.140
it's more positive that we think that we
see things in a better way and we're

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150
see things in a better way and we're
 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.689
see things in a better way and we're
smarter

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699
smarter
 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.360
 
well one of the trends in the life

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370
well one of the trends in the life
 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.590
well one of the trends in the life
sciences and I think probably in all

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600
sciences and I think probably in all
 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.800
sciences and I think probably in all
science is the the need to collaborate

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810
science is the the need to collaborate
 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.580
science is the the need to collaborate
across lines people who bring different

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590
across lines people who bring different
 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.650
across lines people who bring different
technologies to bear on a problem and

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660
technologies to bear on a problem and
 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.420
technologies to bear on a problem and
that that will reinforce the creative

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430
that that will reinforce the creative
 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.550
that that will reinforce the creative
experience because you will have to deal

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560
experience because you will have to deal
 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.320
experience because you will have to deal
with other people of a very different

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330
with other people of a very different
 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.110
with other people of a very different
perspective and if it's a if it's a an

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120
perspective and if it's a if it's a an
 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.600
perspective and if it's a if it's a an
effective team effort then I think

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610
effective team effort then I think
 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.860
effective team effort then I think
they'll be there there will be some

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
they'll be there there will be some
 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.629
they'll be there there will be some
creative tension that arises from that

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639
creative tension that arises from that
 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.920
creative tension that arises from that
collaboration yes it goes down to the

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930
collaboration yes it goes down to the
 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.400
collaboration yes it goes down to the
definition that you've been getting

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410
definition that you've been getting
 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.070
definition that you've been getting
before that creativity involves

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
before that creativity involves
 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.689
before that creativity involves
interaction of several things the world

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699
interaction of several things the world
 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:11.950
interaction of several things the world
is becoming a much more interactive

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960
is becoming a much more interactive
 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.550
is becoming a much more interactive
place and people who were unimpaired can

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560
place and people who were unimpaired can
 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.320
place and people who were unimpaired can
now go online and often do some really

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330
now go online and often do some really
 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.820
now go online and often do some really
creative things so I think that the

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830
creative things so I think that the
 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.200
creative things so I think that the
creativity divided by the population is

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210
creativity divided by the population is
 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.279
creativity divided by the population is
going to increase enormously do you find

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289
going to increase enormously do you find
 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:29.890
going to increase enormously do you find
that in your own life technology makes

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900
that in your own life technology makes
 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.010
that in your own life technology makes
you more creative because as you get

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020
you more creative because as you get
 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.659
you more creative because as you get
older you know you're losing neurons all

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669
older you know you're losing neurons all
 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.339
older you know you're losing neurons all
the time and it's not clear that maybe

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:36.349
the time and it's not clear that maybe
 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:38.020
the time and it's not clear that maybe
it makes you stay more or less the same

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.030
it makes you stay more or less the same
 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.570
it makes you stay more or less the same
I guess there's one interesting thing

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580
I guess there's one interesting thing
 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.330
I guess there's one interesting thing
and that is as you get older but

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340
and that is as you get older but
 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.950
and that is as you get older but
normally in life it's much easier to do

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960
normally in life it's much easier to do
 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.810
normally in life it's much easier to do
something you know how to do they seduce

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820
something you know how to do they seduce
 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.810
something you know how to do they seduce
something new when you have no memory

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:48.820
something new when you have no memory
 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.480
something new when you have no memory
there's no nothing at you everything's

there's no nothing at you everything's
 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.249
there's no nothing at you everything's
about the same you know just heard you

00:07:57.249 --> 00:07:57.259
about the same you know just heard you
 

00:07:57.259 --> 00:07:59.920
about the same you know just heard you
say some things about people people who

00:07:59.920 --> 00:07:59.930
say some things about people people who
 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.510
say some things about people people who
are older scientists who say they're

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520
are older scientists who say they're
 

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.649
are older scientists who say they're
doing the best work of their career

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:02.659
doing the best work of their career
 

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:04.749
doing the best work of their career
before you skating about well I'm a

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759
before you skating about well I'm a
 

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.279
before you skating about well I'm a
little worried about that I've told my

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:06.289
little worried about that I've told my
 

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:08.379
little worried about that I've told my
friends that if I ever at this point for

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:08.389
friends that if I ever at this point for
 

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:09.640
friends that if I ever at this point for
the rest of my life say that I'm doing

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.650
the rest of my life say that I'm doing
 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.040
the rest of my life say that I'm doing
the best work of my life and then it is

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.050
the best work of my life and then it is
 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.499
the best work of my life and then it is
a sure sign of senility and delusion so

00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:16.509
a sure sign of senility and delusion so
 

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.330
a sure sign of senility and delusion so
I feel that I did my best work when I

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:19.340
I feel that I did my best work when I
 

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.240
I feel that I did my best work when I
was 30 years old because I had no

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.250
was 30 years old because I had no
 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.129
was 30 years old because I had no
preconceived notions about the field

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:24.139
preconceived notions about the field
 

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.950
preconceived notions about the field
I had no prejudices built up over

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960
I had no prejudices built up over
 

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.439
I had no prejudices built up over
and I could do something that other

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:29.449
and I could do something that other
 

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:31.120
and I could do something that other
people thought was crazy and feel good

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.130
people thought was crazy and feel good
 

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:41.409
people thought was crazy and feel good
about it

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:41.419
 
 

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.440
 
what about being creative I still think

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.450
what about being creative I still think
 

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:52.390
what about being creative I still think
I'm creative I think advantage of

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:52.400
I'm creative I think advantage of
 

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.130
I'm creative I think advantage of
getting older is that you accumulate

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:54.140
getting older is that you accumulate
 

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.140
getting older is that you accumulate
more and more it is a random information

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.150
more and more it is a random information
 

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.920
more and more it is a random information
you get more and more exposed to

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:58.930
you get more and more exposed to
 

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.510
you get more and more exposed to
knowledge outside your own field

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:01.520
knowledge outside your own field
 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.280
knowledge outside your own field
something that is quite often not the

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.290
something that is quite often not the
 

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.410
something that is quite often not the
case for young people when they start in

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:05.420
case for young people when they start in
 

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.220
case for young people when they start in
a difficult field so and so it's it in a

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:09.230
a difficult field so and so it's it in a
 

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.550
a difficult field so and so it's it in a
different way so I don't think I'm done

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560
different way so I don't think I'm done
 

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:20.140
different way so I don't think I'm done
yet I just wanted to reflect also on

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.150
yet I just wanted to reflect also on
 

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.860
yet I just wanted to reflect also on
what is stopping creativity and that is

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:23.870
what is stopping creativity and that is
 

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.579
what is stopping creativity and that is
fear and you can get fear of course if

00:09:27.579 --> 00:09:27.589
fear and you can get fear of course if
 

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:29.860
fear and you can get fear of course if
people tell you that you're stupid you

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:29.870
people tell you that you're stupid you
 

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.920
people tell you that you're stupid you
shouldn't think about these topics or

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:32.930
shouldn't think about these topics or
 

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.600
shouldn't think about these topics or
you shouldn't think along these lives

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:34.610
you shouldn't think along these lives
 

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.840
you shouldn't think along these lives
but also fear that you don't have the

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:37.850
but also fear that you don't have the
 

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.820
but also fear that you don't have the
methods or the techniques to address

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:39.830
methods or the techniques to address
 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.760
methods or the techniques to address
your question and that has happened now

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:42.770
your question and that has happened now
 

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.190
your question and that has happened now
in your science that we have got all

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200
in your science that we have got all
 

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.160
in your science that we have got all
these wonderful wonderful techniques so

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.170
these wonderful wonderful techniques so
 

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.530
these wonderful wonderful techniques so
that we are much tougher than when we

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:50.540
that we are much tougher than when we
 

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.220
that we are much tougher than when we
were young to address questions that we

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.230
were young to address questions that we
 

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.030
were young to address questions that we
couldn't try even to think of addressing

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040
couldn't try even to think of addressing
 

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.720
couldn't try even to think of addressing
earlier for example with optogenetics or

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:01.730
earlier for example with optogenetics or
 

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.390
earlier for example with optogenetics or
all these new techniques that we can use

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:04.400
all these new techniques that we can use
 

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:12.310
all these new techniques that we can use
and then we are so creative I tend to

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320
and then we are so creative I tend to
 

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.130
and then we are so creative I tend to
think I I don't think the biggest

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.140
think I I don't think the biggest
 

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.260
think I I don't think the biggest
barriers fear I think the biggest

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.270
barriers fear I think the biggest
 

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.260
barriers fear I think the biggest
barrier is habit so you just get deeper

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.270
barrier is habit so you just get deeper
 

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.750
barrier is habit so you just get deeper
deeper into that was as you get open so

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760
deeper into that was as you get open so
 

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.490
deeper into that was as you get open so
you're not gonna be as creative I just

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:27.500
you're not gonna be as creative I just
 

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.220
you're not gonna be as creative I just
wanted to follow up on what Brandi said

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.230
wanted to follow up on what Brandi said
 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.600
wanted to follow up on what Brandi said
like I did my best work when I was like

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:31.610
like I did my best work when I was like
 

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.199
like I did my best work when I was like
21 years old I knew nothing and what

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:35.209
21 years old I knew nothing and what
 

00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:37.960
21 years old I knew nothing and what
really worries me today is that people

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:37.970
really worries me today is that people
 

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.580
really worries me today is that people
become independent

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.590
become independent
 

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.070
become independent
I know too much we're really on a 6-year

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.080
I know too much we're really on a 6-year
 

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.770
I know too much we're really on a 6-year
PhD and the six-year postdoc they are

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:44.780
PhD and the six-year postdoc they are
 

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.020
PhD and the six-year postdoc they are
too old and I really believe that

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.030
too old and I really believe that
 

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.850
too old and I really believe that
there's a something really wrong with

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:48.860
there's a something really wrong with
 

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.590
there's a something really wrong with
the system so I think when I talks about

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600
the system so I think when I talks about
 

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.480
the system so I think when I talks about
creativity I think the world is gonna be

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.490
creativity I think the world is gonna be
 

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.610
creativity I think the world is gonna be
more creative I actually think that

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:54.620
more creative I actually think that
 

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.880
more creative I actually think that
science per dollar spent is gonna become

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:57.890
science per dollar spent is gonna become
 

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.920
science per dollar spent is gonna become
less creative I have exactly that worry

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930
less creative I have exactly that worry
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.750
less creative I have exactly that worry
and it's because people are just too

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760
and it's because people are just too
 

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.080
and it's because people are just too
long the whole system has become people

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.090
long the whole system has become people
 

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.430
long the whole system has become people
okay when you're older so for me right

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440
okay when you're older so for me right
 

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.210
okay when you're older so for me right
now 64 is super young right and but you

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:13.220
now 64 is super young right and but you
 

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.920
now 64 is super young right and but you
know people have forgotten that there's

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:14.930
know people have forgotten that there's
 

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.500
know people have forgotten that there's
an absolute youngness 40 is not the new

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:17.510
an absolute youngness 40 is not the new
 

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:23.290
an absolute youngness 40 is not the new
20 20 is we're making a huge mistake we

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:23.300
20 20 is we're making a huge mistake we
 

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.180
20 20 is we're making a huge mistake we
sort of say well it's scientists are

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.190
sort of say well it's scientists are
 

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.470
sort of say well it's scientists are
complicated then you learn all these new

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480
complicated then you learn all these new
 

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.240
complicated then you learn all these new
things and it's basically just a way to

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.250
things and it's basically just a way to
 

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.300
things and it's basically just a way to
have in a really good labor in your lab

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.310
have in a really good labor in your lab
 

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.560
have in a really good labor in your lab
doing things for you and it's a huge

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.570
doing things for you and it's a huge
 

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.840
doing things for you and it's a huge
mistake I think the system is really

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:34.850
mistake I think the system is really
 

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.960
mistake I think the system is really
rotten for this reason I think what well

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:37.970
rotten for this reason I think what well
 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.240
rotten for this reason I think what well
so my generation the baby boomers

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.250
so my generation the baby boomers
 

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.860
so my generation the baby boomers
generation were lucky because when

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:41.870
generation were lucky because when
 

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.210
generation were lucky because when
people old philosophers that have taken

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:43.220
people old philosophers that have taken
 

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.770
people old philosophers that have taken
out of the system by the Great

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:44.780
out of the system by the Great
 

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.940

Depression in the second world war

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:45.950
Depression in the second world war

Depression in the second world war
unfortunately people are young growing

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.080
unfortunately people are young growing
 

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.670
unfortunately people are young growing
up now still fast

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680
up now still fast
 

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.350
up now still fast
so I share all of those concerns on the

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360
so I share all of those concerns on the
 

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.330
so I share all of those concerns on the
other hand Margaret Cho say you can

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.340
other hand Margaret Cho say you can
 

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.760
other hand Margaret Cho say you can
teach people to be much more creative I

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:00.770
teach people to be much more creative I
 

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.410
teach people to be much more creative I
mean you know if you actually said about

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:02.420
mean you know if you actually said about
 

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.590
mean you know if you actually said about
you couldn't actively doing that and

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:04.600
you couldn't actively doing that and
 

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.820
you couldn't actively doing that and
probably at any age although we haven't

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:06.830
probably at any age although we haven't
 

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:12.910
probably at any age although we haven't
tested that in our field we don't have

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920
tested that in our field we don't have
 

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.590
tested that in our field we don't have
this - at least not myself but I work in

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600
this - at least not myself but I work in
 

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.710
this - at least not myself but I work in
a group and I depend on all this

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720
a group and I depend on all this
 

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.370
a group and I depend on all this
beautiful young people in our lab and we

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.380
beautiful young people in our lab and we
 

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.610
beautiful young people in our lab and we
are facilitating creativity in our lab

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:27.620
are facilitating creativity in our lab
 

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:33.310
are facilitating creativity in our lab
by having an environment where you are

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320
by having an environment where you are
 

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.010
by having an environment where you are
allowed to ask questions and you are

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.020
allowed to ask questions and you are
 

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.620
allowed to ask questions and you are
forced to ask questions and then it's a

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:38.630
forced to ask questions and then it's a
 

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.070
forced to ask questions and then it's a
brainstorming which creates creativity

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.080
brainstorming which creates creativity
 

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.180
brainstorming which creates creativity
and I find it so fascinating so when we

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.190
and I find it so fascinating so when we
 

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.960
and I find it so fascinating so when we
have meetings with our people I am so

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:49.970
have meetings with our people I am so
 

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.370
have meetings with our people I am so
happy and passion

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:53.380
happy and passion
 

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.250
happy and passion
makes creativity is there is there

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:57.260
makes creativity is there is there
 

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.020
makes creativity is there is there
almost a kind of conflict though between

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.030
almost a kind of conflict though between
 

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.820
almost a kind of conflict though between
the collaboration that Randy mentioned

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:00.830
the collaboration that Randy mentioned
 

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.650
the collaboration that Randy mentioned
for instance that you need Club the

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:02.660
for instance that you need Club the
 

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.480
for instance that you need Club the

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:29.630
for for progress so you are forced I
 

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.460
for for progress so you are forced I
think not in a bad way but forced to

apply and I think that from that can
 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.060
apply and I think that from that can

know who wants to answer that would you
 

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.620
know who wants to answer that would you
like to yeah I would say that creativity

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:53.630
like to yeah I would say that creativity
 

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.660
like to yeah I would say that creativity
is important a lot of luck and you know

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:58.670
is important a lot of luck and you know
 

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.220
is important a lot of luck and you know
one ends up being where one is because

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.230
one ends up being where one is because

work is also very important I think

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:05.750
work is also very important I think

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600
scientists have a lot of stamina and you
 

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.210
scientists have a lot of stamina and you
know that kind of energy to just keep on

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.220
know that kind of energy to just keep on
 

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.130
know that kind of energy to just keep on
going is really important but I think

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:15.140
going is really important but I think
 

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.960
going is really important but I think
you know creativity in some ways is the

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:16.970
you know creativity in some ways is the
 

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.150
you know creativity in some ways is the
drug that drives us I mean when you have

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160

you with the dog in an aeroplane I guess

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:51.410
you with the dog in an aeroplane I guess
 

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.250

it doesn't work for me having a shower

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:53.260
it doesn't work for me having a shower
 

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.480
it doesn't work for me having a shower
something that kind of you know so I

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.490
something that kind of you know so I
 

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.980
something that kind of you know so I
think the worst inventions gonna be a

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:56.990
think the worst inventions gonna be a
 

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.530
think the worst inventions gonna be a
waterproof ice phone

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:02.540
 
 

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.140
 
so I'll just put in a counter to that

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.150
so I'll just put in a counter to that
 

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.210
so I'll just put in a counter to that
Amin for me that the things that I've

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220
Amin for me that the things that I've
 

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.179
Amin for me that the things that I've
you know got most successful was man

00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:11.189
you know got most successful was man
 

00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:13.730

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740
picks on the area that seemed like it
 

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.370

was gonna be in potentially important

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380
was gonna be in potentially important
 

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.799
was gonna be in potentially important
and I spent years plugging away at it

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:18.809
and I spent years plugging away at it
 

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:22.039
and I spent years plugging away at it
and and at some point there was some big

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:22.049
and and at some point there was some big
 

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:25.010
and and at some point there was some big
challenge and I just you know thought oh

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020
challenge and I just you know thought oh
 

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.840
challenge and I just you know thought oh
well this is the way to tackle it I

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:26.850
well this is the way to tackle it I
 

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:27.289
well this is the way to tackle it I
don't

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299
don't
 

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:29.750
don't
I wonder why nobody else is working on

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760
I wonder why nobody else is working on
 

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.659
I wonder why nobody else is working on
it this way so I never got these great

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:32.669
it this way so I never got these great
 

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:34.580
it this way so I never got these great
inspirations for me it was always I

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:34.590
inspirations for me it was always I
 

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.919
inspirations for me it was always I
wonder why nobody else thought to do it

00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:36.929
wonder why nobody else thought to do it
 

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:40.039
wonder why nobody else thought to do it
this way you know but there was a whole

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:40.049
this way you know but there was a whole
 

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:44.779
this way you know but there was a whole
lot of work to send that up yeah wish I

00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:44.789
lot of work to send that up yeah wish I
 

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:46.909
lot of work to send that up yeah wish I
got these things I could get excited

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919
got these things I could get excited
 

00:17:46.919 --> 00:17:52.190
got these things I could get excited
than the shower rebellion so we've just

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200
than the shower rebellion so we've just
 

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.610
than the shower rebellion so we've just
got a minute left ins I guess you have

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620
got a minute left ins I guess you have
 

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.840

forgive me for asking this question but

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:56.850
forgive me for asking this question but
 

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.669
forgive me for asking this question but
it's sort of I think probably have to

00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679
it's sort of I think probably have to
 

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:00.380
it's sort of I think probably have to
ask it at this meeting can you foresee a

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:00.390
ask it at this meeting can you foresee a
 

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.529
ask it at this meeting can you foresee a
day when you're sitting here and others

00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539
day when you're sitting here and others
 

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:05.360
day when you're sitting here and others
are sitting here in your place and one

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:05.370
are sitting here in your place and one
 

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.520

of you is a machine will there be a

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.530
of you is a machine will there be a
 

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.710
of you is a machine will there be a
machine that can be awarded a Nobel

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720
machine that can be awarded a Nobel
 

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.510
machine that can be awarded a Nobel
Prize don't go for it so so I I would

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520
Prize don't go for it so so I I would
 

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.250
Prize don't go for it so so I I would
say nope because I go back to the

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260
say nope because I go back to the
 

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.919
say nope because I go back to the
original I claim I made as creativity of

00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:18.929
original I claim I made as creativity of
 

00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:22.010
original I claim I made as creativity of
looking at things in some basically

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020
looking at things in some basically
 

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.200
looking at things in some basically
different way than people have before

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.210
different way than people have before
 

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.539
different way than people have before
machines are taught how to look at

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:26.549
machines are taught how to look at
 

00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:30.190
machines are taught how to look at
things it's it's built into them and so

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200
things it's it's built into them and so
 

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.440
things it's it's built into them and so
there's sort of it's gonna be a vastly

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.450
there's sort of it's gonna be a vastly
 

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.820
there's sort of it's gonna be a vastly
different machine than anything we're

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:34.830
different machine than anything we're
 

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.889
different machine than anything we're
thinking of now where we build in rules

00:18:36.889 --> 00:18:36.899
thinking of now where we build in rules
 

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:40.010
thinking of now where we build in rules
cuz you follow those rules it's not

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020
cuz you follow those rules it's not
 

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.010
cuz you follow those rules it's not
gonna be creative like yeah I have no

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020
gonna be creative like yeah I have no
 

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.180
gonna be creative like yeah I have no
problem thinking about that I think it

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.190
problem thinking about that I think it
 

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.889
problem thinking about that I think it
would also be you know great for

00:18:45.889 --> 00:18:45.899
would also be you know great for
 

00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:56.120
would also be you know great for
publicity be real machine not anyone

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:56.130
publicity be real machine not anyone
 

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.799
publicity be real machine not anyone
else want to try that one oh well I

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:57.809
else want to try that one oh well I
 

00:18:57.809 --> 00:19:00.230
else want to try that one oh well I
don't never say never but I don't think

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240
don't never say never but I don't think
 

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.389
don't never say never but I don't think
in my lifetime that I'll see a machine

00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:02.399
in my lifetime that I'll see a machine
 

00:19:02.399 --> 00:19:05.270
in my lifetime that I'll see a machine
up here answering that question just I

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280
up here answering that question just I
 

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.820
up here answering that question just I
watched you know Watson play jeopardy

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:07.830
watched you know Watson play jeopardy
 

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.539
watched you know Watson play jeopardy
and marveled at the ability that

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:11.549
and marveled at the ability that
 

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:12.280

all rare information but putting

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:15.820
all rare information but putting
 

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.010
all rare information but putting
unexpected things together in the way

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020
unexpected things together in the way
 

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.160
unexpected things together in the way
that generates the creative idea I think

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.170
that generates the creative idea I think
 

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.140
that generates the creative idea I think
is that for the time being not not

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.150
is that for the time being not not

something that I'm going to see in a

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:24.350
something that I'm going to see in a
 

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.040
something that I'm going to see in a
machine thank you very much

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.050
machine thank you very much
 

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.380
machine thank you very much
anyone I think maybe when the unexpected

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.390
anyone I think maybe when the unexpected
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.360
anyone I think maybe when the unexpected
happens then we will notice the

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:31.370
happens then we will notice the
 

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.180
happens then we will notice the
difference I think a machine can be

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.190
difference I think a machine can be
 

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.550
difference I think a machine can be
taught to do the most incredible things

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:36.560
taught to do the most incredible things
 

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.130
taught to do the most incredible things
including being creative in a way if you

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.140
including being creative in a way if you
 

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.470
including being creative in a way if you
prescribe the rules for creativity which

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480
prescribe the rules for creativity which
 

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.600
prescribe the rules for creativity which
we have talked about today so we can

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:43.610
we have talked about today so we can
 

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.790
we have talked about today so we can
make a machine actually be creative

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:45.800
make a machine actually be creative
 

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.310
make a machine actually be creative
within certain limits but then something

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320
within certain limits but then something
 

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.500
within certain limits but then something
happens that is not in the rules and

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.510
happens that is not in the rules and
 

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.930
happens that is not in the rules and
then we'll see the difference right I

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:55.940
then we'll see the difference right I
 

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.840
then we'll see the difference right I
just want to say what is so fantastic by

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:58.850
just want to say what is so fantastic by
 

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.880
just want to say what is so fantastic by
being a scientist it's all the passion

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:00.890
being a scientist it's all the passion
 

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.790
being a scientist it's all the passion
by seeing things that we haven't seen

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:03.800
by seeing things that we haven't seen
 

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.330
by seeing things that we haven't seen
before

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:04.340
before
 

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.990
before
and at the Machine count that's a nice

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000
and at the Machine count that's a nice
 

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.730
and at the Machine count that's a nice
place to endless have a round of

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:09.740
place to endless have a round of
 

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:20.970
place to endless have a round of
applause for human passion and creative

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:20.980
 
 

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.200
 
so thank you all and that unfortunately
