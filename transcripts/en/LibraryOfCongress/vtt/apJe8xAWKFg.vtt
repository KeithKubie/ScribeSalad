&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Hello.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.180
I'm Gail Shirazi of the
Israel-Judaica Section here

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.140
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.680
Welcome to today's program.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.270
"Babel Through the Latin
American Jewish Eyes," sponsored

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.670
by the Hebrew Language
[inaudible] and cosponsored

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.090 position:56%
by the Hispanic Division here at the
Library of Congress in cooperation

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.400
with the Argentine Embassy.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.810
If you haven't already
been to the LC website,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.910
it's a treasure trove
of information.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.500
Both the Hebraic section

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.230
and the Hispanic division have
wonderful websites describing their

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.340
collections and activities.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.230 position:56%
You can check it out at www.loc.gov.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.900
Two announcements before we begin.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.220
Please turn off your cell
phones and I have to announce

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520
that we're being webcast.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.550
So during the Q&amp;A, it will be,
the audience will be scanned.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.560
So if you don't want
to be in the webcast,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.890
you might want to maybe step out.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.480
Okay, I would like to thank Maritza
Gueler and the Argentine Embassy

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.290
and to welcome Maritza and Mr.
Louis Levitt, the cultural attache

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.300
at the Embassy of Argentina

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.300
who is sitting right here,
Mr. Levitt and Maritza.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.790
And I want to thank the Hispanic
Division, [inaudible] office,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.820
Kalina Tabarovsky [phonetic] of
the IJ section and special thanks

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.370
to our trio of presenters.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.610
It gives me great personal
and professional pleasure

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.100
to introduce our panel today.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.770
Mirta Kupferminc, Mirta is an
internationally [applause] known

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.110
multidisciplinary artist
who thinks the frontiers

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.960
in art are an innovation
to be transgressed.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.340
Interesting.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660
Graciela Tova Shvartzman, a
psychoanalyst and professor

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.820 position:56%
of Jewish history, and my dear
friend, Dr. Saul Sosnowski, scholar,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.150
university professor and
author, specializing in Spanish,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.760
Latin American and Judaic studies.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730
All three from Argentina.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.840
They will speak about text
and art brought together

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.730
in extraordinary ways,
crossing languages, art,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.440
Judaism, and psychoanalysis.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.780
There'll be a Q&amp;A following
the presentation.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.580
Thank you.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.340
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Good afternoon.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.130
And it's always wonderful
to be with Gail

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.130
because she does the work for you.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.680
I was supposed to introduce
Mirta and Tova.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.680
She did and very briefly but
very accurately because both

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.430
of them are each of them in
their own way transgressors.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.360
They're always looking for
the hidden side of things,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.870
one through art, the other
one through psychoanalysis.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.720 position:56%
And somehow what we are going to be
hearing today is precisely that kind

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.950
of intersection between three
components, between Judaism,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.590
between art, and psychoanalysis,
one through a practicing artist,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.100
the other one through a practicing
artist who is also a psychoanalyst.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.810
So we're going to be hearing and
seeing very, very different things.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.120
And I don't want to take time
out from their presentations.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.960
So we will start with Mirta and
after that we will go with Tova

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.400 position:56%
and after that it will be up to you.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.420
I may interrupt every so often,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.560
which is something I
sometimes do or may not.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.320
Let's see how it goes.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.230
Mirta.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.210
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Thank you.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.610
Thank you.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.910
Good morning.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.520
Thanks to all of you.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.870 position:56%
Thank you to the Hebrew Language
table and the Hispanic division here

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.570
at Library of Congress
in cooperation

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.650
with Argentinean Embassy.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.500
Thank you for inviting us to
be able to share this talk,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.230
our thoughts, our work with you.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.520
This theme about and
questions about babel is based

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.890
on my personal experience of being
born as daughter of immigrants.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.900
My parents, my father from
Poland, my mother from Hungary,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.610
both Auschwitz survivors,
arrived in Argentina.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.360
And the language that I
heard at home was different

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.090
from the external language
spoken at school, with friends,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.650
and this provoked in me a kind
of otherness in my daily life.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:37.130
So babel [inaudible] in languages
is a kind of natural temple for me

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.300
because babel is where
languages and in Genesis

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.610
where languages were born
differences in languages were born

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.590
for people not to be
able to understand.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.880
And that is why I have
a very big body of work.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.040
I realized organizing this
talk that I am working

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.030
with babel already
for 25 years perhaps.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.690
So I would like to
continue my speaking,

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.040
sharing some images and
about my art itself.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.310
So thank you.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.730
This is a very, very
big etching, printing.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.330
I will mix a little
bit with techniques.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.390
So this is a very, very huge one.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:34.080
I will tell in meters, sorry,
so you will translate to inches.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.120
This is almost two meters high.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.560
It's very, very big.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.740 position:56%
So you know to make this an
etching is a very hard work composed

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.220
by many plates, metal plates.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.220
And all people are different kind
of people because we are talking

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:57.400
of differences are walking
around this kind of fire babel.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:06.260
And the text and language
and textures are something

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.420 position:56%
that always worries me and this work
that is called [inaudible] belongs

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:21.360
to a new body of work that is
called the Body of the Word

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.880
that everything is handmade.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.750
I work on the rubber,
cutting the rubber

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.300
and these are digital
photographs that I make

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.670
with a real matter
that I made on hand.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:42.060
So everything that
goes out from the mouth

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:49.510
and in this case also
this image of a woman

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:57.220
that everything what she
says turns to reality.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.540
You know, I was always worried
to join my multiple identities

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.160
as a woman, as an Argentinean,
as a Jew

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.740
and that is why I developed
really many works,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.150
I think that mainly trying to
join this multiple these aspects.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.050
I also made with Saul Sosnowski.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.740
Perhaps some of you know about this
work, about Borges and Kabbalah

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.620
that also joins this
Argentinean identity together

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.010
with this Jewish knowledge.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.810
And in this case also
I work a lot with Tova.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:45.440
We are launching a project,
already launched three years ago

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.260 position:56%
but we are working in something that
is called LABA-BA, LABA Buenos Aires

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.610
that is a group of artists.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.770
We make an open call.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.660
We choose ten artists
of multiple disciplines

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.100
to study together about
a selected theme.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.130
This time, this year
it was the other

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:16.460
and the theme we study is the same
theme that LABA New York study.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:24.640
So now we are coming from the first
trip that Argentinean fellows made

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:32.100
to New York to present the work
together with the New York fellows.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.650
So it was a very big experience.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.140
And really what we are trying
to do is to expand something

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.660
that we think is very,
very valuable to offer this

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.330
to our Argentinean audience, to our
country because we are convinced --

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.860
I will speak about myself.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:59.580
Sorry. I am convinced that
this is something very rich --

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.780
Jewish culture is something
very rich that we have to offer

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.150
to all Argentinean community that
perhaps you know that is shaped

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.540
by many, many, many
different cultures.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:21.960
So this is my main goal
when I choose these works.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.000
"Misunderstanding" is
the title of this work.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.870
It's the same rubber cut with text
with words and you know very well

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.470
that usually what we say
or sometimes what we say

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:46.290
or what we think we said is not
exactly what the other person heard

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.700
or understood.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:54.480
Another babel is called
this one, this work,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.570
everything is done
by real text letters.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:08.120
This one is called "The
Origin of Xenophobia"

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.260
because somehow these differences

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.800
between languages are a
demonstration or a beginning

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.420
to all xenophobia or
difference that we perceive.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:28.870
It's a big challenge, yes,
to immigrate in a country

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.980
but also the ones that are
already there to receive,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.810
to be able to receive people
that are coming from other place.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:45.460
So these migrations that nowadays
are so active in the world,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:52.460
this puts all of us in a very
special intimate condition also.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.430
Other version of the same thoughts.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.820
And another one.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.830
You see the Hebrew
letters on the back.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:10.410
These are overloaded
over a post layers

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.960
of very, very big hand-cut foam.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.390
This is really very white,
not only in the photo.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.690
So it's the texture.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:29.110
And another one, etching,
this is metal etching.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.190
And this is the one that
Gail chose for the flier.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:41.730 position:56%
You see there the good and the bad
because of course every, these many,

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.550
many, many languages
have their own aspects,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:53.330 position:56%
good aspects also not only bad, of
course, the differences are not bad.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:59.940
I think that the big challenge
is to enjoy the differences.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.010
So here, you have about the image.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.630
If I talk about the image, the good
and the bad and the way of working,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:13.190
this is a very spontaneous
gesture of the work,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.400
then everything in the middle.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.130
And now very briefly
I want to invite you

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.590
as a very first presentation to
show what I will present in October

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.610
in Jerusalem for the
Jerusalem Biennale.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.690
The title of the work is
"Traduttore-Traditore"

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:43.290 position:56%
because every translation is somehow
a betrayal, betrayal, thank you.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.360
Sorry for my English.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.550
That's why I make images for you to
understand a little bit at least.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.710
But as I am speaking about this,

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.610
it's okay about the
difference between languages.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.320
So this work will be settled
in the Jerusalem Biennale.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.570
It's a very big building all
made of hand-cut, you see,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.840
this is all text saying,
telling the tale of babel

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.220
in 70 different languages
with characters

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.970
of 70 different languages.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.630
This is a draft, of course.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.030
This was not built yet.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.750
When you put your head inside that
hole -- This is not the draft.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.330
This was built.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:50.600
When you put your head inside,
if you look down that way,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.720
you can see this feeling of
endless, like an infinite.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:00.280
Of course, it is a game
playing with mirrors.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.950
So this is the draft
of the presentation.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:12.100
From inside, [inaudible] hearing.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.940
You know it was a greeting that
the astronauts left on the moon

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:25.240
with Apollo 11 that it is not in 70
but in 55 languages, they greeted.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.940
They said hello.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:36.020
The 70 languages are chosen because
it is said that the relationship is

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:47.470 position:56%
with the, yes, one of the, yes, but
no, Shem, the son of Noah, his sons,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:52.270
each one was the ancestor
of a nation.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.730
That's why 70 languages are chosen.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.440
But the greetings are only in 55.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.660
But these are real
recording that exists

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.050
that this was left on the moon.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:12.990
So this is an example of how all
the 70 chosen languages will be

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.430
displayed on the surrounding
walls of the tower.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.970
You see here Aramaic.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.210
These are only some examples.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:39.560 position:56%
So if you come now to Jerusalem
first October, see you in Jerusalem.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.860
Thank you so much.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.580
Thank you.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.580
[ Applause ]

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Thank you, Mirta.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:06.360
If it's okay with you, we'll
wait for comments, questions,

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.190
et cetera until we hear from
Tova who will be talking

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.790
about the intersection of
Judaism, art, and psychoanalysis.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.360
And then we will have more time
to perhaps engage both of them

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:24.370
in a dialogue or a trialogue
depending how you feel we can

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.590
proceed with the questions
and the comments.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.890
Tova, yours.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.430
&gt;&gt; Tova Shvartzman: Okay.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.670
Sorry about my accent,
speaking about languages.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.690
I have no images.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.620
I have letters here.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.510
So I will read it.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.670
I want to join Mirta and Saul
in thanking the organizer

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.150
for the opportunity to
meet with you today.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.970
I would like to share with you
some thoughts about intersection

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.570
of Judaism, art, in this
case both visual literature

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.730
and psychoanalysis.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:14.820
Judaism is a culture that places a
particular [inaudible] on the text.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.040 position:56%
Literature also centers on the text.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.290
And psychoanalysis also
focuses on another text,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.570
in this case on the
[inaudible] words.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:33.250
This means that all
three meet at the text.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.710
I view today's as a culture based

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.140
on foundational text
beginning with the "Bible."

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:47.080
Those foundational text like in
other cultures are unique answers

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:56.760
to the major questions that
humanity ask themselves

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.040
and these questions
may be summarized

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.530
in the answers that are the myths.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.190
Myths provide these answers.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.530
Their structure, the
myth's structures,

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.140
like Levi-Strauss discovered,
is always the same.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.230
It doesn't matter which
culture they come from.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.480
Psychoanalysis is a practice.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.450
Within this practice,
it's not a matter

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.550
of interpreting an existing
text nor to seek out its author

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.200
but to discover the
structure of a narrative.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:48.200 position:56%
Lacan stated that the artist's
perception anticipate future events.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.720
Just think of Kafka who for
some other man's solitude

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.020
as well as the [inaudible].

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:02.200
Visual artists and writers
often take the myths to write

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:08.550
in them how these answers
are still affecting our days.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:14.870
I want to share with you one of
these answers, the myths of babel,

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.660
as written by Borges and
through psychoanalysis.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.700
We don't have a patient,
just the text.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.020
As you may know, Buenos Aires is
known for having the highest number

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.340
of psychoanalysts in the world.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.470
I don't know if we
can be proud of it.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.800
Borges didn't like
psychoanalysis, you know.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.220
He used to say that this is sort
of narrative, not a science.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.730
Well I agree with him
and so did Lacan.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.620
It's a sort of narrative.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.460
But this narrative
that affects people

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:00.070
if only they assume
responsibility of their own words.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:08.290
A few years ago I had the great
privilege, thanks to Gail,

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:14.510
where is Gail, hey, to
[inaudible] in this building, no,

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:22.010
in the main building, of
seeing one of the letters

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.410
from the Freud archives here
in the Library of Congress

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.050
where Karl Abraham told Freud,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.030
Talmudic thought cannot
have suddenly left us.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:41.890
What is that Talmudic mode of
thought to which Abraham refers?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.710
It is interpretation.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:49.490
It is the freedom to hear in
each word not only communication

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.670
but fundamentally an
instrument to exercise freedom.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.190
It is the answer to
fundamental reason

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.570
which only consider one language.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.920
Every man is different
and it is that difference

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.440
where the [inaudible]
humanities exist.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.860
We always encounter
constant misunderstanding

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.650
and perhaps we speak
the same language

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:21.150
but interpretation comes
always from misunderstanding.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:28.350 position:56%
[inaudible] means the tower of Babel
relates this theme as do [inaudible]

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:35.560
with a narrative that in turn
present the problem and its cause.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:41.990 position:56%
And almost always the cause is man's
fault, [inaudible] responsibility

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.850 position:56%
for what is not right in this world.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:51.480
However, we will try to read the
myths differently as did Borges

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.910
in his fictional text and
as psychoanalysis does.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:05.740
Genesis means of the Tower of Babel
has an even greater appeal today

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:11.010
in the era of communications
where there are more and more ways

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.210
and means to communicate
and there is more

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.290
and more loneliness
and misunderstanding.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:24.250
Men, humans, were punished by the
God of the gods with the confusion

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.960
of tongues for having
been arrogant and wanting

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.000
to build a tower to reach heaven.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.440
They spoke a universal
language up to that point.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.970
Then, different language appeared.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:50.310
Borges has taken, he used several
times this term for his stories,

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.660
two of them, "The Library
of Babel" and "The Lottery

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.820
of Babel" are inspired by the
biblical [inaudible] to talk

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:03.450
about what writing books,
letters, and human knowledge means.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:08.690
Their stories are amazing
metaphors that state

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:16.410
that the universe is symbolic,
maybe the myth is right.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.920
There was a lost language.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.430 position:56%
That forgotten language was a
perfect fusion of sounds and meaning

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:34.680
that all the people, all
humanity goes through.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.920
This language -- If that
language continued to exist,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.890
it would not have given rise to
interpretation, misunderstanding,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.380
poetry, art, conversation.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.720
We have a common skill: language.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.020
We all talk.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.310
Each of our words has
more than one meaning.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.670
We are all beings that are
different from the bees.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:05.240
The bees, they also communicate
but their [inaudible] has signals

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:14.560 position:56%
that mean only one thing, hardly a
bee will write a poet or sing a song

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.900
and bees are much less
complicated than we are.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.420
There is no work or reward or
queen destitution in beehives.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.110
There are no problems, couple
problems between the bees,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:35.450
among the bees [inaudible]
discussion with teenage larvae.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:42.330
No bee thinks with nostalgia on
his parents or in a lost love

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.910
and not one of them has
yet been found weeping

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.660
when the moon reflects
itself in the sea.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:56.820
On the other side, words
are like parasites.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.300
Words are a cancer that
afflicts the human being.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.910
Words are also the only
medicine for many disease.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.860
Mother tongue is the
beginning of our language.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:16.060
Mother tongue is our singular
tongue, unique for everyone.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.500
You cannot study this tongue.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.140
It appears in the mother
with her child.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.660
The mother tongue is a strong
link between mother and child

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:33.650
without words but with letters
and sounds, a-ha, a-ho, uum.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.390
The Tower of Babel is right.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.670
There was a lost language.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.630
It's our mother tongue.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:45.870
It was a time of full
understanding between human beings.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.000
This is gone and never
will come back.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.300
After this language.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.640
So this means he's
right, the ho, the ha,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.020
the uum, are they from the child?

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.150
Do they come from the mother?

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.370
They are sounds and
the mother repeating

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.870
and molding the child's sounds
consolidates that [inaudible]

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:19.470
that someday will be
poetry, [inaudible], song.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.770
They make essentially phonetic
properties of the word,

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.710
the polyphony of the
word, a song for example,

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:34.700
experience of the mother tongue
happens for all human beings.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:41.830
Punctuation seems to be another
step after this experience.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:48.300 position:56%
Commemorating a day of his childhood
in which his father read kids

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:55.650
"The Nightingale," Borges
says he understood nothing

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.690
but writes in poetic art.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:06.130
He says, I had considered
language as a way of saying things,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:11.710
complaining or to say
that one was happy or sad.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.690
I knew that language could
also be a music and a passion

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.950
and so poetry was revealed to me.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:31.750
Borges in "The Library of Babel,"
the character that Borges wrote

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.880
about him, looks for an
impossible book, a book capable

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.080
of saying everything,
of quoting everything.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:47.200
In the story, the whole book
is searching for a catalog

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.410
that contains all the catalogues
and that would contain itself,

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.700
that book that would contain itself

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:03.960
if it were the [inaudible] book
is what made Bertrand Russell the

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:15.950
mathematician, and he thought
that is an impossible point

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.480
and what [inaudible]
will demonstrate

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.090
with the number [inaudible] the
impossibility of its existence.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:30.740
There are no identical books in the
vast library of books, says Borges.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.190
I have seen from the page
of Russell, he said that,

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.590
the doctrine of sets which has

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.550
as figures the letters
of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:54.340
In that delicate labyrinth,
I was not able to penetrate.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:30:02.090
That is why if we know how to
read the plot that is our life,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.290
we can read something as a book.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:13.930
Babel is nothing but an infinite
game of chance, said Borges.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.700
If babel is the universe,
a lottery, a library,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.840
let's play with our own
letters to tell another story,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.180
not to blame ourselves because
of the misunderstanding.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:34.210
The language like in harmony
is a myth and because of that,

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:40.130
we have many languages and it's
not a punishment but is a gift.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.810
I will finish with
a quote from Lacan.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.110
This is a quote.

"We believe that we say what we want
but this is what others have wanted,

more specifically our
family that speaks to us.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.360
We are spoken and because of this,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.680
we make of any chance expression
something that directs us.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.470
There is indeed a plot.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.500
We call it our destiny.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.750
Many Jews, not all the Jews,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.400
but many Jews believe
they found the total book.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.120
Borges is not so sure.

And psychoanalysis is convinced that
each person could read his own text,

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.670
could touch and change a
letter or two without thinking

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:37.540
that it's a sacred text and
then this universe could be a

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.920
different one.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.720
Thank you.

Tova just asked me

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.130
if she was understood,
if it was clear.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.870
Absolutely clear.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.700
Whether we agree, that's
another story

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.570
but this is the chance
we have right now.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.430
It was interesting to hear
that noise from the background.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.760
And those must be the
workers building the tower

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.060
or taking it down.

But anyway, we do have a few
minutes for questions, for comments,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:23.160
for trying to explore some
of the points both Mirta

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.690
and Tova have raised
and we'll see --

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.530
There are several hands coming up.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.080
I was given instructions
to repeat the questions.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.110
So please make them very brief.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:42.470
My memory is not as strong
as the ones we just heard.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:43.770
Okay, let's start from there.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.380
&gt;&gt; I have a question for Mirta.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.480 position:56%
When you were starting to create the
[inaudible] exhibition in October,

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.210
how did you plan that out?

00:32:54.210 --> 00:33:00.810
Did you storyboard your idea
and figure out how it's going

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.600
to look, the exhibition itself?

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Okay, the
question -- No, no, no, [inaudible].

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.520
The question is how did
Mirta conceive of the work

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.480
that she's going to be presenting
at the Biennale in Jerusalem,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.450
whether there was a storyboard, in
general how did she plan that work.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.350
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Actually
just perhaps the three

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.030
of us can stand now.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.520
Okay. We will walk.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.680
Thank you for your question.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.260
Well, you know it's interesting
but I would answer if I'm sincere

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.560
that I never begin and
I never finish a work.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.020
Works are -- A project
is not suddenly born

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.020
by inspiration or so, no.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:52.900
Everything comes from not only
the previous work but my own life.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.240
So these are my thoughts.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.860
Sometimes I feel that I'm
always making the same

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.430
with different shapes.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.970
Look, only with the Tower
of Babel if I must choose,

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.480 position:56%
I have many more, but I must choose.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.040
So everything is the same
and everything is myself.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:19.980
So [inaudible] I would say that I
choose a title based on what I want

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:28.240
to mean and I join my little
parts trying to express that.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.700
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
Okay, don't go away.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.000
You were right.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.600
Stand. Next question.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.900
Please.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.170
&gt;&gt; This is for Mirta.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:41.700
[inaudible] the most important
language is the mother's language,

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.190
mother's tongue, and Mirta,

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.480
you mentioned that you
were [inaudible] Polish.

little bit [inaudible].

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:59.110
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Hungarians
don't know [inaudible].

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.880
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: No, Hungarians
don't know but Polish, yes.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.180
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Polish, yes.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.140
Okay, but I will let
her handle that one.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.350
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Thank you.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:16.970
Look, I think that my mother
tongue is this, is what I am,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.790
everything, because it's true.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:25.480
I heard many, many languages and
many kinds of mother tongues.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.340
If I understand well what
Tova tries to express is

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.100
that this mother language is
something that is not a --

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:39.570
It's a unique language between
that mother and that child,

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:46.000
that of course I had with no
other language of countries.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.450
But I think that here
in what I share with all

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.750
of you is my real mother tongue,
is my being, my being Argentinean,

00:35:54.750 --> 00:36:03.200
Jewish, Hungarian, Polish
woman, brown eyes and I think

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.020
that being a mother, a wife, a
friend and now speaking with you,

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.760
you are also now all
part of what I am.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.510
So I think that what I
make is my mother tongue.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

&gt;&gt; I want to ask a question
because I am an artist too.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.170
I'm intrigued with your concept
of making the journey of words

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.680
from the mouth into
visualization and I wonder

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.240
when you cut the rubber,
how do you get the rubber,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.480
how do you cut it out?

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.740 position:56%
What size is the piece and so forth
because you have this wonderful flow

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.800
and I tried to figure
out how you did it.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.100
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Your name?

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.570

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.170
Thank you, Phyllis.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:58.680
Phyllis is asking me how
do I cut these big rubbers

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:04.180
into such a huge size and how's
the proceeding that I use.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:10.450
Very well, I buy the flat material.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:17.920 position:56%
I draw -- I am a very expert at this
time to write a, yes, in reverse,

backward in mirror, yes,
like in the mirror way.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:28.140
So I write everything from the back
because I don't want it to be seen

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.410
in the front, all the lines,
so I write everything.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:38.960
It's a drawing, somehow and
afterwards with a regular cutter,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.660
a knife, a very little one, I cut.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.960
Very patient.

So it's everything hand cut and
afterwards I join the flat plates.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.650

they are plates and that's how.

[Inaudible] is a word that came

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.770
from Hebrew, [inaudible].

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.290
It's not language.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.590
It's tongue.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.580
Tongue and language
are different things.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.960
[foreign word] is mother tongue.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.940
Mother language is another thing.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:42.670
My mother, when she used to
speak with me is mother language,

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.890
Spanish for example, but
mother tongue is what I have

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:51.760
in my body, without words.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:39:01.600
So what Mirta says is true, the
mother tongue we cannot spell it.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.500
You cannot translate it.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.570
You are that.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.420
After that, you speak.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.390
We speak.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:19.860
&gt;&gt; I've got a question
for both of you.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:32.560 position:56%
The question is do you think that we
should be, I don't know how to say,

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.580
scared that we are losing a
lot of [inaudible] languages

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:44.600
of our [inaudible], Spanish,
Deutsch, whatever language is

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.980
in this globalization, when today
for example I don't know maybe

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.690
because [inaudible] they have
a common language [inaudible]

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.950
because it doesn't matter if
you speak, if you Deutsch,

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.880
if you speak espanol or
you speak English, right,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.750
they are all texting
when they communicate.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.790
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:12.230
They are words but they
are coming into a language

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.760
of an entire generation
that became like universal

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.930
and as the words are becoming
universal, so is the country.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:27.560
Right? So now the [inaudible]
are replacing [inaudible] now

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.860
everybody's [inaudible].

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:39.520
So it's happening in the
language as it happened

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.160
in the culture [inaudible].

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.540 position:56%
Do you fear that we are losing that?

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.890
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: In other
words, the question is,

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.880
if I understand you correctly
and if not you will readjust,

00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.080
the question is whether
globalization is in fact a threat

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.230
to all the languages that
both of them were mentioning

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:09.910
as mother tongue, mother language
and asking that regardless

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:13.730
of where children are or
teenagers are, they're all texting.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.760
I will add before letting
them answer, they're texting

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.490
in a different language still.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.410
It's a means.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.380
It is not the conveyer in itself.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:28.090
But let them answer
the question, please.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:33.950
&gt;&gt; Tova Shvartzman: So
what I am scared of is

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.860
that the mother will be a robot,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:43.820
not that the mother will
speak the same language,

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.170
English, for the people.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:52.330
If the mother is a robot, the
mother tongue doesn't exist.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.600
You understand me?

00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:00.520
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: I have
my own opinion about this.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:08.790
I see as an observer what is
happening and I have a lot less age

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.710
but you less age than
you, perhaps two years,

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:18.850
but I think that we cannot
change what already exist,

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.290
that the world is changing.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.930
So I think we are all the
time inventing, let's say,

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.630
new ways of communication.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:32.510
And if I like it or not,
nobody cares so much.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.450
I think that everything
already changed

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:41.170
and we will continue changing
and of course we lose.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.930
But in my opinion,

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.700
this is completely personal,
we cannot do nothing.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:53.810
Yes, personally, we can do
with our life and our work,

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.970
treasure what we want but
we will find people who care

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.910
and we will find people
who does not.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.100
This is my opinion.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.900
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Well, one of the
dangers is we are losing a language

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.280
and I talk in this
language every day.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.540
That is not coming back.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.170
So the fear is very,
very legitimate.

about George Steiner's
"After Babel" that he says

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.940

been in the process of translating.

Okay. I think translation is
always betrayal but it's good.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:36.480
It's very good because
it's interpretation.

He's not an Oriental thought.

Steiner [inaudible] will be right

Very, very briefly.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:11.720
Borges did write quite
a bit of text.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:18.570
He wrote both short stories and
poems that link the many traditions

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:23.180
that he's interested
in to various cultures,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.910
to various other traditions.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.230
One of those is Judaism.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:34.370
I go in very, very long way
not to say the most obvious,

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:40.160
namely let's not trap
Borges into just one box.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.480
Borges was interested in Judaism.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.410
He was interested in Kabbalah but
he was interested in Buddhism.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.390
He was interested in all
kinds of other things.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:55.430 position:56%
He has a very famous text that is
called "The Vindication of Kabbalah"

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:59.770
but that is one of several
texts that have the word

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.100
"vindication" in the title.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.640
Basically what he tried to do is

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.340
to understand why did the
Kabbalists engage in that kind

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.230
of esoteric knowledge, is
that kind of esoteric study.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:19.610
Basically what he tries to
do is say, not he tries,

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:24.040
he did say very intelligently
the following.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:29.670
If in fact you believe that the
Torah, the first five books of the

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:34.850
"Bible" are the utterance of a
God and the God is all knowing,

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:39.300
all powerful, et cetera, et
cetera, you cannot assume

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.570
that that is just casual
text, namely every text,

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:46.020
every letter has a
meaning and, therefore,

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.660
it is your job to interpret.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.650
Again, I would go into that
statement that Tova made before,

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:56.600
namely you're engaging
in interpretation

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.820
and the Kabbalists are doing that
for whatever purpose they had

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.620
but that is what they were doing.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.490
So what Borges is doing by
saying a vindication of Kabbalah,

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:10.550
he's justifying the
Kabbalists' approach to language.

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:17.970
Now that is an opening, but I'm
the moderator, so that's enough.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.850
The two of them will talk.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:21.600
&gt;&gt; Tova Shvartzman:
And another answer

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:32.810 position:56%
to that we have always a discussion,
the three of us, about Borges,

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:38.550
the Kabbalah, the "Bible"
if they are art or not.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:43.400
They're sacred text to some people

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:49.420
but perhaps they are
literature also like Borges.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:56.840
So we have the beauty of two of
them, the Kabbalah and Borges.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:08.740
The beauty, they are expressions
there that you cannot only someone

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:16.030
that is inspired can wrote like
Borges or like the Kabbalists one.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.920
Perhaps they are literature,

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:25.160
not only sacred text,
or not a sacred text.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.460
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Sorry.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.540
Dealing with so many
women is the problem.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:35.930
If I -- As an artist, I am always
giving my own point of view.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.430
I would say it depends to whom.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.890
It's not the problem what it is.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.900
It is different things
for different people.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:51.250
For some it may be something
sacred and written by God.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.460
And for others, literature.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:57.490
And that's why the biggest
world, the world is very big

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.460
and we can understand what we want

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.530
and interpret what we want
of the same situation.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.660
Very political.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.070
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Correct.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.690
So politically correct in a
town like this, it's unheard of.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:13.990
Please.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:20.940
&gt;&gt; I think the more you
think about language,

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:31.780
the more complicated it gets
because there's body language

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:36.790
and artistic visual language
and there kinesthetic language

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.390
and we're always [inaudible]
interpreting

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.570
and Borges said [inaudible]
the original should be at least

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.730
as good as the translation.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:48.190
I love that because it puts
[inaudible] how do we understand

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:52.210
people, you know, where
did words come

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:55.520
in because I [inaudible] I
mean you, I don't know so well.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.820
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski:
It's not worth it.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.120
&gt;&gt; So that's my question.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:04.150
In other words, language is so
complicated and the more you know

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:05.800
about it, the less you know.

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.990
How does that affect [inaudible]?

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:12.160
And the other thing I just want
to say, these are more complicated

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.440
than [inaudible] when
it comes to language.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.830
It's just a different [inaudible].

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:24.590

you remember way back

I asked you to make the
questions very short

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.990
because I have to repeat
the questions.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:34.290
So --

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:35.590
&gt;&gt; Language is complicated.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.890
How do you deal with it?

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.190
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Love it!

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:39.490
Language is complicated.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:40.790
How do you deal with it?

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.110
Now that makes a lot of sense.

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:43.970
Now please, you're both on.

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:47.510
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: To both of you.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.810

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.990
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Okay.

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:56.660
With my works, I will
begin from an anecdote.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:04.090 position:56%
Many years ago I had to lecture,
actually you invited me to Milwaukee

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:10.650
to teach with a [inaudible]
students and I went with my son.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:16.950
My son was 15 years old then at
that time and he asked me, "Mom,

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.710
you have to speak in English.

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:24.700
Aren't you afraid you will not be
able to express what you want?"

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.670
And I answered, "Look, I am
not teaching English grammar.

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:35.950
I am speaking about what
I am and I know who I am.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:42.020 position:56%
And if I need a word, I will ask
someone please to help me to say it.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:44.170
No, no, I am not afraid."

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:52.650
And answering, I think
that we say what we want

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.370
to say or we want to express.

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:59.090
We cannot control what the other
person will understand or read

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:05.230
or perceive of the work or reading
the book or we cannot control that.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:12.630
So personally, I'm not
worried about that.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.190
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: And that
is how [inaudible] was born.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:17.490
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Exactly.

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:18.790
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: Tova.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:20.090
&gt;&gt; Tova Shvartzman: Perhaps,

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:25.420
I don't know if I could answer
your question, but you know Babel,

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:32.140
many people said that is in
Hebrew [inaudible] Babel --

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.260
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: To mix up.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.290
&gt;&gt; Tova Shvartzman: Mix up.

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:46.380
But the word "babel" is
babel el is door to God.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.810
It's not [inaudible] mix up.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.840
It's babel el.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.730
Like babel what, like babel el,

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:04.730
there are two words in
Babylonian language.

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:16.700
So the meaning and the [inaudible]
of babel run through at times

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:22.750
and now we said babel is to mix up.

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:27.880
But if you go to the
root, it's not like that.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.220
Which I choose.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:33.210
Which I choose.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:39.340
Yeah. So if language
is so complicated,

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:49.630
we must I think we must do the, a
the [inaudible] to understand us,

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:55.380
there is a misunderstanding
all the time and it's good.

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.680
It's good.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.900
If not, we are, we will
not talk each other.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:07.380
We will be silent.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.060
Thank you.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.490
&gt;&gt; Saul Sosnowski: To say something
like this in Washington, DC,

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:19.860
about misunderstandings and to be
quiet and not text and not tweet

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.880
and things like that, that's
a very welcome gate to God.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.080
Thank you all so very, very
much for joining us [applause].

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.380
Thank you, Gail.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.680
Thank you to embassy.

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.310
&gt;&gt; Mirta Kupferminc: Thank
you, Gail for everything.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.610
Thank you, Gail.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:40.160
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: I want to thank
our presenters and I just want

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.830
to comment on Mirta's work.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:48.020
The more we look at it, when I did
the flier I kept looking at it.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.660
Every time I looked at that
picture, I saw something else.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:57.130
I think Mirta's work, you
have to really keep looking

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.430
at it and looking into it.

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:01.660
And I'm sure there's so
much more I'm missing.

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.650
And thank you for having
so much of you in the work

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:08.960
and so much in your work.

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:16.960
Thank you all for coming
[applause] and I want to thank you.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.600
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
