[GOOGLE LOGO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.540
SPEAKER 1: And I'm really
excited for the conversation

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.390
that we're going to have today
with a good friend of mine,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.620
Chris Butsch.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.320
Chris and I actually attended
Vanderbilt University together.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.480
And after graduation,
Chris went on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.750
to get a high paying job with
a reputable tech company.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.180
Some of you may have
something similar,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.990
have a similar
experience with that.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.160
And Chris did really
well at this job.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.070
He got promoted, and
he got paid more,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.640
and he got more
responsibilities,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.820
and he got fancier titles.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.680
And then one day he woke up
and he just wasn't happy.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.480
He had become what he calls
a depressed workaholic.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.100
And so that led Chris to leave
that cushy tech company job

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.570
and go explore happiness
around the world.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.490
He went on a year
long world tour

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.760
to understand and speak with
happiness experts, understand

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.480
what makes people happy,
is it possible to be

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.240
happy and successful
at the same time.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.810
And he's here to share some
of those tips with us today.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.330
He is an award-winning speaker
and best-selling author,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.650
and a good friend of mine.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.900
And please help me welcome
to the stage, Chris Butsch.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.450
So Chris, let's start with
just a bit of your background.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.070
And tell us about
yourself and how

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.638
you became a globetrotting
happiness expert.

00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:31.430
CHRIS BUTSCH: Sure.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.915
Well, first of all,
so thrilled to be here

00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:36.390
in the room with some of the
smartest people in the world.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.820
I also know that you're
also from the busiest

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.653
people in the world.

00:01:38.653 --> 00:01:41.620
So thank you for taking
time off to chat with me.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.780
So my background-- so
when I was 16 years old,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.520
I already knew exactly
what happiness was.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.690
And that was my crush,
Page Whitehouse.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.820
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.360
Getting ready for prom--

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.720
if you're wondering, I
did take the Duke hat off

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.060
before I went to prom.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.490
And that was happiness for me.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
If Page will go out with
me, I'll be happy forever.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.620
Well, she did.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.530
And shockingly, I
wasn't happy forever.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.387
I was happy for about a month.

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:13.970
Because that's about
when we broke up.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.940
That wasn't quite happiness.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.730
I'll be happy when
I get straight A's.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.700
So I got straight
A's, and guess what?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.550
It didn't really
make me that happy.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.550
So I thought, all right.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.050
I know.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.680
I know know.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.010
I'll be happy when I
get into Vanderbilt.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.040
So I got into Vanderbilt.
Freshman year came,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.470
and the happiness
highs subsided.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.980
I thought, OK, getting
ready for adult world.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260
I'll be happy when I
get a high-paying job.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.970
So I got the high paying IT job.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.300
And a year into my work,
I was sitting at my desk

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.590
still not feeling very
happy or fulfilled.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.450
And I was running out of ideas.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.450
I started brainstorming.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.830
What's at the end
of the sentence.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.663
I'll be happy when--

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:02.350
I'll be happy when.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.410
I finally figured it out.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.710
I thought I'll be happy
when I have a fast car,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.780
make six figures, and have
a girlfriend who plays

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.230
Super Smash Bros. with me--

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.690
and a six pack.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.460
I got most of those, and
I still wasn't happy.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.760
And then I started to
feel a little desperate.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.560
I was running out of ideas.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.400
So I settled on the
idea that I'll be happy

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.346
when I make enough money.

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:36.580
Well, I made enough money.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.530
It still didn't work.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.370
And one day, I was sitting
at my desk at work,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.330
and I got the email from
my mom that was addressed

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.770
to me, Chris, and Greg.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.810
Well, Chris and Greg are
also my uncles' names.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.600
And the email said, let's
not tell the grandkids yet,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.520
but dad's dying.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.750
And in response to the news that
my grandfather, my childhood

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.500
hero, was dying when I thought
he was in perfect health,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.640
I felt absolutely nothing.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.570
And that's when I knew
something was seriously wrong.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.940
So I went to check in to talk
to a therapist, my mental health

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.890
squad, as I called him.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.760
And eventually, I was
prescribed some antidepressants

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.490
shortly after being
told I was depressed.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.730
And these pills helped me
go from negative 5 to 0.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.380
And I thought, that's
not good enough.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.930
That's not good
enough for me, that's

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.380
not good enough for
every young person who's

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.800
been in this situation--

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.050
wondering what
happiness is, wondering

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.480
how to treat stress,
anxiety, and depression,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.290
going from negative 5
to 0 isn't good enough.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.498
How do we go from 0 to 10?

00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:49.540
And that question has been
driving me ever since.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.950
That was about four years ago.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.170
So at that point, I had
a crossroads in my life.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.506
I had a promotion
offer on my desk.

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:02.200
But I thought I can
help the world more if I

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.110
tried to answer this question.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.170
Now, I'm not saying you
should quit your job,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.420
even though that's what I did.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.090
I don't want to [INAUDIBLE]
to come here in a helicopter.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.270
I'm not saying quit your job.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.700
I'm saying I did because I
wanted to find out this answer

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.520
and tell everyone else so
you guys didn't have to.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.300
That's what brings me here.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.750
I then went on a
globe trotting tour.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.990
I went to about 31
and change countries,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.450
just asking people on the
street, anyone I could

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.110
who'd have a conversation
with me in English,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.640
what does it mean to be happy?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.330
And that's what brings me here.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.130
SPEAKER 1: So I want
to get into your method

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.690
and what you prescribe in this
book, and your thoughts on how

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.820
we can all achieve
our own happiness.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.310
Because we've hosted
other happiness experts,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.590
we've had Shawn Achor,
and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.973
and of course,
Chade-Meng Tan, who

00:05:53.973 --> 00:05:55.390
created the Search
Inside Yourself

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.510
program that many of our
own Googlers have attended.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.130
So talk to us
about your approach

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.650
and what makes it unique.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.150
CHRIS BUTSCH: So my approach
to happiness completely changed

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.715
by the time I reached
the Taj Mahal.

00:06:07.715 --> 00:06:09.590
I remember that day I
was in a terrible mood.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.990
And I couldn't figure out why.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.970
I was just crabby.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.360
And I was trying to
ruin everyone else's

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.370
mood in my friend group.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.550
So right, happiness
expert, right?

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.310
So I go up to my
Australian friend, Helen.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.435
She sees the Taj.

00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:23.495
And she just lights up.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.078
She looks like a
little kid who's just

00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:26.410
discovered what Halloween is.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.778
She's, oh my God.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:28.320
Is that real?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.360
Look at that accent.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.400
It is so special.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.400
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.260
And I go over to
her, and I'm, like,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.110
you know, he built
that for his dead wife?

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.203
You know that, right?

00:06:42.203 --> 00:06:44.620
While he had other wives, and
they had to had to watch him

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.675
build that.

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:47.800
How do you think they felt?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:51.230
And she turns-- yeah,
I'm speaking short.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.250
So she turns to me, and she's,
like, completely unfazed.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.070
She's, like, oh, come on, mate.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.637
I bet you 1,000 rupee
you're just in a bad mood

00:06:58.637 --> 00:06:59.720
because you're dehydrated.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.060
What?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.160
So sure enough, I take
a huge swig of water,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.200
like I need to right now.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.870
And I feel instantly better.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.200
It just kills my bad mood.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.560
And she's like, eh,
isn't that better?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.250
And I keep getting
this feeling when

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.190
I travel, it's, like,
Australians already know

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.260
everything about happiness.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
They look at America and
they think we're, like,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.410
the muggles of happiness.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.020
It's a secret they
don't know yet.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.600
Give them some time.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.500
So after that moment,
when I realized

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.450
that happiness can
be within our grasp

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.783
if we just do a
few things right--

00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.200
up until that point
in my journey,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.820
I had let my inner hippie
make all the decisions.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.890
Yeah, man, you should,
like, go to a drum circle

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.090
and it's really happiness.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.720
Yeah.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.520
But I fired that guy, and I
let my inner German take over.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.540
So that' my background.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.270
I'm German.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.013
It seems, like, place!

00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:01.100
[GERMAN ACCENT] We shall now
study this most efficient way

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.600
to be happy.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.300
Look at that.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.170
That's a Porsche.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.820
Porsche 911, it's a perfect car.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.260
This makes it perfect.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.780
Happiness formula.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.870
So that was when my whole
philosophy on happiness

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.370
shifted.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.430
Instead of these ethereal
10,000 foot ideas,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.620
I wanted to find the short
term, instant happiness

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.262
fixes, happiness hacks,
as I like to call it.

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:30.220
SPEAKER 1: Let's go into
those happiness hacks.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.720
What are some of the ways that
we can increase our long term

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.370
happiness?

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.968
Will you call in
just a few minutes?

00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:35.760
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.390
So there are two types of
happiness in the world.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.159
There's what I call
true happiness, which

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.409
is the lasting,
nourishing happiness.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.460
And then there is pleasure,
which is the short term fix.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.580
Right?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.600
So my favorite form
of pleasure is a soda.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.500
And a soda will make you feel
good for about five minutes,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.775
followed by a pinch of regret.

00:08:56.775 --> 00:08:58.775
And it's not really-- you
can't build a lifetime

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.870
with just drinking a
happy life drink, soda.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.060
Whereas true happiness is
a different form entirely.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.783
So true happiness is something
that you can do in the instant,

00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:10.450
but it will last and
have a slow burning

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.260
effect on your happiness.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.005
So a challenge I had with
these instant happiness fixes,

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:20.380
or the happiness
hacks, as I like

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.345
to call them is that sometimes
I would prescribe one,

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:23.845
and someone would
say, well, I don't

00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:25.840
feel like doing that
right now at all.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.340
Like, somebody had
a really bad day.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.670
Let's say here they do.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.400
You're exhausted.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.480
You're getting
home at 9 o'clock.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:32.980
Oh, my God.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.125
I'm just exhausted.

00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:35.500
I can't deal with
this right now.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.770
And your roommate
goes, just be grateful.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.130
You work at Google.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.060
Just be grateful.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:43.760
Right.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.950
That doesn't make
you instantly happy.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.040
So I divided happiness
into two different levels.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.790
And these are all forms
of true happiness,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.760
as I like to call them.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.740
So level one is an
acronym I call MESH.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.590
MESH is the baseline
of things you

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.100
need to do on a daily,
or every few days, basis

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.460
to maintain kind of a
baseline concrete foundation

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.600
of happiness.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.960
So MESH stands for meditation,
exercise, sleep, and hydration.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.520
So any time in my
journeys, or if I'm

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.895
getting ready for
a speaking gig,

00:10:13.895 --> 00:10:17.770
and I just don't feel very
happy, and I can't pin

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.950
point why that is,
I go and do my MESH.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.770
And I say, OK, I
meditated this morning.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.510
I exercised.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.400
I got five hours of
sleep last night--

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.810
that's where I goofed up.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.180
And I found if I can
consistently do MESH

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.320
throughout my life, I'll have
this higher level of baseline

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.460
happiness, what positive
psychologists would

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.590
call your hedonic setpoint.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.550
So just by doing MESH, you can
keep your hedonic set point

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.870
a little higher than
it might be right now.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.830
So that's what I call the
level one of true happiness.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.200
Level two are the
more advanced stuff

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.020
you can do once you have
your baseline taken care of.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.020
My acronym for
level two is GRIP.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.512
It's gratitude, relationships,
intellect, and passion.

00:11:00.512 --> 00:11:02.470
So once you have your
base needs taken care of,

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.380
it's easier to be a
bit more grateful.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:12.357
So for me, for
gratitude, for example,

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:13.940
when I was growing
up, as I mentioned,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.130
I kept saying things
like I'll be happy when.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.320
I'll be happy when I get
into Vanderbilt. When

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.380
I work at Google I'll be happy.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.850
When I'm traveling
the world, I'm

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.730
asking these people who
have staggering amounts

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.560
of happiness--

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.700
rickshaw drivers, janitors,
it's unbelievable.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.760
They started sentences
in different ways.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.790
Instead of I'll be happy
when, they started sentences

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.240
with I'm happy because.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.420
I can never forget a rickshaw
driver I was riding with--

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.890
actually, this is
a longer story,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.000
because he had a lot of--

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.208
this guy had a lot of wisdom.

00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:53.660
So I've got a picture of him.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.560
That's me in Bhutan.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.602
Here, we'll just go through
my travel slide show.

00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:01.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.960
That's me in Bhutan.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.400
That's India.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.430
That's off the side of
Buddha's first [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.100
I was meditating until
these Indian eighth graders

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.750
came and surrounded me.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.150
That's Sweden.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.590
So I was asked by the
Swedish to come to Sweden

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.902
and teach them about happiness.

00:12:21.902 --> 00:12:23.610
For those of you who
don't know, Sweden's

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.450
one of the happiest
countries in the world.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.240
So that's, like, Michael Phelps
asking for swimming lessons.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.602
I should go to Sweden, and
you all should teach me.

00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:37.230
Do a little bit of happiness
in both directions.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.950
Oh, yeah.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.540
So I visited a
Buddhist monastery.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.280
Just to learn mindfulness
meditation, I check into one.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.310
Turns out they run some Buddhist
monasteries just like Airbnbs.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.760
You just hit them up by email.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.240
And say, I'd like
to stay for 12 days.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.330
They might charge you
$40 a day, but that'll

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.800
cover your meals and expenses.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.515
So I scheduled some time to
visit this Buddhist monastery

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:01.140
in Mississippi.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.630
Because when you
think the epicenter

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.500
of Vietnamese Buddhist
thought, you go to Mississippi.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:18.060
So [INAUDIBLE]
and imagine you're

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.993
about to walk into a
Buddhist monastery.

00:13:20.993 --> 00:13:22.410
What kind of things
would you see?

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.950
What kind of things
would you smell?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.300
What would you expect
the monks to be doing?

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.310
Maybe meditating, cleaning,
like dragging that rake

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.500
through the sand or
whatever they do?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.104
None of that-- so I walk in, and
this monk hands me a margarita.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.220
I said, is this a margarita?

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.420
He said, no.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.180
It's-- does anyone
have any guesses?

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.780
It sounds like margarita,
but starts with a "B."

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.000
If you can guess it, I'll
give you a free book.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.080
AUDIENCE: Beerita.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.620
CHRIS BUTSCH: Beerita,
no, not quite, we're

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.092
at a Buddhist monastery--

00:14:00.092 --> 00:14:00.998
AUDIENCE: Buddharita?

00:14:00.998 --> 00:14:02.040
CHRIS BUTSCH: Buddharita!

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.630
Yeah.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.728
So they hand me a Buddharita.

00:14:04.728 --> 00:14:05.270
So I walk in.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.932
It's a Buddharita.

00:14:06.932 --> 00:14:08.390
They're watching
a Bollywood movie,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.848
and they're doing
karaoke in there.

00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.310
Turns out, even Vietnamese
devout Buddhist monks

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.840
will take what they call a
lazy week, where they just

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.311
have a staycation and hang out.

00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:24.030
So I showed up in the
middle of lazy week.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.250
And I'm doing--
within 20 minutes,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.622
I'm doing karaoke in a
language I don't speak.

00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:33.205
But later that week, I actually
learned mindfulness meditation

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.670
and got back into
the rhythm of things.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.970
So after that long
diversion-- here we are.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.840
So that's Sati.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.270
Sati was the most
memorable person

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.700
I spoke to in my entire
journey in 31 countries.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.290
I get in Sati's rickshaw, a
little outside the Taj Mahal.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.550
And I say, Sati, I'm a
student of happiness.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.320
I'm traveling the world to ask
people what happiness means.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.910
So what does
happiness mean to you?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.390
And he lights up.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.040
And he's instantly
got the answer.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.110
He goes, ah,
happiness, my friend.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.370
Happiness-- there are
two secrets to happiness.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.230
First, is that
happiness is love.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.640
Too many people in this world
wait around to receive love.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.750
What we forget as a species
is that we can give love.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.248
Sometimes in the middle of the
day, I still feel depressed.

00:15:30.248 --> 00:15:32.540
So what I'll do is I'll drive
down to the Mother Teresa

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.300
house on the Ganges River.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.870
And I'll pour soup into the
mouths of those less fortunate

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.850
than me.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.250
And I'll create love.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.780
And as long as I
can create love,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.360
I'll be the happiest
man in the world.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.780
I said, Sati, that's beautiful.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.780
But you said there are
two secrets to happiness.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.086
What's the other one?

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:58.727
He said, ah, you need
to find a hot wife.

00:15:58.727 --> 00:16:01.529
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.060
Sati, we were doing so well.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.320
So what else is there?

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.290
So gratitude is also important.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:20.860
He said I'm happy because I
can feed my family tonight.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.090
I'm happy because I have a job.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.810
I'm happy because I have
unlimited love in my life.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.350
So very easy gratitude
hack is rather than

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.570
start a sentence with
I'm grateful for, which

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.370
for me personally doesn't really
work that well, I ask myself

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.270
I'm happy because.

00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:44.580
And I'll answer that every day.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.440
It's OK if the answers
are the same every day.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
You've just got
to remind yourself

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.865
why you're already happy.

00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:51.880
So instead of I'll
be happy when,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.910
and setting a goal for this
state you'll never reach--

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.490
I'll be happy when,
I'll be happy when--

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.650
remind yourself why
you're already happy.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.060
I'm happy because.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.260
SPEAKER 1: Let's talk about
the other part of that acronym.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.490
You mentioned relationships.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.530
Talk to us about how you
maintain relationships.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.569
I think a lot of folks,
you know, especially

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.020
in the millennial crowd,
they've graduated from college

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.730
in the last four or five years.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.790
They're now in their first
job, maybe mid to late 20s.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.180
And I think a lot of folks
find a sense of sadness,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.690
because a lot of the
relationships that they

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.240
had when they were younger
start to fade away.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.490
People grow apart.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:29.990
Talk to me.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.840
Talk to us about
your relationships

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.965
and how you maintain those.

00:17:32.965 --> 00:17:34.257
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:34.257 --> 00:17:36.750
So this was definitely a day
when I was not traveling now.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.890
I was back home in Atlanta,
just me in front of a laptop

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.690
doing happiness research,
like, full German.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.670
[GERMAN] find most efficient
way to be happy today.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.070
That was on my to do list,
find efficient happiness.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.480
So there was a
Ted talk about it.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.020
There was a study called
a Harvard Grant study.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.860
Has anyone heard of this before?

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.860
Yeah, a couple of hands.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.960
The Harvard Grant study is--

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.060
in the 1930s,
Harvard researchers

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.030
decided to start collecting
millions of data points

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.330
from hundreds of Bostonian
men, Harvard grads, or Harvard

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.800
undergrads, but also men from
underprivileged neighborhoods.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.450
They didn't really have a
strong objective back then.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.220
They just wanted to
collect a ton of data

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.800
that they could then
extrapolate ideas

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.580
from later in the century.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.420
So in 2013, 75 years after
the inception of the study,

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.130
a guy named Robert
Waldinger did a Ted talk

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.330
revealing what they found
after 75 years, the number one

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.540
indicator of a
happy, healthy life.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.260
Like, the one thing that kept
these guys happier and living

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.720
longer and more successful
throughout their entire lives.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.450
And that one thing was
their relationships.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.380
And not the quantity of their
relationships, but the quality.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.820
So these guys-- one thing that
the happiest guys in the Grant

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.655
study all had in common was
they had five close friends.

00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:00.280
And I took that idea
and I ran with it.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.050
And it turns out the
happiest societies

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:06.380
in the world generally all
have some format of that five

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.200
good friend rule.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.170
So Okinawa, for example--

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.380
Okinawa is what they call a
blue zone, a UN designated

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.520
area where they have a unique
amount of centenarians,

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.380
people who live past 100.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.842
So sociologists around the
world love to study blue zones,

00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:26.050
because they can extrapolate
the secrets of long life

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.710
and happiness.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.610
And one of the secrets of the
Okinawan society is that they

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:35.610
what they call a moai, M-O-A-I.
I think that's right, M-O-A-I.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.170
So the moai is when
Okinawans are born,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:43.250
their families find them five
close friends that they'll have

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.950
throughout their entire life.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.990
And you'll see
pictures of Okinawans

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:54.610
with their moais over 100
years after they were created.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.910
I think, as a society,
we've lost touch

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.980
of the quality of relationship.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:07.570
Because there are websites
that I will not name that

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.890
tend to value
quantity over quality.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.557
When I hold back my
networking and trying

00:20:15.557 --> 00:20:17.140
to meet a million
people in the world,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.810
and instead pour my
resources into growing

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:25.090
five chosen relationships,
my happiness skyrocketed.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.140
So that all being said, here
is a very simple tool for,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.150
as David said,
reconnecting with somebody.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.022
Maybe your best
friend in college

00:20:33.022 --> 00:20:34.480
who you haven't
spoken to in years.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.860
Facebook-- one thing
I love about Facebook

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.500
is that it tells you when
your friends' birthdays are.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.250
The one thing I love to do
every day is call that person.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.500
I pick up the phone,
and I call them and just

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.010
have a quick conversation.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.850
Sometimes I'll leave a voicemail
and I sing them happy birthday.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:01.350
But think about-- imagine
it's your birthday today.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:06.060
And 100 people write on your
Facebook wall, happy birthday.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.990
But one guy even
wrote HB on my wall.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.620
Wow, thanks.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.120
HB?

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.390
I can tell you really put
a lot of thought into that.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.740
So on to HB, imagine
100 people wrote

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.820
HB on your wall and one person
called you and wished you

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.430
happy birthday and catch up.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.410
It makes so much difference.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.310
And what did that cost
you to pick up the phone?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.650
What did that cost to
them to make the call?

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.840
Five minutes-- five minutes
to reignite a relationship.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.940
That's how I
reconnected with David.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.290
Probably I called you on your
birthday, or I just called you.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.170
And around that
time, and because I

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.680
reignited a relationship that
I cared about, here I am.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.952
SPEAKER 1: Here we are.

00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:54.480
I think Myspace was
closed at the top eight.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.190
But I guess we're talking
the top five friends which

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.628
we should consider.

00:21:58.628 --> 00:22:01.170
We're going to go to audience
questions here in a little bit.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.160
So consider those, and
we'll get the mic set up.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.950
I'm sure you have
some more crazy travel

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.070
stories from your time abroad.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.055
You have any you want to share?

00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:15.040
CHRIS BUTSCH: Let's see.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.030
Oh, there was this
time in Cozumel.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.790
I love talking to cabbies.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.290
Cabbies, rickshaw
drivers generally--

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.370
they're sort of undercover
sociologists and psychologists,

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.400
because who else listens to
somebody else's life story

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.483
every single day.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.150
These people have so
many conversations.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.280
They're generally
buckets of wisdom.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.320
And I love talking
to these guys.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.120
So we got in the cab in
Cozumel, and I said the usual.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.500
Hey, Miguel, I'm
studying happiness.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.200
I love asking people
what makes them happy.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.670
And he cuts me
off, and he goes, I

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.462
will take you to where
they make happiness.

00:22:49.462 --> 00:22:53.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.724 --> 00:22:56.340
Well, what does that mean?

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.390
And he doesn't ask
me where I'm going,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.850
or where I want to go, you
know, his job as a cab driver.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.060
Instead, he just drives me
to where they make happiness.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.370
So I'm in Cozumel.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:12.690
Does anyone have a guess where
they would make happiness?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.650
It begins with a "T."

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.400
AUDIENCE: Tequila?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.150
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yes!

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.232
It's a tequila farm.

00:23:16.232 --> 00:23:17.940
He drove me to his
cousin's tequila farm.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.450
He pulls out this little--

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.720
I watched the whole process.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.200
It's actually
pretty fascinating.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.040
And at the very
end of the process,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.040
tequila is dribbling down
the sugar chute that's

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.230
capturing the perfect
amount of sugar,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.090
and it just drips into
this little Dixie cup.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.580
And he hands me the
Dixie cup, and he goes,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.800
my friend, your journey is over.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.580
That's a wrap.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.130
All right.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.630
Right.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.185
I get home.

00:23:45.185 --> 00:23:46.060
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.300
We're going to go to
audience questions here.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.540
Just start lining up at the mic.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.940
And in the meantime, I
want to go back to GRIP.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.210
So we talked about gratitude.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.460
We talked about relationships.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.727
Talk to us about the
last two in the acronym.

00:23:58.727 --> 00:24:00.810
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah, intellect
and passions-- those

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.550
are challenging ones.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.870
So for intellect,
what I like to do

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:14.760
is set a Google alert
on my favorite topics.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.640
That might be happiness,
positive psychology.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.180
I also love cars, so Porsche.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.790
And I'll just, like, will you
email me the latest articles

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.850
on those topics.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.750
And then all of a sudden, I've
got a pile of reading material

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.950
for if I'm on the subway or
if I'm in an Uber or whatever.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.950
So I'm constantly
sharpening my intellect.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.290
Personally, I'm also
a big fan of the--

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.320
I know they're a bit
controversial-- but the apps

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.732
that you can play brain
training games on.

00:24:48.732 --> 00:24:50.190
They've been in
and out of the news

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.990
because they've made some
marketing claims that

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.060
may or may not have backing.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.893
But personally, I've
felt that they actually

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:57.140
work and keep my brain sharp.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.190
And here's really
kind of a quirky one

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.890
I've been doing lately.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.740
And I welcome your
judgmental stares.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:10.320
I was tutoring my neighbor's son
and getting him ready for SSAT.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.720
And he didn't have
the answer key around.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.620
So as an adult, I just had to
go through the SSAT practice

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.530
questions and just
answer them myself.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.570
And I realized that
the questions designed

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.988
to challenge elementary
and middle schoolers

00:25:23.988 --> 00:25:25.530
are actually pretty
good for jostling

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.830
the parts of the brain, like
the prefrontal cortex, insular

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.905
cortex, et cetera, for an
adult. So sometimes before a gig

00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:36.040
or if I'm just trying
to jog my creativity,

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.180
I will download an SSAT
practice test off the internet

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.290
and just take it.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.225
So that's intellect.

00:25:44.225 --> 00:25:46.100
Do three of those, and
you'll be the smartest

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.020
person in the world.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.270
SPEAKER 1: Chris, you brought
your book with us today.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.920
Talk to us about the experience
of publishing your own book.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.330
And what folks who
read it can expect

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.978
to get out from reading that.

00:25:58.978 --> 00:25:59.770
CHRIS BUTSCH: Sure.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.570
So I drafted the book
in Microsoft Word.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.970
And I just had it
sitting in this document

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.360
and wondered what are
my next options, right?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.875
Traditionally, you
can self publish.

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.680
It means you send it
to Amazon or whoever.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.770
And they'll send you back
your book and books in a box.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.220
You can go for traditional
publishing, where you get

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.590
an agent, then pitch it around.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.130
And you might get a bite at
a major or a small publishing

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.630
house.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.310
And they may or may not
take some creative control.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.420
That might be three
months, or three years.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.970
And I thought, I don't like
the idea of self-publishing.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.290
That doesn't feel
really like I'd

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.230
be joining the industry
if I just self-published.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.810
I also don't feel like I want
to lose any creative control.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.352
So there is a third
option now called

00:26:48.352 --> 00:26:51.270
hybrid publishing, where you
work with a boutique publisher.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.020
But if you pay some
of the costs up front,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.280
they'll let you retain higher
royalties and creative control.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.160
That's exactly what I did with
a small company called BookLogix

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.240
in Alpharetta, Georgia.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.510
So they are my formal publisher.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.690
That's my publisher, the
little B on the book.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.230
What that let me do is
retain creative control.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.680
And we went from books
sitting in a Word document

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:20.770
to edited critiques and
books in hand, in about four,

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.180
five months.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.243
And that can be
pretty intensive.

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:25.660
I don't know if
you work full-time

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.620
at Google, if you'll have time
to do that in four months.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.800
But know that it's possible.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.870
If you have a book hanging
around in your head,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.690
know that it's never
been easier to publish

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.720
your own work, your own book.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.400
So, after that, I
wanted to galvanize

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.970
all my friends and family
into supporting the book.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.860
The traditional school of
thought is to launch on Amazon.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.740
But I wanted to do something
a bit more fun and gamified.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.220
So I ran a Kickstarter
campaign to fund

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.690
the book, and all of my
upfront self-publishing costs.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.500
So the thing I love
about Kickstarter

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.560
is you get a ping on your phone
every time somebody donates.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.310
So I was connecting with some of
my old teachers, my old English

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.820
High School teacher.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.670
Yeah, I'm running
this online fundraiser

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.430
to publish my first book.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.760
Oh, that sounds pretty cool.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.040
I get back to my car and
I get a ping on my phone.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.440
Mrs. Finch donated $120
to your Kickstarter.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.050
And that's an isolated case.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.695
But if you run your own
Kickstarter campaign,

00:28:25.695 --> 00:28:27.070
or whichever
fundraising platform

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:32.110
you choose, and you put your own
creative creation on the line,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.590
and you see people
from your past life,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.470
and your current boss, your
best friend, his best friend,

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.595
pouring money to help you give
birth to something that you

00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:42.970
care about,
something that you've

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.610
put your heart and soul into--

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.610
it was the most amazing,
humbling experience

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.520
of my entire life.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.480
And from a German
perspective, it

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.010
helped me pre-sell
my first 500 copies.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:56.513 --> 00:28:58.930
SPEAKER 1: We're headed to
what's in the book in a second,

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.130
but we've got a live
question right here.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.713
Go to that.

00:29:00.713 --> 00:29:01.480
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yes, sir.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.313
AUDIENCE: Yeah, man.

00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:03.640
Thanks for coming.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.940
So I've seen some
research that suggests

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.703
that most of each
person's happiness level

00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:13.120
is predetermined
by their genetics

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.280
and there's only a little
bit that we can affect.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.450
Do you think that's true?

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.908
Like, what do you
think about that?

00:29:17.908 --> 00:29:18.700
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.956
If I can remember the numbers
off the top of my head,

00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:24.190
I wonder if it was
[INAUDIBLE] work.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.070
I think it was 50% is genetic.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.280
10% is controlled by factors
outside of your control--

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.200
the weather, the
stocks, et cetera.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.700
And they say 40% is completely
within your control.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.900
So 40% is a lot.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.060
That's the difference
between a D minus and an A

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.860
plus in happiness.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:47.770
So the challenge is, as it
goes with a lot of happiness

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.870
research, happiness
is very subjective.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:56.350
It's difficult to measure
happiness in objective terms.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.610
You can't really
quantify exactly

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.100
how happy glad people make
you, because you can't just

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.010
show up in a [INAUDIBLE]
with an MRI machine.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.010
You just throw people in it,
and measure the difference.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.660
That being said,
they have measured

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.720
our longitudinal
effects of meditation.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.250
And I think, more subjectively,
the self-reported effects

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.700
of [INAUDIBLE], et cetera.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.260
So to expand on your question.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.500
Do I believe in
the 50-40-10 rule,

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.420
or do I believe in some of this
more subjective or open-ended

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.220
happiness research?

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.220
I can't find any
counter evidence to it.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:38.590
I haven't really found work by
Chade-Meng Tan, or Shawn Achor,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.700
or Sonya Lyubomirsky
that I disagree with.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.592
I've found subjective
evidence in my own life.

00:30:45.592 --> 00:30:46.300
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:46.985
CHRIS BUTSCH: Thank you.

00:30:46.985 --> 00:30:48.890
SPEAKER 1: We've got
another live question.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:49.432
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:49.432 --> 00:30:50.390
This is taller than me.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.830
Thanks for being here.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.940
I think this topic is
definitely [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.590
We've all seen at
least the headline

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.880
of the [INAUDIBLE] millennial
burnout article and things

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.380
like that.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.380
So I was wondering,
from your perspective,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.340
why did you need
to be number one?

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.890
I know that makes this
question, like, hard to answer.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.260
And what about being millennial,
[INAUDIBLE] question,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.490
and, on the flip side, like, how
does being a millennial informs

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.933
the solution [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:11.933 --> 00:31:13.600
CHRIS BUTSCH: Thank
you for asking that.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.100
It's funny.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.960
The number one feedback I get
on the book is, it's great.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.540
Why is millennial the title?

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.835
One of my family friends,
their daughter read the book.

00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:24.460
And then, when she
went off to college,

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.870
she couldn't find
her copy of the book.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.550
That was because her mother
had stolen it and hidden it

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:33.280
in her room because
she wanted to read it.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.962
And anyone over 35
will read the book

00:31:35.962 --> 00:31:37.170
and ask me the same question.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.073
Why are you orienting
this just to millennials?

00:31:40.073 --> 00:31:42.240
And to be honest, I don't
really have a good answer.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.407
I've actually been thinking
about retitling the book

00:31:44.407 --> 00:31:46.867
to just making happiness.

00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:48.950
Because I do want to appeal
to a broader audience.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.210
I think this positive
psychology, these happiness

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.480
hacks, this knowledge
of how our brain works

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.940
and how to improve
our lifestyles

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.220
applies to every generation.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.140
I just wanted to
galvanize millennials

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.270
into taking advantage
of it because I

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.730
feel that we're poised to make
the most change in the world

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.530
right now that we
desperately need.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:20.253
I think the challenges specific
to the millennial audience

00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:21.170
that we grew up with--

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:26.360
I'm 28-- is social
media, I think,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.820
has made the most impact.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.440
I think social
media was originally

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.910
conceived, business objectives
aside, to bring us together

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.540
as a society.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.440
So if you can catalyze the
way that people communicate

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:46.110
and make a fence, that should
be great for humankind, right?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.380
But I think what we've done is
use that not as a supplement

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.920
or a catalyst in
social behavior,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.150
but as a replacement, right?

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.430
So why would I call
up a friend if I

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.400
can just Facebook chat him?

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.050
Why would I try to
connect with this person

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.020
again over coffee, if I can just
connect with them on Facebook

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.030
at friend whatever.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:15.330
So I think what
also goes with that

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.050
is a phenomenon they call
impressions management.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.080
So as a species, we've evolved.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.920
We are the offspring of
the smartest, most powerful

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.460
among our species.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.980
And the way that we've
shown that off in the past

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.490
is by what they
called peacocking.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:30.990
Right?

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.650
So making ourselves look smart,
intelligent, and impressive

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.430
to the small audience
that's around us.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.130
What Facebook, Instagram, and
social media sites have given

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.890
us is a microzone.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.480
So instead of peacocking
to just five people

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.010
that we might care
about, we're now

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.070
trying to peacock to 1,500
people on a daily basis.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:54.520
That's a staggering amount of
pressure to put on ourselves.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.400
I remember back in college, I
had two friends, Ann and Dave.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.750
They were that couple that
dated throughout college.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.833
Everyone thought, oh,
they're that perfect couple.

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:05.555
We need to be like Ann and Dave.

00:34:05.555 --> 00:34:06.930
Well, I knew Ann
and Dave better.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.949
Yeah.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.290
I knew-- and these are
not their real names,

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.429
but they know who they are.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:21.659
So one night, I was talking
to Ann, and Dave came in.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.020
And he demanded to know
who she was on the phone

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.389
with earlier that day.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.377
Who does that?

00:34:29.377 --> 00:34:31.460
Who were you on the phone
call with earlier today?

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.877
She's like, none
of your business.

00:34:32.877 --> 00:34:33.900
She's the jealous type.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.400
He's holding a pizza.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.965
And he takes the pizza out and
throws it against the wall.

00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:42.230
I'm, like, this is
not a perfect couple.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.659
And yet everyone
thinks they are,

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.750
because they post beautiful
pictures on Facebook

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.840
all the time.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.929
How many couples are out
there judging themselves

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:52.659
against the couples that are
on Facebook that look perfect.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.870
And everyone looks
perfect, because you're all

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.390
taking beautiful pictures in
front of the Eiffel Tower,

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.450
her legs popping.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.700
But that's just not real life.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.420
So I think because
we all spend so much

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.500
time in this arena that's not
reflective of the humdrumness

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.950
and the challenges of real life,
we have higher expectations

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.170
for each of ourselves.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.240
And it's OK to remind ourselves
that we're all just human.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.130
And the best reminder
that we're all human

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.780
is to spend time
with other humans.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.547
SPEAKER 1: We've
got a live question.

00:35:28.547 --> 00:35:29.130
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.220
Thanks so much for coming today.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.000
One question I just
had was how do you

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.810
balance gratitude and ambition?

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:37.855
So kind of the idea of being
grateful for what you have,

00:35:37.855 --> 00:35:40.240
and, also, at the
same time, from

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.898
a young millennial perspective,
the desire to want more?

00:35:42.898 --> 00:35:43.690
CHRIS BUTSCH: Sure.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.190
Yeah.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.860
So how do you balance
gratitude and ambition?

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.500
How are you grateful
for what you have

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.920
without stifling your ambition?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.930
Everyone in this room
is incredibly ambitious.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:57.000
I think-- I wouldn't
see them as dichotomous.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.160
I would see them as
supplementary to each other.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.980
So the really important
thing to remind ourselves

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.440
about happiness is that it's
a high performance fuel.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.470
So a grand fallacy
of the idea I'll

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.340
be happy when is, if we
wait for all that happiness

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.370
to come at the end of
this goalpost, that's

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.610
a lot of high performance fuel
that we're not getting that we

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.070
need to reach that goal.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.410
So if you spend your night
journaling and reminding

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.770
yourself what you're
already happy for,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.310
I can't imagine a scenario
where that could possibly

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.000
stifle innovation or ambition,
at least in my own life.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.040
It reminds you how far
you've come and reminds you

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.082
how far you have yet to go.

00:36:43.082 --> 00:36:45.630
So I'm grateful for
what I already have.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.325
And that gratitude is motivating
me to continue to get more.

00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:50.700
And maybe I can
make a difference

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.950
in other people's lives to
make them grateful as well.

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.720
SPEAKER 1: Chris, anything
else that you want

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.430
to add before we wrap up here?

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.238
Any other happiness tips for
the Googlers watching here now.

00:37:02.238 --> 00:37:03.530
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.363
So I'm probably the
least intelligent person

00:37:05.363 --> 00:37:06.600
in this room.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.300
So I would love to
know, because Google

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.910
is known as one of the
happiest campuses in the world.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.130
I'm curious to know
what do you find either

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.700
makes you happy at
work, or what are

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.620
your personal secrets
for happiness,

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.183
or what does Google do
to make you guys happy?

00:37:25.183 --> 00:37:26.600
I'm just curious
about it, myself.

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.730
SPEAKER 1: Anyone in the
audience want to jump in?

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.380
CHRIS BUTSCH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.570
AUDIENCE: In my personal
opinion, working hour

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.880
flexibility.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.990
Like, it takes off a lot of the
pressure if you have something

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.260
that comes [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.420
AUDIENCE: So I used to
work for IBM for 15 years

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.660
before joining Google.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.700
And one of the striking
differences that personally

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.710
made the biggest
impression on me

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.530
and probably influences
my happiness here more

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:15.810
than anything is the feeling
of empowerment to change.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.660
And I think that actually
drives a lot of the, ultimately,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.410
down the line, a lot of
the perks that people talk

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.520
about when they mention Google.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.110
But all of that, I feel,
comes from being a part

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.230
to change the group.

00:38:33.952 --> 00:38:35.910
AUDIENCE: One thing that
makes a big difference

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.900
for me is this concept
of psychological safety

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.310
that we have.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.880
Are you familiar with that?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.360
CHRIS BUTSCH: Now
tell me about it.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.790
AUDIENCE: I'm not probably
the best person to explain it.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.660
But Google did a study
before I started, years ago,

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.660
about what makes effective
teams at Google, what

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.160
makes them the most effective.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.243
And the big thing they
found was that the teams had

00:38:53.243 --> 00:38:54.660
a culture of
psychological safety,

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.470
meaning that people feel
comfortable giving suggestions

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.720
without feeling someone was
going to make fun of them,

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.140
or, like, everyone is just
comfortable being open

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.270
and being themselves.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.660
And that makes a big
difference for me.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.800
Off topic, but you forgot to
talk about the "P" in GRIP.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.910
And I was curious about that.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.360
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yeah,
passions, sure.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.205
So very-- thank you
for calling me out.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.330
For some lifelong
challenges, how

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:28.050
do you answer the question,
what are my passions?

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:33.720
And what I've found works is
simply a brute force approach.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.410
Try everything.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.265
Sample everything.

00:39:37.265 --> 00:39:39.390
I think finding your passions
is like finding metal

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.932
on the beach.

00:39:39.932 --> 00:39:43.680
You just have to wave around
until you hear a beep.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.100
My friend Mark,
for example, Mark

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.700
thought he wanted
to teach English.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.888
He thought that he'd be
passionate about that.

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.180
So he went to go teach English.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.130
And he realized-- I
think he was teaching

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.560
to freshman in high school.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.910
And he didn't like it.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.170
He liked some things about
it, but not [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.100
So what he did is he sat down
and he wrote out what he likes

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.300
and what he didn't like.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.210
I like teaching.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:05.390
I don't like ninth graders.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.520
And I don't like English.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.210
But he heard a beep in
his metal detector, right?

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:12.960
So he thought, OK.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.590
I'm going to try teaching
math to ninth graders.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.210
And the school
allowed that change.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.520
He's, like, oh, I love
teaching and math.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.140
I still don't like
ninth graders.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.750
So now he teaches
math to fifth graders.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.440
So I think to go out on a
limb and just try and sample

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.360
as many things here
and around the world

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.460
as you can, whether it's belly
dancing, or hula hooping,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.920
or coding, whatever
it is, trying it.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.810
And then being
mindful of that beep.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.740
I think I kind of like this.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.260
And then tweaking it from there
is how you find your passions.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:52.410
And passions to me
are things, activities

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.210
that we fall in love
with, just like we

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:58.020
fall in love with a spouse
or a member of our family.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.230
So passion is just
another form of love.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.290
And as Sati told us,
that's one of the two

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.310
secrets for happiness.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.038
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:07.038 --> 00:41:08.330
Does that answer your question?

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:08.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:08.955 --> 00:41:11.030
SPEAKER 1: You've got
a live question here.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.590
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.790
So you were talking
about how to be happy.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.750
And actually, one
of the things that

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:20.940
came to mind for me was that I
know when we think about happy,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.360
I think a lot of people are--

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.450
their religion makes them happy.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.330
But I also feel like
there's this subset to that,

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.710
their religion makes
them very unhappy.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.030
And so just curious
kind of what--

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.000
I don't know, just
in your travels,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.958
what you experienced
in terms of religion

00:41:38.958 --> 00:41:40.750
and how that relates
to people's happiness.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.410
And secondly, since we're
talking about ambition,

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.595
what is your end goal?

00:41:45.595 --> 00:41:46.720
What are you looking to do?

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.412
What would you love to do next
10, 15 years, or accomplish?

00:41:49.412 --> 00:41:50.870
CHRIS BUTSCH: Thank
you for asking.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.150
So the first question--

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.650
first question is on--

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.700
SPEAKER 1: Religion.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.283
CHRIS BUTSCH: Yes,
religion question--

00:42:00.283 --> 00:42:05.840
so when religion
makes you happy--

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.350
there is a metric on the
UN World Happiness Report,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:13.430
which is a report the UN
puts out for free every year,

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.760
I think since 2014,
that measures and rates

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.210
every country's happiness.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.660
How did they measure that?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.650
They send out surveys
in each country

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.148
that had six metrics on them.

00:42:23.148 --> 00:42:25.190
And the people respond
and they measure happiness

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.510
based on that.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.740
One of the questions
pertains to social belonging.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.920
And it's the simplest
question on the entire survey.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.010
The question is, do you
feel that when times--

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.065
when times get tough,
do you have one person

00:42:40.065 --> 00:42:40.940
in your life to call?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.440
And it's sad because
a lot of people

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.120
answer no to that question.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.080
And I think organized
religion is,

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.170
for a lot of people, that
place, a place full of people

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.050
that they can count on.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:00.380
It can also be a place
for meditation and prayer,

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.600
a place for introspection,
and for gratitude.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.870
And I think that's when
religion can make you happy.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.150
I think when religion
can make you unhappy

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.970
is if it stifles natural
sources of happiness.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.530
If it stifles ambition, and
it says you can't do this,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:14.900
you can't do that.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:25.940
If it's a microphone for
oppression or for judgment,

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.190
I think that's what religion
can make you unhappy.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.380
That's about as
politically correct

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.170
a response I can give
to that question.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:39.420
I think the second question,
regarding ambition--

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.800
my ambition-- my
ambition is to visit

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.040
every country in the world and
continue to study happiness.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.600
I want to understand and try
to help in countries where

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.120
happiness isn't a priority
or is such a distant thought

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.940
that it takes a distant
priority to survival.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.930
So I think even for people
in desperate situations,

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.540
there are ways that they can
increase their happiness, which

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.740
in turn creates
improved [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.980
So that's part of my
ambition, travel the world,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.960
continue traveling the world.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.080
Continue writing--
I have a second book

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.620
in the works with a new wording
on top of it called MESH.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.730
It's based on my MESH platform--
meditation, exercise, sleep,

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.620
and hydration.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.310
And it's going to
be called MESH,

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.670
how to take better
care of your brain.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:34.690
And continue writing and
helping people in any way

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:41.290
that I find I can do that most
efficiently, most efficiently,

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:46.790
over the next as long as I can
speak for the next 50 years,

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.108
anyway I can find to help.

00:44:48.108 --> 00:44:50.150
SPEAKER 1: Chris, how can
we follow your journey?

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.950
CHRIS BUTSCH: Sure.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:55.000
So I just got an Instagram.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.390
I created it in the
airport on the way here.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.045
I'm not joking.

00:44:59.045 --> 00:45:00.670
So if you want to be
my 27th follower--

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:03.468
--that looks so cool.

00:45:03.468 --> 00:45:04.510
That's my Instagram name.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.100
I promise to post on it.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.180
That's my site.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.127
And otherwise, if you'd
like a copy of the book,

00:45:10.127 --> 00:45:11.710
we're selling them
in the back corner.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:12.710
I see Andrew back there.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.950
I'll also be back
there signing books.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.370
And just be grateful.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.680
Just pass along anything that
you've found valuable today,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.820
just pass it along to your
friends, family and people

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.740
you find in your life that
[INAUDIBLE] happiness.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.010
Maybe, if we have time
for one more question,

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.550
this would help me to help other
people-- what did you guys find

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.530
valuable in today's talk?

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:36.940
What's your number one takeaway?

00:45:48.172 --> 00:45:50.130
AUDIENCE: I think that
frameworks in particular

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.340
are really helpful.

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.250
It might just be,
like, the nature

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.190
of most Googlers
and our OCDness,

00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:01.000
but usually I think those
frameworks are really helpful.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.460
They're easy to follow
and very catchy.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.500
So those were my main takeaways.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500
CHRIS BUTSCH: Thank you.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.920
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so
much, Chris, for coming.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.753
Let's give a big round
of applause to Chris.

00:46:13.753 --> 00:46:16.330
[APPLAUSE]
