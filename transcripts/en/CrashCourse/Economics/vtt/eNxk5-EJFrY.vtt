Adriene: Hi, I'm Adriene Hill -

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.400
Jacob: And I'm Jacob Clifford, and this is Crash Course Economics. Today we're gonna talk about a lot of stuff.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.490
Adriene: Everything from blundering planned
economies to heartless free markets from price

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.030
gougers to indolent apparatchiks. But it's
not all bad news. We're going to learn that

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.010
price signals indicate skinny jeans are on
the way out.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:27.840
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.400
Adriene: We've talked about the difference
between free market economies, where supply

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.460
and demand determine what gets produced, and
centrally planned economies, where government

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.540
agencies decide what gets produced. Today
we're gonna expand on that, and discuss why

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.420
competitive markets have been more successful
at providing most of the things people want.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.500
Central planning has some upsides. Everyone
who wants a job has a job, and production

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.489
aims to meet an idealized version of society's
collective goals. But the reality of it has

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.880
been less ideal for consumers in those societies.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.739
In the Soviet Union, central planners were
focused on producing heavy equipment and military

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.850
hardware. There were shortages of consumer
goods, like soap, sugar and electronics. It

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.400
turns out that people care more about smartphones
and good coffee than they care about tractors.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.040
And so countries like China and Cuba have
moved away from large-scale central planning.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.460
Jacob: The problem with central planning is
that it's inefficient. Now, when economists

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.580
talk about efficiency, they're talking about
a couple different types of efficiency that's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460
different than the efficiency that you might
know.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.250
The first is productive efficiency: the idea
that products are being made at their lowest

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.700
possible cost. This means that there are no
wasted resources and that raw materials, workers,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.110
and machines are being used to their fullest
potential.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.040
Central planners in general, aren't that focused
on cost. But in the free market an individual

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.630
business owner has an incentive not to be
wasteful because they want to maximize profit.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.270
In the words of Milton Friedman; "Nobody spends
somebody else's money as carefully as
he spends his own."

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.740
The second type of efficiency is called allocative
efficiency This means that the things we're

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.930
producing are the things that consumers actually
want. In other words, our scarce resources

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.970
are being allocated towards the things we
value.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.689
Let's say a company is producing only skinny
jeans, now if they're not hiring too many

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.190
workers and if they're not ending up with
a bunch of extra materials they're producing

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.970
at the lowest possible cost and that's productively
efficient. The problem is they only make skinny

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.450
jeans. Even though the company might be productively
efficient they're probably not allocatively

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.450
efficient. Consumers don't want only skinny
jeans some want boot cuts. Central planners

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.260
are less likely to be allocatively efficient because
they have a harder feedback about what people want.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.319
Adriene: Free market producers of consumer
goods collect a lot of data about consumer

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.069
preferences through stuff like market research.
But they can also learn a lot about consumer's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.129
wants by looking at prices. Economists call
these price signals. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.001
Okay, if people are paying high prices for
skinny jeans, it tells producers "Society

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:51.060
wants more skinny jeans, start making them."
If no one wants skinny jeans, producers start

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.760
making something else instead.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.239
Here's another example: tablet computers weren't
really popular until apple introduced the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.709
iPad. After that, boom! The market exploded.
In fact, I know about 11% of you are watching

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.800
this video on a tablet right now. Because I can see
you. And I can't believe you're still wearing skinny jeans.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.379
When Google, Samsung, and Microsoft saw Apple
selling millions of iPads at $500 and up,

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.989
they had an incentive to jump into the market.
Price signals not only tell producers what

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.110
to make, but they also help distribute tablets
to the people that value them the most.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.069
For example: if someone's grandma doesn't
really want a tablet and she was only willing

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.459
to pay $20 for one, she doesn't get it. Unless
her grandkids drag her into the 21st century,

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.220
by giving her one for Christmas. Some economists
love price signals so much that they argue

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.860
against the tradition of giving gifts. This
argument was popularized by economist Joel

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.050
Waldfogel who argued that gift giving is inefficient.
From a macroeconomic point of view, holiday

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.060
shopping boosts consumer spending, GDP, and
employment. But, if too many people are purchasing

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.810
items that the end consumers don't value,
then resources are being wasted.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.260
Of course, this analysis doesn't factor in
other implicit benefits of gift giving Like

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.400
fostering love and affection among family
and friends. But the fact remains: The ideal

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.939
gift in terms of efficiency is cash. Heart-warming
cash.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.579
Thanks Thought Bubble. Theoretically, in a
free market, producers cannot make themselves

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.699
better off without making consumers better
off. If a company makes too many units of

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.050
a product or just undesirable stuff, They'll
have to adapt quickly, or else it will go

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.750
out of business. Competition between businesses
keeps prices and quality up. This is our old

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.150
buddy Adam Smith's invisible hand.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.580
It's important to take a step back here and
point out that we're not saying that free

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:49.469
markets are always good and that government
involvement is always bad. Most economists

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.680
recognize that markets aren't perfect and
they often fail to meet society's needs. In

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.639
these cases, economists encourage the government
to either regulate or take direct control

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.249
of markets to improve social welfare.

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.189
In the United States, which is often mistaken
for a free market economy, it turns out just

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.979
about everything is regulated. For example,
FDA regulations reject any wheat that contains

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.639
nine milligrams or more rodent excreta pellets
and/or pellet fragments per kilogram. And

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.259
the government directly controls the markets
for national defense and public education.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.800
The field of public economics analyzes this
very thing.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.680
Now I love rodent excrement and public education
as much as the next girl But let's get back

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.960
to markets and the role that prices play in
determining how we use our limited resources.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.889
So price signals help us use our resources
efficiently, but that doesn't mean that everyone

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.199
agrees that they are always right or just.
Take price gouging.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.550
Price gouging happens when sellers raise prices
for essential items like food, water, or gasoline.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.679
When there's something like an emergency.
Some argue that this practice exploits consumers

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:03.300
and as an example of the cruelty of markets.
In the US, anti-price gouging laws have been

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.279
enacted in 34 states. But many economists
say that these laws promote inefficiency and

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.939
actually make the problem worse. They argue
that allowing prices to increase in times

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.909
of crisis encourages others outside the disaster
zone to haul in and sell essential goods.

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.559
If prices aren't allowed to increase, then
there's less of an incentive to bring this

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:27.599
stuff in. Furthermore, higher prices for things
like batteries, sleeping bags, and generators

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.210
mean that people who don't really need them
won't buy them, making them more available

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.210
to people who do. Now it might not always
be government laws that limit price gouging.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.020
It may be the desire to earn profit that actually
keeps prices down.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.279
It's clear that businesses can earn a ton
of profit in the short run by price gouging,

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.959
but what happens in the long run? Consumers
are likely to remember how they were treated.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.559
This is part of the reason some businesses
like Walmart has an emergency operation center

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:00.319
and an in-house meteorologist to interpret
weather patterns. This allows them to have

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.949
goods like water and batteries and stock when
they're needed.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.889
Not only is this profitable, it's also a pretty
good public relations move. In fact, in some

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:14.899
cases like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, private
businesses were quicker to provide disaster

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:19.629
relief than government agencies. A different
example of how the price system is perceived

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:24.800
as unjust is below-cost pricing. Sometimes
called predatory pricing. This is the idea

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.029
that a business can drive out competitors
by charging lower prices even at a short term

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:35.729
loss. Competitors that can't sustain such
low prices will be forced out of the market,

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.709
giving the surviving businesses market share
and the ability to raise prices.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:44.140
Let's talk about Walmart again. Walmart has
been the target of numerous predatory pricing

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:48.979
lawsuits. Their size allows them to squeeze
distributors and sell products at very low

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:54.759
prices. Although lots of consumers like these
low prices, it's bad for competitors. Especially

00:07:54.759 --> 00:08:00.019
small mom and pop stores, who are sometimes
pushed out of the market. But is it predatory pricing?

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:04.729
In the US, the courts have said it's not.
the federal trade commission's website states,

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:10.789
"Although the FTC exampines claims of predatory
pricing carefully, courts, including the Supreme

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:16.429
Court, have been skeptical of such claims."
So predatory pricing lawsuits are common,

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:22.300
but very rarely successful in the US. In Germany,
Walmart faced the same sort of accusations

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.680
in 2000 and was ordered to raise some of its prices.
The company ended up leaving Germany in 2006.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.300
Predatory pricing is difficult and risky.
When a business successfully eliminates their

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:38.060
competitors by selling products at a loss,
they're eventually gonna need to increase

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.050
their prices above the market price to make
up for those losses. In the short run, consumers

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.500
would have to pay more. But eventually, other
businesses would be attracted by the higher

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.560
prices and enter the market. The end result
is that there's no guarantee that predatory

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.610
pricing is worth it in the long run.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.800
Jacob: There's tons of examples of corporate
greed, inequality, and disregard for the environment

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.079
that make people wonder if markets are evil.
And they are. Thanks for watching! We'll see

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:07.660
you next week! [endscreen music plays, stops]
Now, there are some examples of socially conscious

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.020
companies that make an effort to protect the
environment and help the disadvantaged.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.400
Capitalism, with its focus on prices rather
than fairness is often characterized as the

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:21.230
opposite of altruism. But the two can, and
do coexist. But here's the big takeaway: Capitalism,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.240
with its system of price signals, is basically
crowdfunding. We collectively choose what

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.379
we want and how we want it made when we spend
our money. After all, companies can't force

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:33.430
you to buy their stuff, they have to earn
your money. Now if you want to see real changes

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.129
in the world, don't just complain that corporations
are greedy; expect more from them.

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:41.160
You also need to expect more from ourselves.
If you disagree with the way a retailer treats

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.740
its workers, then don't buy from them. Even if they do
have the lowest prices and convenient delivery options

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:51.250
Adriene: If we as consumers want our purchases
to have a positive impact, it's on us to seek

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.410
out companies that try to improve the world.
This might mean paying more for the stuff

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:01.550
we buy or it might mean buying less stuff.
A market based society still has shared social

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.240
goals. They just don't come from a central
planner. Sure, some of our social priorities

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.680
come from governments, but they also come
from each of us and the decisions we make

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.579
about how to spend our time, and energy, and
money.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:17.209
It's also worth remembering that it's a luxury
to have these discussions. For many, many

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:22.229
people around the world who live in poverty
and have trouble affording the basic necessities of

00:10:22.229 --> 00:10:29.109
life, paying a higher price, based on conscience isn't an
option. Thanks for watching! We'll see you next week.
