[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.250
PRASAD SETTY: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.200
I'm delighted to welcome
Jacqueline Novogratz, CEO

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200
and founder of Acumen,
into Google today.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000
And in today's
conversation we're

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.040
going to discuss a
whole bunch of topics,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.410
but primarily one that I
think Jacqueline is really

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.950
focused on currently, which
is around model leadership.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.700
So in the 16 years
that Acumen has

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.512
been around, they've funded
almost 100 companies,

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:32.470
more than $100 million.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.890
They have positively impacted
more than 200 million people

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.100
around the world in some of
the poorest parts of the world.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.590
And so I have been
personally involved

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.650
with Acumen myself
for several years now

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.460
and I've always been amazed
by the thinking and the vision

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.300
that Acumen has had in dealing
with some of the key issues

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.490
that we all see affecting
the world around us.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.080
And so I've been proud to
be a part of this journey

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.440
and a proud supporter of
Acumen all of these years.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.467
And with that welcome to Google.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:09.800
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ: Thank you.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.300
Thanks.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.259
And thanks for all
you've done for Acumen.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.300
PRASAD SETTY: Absolutely.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.920
Jacqueline, I thought I'd start
off not by too much of dwelling

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.530
on the past, but
now that you have

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.890
been on this journey
for 16 years with Acumen

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.990
and certainly your own roots in
the social sector [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.020
well before that, tell us what
are you proudest of Acumen

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.330
having accomplished to date?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.070
And what are some
of the learnings

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.820
from this journey that when
we talk about the future,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.622
looking through learnings and
how they apply to the future?

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:47.330
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
Great big question.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.080
PRASAD SETTY: Yes.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.310
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
Probably the biggest--

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.130
when we started Acumen,
it was clear to us

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.260
that markets alone
were not going

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.790
to solve the
problems of poverty,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.515
nor was charity by itself.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.890
And so we had this idea, as
you know, of patient capital.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.020
That we would take
philanthropy and we

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.850
would invest in
intrepid entrepreneurs

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.870
for the long term, 10, 12
years to disrupt systems.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.940
And 16 years later,
often credited

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.040
as being one of the pioneers
of the impact investing sector,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.310
I would say what
makes us still feel

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
proudest is this recognition
that you can use capital

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.190
as a means to solving problems.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.820
We get in trouble if we see
it as an end in and of itself.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.970
But if you think about it
as a means you can actually

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.190
build individual companies
that can change systems,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.670
whether it is taking
on the broken ambulance

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.140
industry in India and now
having a company with 3,500

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.120
ambulances and 8,000 employees,
has taken 6 million people

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.930
to hospital.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.480
Or Delight which we
were talking about which

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.660
is two guys out of
Stanford Business

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.590
School with a solar
torch and a dream

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.350
to eradicate kerosene
10 years later

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.790
has brought light
and electricity

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.120
to 72 million people
around the world.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.520
These companies wouldn't
have happened if we

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660
had let business be business.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.340
It required some very
thoughtful philanthropists

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.140
to say, take this money,
invest, give these entrepreneurs

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.650
the time to experiment,
to fail, to try again.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.910
And lo and behold, we have seen,
as you said, 200 million people

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.360
get access to services
and new models for how

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.240
we solve problems of
poverty for the world.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.980
PRASAD SETTY: And as you
think about then the learnings

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.810
from this journey that
influence how you're are

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.289
thinking about the future,
what stands out for you?

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.830
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
So in many ways

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.220
we grew up against the global
backdrop of the last 15,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.780
16 years.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.900
If you think about it, when
Acumen was started in 2001

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.090
the world was a very
different place.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.520
Whether you're talking
about cell phone technology,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.079
post-9/11 versus pre-9/11
and the lack of trust around

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.579
the world, the inequality that
we're seeing as well as real

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.190
questions of capitalism
that are coming on.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.830
So in many ways Acumen has
moved from simply focusing

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.630
on entrepreneurs that
are trying to solve

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.500
specific problems
of poverty, Prasad,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.380
to where we fit into
building an ecosystem that

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.340
can take on the issues
of capitalism, frankly.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.020
How do we create a more
inclusive capitalism?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.580
Not just Acumen,
but the world is

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.890
starting to see that we
must move from shareholders

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.140
to stakeholders.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.640
For us those stakeholders
have to include the poor

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.710
and have to include
the environment.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.470
The world is seeing that we need
a long term, not a short term

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.022
impact, which is something
that we have stood for.

00:05:02.022 --> 00:05:03.730
The world is seeing
that we have to start

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.720
with purpose before profit
rather than just do good and do

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.710
well.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.710
And that we need
to define success

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.010
more than how the rich fare
but how the poor and vulnerable

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.210
are treated.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.230
And so I think that this
drive as we've seen the world

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.950
move from interconnected
to interdependent

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.370
allows Acumen to play a very
different role on the capital

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.840
side as well as on the
kinds of entrepreneurs

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.740
and the kinds of
businesses that will

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.644
enable a more sustainable
world for all of us.

00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:41.560
PRASAD SETTY: You mentioned
quite a few things

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.710
that I'd love for us to
explore in this conversation,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.850
be the new way of
thinking about capitalism,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.530
thinking about
leadership itself,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800
thinking more the
role of technology

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.830
and the connected society
that we have today play in.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.570
So I'd love to explore
each of those with you.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.820
If we start off with the broader
macro trends as you mentioned,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.360
you do see a lot of changes
in the political nature

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.590
around the world, and the
forces of globalization

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.290
that were very prominent
over the last 20 years

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.830
as well as capitalism
being really prominent.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.610
How do you see that
evolving, and what

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.990
role do you think Acumen and
others should be thinking about

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.672
as you think about
capitalism itself?

00:06:27.672 --> 00:06:29.630
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
Well, as you're speaking,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.930
you think about how many
governments are actually

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.280
pulling inward?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.340
Rather than this is a moment
where we need to reach outward,

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.680
which is something that
Google really represents.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.430
The world I get to see
and Acumen gets to see

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.030
is the next generation that
is looking for new rules

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.540
altogether.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.710
There's so much faith and trust
lost in the big institution.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.990
What's so thrilling to me is
to see these entrepreneurs that

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.590
are using more what we
would call moral imagination

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.680
to build new systems.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.121
So two examples,
one from Colombia,

00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:04.245
one from the United States.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.690
If you look at coffee
or cocoa for chocolate,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.310
these are industries
that really were

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.060
born in slavery and colonialism
and the economics of them

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.930
have not changed all
that dramatically.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.080
If you think about
chocolate alone,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.360
there are 6 million cocoa
producers in the world,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.850
90% of whom make under $2 a day.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.820
On the back of that we're
supporting a $150 billion

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.530
chocolate industry.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.990
Those economics
really make no sense

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.030
if you're thinking
about the farmers

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.320
that we need to depend on.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.000
And it should be no secret or
surprise that the average cocoa

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.310
farmer's 58 years old and
most of their children

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.104
do not want to be farmers.

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.520
On the other hand,
you're starting

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.030
to see an artisinal
chocolate industry take off

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.600
where individual chocolate
bars can sell for $12, $15.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.630
So there's a new
generation of entrepreneurs

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.230
who are completely ignoring
global commodities prices when

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.830
they are negotiating
with farmers.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.430
They're understanding
the price that farmers--

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.880
or the cost to farmers
of actually producing.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.250
In many cases they're
doubling those costs,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:18.460
but providing a margin that is
not 30% better, but 200% better

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.630
than the global
commodities prices.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.630
So it's left their trade
behind and substituted it

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.020
with a radical transparency
using technology

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.679
to show the farmers the whole
value chain from what they're

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.070
paid to what these
chocolate bars are sold for

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.110
to enable communities of trust.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.770
To me that is so
incredibly hopeful

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.040
when we think about
visibility and transparency

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.900
around the products
that we want to buy,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.750
and the new generation
cares about that stuff.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.180
In the United States,
everybody talks

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.230
about workforce development,
certainly in Silicon Valley,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.860
as we should.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.110
On the other hand,
we're not doing the job

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.050
that we should be doing in terms
of getting diverse communities

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.540
into coding jobs, for instance.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.120
We've invested in a company
called Learner's Guild just

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.690
here in San Francisco
that understands

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.530
that low income communities,
particularly of color,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.670
often have huge stress,
families, jobs that pay

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.100
$15,000, $20,000 a year.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.070
It's impossible to go to
a good coding boot camp

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.110
and stay in your job and
take care of your family

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.400
so that you can get the job.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.250
So what these guys have
done is create a system

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.690
where they will give you a
10 month stipend so that you

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.180
can focus fully
on the boot camp,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.660
at the end of which you have to
pay it back but only once you

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.680
start earning $50,000 a year.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.260
So there's a risk sharing.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.760
The first batch
who just graduated,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.880
the average salary is $81,000
that these guys are getting.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.010
And they came in at an
average salary of $23,000.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.630
So we can do this, but it's
not traditional capital

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.680
that will enable that because
there is risk at every level.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.630
Then Acumen can play a role.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.200
Because what we're focused on
is solving the problem, right?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.810
Not just making money.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.600
What you learn is that
companies like Google

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.460
and others in Silicon Valley
have requirements for college

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.690
degrees because of h-1 visas.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.192
So all of this stuff is
interconnected again.

00:10:31.192 --> 00:10:33.400
Many of these communities
don't have college degrees.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.650
So then we can intermediate
and say, wait guys,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.685
to make this system work
we've got to change that.

00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.060
And that's the
way we're starting

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.140
to think about building an
entrepreneurial ecosystem that

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.720
will enable these
companies to change

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.790
the way the world tackles
poverty, essentially.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.470
PRASAD SETTY: Fascinating.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.910
As you think about
the ecosystem,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.540
one part of thinking
about these problems,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.610
thinking about the entire
value chain, as you said,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.500
then there was a piece
about just the people

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.240
that you're trying to find
and the leadership itself.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.010
You've been talking a lot
about moral leadership.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.070
Can you tell us what that
means in your own mind?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.820
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
Yeah, and again it's

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.660
this recognition that in
going from an interconnected

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.460
to an interdependent
world we will rise

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.170
and we will fall together.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.430
And that we can no longer
make all of our decisions

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.440
according to a single metric.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.830
And yet it's a lot more
nuanced and complicated

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.490
when you are making decisions
based on multiple metrics,

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.410
based on multiple stakeholders.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.750
It necessitates
navigating the gray.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.510
So when we think about the
qualities of a moral leader

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.780
versus just someone
who can get stuff done

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.270
and is focused
simply on efficiency,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.390
they are individuals
that have what

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.430
we call a moral
imagination, or the ability

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.860
to have the audacity to imagine
the future and what could be,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.120
but also the humility to
recognize the world as it is.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.410
They are individuals who
see capital, as I said,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.220
as something that we control
rather than let it control us.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.042
That see investment as
a means not as an end.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:12.000
Something that we don't
think about enough when

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.440
we talk about
moral leadership is

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.700
grit, resilience,
persistence, courage

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.530
to fight the status quo.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.800
What we've learned is that if
you want to build something new

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.140
you are going to be
fighting a system that

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.510
does not want to change.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.660
And that system is full of
bureaucracy, corruption,

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.190
and probably the worst
of all is complacency.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.610
So do you have what it takes--

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.110
the determination,
the persistence?

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.190
So we are increasingly looking
for that in every entrepreneur

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.330
that we invest in as well as
the fellows that we're finding.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.300
Because that will tell
us whether their ideas

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.275
are actually going to take off.

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:52.650
Probably just like
you at Google,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.490
we've learned that
great ideas come and go,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.460
but give us the leader
who have what it takes

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.540
and to do it
ethically in a world

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.550
where so many
systems are broken.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.470
PRASAD SETTY: What's
been your experience,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.250
Jacqueline, as you think about
developing this next generation

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.360
of leaders?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.090
Have you been able to
find them, have you

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.460
been able to scale how
they actually learn,

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.800
and grow, and become
these kinds of role models

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.300
for the rest of the world?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.040
Any examples, anything from
your experience you can share?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.370
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ: Yeah.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.470
In addition to investing
in the 100 companies,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.180
we've invested in about 400
fellows across 32 countries.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:40.950
And you know, we've said it
before that talent is is fully

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.390
distributed across the world.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:49.470
And daily I am blown
away by the capabilities

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:56.730
of these individuals who really
need access, capital, networks.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.200
And so, yes, we're seeing
enormous change happening

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.060
at the company
level, whether it's

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.190
someone like [? Gitri ?] who
runs a company called LaborNet

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.030
in India, which a number
of Googlers have helped

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.020
and volunteered for.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.330
But they've
essentially recognized

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.160
that education in a
traditional school room

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.860
is not going to be the answer
to the world's problems,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.630
particularly in a country like
India where 85% of the country

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.960
has not gone past 10th grade.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.230
And so they go into
construction sites,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.460
work with Muslim
communities doing

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.460
beauty salons, leather tanning.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:44.490
And they provide workforce
development training,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.790
ethical training, safety
training, and then

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.046
cream those who are clear
learners to help them

00:14:51.046 --> 00:14:52.170
get better and better jobs.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.260
And they've already trained
half a million people.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.390
So some of these companies
are really working at scale.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.290
To individuals who are
just getting started,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.570
[NON-ENGLISH] is
a Pakistani firm.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.320
Small village in rural Punjab
couple of hours outside

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.530
of Lahore, Pakistan, who
works with local cobblers

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.270
making beautiful shoes
but never had a market.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.480
He worked with other
fellows across Pakistan

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.770
to redesign his shoes,
rebrand his company,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:29.510
now called Markhor, create
a Kickstarter campaign, used

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.430
our network to get
those ideas out

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.680
into the greater world, raised
$115,000 on Kickstarter,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.080
now is in the Y
Combinator and is

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.480
on his way to building
a company that

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.660
provides good quality visible
jobs to village men and women

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.920
and creates an export
product for Pakistan

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.240
that the country
should be proud of.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.220
We're seeing this kind
of innovation happening

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.110
in the highest and lowest
communities of India and Saudi

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.400
Arabia--

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.166
across the world, actually.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.540
PRASAD SETTY: Both
these examples

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.220
show the power of connection.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.960
How are you thinking
about technology

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.780
as an enabler of these
kinds of connections,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.552
and what could that possibly
do for us in the future?

00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:22.760
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ: Well
one, we get so many emails

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.870
from young people who want to
start companies themselves.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.970
And two, every time we
launch a fellows program,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.660
we will get over 1,000
applications for 10, 20 spots.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.660
So we started to ask
ourselves essentially this,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.980
could we put the
courses that we're

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.900
training our entrepreneurs
and our fellows

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.230
in, could we put them online,
and would anybody take them?

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.270
And so looked at,
what are the courses

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.440
that people care most about?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.427
Human centered design,
lean startup, storytelling,

00:16:52.427 --> 00:16:54.260
that you can't really
be an effective leader

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.910
if you can't tell a story.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.090
And we've now put about
30 courses up online

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.300
and we've seen half
a million sign ups.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.829
And 300,000 people taking
these six to eight week

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.930
courses where they have to
come together in groups.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.900
And out of these courses
what's been so thrilling

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.050
is we're seeing
companies being built

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.579
using the same metrics
of moral leadership,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.079
whether it's Kidogo--

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.210
a Canadian and an
American who met

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.180
online, moved to Nairobi to
start a nursery, essentially,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.800
for low income little kids,
and have now turning it

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.160
into a franchise and
are really growing.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.140
Or I just got a note
from an Indonesian named

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.460
[? Irman ?] who took 19
courses, started a company

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.470
to work with smallholders
and really break

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.960
a lot of the barriers
that smallholders

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.820
deal with in Indonesia.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.390
He's got about 300 employees and
is ready for a series B that--

00:17:53.390 --> 00:18:00.530
We're starting to see this
entrepreneurial imagination

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.160
combined with
dedication translate

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.560
into real change for the world.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.910
Can you then build a
community of individuals

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.420
who are daring to use the
skills and the attributes

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.270
they have to solve big
problems in the world?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.840
Because that's what we need.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:25.700
We need a movement right now as
we see so much that is cynical,

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.700
lacking trust, because
it lacks trustworthiness,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.540
a huge divide between
rich and poor,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.190
the destruction of so
much of our physical

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.980
and human environment.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.280
We need a counter
movement that says no.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.740
What this moment
in history offers

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.560
through our interdependence is
an opportunity like humanity

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.770
has never had in history that we
can work across lines to create

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.690
the new kinds of companies,
the new institutions that

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.330
allow us to bring our best
selves to one another.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.090
And what the
ecosystem that we're

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.780
seeing through the fellows, the
companies that we've invested,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.480
the online community is
showing is just that.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.160
That this is a possibility
and it's something

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.250
that we've got to double
down on and really grow.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.220
This movement for moral
leadership, frankly,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.820
and a more inclusive
type of capitalism

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.677
that is measured by the
amount of human energy

00:19:25.677 --> 00:19:28.010
we release in the world, the
amount of human flourishing

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.120
and dignity, not just how
much money we make, or even

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.380
how much money we give away.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.380
PRASAD SETTY: Thank you.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:42.040
That was very inspiring, was
very, very much in synchrony

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.980
the kinds of messages that
Google and Googlers love

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.110
to hear about.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.350
And we try to do that in our
own environment out here.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.330
The partnership between
Acumen and Google

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.660
goes a long way certainly, both
with financial funding as well

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.940
as office locations and so on.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.440
And I know that a
bunch of Googlers

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.480
have also worked on
some of these projects,

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.690
including working with
LaborNet, et cetera.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.060
What message would you
have for other Googlers who

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.710
are thinking about,
how can I work in

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.280
either the social
services sector, partner

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.450
with Acumen itself, et cetera?

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.385
Anything that you
would like to share?

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:21.010
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
And you're right,

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.760
Google has been a
critical party to Acumen

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.080
from the very beginning.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:33.370
2006 Google supported us
with a significant grant

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.970
to really help put
Acumen on the map.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.750
At that time we also
were given amazing office

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.000
space in New York City
that lasted nine years.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.630
And for that we are
eternally grateful.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.340
So many nonprofits have to sit
away at a cubbyhole somewhere.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.400
And having a great location
with Google right upstairs

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.920
enabled a real relationship.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.960
And we have a huge debt
to many of the Googlers--

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.690
Craig and Kirsten [INAUDIBLE]
who've become real partners

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.610
to us, Doug Brody, others, you--

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.590
that really supported us
in concrete as well as

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.670
inspirational ways that you
probably don't even know.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.920
And then in 2010 Google
gave us $2 million

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:29.920
in philanthropy to do this
early stage work in solar.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.890
At that point we
were taking big bets

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.510
in off grid solar where very
little was actually known.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.660
There was no investment,
particularly in Africa.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.180
Most people relied
on kerosene, take

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.580
buying little bits
of kerosene every day

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.870
by which they would read at
night with a lot of smoke

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.950
and cook.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.070
And trying to
convert people seemed

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.750
like it should be easy, right?

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.380
But the truth is, you have
no trust, you have no income,

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.780
you have no financing mechanism.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.140
And you've never
really seen solar work.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.060
And it takes a long time
to go from a push market

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.470
to a pull market.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.970
And over 10 years we
invested about $20 million

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.320
of philanthropic capital
in these companies.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.030
That taught us how
people make decisions,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.120
how to market in a way
that people could hear.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.030
It gave time for mobile
banking to enable the financing

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.570
mechanism.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.110
We built brand recognition,
particularly Delight.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.870
Googlers helped in
many different aspects

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.670
of that building
of a value chain

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.560
that had not existed before.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.470
So much so that we were able
to take the Google money,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.530
leverage it 10 times with
the $20 million invested,

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.030
and now are raising
a $100 million

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.680
for-profit initiative so that
we can prove to government

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.620
that off-grid solar is faster,
cheaper, and more effective

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.090
than extending the grid.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:57.160
It takes $1,500 to get one
household connected to a grid--

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.770
and as they say,
nine years to never.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.190
And for $170 people can
buy a 10 watt system--

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.790
three lights, a
radio, a flashlight,

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.750
a cell phone charger--

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.240
and their life changes
overnight because of what

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.880
they have done themselves.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.190
That is where dignity
gets to start.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.200
And we think Africa
can leapfrog the grid

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.504
just like it did with the cell
phones leapfrogging, landlines.

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:23.920
Googlers helped
there financially.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.030
They helped in terms of
design, thinking about some

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.970
of the technology here.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.860
When you go to the volunteer
work that you talked about,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.779
many of our companies have
tech platforms for the work

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:41.320
that they do.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.860
Whether it's a bank
in rural Pakistan

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.320
that has 500,000
farmers and is now

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.440
converting to mobile
banking, or LaborNet

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.370
which I was talking about
before, or Esoko, which

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.450
is a platform for
smallholder farmers based

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.310
out of Ghana and now
Kenya to give farmers

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.680
market information,
Google helped actually

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.750
take that platform and,
one, both proposed a million

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.710
dollar grant which the company
got, as well as helped design

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:16.750
a platform for mobile banking
and the distribution of

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.800
implements.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.360
That's a major give
for Googlers who

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.510
went over and actually spent
time in country with companies.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.060
So there's real
opportunity there.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.767
There are 400 fellows that are
requiring different kinds of--

00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:34.600
I don't even necessarily
want say mentoring,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.270
because so much of them
are such great leaders.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.960
But certainly technical
expertise as well as access

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.230
to networks and ideas.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.910
There's real opportunity
there, there's

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.060
opportunities to contribute
to this kind of work

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.710
in the building
of this ecosystem.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.280
We would love to see
co-creation of courses

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.920
I know that you
have online courses,

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.200
and some of our most
successful courses

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.850
have been co-created,
whether it's

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.890
with Fossil, the company, or IDO
on the human centered design.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.690
And so I think that there's
a myriad number of ways

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:16.360
for Googlers to interact with
Acumen through the technology,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.760
through the know-how,
through the networking,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.170
through financial support.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.170
PRASAD SETTY: Fantastic.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.490
We look forward to keeping those
connections strong with Acumen

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.430
as we explore the
future together.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.520
As I mentioned earlier
on, certainly our paths

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.720
are intertwined.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.610
There's a lot that
we collectively

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.530
believe in both
Acumen as well as

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.750
Google in terms of being a
positive force for the world

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:43.550
and using technology to address
a whole bunch of problems that

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.810
have perhaps been
neglected over time,

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.610
thinking about the
use of data which

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.520
I know that's a a lot of work
that you folks are doing,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.430
and just getting a lot more
rigorous about measurement

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.920
of impact in the social sector.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.330
So certainly we look forward to
continuing on that partnership.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.290
One of the other common things
that is both of interest

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.200
to you as well as
to us is this notion

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.850
of diversity and inclusion.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.160
That is a big topic
certainly at Google,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.980
certainly all over Silicon
Valley and the technology

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.880
industry.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.220
And I was especially struck
by our earlier conversation

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.800
where you talked about how
you're getting groups together

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.530
of people in this attempt
to build a community, people

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.500
who would perhaps not
engage, or ever meet,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.200
or talk to each other.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.510
Can you share with us both
your experiences there,

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.820
as well as your
emerging thoughts

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.432
on how do you get this
global community together?

00:26:43.432 --> 00:26:44.890
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ:
Thanks, yeah.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.889
This is something that's
keeping me up at night,

00:26:46.889 --> 00:26:49.540
and I know it's
important to Google.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.060
And particular when you look
at Google Translate as well

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.610
as a way that we can have
greater access to one another,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.790
and I think that that's
actually a fifth way

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:03.760
that we could interact with
Googlers because our community

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.690
is so diverse.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.740
And in fact, in one
community [? in Buxon ?]

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.860
there are 73 languages, and
many of them are getting lost.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:16.720
How could Google help to
keep those not just claimed

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.560
and reclaimed, but alive?

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.250
And so what we started
to do 10 years ago

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.620
with the global fellows was
to bring together people

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.316
across lines of difference.

00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:29.690
We realized that
at global level,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:34.690
so often we end up with
people who are actually

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.750
more like each other than
sometimes they are low income

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.760
people in our own countries.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.480
And that if we really
wanted to get to diversity

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.955
we had to have the courage
that you talked about

00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:50.050
of cutting across all of
these different lines that

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.340
keep us separated.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.720
Religion, class, ethnicity,
ideology, geography.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.920
And so whether-- we've started
in three regions, Pakistan,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.760
India, and East Africa.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.120
And we find amazing
leaders across all sectors,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.740
and all of these
different lines.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.910
If you take a country like
India, which is so vast,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.670
you have some young
Indians that have

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.370
gone to the best
schools in the world

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.030
and have graduated at
the top of their class

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.863
and want to use those
skills to make change.

00:28:20.863 --> 00:28:26.290
Suhani Mohan, number
one at the IIT Mumbai.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.650
Then you went to
investment banking,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.230
and after a few
years thought, I'm

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.910
among the most educated
people on the planet,

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.370
and yet I go to the villages
and women have no access

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.280
to even basic health hygiene.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:46.260
And so she started a feminine
hygiene company a few years ago

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.070
and just sold her millionth
biodegradable sanitary pad.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.037
And is using the network
of fellows to do this.

00:28:55.037 --> 00:28:56.620
To do that effectively,
she's actually

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.780
got to understand how people
in far flung villages who

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.280
don't speak her language, who
have a different religion, who

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.300
are in some cases deeply
conservative, how they think,

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.490
how they respond.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.310
And so our fellows
program includes people

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.550
from those villages, but
who are incredible leaders

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.910
in their own right.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.970
And we bring them together and
both hold up a mirror to them,

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.130
where do you get
in your own way?

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.370
What is your identity?

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.860
How do you think through it?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.020
We use literature
as a springboard

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:37.570
into conversation, using moral
leaders as that springboard.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.850
Regardless of where they
come from in the world

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.040
they will read the
same curriculum.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.420
Everyone from Plato and Hobbes
and Rousseau to [? Huldoon, ?]

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.990
one of the great
Islamic mathematicians

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.970
and philosophers.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.930
They read Haile Selassie,
and Chinua Achebe

00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.202
of Nigeria, Gandhi, of course
Mandela, King, Aung San Suu

00:30:00.202 --> 00:30:01.910
Kyi.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.550
And there's a pantheon
of moral leaders

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.570
who have been engaged in the
same conversation for 2,500

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.620
years.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.240
What is the nature of man?

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.850
How do we make trade offs
between the individual, which

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.230
we're seeing reigning
supreme in Silicon Valley,

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.940
and the community where many
of the places that we work

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.260
takes precedence?

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.250
How do you trade off
freedom and security

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.130
at this moment where so
many people are afraid?

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.322
How do you trade off
justice, or do you?

00:30:37.322 --> 00:30:39.530
What's the difference between
justice and generosity?

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:40.330
What's easier?

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.610
We have those kinds
of conversations,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.280
stepping back, reflecting, so
that you can both understand

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.760
more who you are and what your
values are and the principles

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.660
by which you live.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.470
Because we live in
a moment in history

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.362
where our leaders are flinging
opinion at one another.

00:30:57.362 --> 00:30:58.820
They are not standing
on principle.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.010
They are not helping us make
sense of this tumultuous time

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.210
in the world.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.570
And we can't wait
for them to do so.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.710
And so by bringing these
uncomfortable groups together

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.580
and moderating these
kinds of conversations,

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.550
not only can they learn more
about themselves and each

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.120
other, but develop the tools
to have difficult conversations

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.670
across lines of difference
and then find their tribe--

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.630
their real tribes--

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.510
in the groups that
are trying to solve

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.070
the problems of education.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.890
Regardless if they come from
a tribal village of Pakistan,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.420
or an elite school in
India, or a slum in Nairobi,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.649
or a university in Rwanda.

00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:42.190
That's a tribe
because they're trying

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.060
to solve a problem together,
or off grid energy,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.360
or health care for the poor.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.980
That for me is so
incredibly hopeful.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.120
And that goes to this idea
that we could create a citizen

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.100
movement that transcends.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.920
But we can't do it if elites
are only talking to each other.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.460
We need to bring
people who have never

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.080
been able to sit at the
table to bring those voices.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.840
We need to stop
seeing them as needy

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.600
and recognize how
needed they are.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.360
And that requires
this moral revolution.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.660
We've had the
technological revolution.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.090
I actually think
there's a yearning

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.367
for a moral revolution.

00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:28.700
We just don't know how to do it.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.840
And we're not seeing
it in our leaders.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.610
But we know that we don't
like what we're seeing.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.890
And so how do we develop
the new frameworks

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.490
within which we can
all find ourselves,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:48.520
and how do we find a
minimum set of values

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.939
that we can all sign up
for and we can all share?

00:32:52.939 --> 00:32:54.730
That actually shouldn't
be that hard to do.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.790
We can't approach
each other with fear.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:06.610
We have to have the moral
courage to start by listening.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.420
And we can't start by
trying to convince,

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.410
we have to listen in a way
that's ready to be convinced.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.460
PRASAD SETTY: Thank you.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.330
Talking about courage,
one of the things

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:27.180
that has stood out for me is
how you, as well as Acumen,

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.890
both at an individual
level, but also

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.620
at an organizational
level, constantly keep

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.805
reinventing yourselves as well.

00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:37.140
And think about
what is required,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.700
what can we learn
from the past, what

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.400
is required with the
environment that we see now?

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.650
So as you think about parting
thoughts for this group

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.970
and anyone who might see us in
the big wide world of YouTube,

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.110
what messages do
you have for us?

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.179
Where are you headed personally,
as well as for Acumen?

00:33:57.179 --> 00:33:59.220
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ: Well
you started by saying,

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.553
you know, what are the things
that you're most proud of?

00:34:01.553 --> 00:34:07.710
And as I think back to that
beginning of our conversation,

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:12.389
we didn't start Acumen to prove
that with impact investing

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.540
you could make money in
low income communities.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.270
We started Acumen because we
wanted to solve the toughest

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.250
issues of poverty.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.520
That has become a North
Star for us, a thread.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.510
That makes courage really easy.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.590
Nietzsche says that
when you know your why

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.520
you can bear almost any how.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.929
You can endure it anyhow.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.570
And so as the world
has changed, we

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:44.639
have had to change to
stay true to our mission.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.270
And that's-- on the one
hand it's courageous,

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.989
but on a much larger
hand it's thrilling.

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:54.810
Because I think that for
too long, and certainly

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.750
in my generation,
we divided the world

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.760
between the do-gooders
and the people

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.930
who wanted to make money.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.450
That world doesn't
exist anymore.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:07.170
One, if we are going to
create the world that we

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.140
are capable of creating,
we have to recognize

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.784
that every single
one of us is needed.

00:35:11.784 --> 00:35:13.200
Whether you work
in a corporation,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.991
whether you work in
government, whether you

00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:17.970
work for a nonprofit in the
civil society or a community

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.440
organization.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.700
And we've got to approach each
other from a place of building

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.676
trust, not thinking that I
have the answers and you don't.

00:35:27.676 --> 00:35:29.550
I'm in the corporate
world and I'm efficient,

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.590
and you're in the
nonprofit world

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.450
and you might have a big heart,
but you can't manage yourself

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.190
out of a shoe box.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.860
Obviously there may be
truth for individuals,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.830
but there are not truths.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.600
There's no capital-T
truth to that.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:50.070
So one is this idea of be
audacious in the problems

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.570
that we are trying to change.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.350
But then have the humility
to start where you are.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.940
Just take a step.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.740
I worry with the next
generation is there

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.000
such a focus on
perfection sometimes

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.300
that people are too
afraid to make a move?

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.740
Just make a move.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.730
And then once you take a
step, let the work teach you.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.130
Probably the second
big parting thought

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.380
would be that came
from my mentor

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.210
here in Silicon
Valley, John Gardner.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.040
In this age of
celebrity we so often

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.195
focus on being interesting.

00:36:25.195 --> 00:36:26.820
The people who make
change in the world

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.800
focus on being interested.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.600
Find out about others.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.080
Understand the problem
from their perspective.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.330
Have the courage to fail,
and then just get up

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.260
and start again.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.480
It's not the smart
people necessarily

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.360
who make the change, it's
the determined people.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.570
And then find a
community, find a tribe

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.880
that's willing to stand
with you as you stand

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.460
with the poor and the marginal.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.730
Because that can be
a lonely journey.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:59.910
It will be a lonely
journey at times.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.860
You got to be able to
find the joy that's

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.980
inside of it as well.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.180
And that doesn't
happen by yourself.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.630
That happens with the community.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.310
And what's been so
wonderful, and joyful,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:15.570
and fulfilling about partnering
with Google, and with you,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:20.280
and the team that you bring
is that, like you said,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.210
this is a journey
of kindred spirits

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:29.610
that are driven by answering
problems, not by being right.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:35.160
And if you can take that kind
of attitude for the long term,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.380
there's not a problem
we can't solve.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.920
We should be bold enough
to dare to end poverty

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.840
in our lifetimes.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.090
Not just the material
poverty, but the poverty

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.450
that's keeping us
most apart from one

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.310
another, certainly
in the United States,

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:55.200
and that is a spiritual sense
of impoverishment, of isolation,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.380
of not counting,
of being left out.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.240
And that's the one we
have to work on the most.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.310
And there is no
way to work on it

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:12.050
than to pursue lives of
purpose, of meaning, of taking

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.450
on the hardest problems
that we need to solve

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.931
and can only solve together.

00:38:16.931 --> 00:38:17.930
PRASAD SETTY: Thank you.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.090
Thank you for living
that life of purpose,

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.400
being an inspiration
to so many people

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.470
that are in the
organization, as well as

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.137
your own fellows and enlistees.

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.470
JACQUELINE NOVOGRATZ: Thank you.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.540
And thank you to Google.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.390
Truly you've been with us
every step of this journey.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.500
And I think we're at
a level and a place

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.260
right now to just go
deeper together and learn

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.350
from each other.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.830
And I look forward to that.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:42.520
All right.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.720
Thank you, Jacqueline.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.770
