00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:01.681
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:03.660
is talk about the powers of the President

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.965
of the United States,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:08.403
and we're going to broadly
divide them into two categories.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:11.648
Formal powers are those
that are explicitly listed

00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:13.883
in the United States Constitution.

00:00:13.883 --> 00:00:16.408
And we're also gonna talk
about informal powers

00:00:16.408 --> 00:00:17.426
a little bit in this video

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:19.741
and a lot more depth into future videos.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.339
The formal powers are listed in Article II

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.115
of the United States Constitution,

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:26.146
and it starts in Section 1

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:30.083
where it says the executive
Power shall be vested

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.970
in a President of the
United States of America.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.771
And this simple statement alone

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.747
has a lot of implications.

00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:38.612
As we will see,

00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:40.042
it is used as a justification

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:43.469
for many of the informal
powers of the President.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.450
The President is the executive.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.196
They run the government.

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:49.714
Congress can pass laws and set budgets.

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:51.920
The judicial branch can interpret laws

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.670
or declare them unconstitutional.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.527
But the executive power is
vested in the President.

00:00:57.527 --> 00:01:00.845
But the bulk of the powers
are listed in Section 2

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:02.012
and Section 3.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.219
So let's read this together

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.688
and let's see if we can
classify these different powers

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:09.610
as executive, legislative,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.149
foreign policy or military,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.732
or judicial powers.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.022
So Section 2 of Article II starts off with

00:01:17.022 --> 00:01:19.698
the President shall be Commander in Chief

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:22.496
of the Army and Navy of the United States,

00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:25.247
and of the Militia of the several States,

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:30.188
when called into the actual
Service of the United States.

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:32.946
So this is clearly a military power.

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.814
You have the President
of the United States

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:38.738
being in charge of the nation's military.

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:40.271
It then goes on to say

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:43.340
he may require the Opinion, in writing,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.246
of the principal Officer

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:48.088
in each of the executive Departments,

00:01:48.088 --> 00:01:51.347
upon any Subject relating to the Duties

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.828
of their respective Offices.

00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:56.285
So this is clearly an executive power

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:57.887
or an administrative power,

00:01:57.887 --> 00:01:58.940
where he can go to the head

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.449
of any of the executive
departments and say,

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.227
hey, I need your opinion on something,

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:04.880
potentially in writing.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.912
Then it goes on to say

00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:10.758
and he shall have Power to
grain Reprieves and Pardons

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:13.052
for Offenses against the United States,

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:16.367
except in Cases of Impeachment.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.700
So this is a judicial power.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.978
Grant reprieves and pardons
for federal offenses.

00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:24.061
Then we read,

00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:26.597
he shall have Power,

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:29.361
by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Senate,

00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.141
to make Treaties,

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.112
provided two thirds of the
Senators present concur.

00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:36.370
So this power to make treaties

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.567
is clearly a foreign policy power,

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.607
although it does have to
be ratified by the Senate.

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:43.440
And he shall nominate,

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.618
and by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Senate,

00:02:47.618 --> 00:02:50.137
shall appoint Ambassadors,

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:52.377
other public Ministers and Consuls,

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.844
Judges of the Supreme Court,

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:57.625
and all other Officers
of the United States,

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.792
whose appointments are not
herein otherwise provided for,

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:06.001
and which shall be established by Law.

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.649
But the Congress may by
Law vest the Appointment

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.429
of such inferior Officers,

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.635
as they think proper,

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:13.049
in the President alone,

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.326
in the Courts of Law,

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.038
or in the Heads of Departments.

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:17.588
So all of these lines here

00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:20.177
talked about the President's
power of appointment,

00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:22.708
which is why I underlined
it in the executive

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:23.982
or the administrative color,

00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:25.528
although it touches on appointments

00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:28.086
that affect these other powers.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:29.207
So, for example,

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.882
the appointment of ambassadors

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:35.831
is clearly going to have
foreign policy implications.

00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.396
And judges of the Supreme Court.

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:41.223
This could have huge
judicial implications.

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:44.723
So I will underline that in blue, as well.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.159
It then goes on to say,

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.653
and this is in relation
to the appointments

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:49.894
we just talked about,

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:52.991
the President shall have
Power to fill up all Vacancies

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.377
that may happen during
the Recess of the Senate.

00:03:56.377 --> 00:03:57.544
Because remember, it just talked about

00:03:57.544 --> 00:03:59.968
how the Senate has to
confirm appointments.

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:01.596
But the President does have the power

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:04.368
to fill up vacancies while
the Senate is in recess,

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:05.581
while they're not in session,

00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:06.940
by granting Commissions

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.267
which shall expire at the
End of their next Session.

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.317
And then in Section 3, we read,

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:15.480
he, the President,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.684
although it could be a she,

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:19.396
shall from time to time
give to the Congress

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:22.464
Information of the State of the Union,

00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:26.170
and recommend to their
Consideration such Measures

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.759
as he or she shall judge
necessary and expedient.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.675
He may, on extraordinary Occasions,

00:04:33.675 --> 00:04:35.191
convene both Houses,

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.499
or either of them,

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.300
and in Case of Disagreement between them,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.762
with Respect to the Time of Adjournment,

00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:45.929
he may adjourn them to such
Time as he shall think proper.

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:48.946
So these are all ways,

00:04:48.946 --> 00:04:51.374
these are all powers
that the President has

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.451
in the legislative process.

00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:55.577
And then it goes back to foreign policy.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.347
He shall receive Ambassadors

00:04:57.347 --> 00:04:59.195
and other public ministers.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.695
He shall take care

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:04.359
that the laws be faithfully executed

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.759
and shall Commission all the
Officers of the United States.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.592
This statement,

00:05:09.592 --> 00:05:13.240
he shall take Care that the
Laws be faithfully executed,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.877
in conjunction with
what is sometimes known

00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:18.186
as the Vesting Clause,

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:21.446
which is at the very beginning
of Article II, Section 1,

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.346
that simply states

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:25.808
the executive Power shall
be vested in a President

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:27.220
of the United States.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.072
These two clauses combined

00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:31.045
have been used to justify

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.797
what we will see are
called informal powers,

00:05:33.797 --> 00:05:36.794
which we will go into much
more depth into future videos,

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:40.461
especially the power
of the executive order.

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:43.180
And so, in summary,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.099
if we wanna look at the executive
powers of the President.

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.060
The power to take care that
laws be faithfully executed.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.489
Nominating officials

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:53.577
with confirmation from the Senate.

00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:56.629
Request written opinions of
administrative officials.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.184
Fill administrative
vacancies during recesses.

00:06:00.184 --> 00:06:02.225
Then you have the legislative powers.

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:05.059
Present info on the State of the Union.

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.313
Recommend legislation to Congress.

00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:10.444
Convene both houses on
extraordinary occasions.

00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:13.709
Adjourn Congress if House
and Senate cannot agree.

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:15.833
And can veto legislation,

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:20.452
although Congress can overrule
with a two-thirds vote.

00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:22.932
And then you have the foreign
policy and military powers,

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:24.521
which include being the Commander-in-Chief

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.006
of the armed forces.

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:27.074
Making treaties,

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:28.974
which have to be ratified by the Senate.

00:06:28.974 --> 00:06:30.681
Nominate ambassadors,

00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:32.178
receive ambassadors,

00:06:32.178 --> 00:06:35.804
and provide diplomatic
recognition to other governments.

00:06:35.804 --> 00:06:36.637
And then finally,

00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:39.205
the judicial powers that
we saw in Article 2.

00:06:39.205 --> 00:06:42.000
Reprieves and pardons for federal offenses

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.990
and the power to nominate federal judges,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.823
including US Supreme Court judges.

00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:49.922
Now, as I touched on,

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:51.298
these are the formal powers,

00:06:51.298 --> 00:06:54.612
but there's also what are
known as informal powers,

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:57.414
and we'll talk more about
these in other videos.

00:06:57.414 --> 00:07:00.378
The President has a unique
role in the federal government

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.554
and in national discourse as a whole,

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:03.626
and because of that,

00:07:03.626 --> 00:07:06.687
they have a lot of bargaining
and persuasion power.

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.100
Now, as we also touched on,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.355
we have an informal power
of executive orders,

00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:13.821
which is derived from the formal powers

00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:16.809
to take care that laws
be faithfully executed

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:19.607
and the fact that the
power of the executive

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:22.182
is vested in the President.

00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:24.196
You also have things
called signing statements,

00:07:24.196 --> 00:07:26.041
which we'll do future videos on,

00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:28.805
which is when a law
gets passed by Congress,

00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.752
the President can issue a document

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:33.186
known as a signing statement

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.354
which interprets that law.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.201
And as you can imagine,

00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:37.945
that interpretation of the law

00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:40.502
could be very, very influential.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.229
And then you also have
executive agreements.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.101
These are agreements
with foreign governments

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:48.502
that do not have to be
ratified by the US Senate.

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:50.022
So they're not formal treaties,

00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:53.504
but they can be agreements
with governments.

00:07:53.504 --> 00:07:55.061
So I will leave you there.

00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:56.221
As you can see,

00:07:56.221 --> 00:07:59.453
the President has many
tools at their disposal

00:07:59.453 --> 00:08:03.437
to influence the policy-making process.

00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:06.302
In future videos, we will
talk more about these,

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:08.885
especially the informal powers.
