Vsauce! Kevin here. &nbsp;

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:09.280
We’ve all heard the term starving artist
but even artists at some point have to eat.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.619
Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí published
a surrealist cookbook in 1973. Filled with

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.420
lavish illustrations, strange musings and
of course recipes.&nbsp; Like, “Frog Pasties”

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.050
- frog legs sautéed in garlic and parsley
and served fried underneath a chilled yogurt

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.210
whipped cream. Despite featuring Dalí’s
unique paintings, his cookbook didn’t sell

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:42.460
many copies and today it’s considered quite
rare. But this is actually pretty good. Maybe

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.220
it should’ve sold more copies. That yogurt
thing is amazing. The frog legs are a little

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.690
chewy but the topping makes up for it. I’d
probably eat this topping on a shoe, it’s

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.560
really delicious.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.990
Lord Byron is considered one of the greatest
British poets to ever live. But while studying

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.499
at Cambridge, he became obsessed with losing
weight and only ate biscuits, water, and potatoes

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:15.560
covered in apple cider vinegar. He lost over
60 pounds and apple cider vinegar became the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:28.869
first fad celebrity diet.&nbsp;That’s uhhh…
That’s vinegar-y. I can see why he lost

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.020
some weight eating nothing but this. He probably
didn’t smell very good either. Old vinegar-y

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.439
Lord Byron.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.779
In 1976, Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and
Roll went to a restaurant that knew all about

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:51.740
his love of peanut butter. They recommended
the Fool’s Gold Loaf—a four-pound peanut

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.810
butter, bacon and blueberry jam sandwich named
for its lofty price tag of $49.95. Elvis loved

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.590
the sandwich so much he once flew his private
jet from Graceland to Denver just to eat it.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.630
To make a Fool’s Gold Loaf, start with French
bread covered in butter, and bake at 350 degrees

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.570
until the bread is golden brown. Slice it
in half, hollow out the insides, then fill

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.250
with peanut butter, jelly, and 450 grams of
cooked bacon. It feeds eight to ten people,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:34.580
or one King of Rock and Roll. &nbsp;Oh man. This
is amazing. This is what being the best tastes

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.230
like. No! Bring that back! I need more Fool’s
Gold Loaf.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.190
Sylvia Plath was a Pulitzer Prize winning
poet, novelist, and author of The Bell Jar,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.220
a book loved by many academics, including
my friend and favorite Youtube scholar, Sparky

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.730
Sweets PhD.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.990
Thanks, Kevin. Sylvia Plath also loved to
bake and often used cookin’ as a way to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.280
turn writer’s block into a blockbuster dinner.
Girl used food imagery in her writing, and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.930
had even planned to write a short story called
“The Day of the Twenty-Four Cakes” before

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.350
she died. But her favorite thing to bake was
a tomato soup cake, which is supposedly delicious

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.210
but sounds like something a fancy hobo eats
out of an old pair Air Jordans. &nbsp;Back to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.280
you, Kevin!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.460
From her personal journals, we know that Plath
wrote the poem “Death &amp; Co” while baking

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.950
a tomato soup cake. Which aside from tomato
soup features cream cheese frosting, cinnamon,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:48.410
nutmeg, and raisins. Tastes like carrot cake.
I’m lookin’ for the tomato soup. There’s

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.720
the tomato soup. It’s good - it’s cake.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.990
Charles Darwin is best known for his theory
of evolution. He also wanted to eat basically

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.431
every animal ever. As a student he started
the Glutton Club to eat unusual animals. And

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:13.210
during voyages he ate iguanas, rodents, ostriches,
and puma. But perhaps Darwin’s strangest

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.341
snack of all was the armadillo, which once
taken out of its shell he said, “taste and

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:31.040
look like duck.” And as always..thanks 
for watching!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:41.400
This… I don’t know about this. I think
I got a bone. I’m gonna eat more of it,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.940
though. I mean, it’s like eating really
dry, dark meat. I’m not gonna open an armadillo

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.960
restaurant tomorrow is all I’m saying’.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.490
Special thanks to Dr. Sparky Sweets and the
gang over at Wisecrack. Seriously, go subscribe

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.101
to their channel. I actually made a video
for them talking about my favorite book. So

00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:12.931
check that out. Subscribe while you’re there.
I’m gonna go brush my teeth four hundred

00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:12.941
thousand times.
