00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.270
I've got a handful
of matrices here.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.890
I have the matrix A
that's an m by n matrix.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.895
You can see it has n
columns and m rows.

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:11.770
And actually let me
throw in one entry there.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.930
It might be useful.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.600
This is the jth column.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.040
So the row is going to
look like this-- amj.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.840
That's that entry right there.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.100
And then I have matrix
B defined similarly,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.980
but instead of being an m by n
matrix, B is an n by m matrix.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.720
And so this entry right here.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.500
Let me just-- I realize
this might be useful.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920
This is going to be my nth row.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.970
And it's going to
be my jth column.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.370
And then I also wrote
out their transposes.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.170
So if you look at the transpose
of B, B was an n by m matrix.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.010
Now the transpose is going
to be an m by n matrix.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.760
And each of its rows
become its columns.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.470
And the same thing I did for A.
It's transpose is right there,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.300
A was m by n.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.130
The transpose is n by m.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.200
And each of these rows
because each of these columns.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.450
Now fair enough.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.130
Let's define two new
matrices right now.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.380
Let's define the matrix
C. Let me do it over here.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.010
I think the real estate will
be valuable in this video.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.610
Let's define my
matrix C as being

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.270
equal to the product of A and B.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.210
So what are going to
be the dimensions of C?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.490
Well, an m by n matrix times
an n by m matrix, these two

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.640
have to be equal even for the
matrix product to be defined.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.265
And that's going to result
with an m by m matrix.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.820
Now let's define another matrix.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's call it D. And
it's equal to B transpose

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
times A transpose.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.350
And the dimensions are going
to be the same, because this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.020
is an m by n times an n by m.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.540
So these are the same.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.530
So which is a requirement for
this product to be defined.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.853
And so the dimensions of
B are going to be m by m.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.770
So let's explore a little bit
what the different entries of C

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.085
are going to look like.

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:19.250
So let me write my
matrix C right here.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.800
So it's just going to have a
bunch of entries-- c11, c12,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.189
all the way to c1m.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.105
You can imagine because
it's an m by n matrix,

00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:33.670
you're going to
have cmm over here.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.846
You know how this drill goes.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.220
But what I'm
curious about is how

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.120
do we figure out what
the general cij is?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.390
How do we figure out what
a particular entry is?

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.590
We know that C is the
product of A and B.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.640
So to get to a
particular entry in C--

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.870
and we've seen this
before-- so cij--

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.680
It's going to be--
you can view it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.204
as the dot product
of the ith row in A

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:13.810
with the jth column
in B, just like that.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.710
And what's that
going to be equal to?

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:29.280
It's going to be equal to ai1
times b1j plus ai2 times b2j.

00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:33.160
And you're just
going to keep going

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.660
until you get to
the last term here,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.880
ain times the last
term here, bnj.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.950
Fair enough.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.330
Now what about our matrix D?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.100
What are its entries
going to look like?

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.950
So D, similarly, it's
going to look like-- you're

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:01.520
going to have d11, d12,
all the way to d1m.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.650
You're going to have dmm.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.410
I could keep putting
entries here.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.370
But I'm curious about just
that sum in general entry here.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.778
Let's say I want
to find d sub ji.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.300
That's what I want to find.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.215
So I want to find a general way
for any particular entry of d.

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:21.605
The jth row and
ith column, which

00:04:21.605 --> 00:04:23.480
is a little bit different
than the convention

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.210
we normally use
for these letters.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.500
But it's fine.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.560
The first one is D's row.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.290
The second one is D's--
is this entry's column.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.500
So how do we figure that out?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.900
So d sub j i.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.130
It's going to be equal to-- D is
the product of these two guys.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.550
So to get the jth row and
ith column entry here,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.370
we essentially take the
dot product of the jth row

00:04:49.370 --> 00:05:01.310
here, which is that right there,
with the ith column of A, which

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.030
is that right there.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.950
So I'm going to take
the dot product of that.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.360
And you might already see
something interesting here.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.430
This thing right here is
equivalent to that thing

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.592
right there.

00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:15.800
And this thing right here
is equivalent to that thing

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.633
right there, because
we took the transposes.

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.980
But let's actually
just write it out.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.705
So what is this dot product
going to be equal to?

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.669
Well, it's going to be bij.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:27.710
Let me write it this way.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.150
It's going to bij times ai1.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.230
Or we could write
it as ai1 times b1j.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.980
And it's going to be
plus b2j times ai2, which

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.120
is the same thing
as ai2 times b2j.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.050
And you're going to keep going
until you get b and j times

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.950
ain.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.932
Or you could write
that as ain times bnj.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.920
Now notice something.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.450
These two things are equivalent.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.260
They're completely
equivalent statement.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.950
The d sub ji is
equivalent to c sub ij.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.880
Let me write that.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.630
Or I could write c sub ij
is equivalent to d sub ji.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.410
Or another way you could say
it is, all the entries that's

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:31.210
at row i, column j in C is
now in row j, column i in D.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.840
And this is true
for all the entries.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.560
I stayed as general as possible.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.660
So what does this mean?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.360
This is the definition
of a transpose.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.870
So we now get that C
transpose is equal to D.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.267
Or you could say that C
is equal to D transpose.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.350
Now this is pretty
interesting, because how did we

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.820
define these two?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:04.500
We said that our matrix C is
equal to the matrix product

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.560
A and B. And we said that D is
equal to our matrix product B

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.400
transpose times A transpose.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.750
I did those definitions
right there.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.560
Here are the definitions.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.620
And now we just found out that D
is equal to the transpose of C.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.230
So we could write that
C transpose, which

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:32.292
is the same thing as A times
B transpose, is equal to D.

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:37.720
So it is equal to D, which is
just B transpose A transpose.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.200
And this is a pretty
neat takeaway.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.710
If I take the product
of two matrices,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.490
and then transpose it, it's
equivalent to switching

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.120
the order, or transposing
them, and then taking

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.790
the product of the
reverse order-- B

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.250
transpose, A transpose--
which is a pretty, pretty neat

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.040
take away.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.790
And you could
actually extend this

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.720
to an arbitrary
number of matrices

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.891
that you're taking
the product of.

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:09.640
I'm not proving it
here, but it's actually

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.440
a very simple extension
from this right now.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.780
If you take the
matrices, let's say

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.012
A-- let me do different
letters-- X, Y,

00:08:19.012 --> 00:08:23.460
Z, if you take their product
and then transpose it,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:29.780
it's equal to Z transpose,
Y transpose, X transpose.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.670
I haven't proven
this general case,

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.549
and you could keep doing
it with four or five

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:38.020
or n matrices multiplied by each
other, but it generally works.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.770
And you could
essentially prove it

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.640
using what we proved
in this video right

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.940
here, that you take the
product of two matrices,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.770
take their transpose,
it's equal to the product

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.900
of their transposes
in reverse order.
