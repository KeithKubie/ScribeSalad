00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.010
Matt you asked the question can we go

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
Matt you asked the question can we go
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.049
Matt you asked the question can we go
skateboarding on the Moon or Mars or

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059
skateboarding on the Moon or Mars or
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820
skateboarding on the Moon or Mars or
this be more of a a hoverboard scenario

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
this be more of a a hoverboard scenario
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709
this be more of a a hoverboard scenario
well both the Moon and Mars have a

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
well both the Moon and Mars have a
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.209
well both the Moon and Mars have a
weaker surface gravity than the earth

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
weaker surface gravity than the earth
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.070
weaker surface gravity than the earth
does so you don't weigh as much on the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
does so you don't weigh as much on the
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.290
does so you don't weigh as much on the
Moon or Mars as you do here but there

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
Moon or Mars as you do here but there
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790
Moon or Mars as you do here but there
still is enough gravity to stick you to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
still is enough gravity to stick you to
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.810
still is enough gravity to stick you to
the surface so I think you could

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
the surface so I think you could
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.249
the surface so I think you could
actually sting on your board and keep it

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259
actually sting on your board and keep it
 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.769
actually sting on your board and keep it
down you probably wouldn't accelerate as

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779
down you probably wouldn't accelerate as
 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.659
down you probably wouldn't accelerate as
fast as you do here on earth so for

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669
fast as you do here on earth so for
 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:27.799
fast as you do here on earth so for
example on earth you'd be going down a

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:27.809
example on earth you'd be going down a
 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.749
example on earth you'd be going down a
hill picking up speed on the Moon and

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759
hill picking up speed on the Moon and
 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.580
hill picking up speed on the Moon and
Mars the gravity is weaker so you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
Mars the gravity is weaker so you
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290
Mars the gravity is weaker so you
wouldn't be picking up as much speed so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
wouldn't be picking up as much speed so
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
wouldn't be picking up as much speed so
in fact skateboarding might be a little

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
in fact skateboarding might be a little
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.369
in fact skateboarding might be a little
bit dull on the Moon and Mars the good

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379
bit dull on the Moon and Mars the good
 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.599
bit dull on the Moon and Mars the good
thing is that if you fall over

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609
thing is that if you fall over
 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.069
thing is that if you fall over
you also don't fall with the same force

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
you also don't fall with the same force
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.569
you also don't fall with the same force
you would but from the gravity of the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
you would but from the gravity of the
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.849
you would but from the gravity of the
earth so you probably be a bit safer but

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859
earth so you probably be a bit safer but
 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.200
earth so you probably be a bit safer but
the question actually kind of has got me

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
the question actually kind of has got me
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.700
the question actually kind of has got me
thinking about what sort of sports you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
thinking about what sort of sports you
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110
thinking about what sort of sports you
could do on some of the worlds in our

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
could do on some of the worlds in our
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729
could do on some of the worlds in our
solar system that you just could not do

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
solar system that you just could not do
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950
solar system that you just could not do
here at all and there are several places

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
here at all and there are several places
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.349
here at all and there are several places
in the solar system that have relatively

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359
in the solar system that have relatively
 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.419
in the solar system that have relatively
low surface gravity the gravity isn't as

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429
low surface gravity the gravity isn't as
 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.950
low surface gravity the gravity isn't as
strong as here on the surface of the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
strong as here on the surface of the
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.989
strong as here on the surface of the
earth but they have thick atmospheres

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999
earth but they have thick atmospheres
 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.360
earth but they have thick atmospheres
there's a moon called Titan that orbits

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
there's a moon called Titan that orbits
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640
there's a moon called Titan that orbits
Saturn and Titan is a really big object

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
Saturn and Titan is a really big object
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.200
Saturn and Titan is a really big object
I mean physically it's actually not that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
I mean physically it's actually not that
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940
I mean physically it's actually not that
much smaller than the planet Mars

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
much smaller than the planet Mars
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070
much smaller than the planet Mars
Titans gravity isn't as strong as

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
Titans gravity isn't as strong as
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.450
Titans gravity isn't as strong as
Earth's but the atmosphere is actually

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
Earth's but the atmosphere is actually
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950
Earth's but the atmosphere is actually
thicker there's actually a little more

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
thicker there's actually a little more
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.110
thicker there's actually a little more
air pressure on Titan than there is here

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120
air pressure on Titan than there is here
 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.940
air pressure on Titan than there is here
on earth it's a very different sort of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
on earth it's a very different sort of
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560
on earth it's a very different sort of
air there's no oxygen it's actually

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
air there's no oxygen it's actually
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.090
air there's no oxygen it's actually
mostly nitrogen a little bit of carbon

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100
mostly nitrogen a little bit of carbon
 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770
mostly nitrogen a little bit of carbon
dioxide so you couldn't breathe you'd

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
dioxide so you couldn't breathe you'd
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270
dioxide so you couldn't breathe you'd
have to bring a breathing apparatus and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
have to bring a breathing apparatus and
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.550
have to bring a breathing apparatus and
it's also very cold it's about 300

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
it's also very cold it's about 300
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710
it's also very cold it's about 300
degrees below zero but if you had a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
degrees below zero but if you had a
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600
degrees below zero but if you had a
really SuperDuper parka and you got a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
really SuperDuper parka and you got a
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130
really SuperDuper parka and you got a
breathing apparatus you could actually

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
breathing apparatus you could actually
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990
breathing apparatus you could actually
survive on the surface of Titan there's

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
survive on the surface of Titan there's
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.720
survive on the surface of Titan there's
air pressure with air pressure and low

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730
air pressure with air pressure and low
 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.060
air pressure with air pressure and low
gravity you could actually strap large

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
gravity you could actually strap large
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580
gravity you could actually strap large
wings to your arms I mean imagine wings

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
wings to your arms I mean imagine wings
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.650
wings to your arms I mean imagine wings
made of some wonderful flexible metal

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660
made of some wonderful flexible metal
 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.690
made of some wonderful flexible metal
and maybe like titanium and if you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
and maybe like titanium and if you
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.180
and maybe like titanium and if you
jumped off a cliff you could fly you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190
jumped off a cliff you could fly you
 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.980
jumped off a cliff you could fly you
could actually start flapping your wings

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
could actually start flapping your wings
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170
could actually start flapping your wings
and actually getting lift and you could

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
and actually getting lift and you could
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.420
and actually getting lift and you could
fly just yourself jumping off a cliff on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
fly just yourself jumping off a cliff on
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.950
fly just yourself jumping off a cliff on
Titan and flying around in that thicker

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
Titan and flying around in that thicker
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350
Titan and flying around in that thicker
atmosphere and there are other places

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
atmosphere and there are other places
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240
atmosphere and there are other places
where you have relatively low gravity

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
where you have relatively low gravity
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.970
where you have relatively low gravity
but giant cliffs for example there's a

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980
but giant cliffs for example there's a
 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.560
but giant cliffs for example there's a
moon of Uranus called Miranda and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
moon of Uranus called Miranda and
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.900
moon of Uranus called Miranda and
Miranda has cliffs that are many miles

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910
Miranda has cliffs that are many miles
 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.690
Miranda has cliffs that are many miles
high so you can jump off a cliff and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
high so you can jump off a cliff and
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.690
high so you can jump off a cliff and
fall very slowly and very gently down to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
fall very slowly and very gently down to
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.339
fall very slowly and very gently down to
the bottom if you think about the the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
the bottom if you think about the the
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.660
the bottom if you think about the the
idea of feather falling that's something

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
idea of feather falling that's something
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.099
idea of feather falling that's something
from Dungeons and Dragons you can fall

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109
from Dungeons and Dragons you can fall
 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:16.790
from Dungeons and Dragons you can fall
very care

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
very care
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.020
very care
fully and not actually hurt yourself

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
fully and not actually hurt yourself
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.910
fully and not actually hurt yourself
there might be sport on Miranda like

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
there might be sport on Miranda like
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710
there might be sport on Miranda like
skydiving but you don't need a parachute

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
skydiving but you don't need a parachute
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.150
skydiving but you don't need a parachute
you just float down very gently and land

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
you just float down very gently and land
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.410
you just float down very gently and land
