Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. and.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking it on Ya. I'm just checking in on, you know, you're almost through the week. Some of you get paid today. Somebody you don't, I don't know how it fucking works, but um, yeah, I'm just here to check in on you just for the fucking half an hour. I hope you guys enjoyed the very special edition to the Monday morning podcast that was put out yesterday with uh, the great, the Great Jim Norton promoting his new standup special that you can watch now on Netflix. Mouthful of shame. I've heard nothing but great things about it. I have yet to see it because uh, you know, I only got so much fucking time now with the little kid running around who just, it just keeps getting better every day. Just keeps getting better every day. I Dunno what the fuck people complain about, about having a kid. It's fucking awesome. Oh my God, you going to do good as opposed to what? Sitting alone in your apartment

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       do all the free time. In the fucking world. Slowly drinking yourself to death. Cause I'll tell you that bit up those sides of the fence like in this side a little better. Let's say in every once in awhile. Every once in a while I don't have visit my old friends that my fucking 83 70 sixers level bar that I have, I always throw, I always give a shout out to the 83 76 in, cause every talks about the 96 bowls. Everybody talks about the 27 Yankees. What about the 1983 Philadelphia 70 sixers. Huh? I would love to throw the 86 Celtics in there, but the fucking Lakers choked against the Houston Rockets. So I mean sort of a a, you know when in the 80s it didn't mean you didn't really feel like you won a championship unless you beat the Celtics and the Lakers. That's basically it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       That's, that's my, you know, no disrespect to Ralph fucking Sampson. No fucking disrespect. Do Chemo [inaudible] Lucy on a TV or they have fucking treat. No tree Rollins was Atlanta. I don't remember. They had very similar uniforms in my memory bank. In fact, I think they had the exact same colors, just Houston Rockets was less busy. More traditional like the Detroit Red Wings, jersey, simple red and white, Toronto, blue and white sit. It's over. These are our colors. Fuck you somebody. Please explain to me how the Tampa Bay fucking lightning also can wear blue and white. I don't understand that. You know, it's like the Pittsburgh Penguins when they came back wearing black and gold, it's like what the fuck? Bard Nick told me that the original fucking hockey team in Pittsburgh did wear black and gold. But then yeah, but then you folded and you left it on the table. It's like when you don't renew your fucking website, somebody else is going get it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       Um, I don't know what I'm talking about. All I know is I have to plow through this next fucking half an hour just to see how you're doing. Whatever. Maybe I'm going to catch you on the ride home. You know, worst case scenario, you got one fucking day left. Use a sick day, take a three day weekend. You know, you know, it was actually thinking now is this is the time of year where, uh, the spring break, I wonder what kids do nowadays. It's gotta be a way where they can get out of the view of the constant surveillance of your parents. Now, you know what I mean? Jesus Christ. By the time my daughter gets to that fucking age, I'll probably be able to have a drone like hovering over her for her the entire fucking existence. I'll just shout down from the sky, you know, on a dog. Go to that party, just freaking around. She'd be looking up like dad,

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       oh,

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       so shaken my dad hovering over me in a hoe and a fucking whatever the fuck it's called. That will literally be helicopter parenting. No, it's fucking drones. I went to something recently and I guess the gift bag was a drone. It's like, why would you give people those things? It's not intrusive enough. All this fucking technology that all these fucking Weirdos, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       I want to know the first time a drone is going to seriously give somebody's brain damage because the operator was trying to jerk off while they were trying to operate. It is there hovering over somebody's fucking house, you know, try to come down to the bathroom. This already perverts doing that. Perverts fascinate me, man. They fascinated me. Say Blanket. You just walk up and say hello. They can't do it. But then they have these needs, right? So then they got to peek around the corner. You know, speaking of Pekin peaky blinders, one of my favorite fucking shows is come on over the last five years, um, I was on a, uh, an airplane flying back from Austin, from the south by southwest festival. Um, which, yeah, I can't tell you another time when you would not want to be in Austin. You know, I mean, it's great for films in that type of Shit, but it's just like, I don't know, man.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       I don't know what happened to that city. I've been going there for the last 20 years. It just gets more and more crowded. It's like a bunch of sweaty hippies with LH level traffic. That's what south by southwest is. And I don't know what it is. Every white person in Austin during that week, they all look like they play hacky sack, you know, I dunno if there's just something about the, uh, did disheveled on purpose colleged age white kid that I know. I even when I went to college, I wasn't like that, you know, fucking combed my hair when I still had here. Right. I didn't try to fucking look like I lived out on the street. That was like a big guy thing back then to try to look all fucking disheveled. Like guy could barely take care of myself. But look at my college id. Look at my crazy picture. It's like, dude, you did. All of the sudden this whole fucking thing is on purpose. The end of the fucking day, if your back's against the wall, you can call your mom and dad. All right, so fucking calm your hair and put on a clean shirt, right? You can't, I'm sorry. Why did I say all of that? Anyways, I, um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       this was my day. I actually was flying out there at that day to do the all things, comedy, podcasts and then fly right back. So I, uh, I'm like, this is great. I've always wanted to go to the airport and just have like nothing and just walked in, you know, like Leonardo Dicaprio in catch me if he came every just come fucking walking in wearing this little fucking, I know how to fly plain outfit. That's what the fuck I wanted to do, minus that outfit. So I put on sweatpants, you know, and whatever fucking tee shirt jacket. And I had my change of clothes and toiletries in this backpack and that was fucking it. All right. Went in there like a Goddamn drifter and I get all the way to the airport and I realize I forgot my fucking wallet. Right. So I can't get on the fucking plane cause I don't have any form of identification. I don't have my college id man from back in the day. And, um, what did I have? Um, I ended up having to go,

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       I didn't know what to do. I was like, I'm gonna miss this fucking fun. I'm actually thinking now that my dad, she did grow my hair out a little bit in college, but I still dress respectfully. Maybe I was a hybrid. I can't fucking remember was so fucking long ago. Anyways, so I fucking get to the airport. I don't have my Goddamn id and I don't know what the fuck to do and I have to make this, this podcast cause his advertisers and all that type of shit. You can't say this is the lineup. This is the projected amount of people that are going to listen. It's a business and then not show up and take the fucking money. So, uh, I didn't know what to do. So I ended up, uh, the first time ever I flew private and blue a fucking ton of cash.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       So I'm going to be playing a bunch of casinos coming up to make up for the money that I, uh, that I spent on, that I flew out of Van Nuys like a fucking rock star, lit up my card, literally glowing in my pocket. I had to fuck a drive home, get my wallet, fly out, you know, drive out there and then sit there and then talk to these fucking savages just being like, oh, you need a plane right now. Ah Yeah, really, that'll be 1 million bucks. And I'm like, fuck you with somebody else. And they're like, it'll be a half a million. I'm like, fuck you. And all you do is you just keep calling people and after awhile you just start saying numbers and um, I got it. I got it way the fuck down for whatever they first quoted me. I have that, got it down to half that, but still cost a fucking zillion bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       So, uh, I get on the plane talking to the pilots to like, right fucking, there was a smaller plane, like when I went to take a Piss, I'm like, do you guys have a bathroom here? They're like, yeah, they do. When they had to move the snacks and then they closed that little door and I'm taking a piss right on the other side of the fucking door and like, you can't stand up in the plane. So I am stand up, but I, I'm acting like I have osteoporosis and I'm trying to take a fucking piss and there's, there's an angle you have to be at so you don't piss on your own fucking sweatpants. But eventually the velocity of the urine coming out of your Dick is going to slow down and it's going to come towards your clothes. So then you gotta make a decision. What am I going? How am I going to do this? How far down am I going to pull my pants? What the fuck's going on? Like that weird kid. Remember that weird kid when you were in elementary school? You went in to take a piss and the kid had his pants all the way down around his ankles. It's like, why didn't you just fucking on Zip? You fly, you know what's going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       So, and then old town, I'm just thinking like, how is this better than flying on a commercial airline? I don't get it. You know what, if you fly in business of first, if you bump yourself up, um, the, I am one and done on that shit. I just think it's the, it's a colossal fucking waste of money. And I have the glowing fucking credit card right now to prove it. And um, there's just no money in it. The fucking people who rent the planes of barely making any money, the pilots don't make any money. All the pilots, one eventually fly for commercial, a commercial airline, right? I mean, they're still flying commercial private or they want to fly for like, you know, one of the major airlines is what I'm trying to say. So one of the pilots came back and he's talking to me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       He goes, yeah, we got some beers here. And I'm like, I'm on the wagon. But I'm like, well, what the fuck? I spent all this money, I got to have a beer. So I drank a cores light, like the white trash count that I am. And um, he sitting there talking to me and uh, I'm all fascinated with the, all the aviation aspects of it. And I'm sitting there and looking at the guy and he had a tear in his slacks right at his knee. Like there was a, like a, like a vertical slice, like he was in a knife fight and just so many sliced it a little bit. And I was just going like, there's no fucking money in this. What this guy's doing right now define the law of gravity getting me from Los Angeles to Austin. He doesn't get lost. He knows where to go. He knows what altitude to fly at. We had a nice fucking landing. We, my life is literally in this guy's hand and they don't pay this guy enough money that he can fly this fucking jet without a pair of pants that have fucking ripped. You know, maybe that's why all those kids fucking annoyed me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       You know what, he's, I didn't fit, you know, when I was in Austin, cause I'm seeing a guy who actually really is struggling flying of fucking jet and he has fucking a ripped slacks. Who knows? Maybe he just had a rough night. He had a rough one. Maybe just passed out. I don't fucking know. Anyways. Um, I remember when I was in college and uh, yeah, like I, I did, I was never that fucking rebel guy. I remember walking by this chick one time and I just had like mainstream clothes on. I had like a polo shirt and regular shit. I remember I walked by and she just goes, Ooh, hot labels. I just want to be like, you fucking golf. Can you look like every other fucking got caught here? Do you guys all, I don't know what fucking every blacks, everything painted black store. You fucking walking. You all have the same fucking makeup. Y'All have the same fucking lipstick.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       Yeah. I just, you know, cause there's no goth food court. You feel like you're out of the year out of the reach of the corporations. I'll never forget that. Ooh, hot labels. And I kind of liked her too cause a lot of those got chicks with cute, you know, if you could get past the fucking, you know, now a days I would actually, I would totally steer clear of them knowing what I know. It's like, Oh God, let me, I would have one question. Do you or do you not hate your parents? You do and say, ah, I'm not fucking going through that shit. Those fucking long talks about everything that they did to you. You know? And you know what? My parents did shit to, you know, and I'm a parent now and I'm going to do shit. You know that doesn't mean you got to fucking walk around dressed like you were in awake.

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       I mean, why are you dressed like that? Cause you got bullied. Now look at you now you're just bringing this shit onto yourself. What are you waiting for bullies to become enlightened and be like, oh I guess people have the right to be different. It's not going to happen. So at the very least, if you're going to walk around like that, it at least at some point take the makeup off, going to a Dojo and learn some fucking MMA shit so you can protect yourself. So I guess in the end of the day, I'm not really attacking golf people. I'm really saying a pellet fucker. She still judged me, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       Ooh, hot labels. I've seen one of those things where you walk and you kind of stop for half a second and then you, is it worth it? It's not worth it. And I just kept going. I forget what her fucking name was. It was either Natasha a brook, which was always a fucking hot girl name. When I was growing up, I never really saw a brook that wasn't good looking. Natasha's were good looking. Debbie's Debbie's, we'll fund Debbie's were fun girl. It's weird like you give, you give a fucking person a name, you know what I mean? It was, I, you know, just blending in. Bill lost in the crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:15:01       Oh, mainstream bill with this corporate clothes. Just walking down the street. I did have the Red Afro for awhile when I got into fucking radio. I fucking grew it out a little bit. And, uh, I think I had the beard or that's when I got into drums and I was trying to be in a band and that sort of, I was trying to grow my hair out and it just went out, which would have been cool in the sixties or seventies I would've looked like Bernie from room to 22 but by the 80s it wasn't cool. You had to have the law and fucking hand just never worked for me. The comedy gods, they just pulled me in. It's like, listen bill, you'll look like a douche no matter what you do. Okay. You're not a good looking guy. You look like a fucking freak. Okay. The only hope for you is to stand on stage and make fun of yourself and make a little bit of money.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       Why didn't you want to, you cash in on your Orange Afro? You know, I think that that's what was going on. And eventually I, I, that's what I did. That is exactly what I did. And then when I was making enough money in the business, uh, the comedy, God said, okay, you don't need your orange afro anymore. And they took it from me. Um, I know what the fuck I'm talking about. Oh, I know what I wanted to bring up two weeks in a row. I'm going to give you a great movie. I told you I saw Jordan peals get out, which is so fucking such a great movie. And so, you know, different from everything else that's out there. I'm actually going to enjoy watching Hollywood now. Try to rip that movie off. It's like get out, meet people who don't know how to make a get out. I think they're going to do the Latino version. Um, however you say, uh, get out in a Latino, you know, Salado Vamonos I don't what the fuck you say. I'm starting to remember sesame street and we had to enter and exit Ibn [inaudible] out. Oh, that was close.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       I don't fucking room. I don't know. You know, whatever. There's some fucking white guy will get a reset of stone and he'll figure out how to say it. Don't try to rip off that movie. That was a great movie. And this week, um, I was on the plane ride back from Austin. Wait a minute, typing in my password and I saw the guy from peaky blinders. Kilian Murphy don't know nothing about no robbery. Oh fuck you with the fucking password. Hang on a second. God Damn it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       Uh, there we go. It's called, I don't know, I hope I say this right. It's um, anthropoid a n t h r o p. O. I. D and it's based on, they say the extraordinary true story of operation anthropoid uh, the world war mission to attempt to assassinate ss general. I am hard Heidrich. Um, and what I love is it, it's a story I never heard. You know, granted I don't fucking read and it takes place in a checklist of Aki and Prague. And I had no idea. I knew that Germany, you know, they lost I guess Austria in World War One. And then, uh, you know, a star came back and he's just like on TV should have that. And they just took fucking Austria and nobody in Europe did anything. And everyone's just like, well, well maybe that's, maybe they'll just be happy with that and we won't get involved in this fucking world war thing again.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       And then I thought he went immediately to Poland, but evidently, oh, fucking evil. Charlie Chaplin himself went to a checklist of, I had no idea and, uh, made me want to read up on the subject. And, um, it's a fucking amazing, amazing movie. And, uh, it's one of those movies where, uh, what they're talking about, the behavior was so heroic as you're watching it, you're actually sort of squirming going, like, how would I react? What I would hope that I would be one of these, you know, the good guys here as opposed to the person just trying to blend in. Well, they're not coming after me and I just sort of do whatever the fuck they see. And I'll choose like self preservation, which I gotta be honest with you. Like, um, I would never fault a parent for doing that because once you get your kid like you just like so focused on your fucking kid, you just like fuck all adults, you know, not fuck all adults. It's a cycle. I'm not creating a situation. Me, I go, I I think I got a kid, you know, but you'd like to think like, you know what? Fuck that I'm going to teach my kid how to shoot a fucking Uzi and let's go Nazi hunting. You know, you'd like to think that you were that person

Speaker 1:          00:19:49       as opposed to sitting there quietly eating your soggy cornflakes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       You know, this is the thing about being a coward is if nobody else knows, you'll forgive yourself. You know, it's other people know and it just staring at your shoes for the, you know, waiting for the people that know what a coward you were during that time. Eventually die or you die or whatever. But it's a fucking unbelievable fucking movie. Absolutely loved it. And um, directed by Sean Ellis. I like this, I like giving shout outs cause not a lot of people go to movies anymore. Shout outs, all these fucking talented people here and it stars a Jamie Dornan. Kilian Murphy. I hope I said that right. It's spelled c, I. L. L. I. A. N. A. Come on. You got to have a couple of broads in here with some 11 inches, right? I'm never going to say this. Sarah Amro Savage Strava, a fried joke joke. These crisis is like trying to name a fucking hockey player now.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Hannah F R e J. K O. V. A with a fucking hatchet mark right above it. I Dunno. It was a, it was amazing. Very fucking movie. Check it out if you get a chance. If you're on American Airlines, it's playing. Um, I don't know if they get extra money if they do it that way. I Dunno. All right. Anyways, let's read a little bit of advertising here for this week.

By the way, that fucking commercial, I think it's full lift that they do on TV where the people are robbing the bank and they're freaking out. And then there's that one kid just sitting there going like, oh, the guy's named Tim. That's a great name. And he's totally fucking relax.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       I'm going to in a minute. Um, what do I have on the thing? Uh, oh, I have a benefit benefit. Um, on March 25th and I am for M ms and it's here in la. I for some reason don't have the information in front of me. I don't fucking know. I'm co hosting it with Craig Gas. It's rock against ms I believe is going to be a bunch of musicians there. Steven Adler again, fucking Gilby, Clark, um, Rudy Sasso, Michael, Devin. All of these fucking rock stars are going to be there. We're going to raise a bunch of money to help try and find a cure for this bed. Horrific disease as opposed to what? Bill? A wonderful disease. What about the disease of laughter? I don't think we ever want to cure that to me. I'm sorry. I'm going to be in San Jose this week. Everybody, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I'm doing two shows a night. I got my new shit going on. I was supposed to do the goddamn comedy jam, but I'm, my fucking shoulder is messed up. And uh, I've been driving my old truck to that's three on the tree and that's the shoulder that's fucked up. But I actually was bothering me just to shift on the column. That's how fucking old I am. Like someday I might have to sell that truck because it hurts my shoulder to just shift. It only has three gears.

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       I know. It's fucking pathetic. I've been fallen off on the Bruins and the Celtics, I know the Bruins scored a bunch of goals. I know we beat the bulls the other day, but then the, uh, the Bruins scored six goals, four goals in the third period. I watched the first period of both the, uh, the Vancouver and the Calgary game. And that was always my, my fantasy when I was young as a fan, when I went on the road, you know, I was just like, I would love to do that fucking western Canada road trip. You know, back then it was Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Eh, maybe played Winnepeg too. And then the last end he went down and they played the La Kings in La. Kings would just sit and way out in the West would nobody nearer. Like the closest fucking team I think was Vancouver. And then the next closest would probably be, would have been the St Louis Blues, maybe Chicago Blackhawks.

Speaker 1:          00:33:00       I will guess Saint Louis. They would just, there was no fucking team west of St Louis other than the La Kings. So no wonder the answer to that time took him so long to win a fucking cup along. They had to fly. Vancouver's never fucking one. One Calgary one once, right. In 89, they'd be fucking Patrick war in the Montreal Canadians. Uh, I want to say Pat Burns was coaching that team. I can't remember, but Edmonton Limited fucking lit it up. So anyways, let me see if they'd be Calgary Leslie Boston prayer. We go bro wins. Here we go. Boston Bruins. If flying around the ice they saw Pasta Knox 29th goal. He's really fill in, fill in the uh, Tyler and void. When you say, you know, since Tyler Sagan left, Marshawn became a legitimate superstar and now pasta knock is on his way. So I guess we're doing all right. You know, we survived it and I actually think Tyler Sagan, all this shown us congratulating ourselves. I think we want Bruins extinguish the flames. You get it. You get it. It's like they're on fire. David Back is returned from a collision into the boards. Yeah, that was scary. That looked like me and pick up hockey. Um, oh for fuck sakes. Where did the story go?

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       We scored the game winner is the Bruins down the flames. Five to two in Calgary on Wednesday we scored six goals of Vancouver. Five 11 goals in two fucking games. You know, all my fucking bitch moaning and complaining. Um, Marshawn humbled by emerging status as a lead score. Yeah, that's absolutely right. What about pasta? Marshawn had a hat trick in Vancouver and I fucking missed it, dude. All of a sudden we're scoring goals and I was sitting there wine and saying, do not get rid of Clo Julian. And it's been a, it's totally worked out. It's worked out for us. It's worked out for him. It's worked out for the Canadian, so it's all good. And I'm flying around the ice with the new coach Cassidy. That's fucking great. That's fucking great. I love it. I love it. Is good to see Doug Hamilton to seem to be doing all right out there and can't.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       And Calgary, I never, I never have a fucking problem with the experts. Even if they decided to try to take more money. I don't give a fuck you a career. Have a good time. Good to see you still in the league. You know, I know you're out there in the saddle dome that doesn't get a lot of love down here in the lower 48 as they say in Alaska. Um, anyways, that's the podcast I got to get on with my fucking day here. Oh my God. My wife said the fucking greatest thing to me ever to fucking motivate me to work out. I was sitting there looking in the mirror in the bathroom. I just fat shamed myself every fucking night. That's how I stay in shape, right? And I just, you know, I went off the rails and I ate steak and shake twice and a to Mcdonald's twice and had burger king.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       This month has been like fast food when had been on the road, I don't want spend going on with me. Right? So I was looking at the results of that diet and I was just looking in the mirror and I, I called myself a tub of fuck, which I've never said my life. I was just like, you fucking soft mushy tub of fuck. And then Nia was in the other room going like, what's going on with you? I don't know. Look at me. I'm fucking, I'm a mess. She goes, yeah, I looked at bad. I go, Yag, do look at me. I've got a fucking dad bod now. And she goes, no, you don't. I don't need it. You're not helping me. You know, I need honesty here. And then she just goes, all right, you're not his tone as you once were. And I just went, fuck yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       She goes, I'm sorry you said that. I said, no, you're doing me a favor. So that's it. Now I've been on it. I've been on it like the Joe Rogan company. I've been focusing on it. Alright. Oatmeal. Fucking poached egg in the morning. By the way, when you make your poached eggs, if you want to have them like they do in the restaurant, you know it's, it's spooning with itself. This is such a simple trick. I didn't even know it for all these years. Just swirl the water. I know I've said this before, but maybe you missed the podcast. Just swirl the water, get a little whirlpool going. Okay. And then you crack the egg, you drop it right down the center and it's like a figure skater. You know when they do the fucking spinning around and it just, it brings its arms in and then you go, you take it out with a slotted spoon, you put it on a fucking English muffin. Unless you like me. If you're a tub fuck and you're trying to lose weight, there's no English muffin. It's just sitting in naked and afraid.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       That is the dumbest fucking show. Do you know there's no prize? These people go out there and get like fucking Lyme disease got ants crawling around their balls and up into their fucking private parts. I mean, I just don't understand why you would do that. Cavemen were not naked. They were definitely afraid, but they fucking killed something and they covered up their junk. I actually saw this guy naked in a fucking tree with a hatchet. This is just a commercial because I refuse to watch that. I don't watch that show. You know, black people will watch shit that because it's a bad representation of themselves. That's what that show is for white people. There's very few shows out there that, that bring white people down, you know, because white people are run and shit. So we always make ourselves the fucking heroes. I'm naked and afraid. That's not a good show for white people. That is every stereotype of a fucking white person. Just like, you know, I think my life is just too fucking easy. I got to make it difficult. What am I just took all my clothes off, went to the fucking juggled sob. I could survive.

Speaker 3:          00:38:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       Naked and afraid. So this fucking guy and just in the commercial Ford, he's up in a tree and he's fucking hacking at this branch in this tree. He sitting in and then the whole fucking branch collapses and it's just like, that reminds me of some shit from like bugs bunny. We the f somebody be sitting on a branch in this sign off in a sitting on the wrong side of it and then they fall off or the whole tree falls down. I literally watched this guy do what? Live action. A real person did that to himself. He was, but he was hacking on the right side. But still, I don't know what happened. The whole thing fucking falls. And now he's falling in.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       To like a bunch of like branches sticking all like with just completely naked.

Speaker 3:          00:39:23       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       I never cut my balls my entire life. I never got a scratch on my balls. Nothing. Cause they were covered up. They had on a pair of pants, claims a fucking tree naked.

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       Anyways, I don't know why I'm talking about this. I don't know why I have this level of passion for a fucking show. I don't, I don't even watch, uh, that's the uh, yeah, checked in on you. Okay. You guys, you guys have, you guys have yourself a great fucking weekend or write your cards and I will, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday. All right. That's it. Go fuck yourselves. And, uh, God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 4:          00:40:00       Hey, what's going on? It's still birth is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday, March 16th, 2009. Um, I didn't know what this is the year of anybody. Asian listening. What is it the year of? Is it the year of the Monkey? Um, I am in San Francisco right now and, uh, I can't believe it. It's drizzling out and it's cold and it's miserable as just, I, I just blew my mind because every time I come to San Francisco, but whether it's just, it's just, you know, it just puts a smile on your face, you know, it's just one of those, you know, which I don't know when the fuck they ever filmed that rice a Roni commercial, but it must've been like the one sunny day in the last 10 fucking years out here. Cause this is the 12th time I've come to this city. I just pulled that number out of the air, but whatever, it was the suck every time.

Speaker 4:          00:40:55       And that's like five typically impossible. Um, and as I mentioned, I have a touch of a cold. I usually get sick when I come here. Dave was actually a little bit sick before I got here. How did you get sick bill? Well, I'll tell you, I went to a Joshua tree national park and uh, evidently I didn't dress properly as I hiked my way out to somebody goldmine, literally, um, Joshua tree definitely, uh, definitely a good time. Although I made a real, I made a big time fool of myself. I showed up and uh, I asked the ranger, I swear to God he was a ranger, but he's working the gift shops. So I forget he sucks at the and arranger, you know what I mean? Probably accidentally started a fire rather than putting one out in the park. So, uh, I asked the ranger, I, you know, it's called Joshua tree. So in my mind, you know, there's this big beautiful park and this is one fucking Joshua tree and that's what everybody comes up to. And you know, like that, what's that wall at all those Jewish people go up and pray to? I thought it was something like that, some sort of Mecca. Right? So I say, yeah, you got, gives me a map of the whole, the whole park.

Speaker 4:          00:42:08       I'm actually getting embarrassed telling the story. I actually said, so where exactly is the Joshua Tree? Is it like, is it like one tree? Is it like a group of like five trees and the guy's looking at me and then just the way he looked at me, I just realized, I just said probably the dumbest fucking thing I could possibly say within them park. And evidently this is what I learned it in defense of myself. I am from the east coast, every gift gently. Uh, Joshua tree is just the type of tree and I had probably driven by like 200 of them on the way up to fucking talking to this ranger. There was probably three of them in the parking lot basically there. But you, people on the east coast who have, if you ever go out there, there is no Joshua tree. It's just a type of tree. And if you go to Joshua tree and you say, so where is the Joshua tree that would like be, that'd be like going to New Jersey and going, um, where is the pine tree? Like the, the, the pine tree that, you know, the special one. And, uh, you know, it just, yeah, I don't know. You know, I just got the directions. I just found out out of fucking get there. I had no information about it, but you know, in defense of me, they should name the park. Uh, Joshua trees, plural, not Joshua tree.

Speaker 4:          00:43:30       It confuses people when they ask silly questions and then they feel stupid and then they tell him that we tell the story on their podcast and they get slightly embarrassed. Um, so anyways, that was my week. Oh, you know, somebody went to the San Jose sharks game on Saturday night on my way up here to do my one, my two shows here up in San Francisco, saw the shark's speed, uh, the kings in a shootout and at the game I saw a 50 to 50, I'd say about 55, 58 year old Guy Punch a 27 year old kid right in the face. And it was fucking hilarious. Um, there was this kid he had on this, uh, Detroit Red Wings, Jersey A's hat on backwards, you know, and right out of the gate he's just standing up screaming shit. And he was cheering on the sharks. So Evan, I don't know what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:44:22       I think, cause he kept standing up anyways, this, this chick who was also like 55, 58, she's got this awful fur coat on, you know, in San Jose. So you know, she thinks she's somebody, I'm sure that's a fancy thing to do in San Jose, California. What a fucking ghost town that was by the way, is that nobody on the streets. Right. So, um, yeah, speaking of which, like I actually was going cheap with the fuck I was going to stay and I actually, uh, decided to stay at this Ramada, you know, thinking that it was, you know, I'm like, all right, it's like an 89 bucks for the night. Fuck it. I'll stay here. And I pull in and it's one of those deals where the hotel rooms open up out into the parking lot. And if you're a fan of my podcast, you know, I feel about those.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       I do not stay, I don't stay in motels. Okay. Even if you call it a hotel, if it fucking opens up, if your room opens up out into the parking lot, that's a fucking motel. Can somebody tell what is the definition of a motel versa hotel? Cause if my world, if your door opens up to the parking lot, that is a motel slash this serial killer buffet where they can just walk down and be like, I'm going to kill this guy. I'm going to kill this guy and I fucking with that guy. So I never even checked in nor did I cancel my reservation. So I wonder, I wonder if I'm going to pay for that. I ended up just calling the Marriott around the corner, not even worried about whether they had a fucking room available because I saw that there was only six people on the street, four of which were fucking crack heads.

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       Um, yeah. So anyway, so I go to this fucking game, get back on track here. Yeah. So this woman, this fur coat, all of a sudden she gets into it with this guy. Where is this? This, this Red Wings Jersey, and you know, she's giving him shit and he's given it right back to her, which of course I'm loving. You know what I mean? They're usually guys back down to women once they start screaming in public and he didn't, he just kept giving a shit right back. And I don't know what she said, but she goes, yeah, you just try me. Or something like that. Which was really fucking annoying. You know, I hate where women act like they're going to get physical with a man. Like they're going to knock them out. It's like we do shut up, you know, I can't hit you.

Speaker 4:          00:46:41       I mean I could, but I'm instantly going to go to fucking jail and then I'm going to get raped, you know? So stop acting like you're fucking Tufts. The law is on your side. I, right. So she's doing all that shit and he's given a shit right back and then it's sort of died down. Then I started watching the game again and next thing you know, there's just this commotion and I look over to my left again. Now, the kid in the Red Wings Jersey is covered in beer and he's John at the, the lady with the fur coat and a, obviously she dumped it over his head, you know, I mean, of course I would too if it was illegal to kick the shit out of me. So she dumps it over ahead. Any doesn't blast her in the face. Just adding to her country level that she's going to be the following day.

Speaker 4:          00:47:28       The fact that she got away with that and didn't get dropped. I'm not advocating, I don't think you should hit a woman, but I don't feel that women should take advantage of the fact that a man can't hit them by just doing over the top country things like just dumping a beer on somebody. You know what I mean? So anyways, so she dumps a beer on the guy, which I gotta admit is also hilarious on another level. So I didn't hear the exchange, I guess. I don't know what happened. All of a sudden this fucking old guy comes into the picture he's got his face is all twisted up with angry anger, and he just says to the kid, he goes, who are you calling a bitch? He must've called the chicken of fur coat a bitch. And I, the kid didn't say anything and I swear to God, this fucking 55 year old dude who was the slowest punch I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       He literally lifted his hand up like a rock 'em sock. 'Em robot and just through this straight, not even, you know, I don't know what the fuck it was. It was like rock 'em sock 'em he just, she sort of bought them right, right on the nose. And then the kid just immediately called for security and I was just like, wow, that's really a tough situation. They're like, he just dealt with two of the toughest physical confrontations. A woman dumps a bureau via head. You want to punch her in the face, but you can't, but then you allow them to dump it over your head. So he deals with that. Then he has an old guy punched him in the face. It's like another man just punched him in the face. You want to drill them back but you can't cause he's an old guy, but then you will out an old guy to punch you in the face.

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       So at this point this guy socially has been raped, right. So I'm thinking when security comes down, I'm like, all right, this guy got punched in the face and a beer over his head. He might actually, you know, he should get out of this even though he's younger than the two of them. You're going to be sympathetic with the old people. But he immediately screws up cause the security gets there and he just starts cursing his brains out. Go and I didn't do shit. I was use fucking watching the fucking, they just snatched him. They actually snatched all three of them and 20 minutes later, somehow the kid with the Red Wings Jersey came back and the two old people didn't. And I was thinking, how the fuck did he pull that off? And the only way I can think of it is, is if the old guy admitted to punching him in the face, which is probably what someone would do if they weren't a lawyer.

Speaker 4:          00:49:42       He probably said, well this guy punched me in the face and then he probably did it cause you called my wife a bitch and then it became do you want to press charges? And then the old guy gets scared and grabs his walker and he leaves and then the fucking Detroit Redwings kid came back. That was my experience. Was that just a long boring story that went nowhere. I kind of lost interest towards the end of that and their mouth started getting dry. Anyway, this is the month, uh, the Monday morning podcast and a, if you new to my podcast, I do one of these every single week. And uh, I think it's becoming really relevant during these tough economic times, you know, to just give away something free like this. I'm only mentioning that it's free cause somebody told me that they find it annoying when people say it's a podcast, you know, it's like really?

Speaker 4:          00:50:30       Well, it is a free podcast. You fucking douchebag and despite the fact that it's free, people still bitch at me every week, you know? So yeah, I am going to throw it in your face then. I'm doing this for free. What do you think about that? I'm going to guilt you. Just like your grandmother. You know I saw one of the greatest movie trailers I've ever seen in my life. Do you guys, you guys fans of the movie the dirty dozen? Well what is wrong with you have you should be go go on youtube, hit pause. You don't need to listen to me right now. This is all you need to do. If you want to be entertained for free, just go on youtube and type in the dirty dozen and watch. Watch the movie trailer of it and they have one of the greatest lines I think that has ever been written. And then describing basically the premise of the movie is this. These 12 guys who are on basically either on death row are facing really long prison sentences. And if they agree to go on this suicide mission to kill a bunch of Nazi officers, if they survive, they get to go free. And, uh, that's the movie. So they're basically describing all the characters and one of the characters they described as an Indian with war paint smeared on his soul.

Speaker 4:          00:51:48       I can't do it justice. I cannot do it justice. The guys doing it in that movie voice and he's not doing it with a hint of how fucking hilarious it is. Cause it wasn't a hilarious back then and Indian was more page smeared on his soul. It's just, it's fucking awesome. I want that as my ring tone. Um, anyways, so let's get on with the podcast. Uh, yeah, like if you're new to my podcast, people send me questions, I answer my answer the questions as best I can. People send me their lists of underrated things they find underrated or overrated and movie reviews. Um, and the latest, the latest is people are telling me stories of, uh, of revenge. Uh, all right, so here's one. They're really long. These people really are writing me like Stephen King length stories of revenge and I'm personally, what I've been saying throughout this is I don't do revenge.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       I, uh, I enjoy hearing the stories, but I don't do it because a, I just, my Karma is too fucking strong. I Dunno man. Like there's something about revenge unless it's face to face, you know, you just sort of fight somebody, you know, that seems like an honorable kind of revenge. But when you sort of, you start the second year, like looking at another human being and they don't know, you're looking at them and you're trying to plan some diabolical shit. I don't know about you guys, but there's something inside of me. I can't fucking do it because I just, I never feel more evil. I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you. I've sat around and thought about it, but to actually carry it out. Yeah. Who knows? Maybe it's exciting. I never feel more alive than when plotting the death of a, my next door neighbor.

Speaker 4:          00:53:37       All right, here we go. Um, you know that sound byte, Mike, to come back to haunt me in the future when I pull my Robert Blake in my sixties. Take that one out of context. All right, so here's the podcast one. I'm gonna try to skip through most of this and just get to the gist of it. A pill. I was going to college in Washington state, uh, but I'm skipping all of my classes and getting horrible grades. The school I was going to was university of Puget sound easily the worst place I've ever fucking been to a Yada, Yada, Yada. So anyways, there was this kid who was a friend of mine and at the beginning of the summer he was in front of his at the beginning of the semester. But I slowly started to realize that he was a piece of shit, which culminated when he also having red hair fucked my then girlfriend when she was drunk.

Speaker 4:          00:54:24       That makes sense. So basically he had this friend in the beginning, the semester. He thought he was cool. You graduated, realizes that he's a piece of shit in the culminated when he fucked his then girlfriend when she was drunk. There we go. So anyways, uh, uh, what he said was this, this was actually one of the better moments of my time at the college hearing that they had hooked up and finding her the next day, the next morning, sorry. And she literally could not look me in the eye, which in hindsight I find extremely funny. Um, and she is shame she and an shamed way explained that she thought the other guy was me, but she was so drunk, she didn't notice. They look to say I was not understanding with her at all and may be out of character choice to go back to not fucking anyone. Well, good for you man.

Speaker 4:          00:55:13       It's a strong choice. Hey, go be alone. Good move. Um, but this of course ended my friendship with that piece of shit kid since he confirmed what I had been suspecting about him, about big being a, uh, an asshole. So Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This. So basically the kid stops going into class. He starts drinking every day and he ends up dropping out. So, uh, he's cleaning out basically his room. He goes, so it's my last day. I'm happy, I'm happier than a crack head with a hundred dollar bill, packing my shit up. Then the cock sucker who fucked my girlfriend somehow found me in the hall checking myself out of my room and he comes up to me with this incredible Shitty, shitty eating grin and he says how much he's gonna miss me and that thickly sarcastic tone. And then actually proceeded to pinch my cheek like your grandmother used to when you were six.

Speaker 4:          00:56:11       I'm sure you know the feeling of shaking with rage, being unable to do anything, being unable to do anything. Assaulting a kid at a liberal arts school with security guards right in front of me would get me arrested. But of course I still felt like the world's biggest gaping pussy for not doing anything at all. Something had to be done about this. And here comes the revenge, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, okay. I decided I liked the kids, uh, from the ranch story last week, I decided to fuck with his car. Yeah. Jesus Christ, Dude. You know, that's, that's really not, that's not the man. That's not the, the, uh, that's not the John Wayne move there. You know, you should have, you could have always gone back when the security wasn't there and then just sorta, just fucking smashed him in the face. You, I dunno. So anyway, he decides to fuck with his car.

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       Dude, you're reminded me of that. That, uh, that chicken fast times at Ridgemont high, that's what, what's what women do? They write dick or prick on the side of your car or whatever. What am I going to do? Well, I'm going to stop judging. I'll just read the rest of the story. So he had decided to fuck with his car. He had a nice Jetta and I knew where he parked at every night. So I got a friend to be my lookout as much as a scumbag as I am for fucking with someone else's car. All right. At least he admitted it. Uh, this could not have gone any better. Miraculously, there was, there was this perfect gap in the security patrols given me just enough time to key every panel on his car and slash all four tires until I was back on the sidewalk with my friend.

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       Uh, immediately up to finishing security guard showed up. Bill old people started doing their early morning walk to Cetera, and I got the fuck out of there. Within an hour, I caught a bus to Seattle and commerce started working almost immediately. Only an hour in front of my friend's apartment. And hour later in front of my friend's apartment, I started feeling awful. I went from feeling totally fine to having a, a hallucinatory fever. Uh, I lay in my friend's bed for an entire day until around four when apparently that Jack has discovered what I did to his car and called my phone over and over from a number from his number, then from all my friends' phones, etc. I don't remember much of, is this conversation, but I do know I was trying to be a tough guy. Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So the kid kept calling for months and months. Eventually I stopped answering his calls, but he, he kept calling, dude, you fucked with a cycle.

Speaker 4:          00:58:45       You know, when he came up and pinched your cheek like that, and they said, how much do you do? Realize how, what a sadistic fucking maniac you dealing with. It's probably good. You didn't fucking punch him cause he probably would've came at you like Hannibal lector and fitting the Chunky a cheek right out of your face. But anyway, he said, he even called me on Christmas almost a month later when he would call it these times, it's always on available, blah, blah, blah blah. Oh, this is a good party. I'd answer. And he'd start making heavy breathing noises after awhile. Like those telephone perverts women were afraid of in the 1960s

Speaker 4:          00:59:23       a story has a happy ending though. Uh, at one of those hipsters bar, a sort of gothic coffee shop. Actually I managed to hook up with a girl that was probably out of my league by playing off his constant cycle phone calls as though there were other chicks trying to get with me. I don't know whether, does that sound like the number one thing? Well, it's like with revenge. I'm sorry, like that was really choppy, but I swear to God, the kid wrote me like a manifesto. I was really trying and I don't have time to edit these fucking things, but uh, that seems to be people's number one a way of uh, taking revenge on somebody. You know, you got to get out there and uh, fuck with their car. I guess that what's makes it ven right. Revenge has to be sneaky.

Speaker 5:          01:00:12       Bye.

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       See, wait a minute. We've got two guys fuck with a car and we had another guy who took his girlfriend to Disneyland is ex-girlfriend, have cheated on him and did horrific things to her.

Speaker 4:          01:00:25       Ah, you know what it is about revenge. It has to be sneaky because even that chick thought she was going to Disneyland to ride on the tea cups and to get back with this guy and he was actually taken her down there to, to make a porno. Um, do you know something that that's, that's what it is about revenge. I can't deal with, I can't deal with the dishonesty of it. There's just something that just makes you feel like, uh, he just feel dirty. You know, he fuck up somebody's car. You should do it right in front of them. As you look at them with some maniacal look on your face. I mean that would really, you know, when that get them, cause then you'd be like, wow, this guy knows I'd fuck him up if he fuck with my car. And not only is he doing in front of me, he made sure he called out my name. So I saw him doing it. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:01:15       Got It.

Speaker 4:          01:01:16       You know what their minds me on what time? I saw this crazy white dude on the subway and he was rapping some song and that had the n word in it and it was like 10 black people on the train. Okay. And he's dropping the n bomb every five seconds.

Speaker 5:          01:01:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:31       I like, I'm a crazy Edward, some something, some crazy and we're doing the best they can. And then he'd go, whew. He just kept doing it over and over out of his fucking mind. But why is hell all the downtown six back in the day when I lived on the upper east side, he kept saying it over and over again and it was like, you know, was a subway. It was like 10, 15 black dudes on the train who was a white dude. He's dropping the Edwards. Every white person knows if you fucking do that, if it's instantaneous asking. But I think that that's what saved him is because he was so overtly doing it. All the black people looked at him. We're like, this guy knows we're going to kick the fuck out of him yet he's still doing it. So then you do the quick math.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       Oh, he's fucking crazy. He's crazy. Okay, I'm going to fight this guy and he's going to bite me and I'm going to get hepatitis. So that's the, uh, I don't know what the fuck point up front and make that. That's how you get out of, I guess, you know, not getting your ass kicked because if you can truly convince people that you're fucking crazy, like people just, they, they, they don't, they don't mess with you. So that's what you should've done then did you want to keep this fucking car in front of them? They just have a maniacal look on your face and every other sentence just scream out. Woo. And they leave you alone. Anyone after dealt, dealt with the phone calls and then again you wouldn't hooked up with the chicken, the coffee shop. I don't know. Let's get to the podcast questions.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       Shall We? I get a, I get fucking, I get a cold here. Okay. I'm making excuses for that last two minutes. That didn't even make sense. All right, podcast question number one. So you talked about wanting to have a kid now, now that you're getting older, I'm just curious to know if you would want him or her to hear your podcasts considering you can don't things like revenge. I love how people don't listen to me. I don't condone revenge. I've said that on every podcast, but I do find the stories interesting. And I will comment and laughed at the shit that you did. I don't condone what Scarface did, but I can enjoy him shooting up people in the end of the movie, you know? Anyway, so he, but anyways, the way this guy heard it, maybe I've maybe out, you know, maybe I wasn't clear about what I was saying.

Speaker 4:          01:03:50       So anyways, uh, the way he heard it is basically I condone things like prevention. He said, I, he busting a nut on your x space to make her feel like a whore for cheating on you. I'm not criticizing you. I'm sincerely interested in knowing if having a child will change your perception on things because as I close in on 40, I'm feeling the same way, wanting to finally have a kid and it makes me consider if I should adjust my moral compass beforehand because I would want my son or daughter to have me as a decent role model. Your situation is a little more precarious in the your future. 10 year old son could find an old copy of bill burrs. Greatest hits. And here I was, father thinks that common a girl's hair is the best prescription for heartbreak. Keep up the good work.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       Ah, all right Michael. This is how I view this type of shit. Um, for me to actually think about anything that I'm saying on this podcast about actually having a child that I don't even have is the quickest way of making these podcasts horrifically. Unfunny. Um, um, I actually, I have major problems with parents and how once they have kids, they all of a sudden start acting like they're not the fucking frat boy date rapists that they used to be. And not only do they act that way, want everyone else to behave that way too, because they knocked up the check that they're with and it's like, dude, I did knock up my curl. Okay. I'm still having a good fucking time. You know what I mean? So if my, you know what, why don't, why don't I do the rest of his pod, this, this moment right now, like my future 10 year old son is actually listening to the archives.

Speaker 4:          01:05:36       Hey son, what's going on? It's your dad. I hope I didn't fuck up the first 10 years of your life. Listen son, if you're taking anything that I say on these podcasts remotely, seriously, I've completely failed as a parent and I want you to go outside and fall on a fucking lawn dart. Cause I'm going to start over again and I'm going to make another kid and a, I'm the teaching them to learn how to fucking take a joke. I don't know. You don't want I got halfway through that and just got fucking creepy. I just told him my future kid to kill himself, you know, with a toy that has been banned. Um, no, to be honest with you, no, I never, I never think about what you're asking me. Do I swear to God? Is the formula for not becoming funny? You know, that's what comedians do is they get older, they have kids and all of a sudden they stopped cursing on stage and they stay one of the role model.

Speaker 4:          01:06:30       And uh, that's when shit just starts going down hill. And, uh, you know, you want to start doing family movies, you know, and, uh, I'm not doing that. Okay. I'm a comedian. Nothing I say should be taken seriously if you take it seriously, if that's not my problem. Uh, even if you are my kid, I'm be honest with my kid. You know what I mean? Now people like try to shelter their kids and tell them that there's a Santa clause and everything like that. And you know, I don't know about that. Like if somebody does something really weird and then my kids like, why did somebody, why did that person do that? I'd be like, you know what son? Because most people are cons, you know, I know it's a harsh reality and uh, enjoy your coloring years sun, cause it's only gonna get worse.

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       I wasn't going to get worse. All Right, Bill listening to, uh, okay, bill listening to the newly discovered podcast. You all, this is the guy. You know what? This guy, I'm going to, I'm going to say this guy for this, this right here. Not as whole email. But this email right here, I think this guy earns Douche bag of the, uh, of the fucking week because he goes, you should charge for your podcast and up the production value or just leave them as they are. Just don't keep mentioning that they're free like other podcasts is due. It's a bit Douchey when you do that. You know what? Why don't you go fuck yourself? How about you do that? Is that, do she, if I tell you that you fucking cunt, they'll tell me what to do in this fucking podcast is free. I don't need to do this.

Speaker 4:          01:08:07       Shift going to tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to do these. All right? So go fuck yourself on your first paragraph. But because I'm such sweetheart, I'll read the rest of it. The rest of it. You don't bug me. You're a Douche in your first paragraph. Uh, Bill. So with the Vinny call you to come in, I kind of assume you are a drummer like me and with the headphone comment drummer headphones gotta be right. Uh, I've got to be right. So if you are a drummer and listen through headphones, listen to Steve, Steve, oh seven days, then in parentheses it says a sting field with gold. All they did, they did a cover of that. Yeah. I don't know if you guys listened to the podcast, but that's I'm kind of into, I've been starting to buy records. I started buying them again and uh, find like some concept albums and that's, you know, those all those great old albums.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       So just a great, somebody sent me, somebody wrote something on the Internet where they would just, they were bitching about music today and they said something to the effect of how, you know, how bummed they worked because people today don't want to hear good music. I just think that's such a hilarious comment. People today. Yeah. They don't want to hear good music. Oh yeah, that's, that's exactly what it is. It has nothing to do with the deregulation of media in the early 1980s which allowed fucking five guys to buy all the fucking radio stations and to run everyone exactly like the other one. Thus limiting the amount of music that can get on the radio. That's not what it is. It's that people then they don't want to hear the music. Is that good music? You shut that off, Mr. I don't want to hear that.

Speaker 4:          01:09:42       I want to hear some awful, I don't want to hear good music. You know, it's funny, there's the cleaning ladies on the outside of the door and she picks, I can't hear. And I know she's listening to me ranting it here, debating whether or not to come in here or not. I know you're out there. Um, John just freaked around. Kind of freaked me out too because I realized that technically I really am not talking to anybody. Um, what was I talking about? Oh yeah, the music. I think there's plenty of good music out there. You just, you get access to find it. It's on the Internet now and possibly on satellite radio. And if you don't have satellite radio, that's one of the most underrated things ever. Uh, it's fucking incredible. And I'm getting it put in my car because, uh, I've rented a few cars recently and they've had satellite ready radio in it, and that's where the good music is.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       That's where the funny radio shows are. That's where it's at when it comes to radio. Man, it's fucking great. And uh, and people curse on the radio, which I enjoy. And if I had a 10 year old son, I let I let him listen to those words because I always heard them from the day I was walking around. I heard him and look at me. I turned out fine and I did two. Stop laughing. I did pay my fucking taxes. I'm not hurting anybody. Um, anyways. Overrated. Underrated. Uh, overrated. This guy says sonic youth. Dot, dot, dot. Really? You know what? I don't know. Are they the ones who are saying a runaway train? How about the kids who runaway runaway Chelsea? I would call it back. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:11:24       something Yak. Ah, Paul Simon. A. Dot dot. Dot. I want to shove an African drum up his ass. Is he black now? Okay. Listen to any Paul Simon album in the late eighties, early nineties. Do you ever think he was just trying to expand as an artist and he was working with different musicians and he went outside of America? You know, it's not like he went out there with a Fubu fucking a tracksuit on when he played with them. Notice I said Fubu staying at times with the, uh, early nineties was Fubu, wasn't it? It was at midnight. You know, Jesus Christ who did the black, now he's standing next to a black guy. He's still wearing those wrangler jeans, those awful hair plugs. Uh, BB King, the other guy says is overrated. He's been milking the legend status for so long. He can't eat. He can't even play a chord. C You two's rattle and hum, dude, I got to agree with you on that one. Bb King, I think. Uh, yeah, I think he might be a little overrated. The guy can't play a chord. A, he does play nicely, but a, if you've noticed, there's not a lot of black people going out to see them. I think it's a pitcher. White people who think he's good.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       That was one of the most ignorant fucking things I'll ever say that really made me laugh. You know, and that guy who sent me the email, I didn't mean that. So in the future, when my 10 year old son hears it ease, I, you know, he's going to know and let Jesus Christ. Why would you put that in my fucking head? I never think shit like that. That's how you know, if you think about ramifications, you never going to be funny. Hey, what if I say this? Won't that hurt someone in the crowd? And then the moment to set it is gone and it's over five batch shows tonight. I'm going to fucking blame you. Hey, like that. Alright. Underrated. Uh, the Mayfield four miles. Kennedy. I have no idea who that is. I'm going to look that up. And Roy Orbison, he's one of those guys who is overrated and underrated. I think he's underrated with the average listener. And he's overrated. When you talk about him, about his, uh, seven octave voice. Hey, I dunno. He really has an amazing range with his voice, but I don't like the sound of it. Is that like sac religious list? Some of the songs he thinks like pretty willing

Speaker 6:          01:14:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:14:02       yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:14:04       [inaudible] you.

Speaker 4:          01:14:06       Oh, kill yourself. He looks like a lesbian. All right. Underrated. Uh, the slight Enos of college chicks. Um, I don't care. Well seeing a Roy Orbison, he died out of nowhere, man. Like I just had a heart attack. That's one of those guys where he dies of a heart attack. You really look at his face and it's like, yeah, I can see the heart attack. He had a blue cheese double chin, underrated the sluttiness of college chicks. I don't care where you went to college, if you lived any, if you lived away at school and weren't getting laid once a week, something must be wrong with your Dick. This is over exaggerating a bit. That's one of my favorite expressions. I think I've ever read over exaggerating. I'm trying to do the math on what the fuck that means. So if you said, if you lived away at school and we're getting laid at least once a week, if you weren't getting late, at least once a week, something must be wrong with your Dick. But that statement is, is overexaggerated over it. So does that mean you're not exaggerating?

Speaker 4:          01:15:08       Does that mean to get laid one and a half times a week? You tag someone and finger bless someone else. I really don't do sex jokes. I believe that that makes me uncomfortable. Uh, but this is over exaggerating. Vimpat ice still. It is ridiculous. I went to a small Catholic college, but you would know about the stories I got from my dorm room. A couple bears, some can't even read this. Do you guys even guys like against using the space bar? A couple of beers, some dim dorm room lighting and slow jam playlists off your laptop and you were in business most of the time. It didn't even matter if your roommates were there. I want to have my roommate wake up to this bitch sitting on my face riding a unicycle. All right, we're going to stop there. Okay, I got it. Dude, you're getting late. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          01:15:59       You know what? That's actually true. I never lived at college, but I definitely hooked up with college girls and I actually hooked up with the girl in the top bunk and her in a roommate now only was in the bottom bunk, but was awake. I have you ever tried to fuck respectfully in respective kind of way? It doesn't really work. Uh, especially when you use a word you can't even pronounce respectively. Does that even, does that even a word? All right. Overrated. Adding why to the end of guys' names, unless you're playing stick ball in the school yard or your grandma calls to wish you a happy birthday. If you're over the age of 18 year old man and should not be referred to as Joey or daddy or any other bullshit name ending and why I'm hoping you would want to punch. The first guy walks up and says, hey Billy, what's up?

Speaker 4:          01:16:52       It's bullshit. You're a man. You should go buy a man's name. You know what? That's exactly right. I actually, when I first game game into this business, I went by Bill Burr and I thought it was too short and too difficult to say. So for like five years I went by Billy and even though it flowed better with my name, anytime anybody called me that I, it just, it, it didn't feel right. It was just like a, unless the guy was some like New Jersey, they have a way of making it sound. All right. Are New York guys, but it's just, I just felt like a little kid. Like I should have been sitting there with my brown sack lunch and after, I don't know how Billy crystal does it, so I would have to agree with you on that one. All right. And I think that's it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:33       I think that's it for the podcast. Uh, I want to thank everyone for listening this week. Uh, it's a little bit on the short side, but um, I don't know. It's weird. I'm up in San Francisco and I got a gig tonight and I want, before I even do the Gig, I want to thank everybody for coming out on a Monday night. I know it's a, you know, it's a work night for you guys. You working hard and that type of shit. So, uh, listen to this. Before we come onto my show, I'm going to try out this new chunk and I'm probably going to bomb, but, uh, definitely going to give you your money's worth. I really appreciate everybody who showed up or who's going to show up or if this is the next day who has showed up? Jesus Christ, they'll get to the point. And on next week I'm going to be at the, uh, not this upcoming weekend, the following weekend, last weekend in March, I'm going to be at the, uh, uh, the house comedy in East Saint Louis.

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       All the information's on a billboard.com and anything else? Oh, and I'm going to be on the opie and Anthony Show. Um, when I got, I got to Atlantic City Day covenant. What is the fucking day? Hold on one second. I got to figure this out. I need a calendar. God dammit. Hang on a second. He knows podcast from school and pretty smooth up until this point. This is just garbage time. You can hang up right now. You don't do this. All right. The Trump marina gig is on April 4th. All right, so that's the Saturday. So Friday the third, second, first, the first, second and third. At least someone would go, I'm going to be on the open. Anthony show him going back into New York and I'm going to visit my, uh, my good friends, um, opie and Anthony and uh, they always hilarious little Jimmy Norton and I'm really excited to get back there.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       Um, it's the number one thing that I miss about living in New York. I fucking loved doing that show. And uh, it is on XM satellite radio because satellite radio was the shit XM two o two. And uh, I'll be doing a taping, an uninformed episode with Joe de Rosa and a, and then is it, I think that's it. Oh, also be at the lake shore theater in Chicago, Illinois on April 3rd look amazing zag. And across the fucking country, not right. And that is it. You guys all have yourself a good week and God bless the United States of America, say no to the marrow and the North American Union and microchips. God bless you.
