capacity building in Central America I

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:01.660
capacity building in Central America I
 

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.930
capacity building in Central America I
think will be to make us to make a

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:03.940

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.890
generalization it's going to be easier
than capacity building in Mexico for a

than capacity building in Mexico for a
 

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.710
than capacity building in Mexico for a
lot of reasons which we can probably

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720
lot of reasons which we can probably
 

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.710
lot of reasons which we can probably
expand on in the Q&amp;A yeah I think some

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720
expand on in the Q&amp;A yeah I think some

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.490
the business model is going to be
beneficial until they start prosecuting

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:41.500
beneficial until they start prosecuting

picked up on their way home so I think
 

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.600

it's absolutely tragic but the sense

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:40.610
it's absolutely tragic but the sense
 

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.220
it's absolutely tragic but the sense
that I'm getting from this perspective

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:42.230
that I'm getting from this perspective
 

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:44.710
that I'm getting from this perspective
on the ground is I think the general

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:44.720
on the ground is I think the general
 

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.170

kidnapping problem in Caracas or
Maracaibo or Venezuela large and I think

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:58.430
Maracaibo or Venezuela large and I think
 

01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:59.350
Maracaibo or Venezuela large and I think
many probably think that they are

01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360
many probably think that they are
 

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.610

the problem with violence whether it be

01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:15.620
the problem with violence whether it be
 

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.830
the problem with violence whether it be
at least in my perception in Latin

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840
at least in my perception in Latin
 

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.640
at least in my perception in Latin
America or in Iraq and Afghanistan is an

issue of political dynamics it's not
 

01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:27.340
issue of political dynamics it's not
necessarily a shortage of trigger

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:27.350
necessarily a shortage of trigger
 

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.770
necessarily a shortage of trigger
pullers and so what you've seen my

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:29.780
pullers and so what you've seen my
 

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.690
pullers and so what you've seen my
perception are not a Latin American is

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:31.700
perception are not a Latin American is
 

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.420

Chavez regime has systematically

01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960
Chavez regime has systematically
 

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.290
Chavez regime has systematically
hollowed out both Venezuelan state and

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:38.300
hollowed out both Venezuelan state and
 

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.470
hollowed out both Venezuelan state and
society in you know to my mind it looks

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480
society in you know to my mind it looks
 

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.720
society in you know to my mind it looks
like not quite as extreme but a similar

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:43.730
like not quite as extreme but a similar
 

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:45.850
like not quite as extreme but a similar
dynamic to what Saddam Hussein did in

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:45.860
dynamic to what Saddam Hussein did in
 

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.470
dynamic to what Saddam Hussein did in
Iraq over the course of the 1980s and

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480
Iraq over the course of the 1980s and
 

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.000
Iraq over the course of the 1980s and
1990s and you end up with an overweening

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:52.010
1990s and you end up with an overweening
 

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.770
1990s and you end up with an overweening
state that is nonetheless not terribly

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:53.780
state that is nonetheless not terribly
 

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.660
state that is nonetheless not terribly
effective and I think that's exactly

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:55.670
effective and I think that's exactly
 

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:57.910
effective and I think that's exactly
what you're seeing in Venezuela because

01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920
what you're seeing in Venezuela because
 

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.960
what you're seeing in Venezuela because
it's too much of a cult of personality

01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:58.970

because loyalty is paramount loyalty not
 

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.500
because loyalty is paramount loyalty not
only to a specific leader but to the

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:08.510
only to a specific leader but to the
 

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:12.070
only to a specific leader but to the
state apparatus and you know in in every

state apparatus and you know in in every
 

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.290

and you know you can point to example

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:24.170
and you know you can point to example
 

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:26.320
and you know you can point to example
after example be it South Vietnam in the

1970s where despite loads of aid I mean
 

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.330
1970s where despite loads of aid I mean
absolutely the most military aid we've

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:31.340
absolutely the most military aid we've
 

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.100
absolutely the most military aid we've
given any country in the world you

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:33.110
given any country in the world you
 

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:34.689
given any country in the world you
couldn't produce an effective army why

01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:34.699
couldn't produce an effective army why
 

01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:36.040
couldn't produce an effective army why
because South Vietnamese people won't

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:36.050
because South Vietnamese people won't
 

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:38.080
because South Vietnamese people won't
fight no it's because this is the state

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.090
fight no it's because this is the state
 

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:40.390

full-blown insurgency it clearly isn't
 

01:12:54.679 --> 01:12:57.490
full-blown insurgency it clearly isn't
yet in in Venezuela or Mexico but it

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.930
 
and this incident here I have two

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:24.940
and this incident here I have two
 

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.880
and this incident here I have two
questions here one is what is the just

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:26.890
questions here one is what is the just
 

01:19:26.890 --> 01:19:28.979
questions here one is what is the just
now you mentioned the institutional new

01:19:28.979 --> 01:19:28.989
now you mentioned the institutional new
 

01:19:28.989 --> 01:19:31.740
now you mentioned the institutional new
Georgian so what is the root cause for

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:31.750
Georgian so what is the root cause for
 

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:35.610
Georgian so what is the root cause for
the for such an institution for the

01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:35.620
the for such an institution for the
 

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:38.640
the for such an institution for the
usual in of the institutions and the

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:38.650
usual in of the institutions and the
 

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:43.229
usual in of the institutions and the
second one is it seems to me that in the

01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239
second one is it seems to me that in the
 

01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:46.290
second one is it seems to me that in the
past 20 years maybe the Violence Unit

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:46.300
past 20 years maybe the Violence Unit
 

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.490
past 20 years maybe the Violence Unit
American has accelerated but can you

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.500
American has accelerated but can you
 

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.800

give us a comparison about what about

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:52.810
give us a comparison about what about
 

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:55.860
give us a comparison about what about
maybe before nineteen ninety before

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:55.870
maybe before nineteen ninety before
 

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:58.560
maybe before nineteen ninety before
because we know after before that time

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:58.570
because we know after before that time
 

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:01.380
because we know after before that time
the economic and Latin America actually

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.390
the economic and Latin America actually
 

01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.420
the economic and Latin America actually
experience the economic in miracles and

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:03.430
experience the economic in miracles and
 

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:05.760
experience the economic in miracles and
then at that time economic situation was

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:05.770
then at that time economic situation was
 

01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:09.270
then at that time economic situation was
very well was good and but after that

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280
very well was good and but after that
 

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.410
very well was good and but after that
and then the economic situation

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420
and then the economic situation
 

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.840
and then the economic situation
deteriorated so do you contribute the

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:17.850
deteriorated so do you contribute the
 

01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:21.290
deteriorated so do you contribute the
increasing imbalance in Latin America to

01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300
increasing imbalance in Latin America to
 

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.270

up your extractive capacity and you see

so that's your off the off the shoot

and so it's it's you know it's a it's a

clear link and in fact there's a

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:41.130
clear link and in fact there's a
 

01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:43.400
clear link and in fact there's a
hierarchy and in an interesting sort of

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:43.410

hitter on the street so there is a link
 

01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:15.680
hitter on the street so there is a link
and that in the hierarchy is a bit

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:15.690
and that in the hierarchy is a bit
 

01:35:15.690 --> 01:35:18.080
and that in the hierarchy is a bit
inverse of how it normally worked and

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:18.090
inverse of how it normally worked and
 

01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:19.729
inverse of how it normally worked and
that's because the Mara's grew up in the

things get a lot better for sort of

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:29.270
things get a lot better for sort of
 

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:30.340
things get a lot better for sort of
weird reasons and one of the interesting

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:30.350
weird reasons and one of the interesting
 

01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:32.709
weird reasons and one of the interesting
things about Salvador is that the areas

01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719
things about Salvador is that the areas
 

01:38:32.719 --> 01:38:34.930
things about Salvador is that the areas
that were insurgent held during the

01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:34.940
that were insurgent held during the
 

01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.780
that were insurgent held during the
1980s tend to be the safest bits in

01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:37.790
1980s tend to be the safest bits in
 

01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:39.790
1980s tend to be the safest bits in
terms of crime and so again you could

01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:39.800
terms of crime and so again you could
 

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.439
terms of crime and so again you could
probably have a whole conference on the

01:38:41.439 --> 01:38:41.449
probably have a whole conference on the
 

01:38:41.449 --> 01:38:43.660
probably have a whole conference on the
dynamics that led to that but in sin

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:43.670
dynamics that led to that but in sin
 

01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:45.310
dynamics that led to that but in sin

because you know as I said it's it's
weird because you have a state that is

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:35.690
weird because you have a state that is
 

01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:37.689
weird because you have a state that is
