ATISSA BANUAZIZI: My
name is Atissa Banuazizi,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.100
and I work in WRAP, Writing,
Rhetoric, and Professional

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.440
Communication, at MIT.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
And I work with classes
across the Institute

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
helping students learn to
write and speak professionally.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.780
The goal is to get
students to learn

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.230
to communicate like
professional practitioners

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.240
of their own disciplines.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
And that is really what
8.13, I think, excels at,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.660
getting students to work, and
think, and talk, and write

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020
like physicists.
