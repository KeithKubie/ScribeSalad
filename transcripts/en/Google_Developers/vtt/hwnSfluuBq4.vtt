TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right
so this is our talk

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.400
today, Surf the Stream.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.860
We're going to be talking
about Google Buzz, location

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.978
and social gaming.

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:13.038
If that's what you're here for
you're in the right room.

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:15.498
If that's not what you're here
for you're in the wrong room,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:19.448
which is sad because this
is going to be really fun.

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:28.618
If you'd like to take a look at
the live notes being taken

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:31.458
about the session on Wave you
can go to the following

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.158
bit.ly link, it's
bit.ly/buzzbingowave.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.880
Also there's a moderator gadget
on there, so you can start

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.658
inputting questions there.

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.298
Also you'll be able to ask
questions live on these

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:46.000
microphones near the
end of the session.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.260
The hashtag for this
session is #buzzbingo.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.400
And there's a URL for the
application we built

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.778
for this session.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:00:58.378
It's buzz-bingo.appspot.com.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.320
Feel free to go there now
and check it out or you

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.458
can check it out later.

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:08.920
I'm Timothy Jordan, I'm
a developer advocate

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.640
working at Google.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.300
BOB AMAN: And I'm Bob Aman.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.420
I'm a developer programs
engineer, also at Google.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We're here
today because one of our

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.140
primary tasks is to work with
the developer community

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.238
building on Google's platforms.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.018
And today we're going to
be talking about the

00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:24.060
Google Buzz API.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.658
If you want to find us online
you can use our Buzzes or our

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:35.800
Twitters, which are
up there as well.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.660
All right, so today we're going
to talk a little bit about the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.860
conversational web
and Google Buzz.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.598
Then we're going to go in and
look at some apps and demos

00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:46.738
that have been build on the
Buzz API or are in process.

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:48.518
We're going to look at
something that ShareThis

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:49.458
has been working on.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:52.540
We're going to look at Boxees
integration with Buzz and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.920
we're going to look at the
game we built for this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840
session, Buzz Bingo.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.560
Afterwards, we're going to talk
a little bit about growing the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.620
Google Buzz ecosystem and at
the end we're going to take

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.840
some questions and hopefully
provide some really

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.460
excellent answers.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.158
All right, so first off,
the conversation web.

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:14.360
As you've probably heard from a
lot of sessions here at Google

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.038
I/O from Chris Chabot, Chris
Messina, Joseph Smarr, John

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:18.618
Panzer and Will Norris.

00:02:18.758 --> 00:02:21.758
they've all been talking a
lot about the conversation

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:22.818
web and Google Buzz.

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:25.420
And the conversational
web is all about good

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.658
internet conversations.

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:32.358
And there's just a few required
elements that we see in a nice

00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:33.818
conversational web apparatus.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.878
First is the ability to post
messages to the internet.

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:42.638
And to be able to include rich
media and links to other places

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:44.278
on the internet in that post.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.138
The ability for people to
respond to that post and

00:02:47.138 --> 00:02:51.918
mention their friends to bring
them into the conversation and

00:02:51.918 --> 00:02:55.138
this is what we consider
the conversational web.

00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:58.838
This ability to have
conversations online as

00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:00.178
if it were in real life.

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:04.058
And our entry into this space
is in fact Google Buzz.

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:08.620
As you can see from this post
by DeWitt Clinton, who linked

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.218
to an article about the Droid
Incredible-- you may have heard

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:17.418
of this phone-- he posted
about this article and people

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:18.458
joined that conversation.

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:22.318
You'll see there's mentions in
line in that conversation and

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.398
people are being brought
into that conversation.

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:26.198
People are linking to this,
there's rich media, it's

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:29.660
really a great way for
people to connect online

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.478
and that's Google Buzz.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.360
All right, so people
are building on top

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.158
of this platform.

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.598
Google Buzz is more than
just the product that's

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:39.558
embedded in Gmail.

00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:42.898
Now you're able to build
applications that work with

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:43.920
Google Buzz outside of Gmail.

00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:49.058
ShareThis has been
working on something.

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:52.798
They if you know them are a
sharing network reaching

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.818
400 million consumers
across 800,000 sites.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:59.998
Their core belief is simple
sharing across channels and

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:03.238
aggregated curation of what's
being shared on the web.

00:04:03.238 --> 00:04:06.518
With the rise of social
plug-ins, widgets of every type

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.740
and flavor it was important to
the ShareThis developer team to

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.038
create a social widget that
aggregates top shared content

00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:16.220
and social comments form
across Google Buzz and other

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.320
networks and services.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.038
And that's what their
stream widget does.

00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:22.418
ShareThis expects the social
stream widget to be available

00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:25.818
to embed on publishers sites
in June and they have a beta

00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:26.578
list open on their site now.

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:30.378
So you can go and check it out
and try and get involved.

00:04:30.378 --> 00:04:32.258
We're excited to see ShareThis
building on its very cool

00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:35.980
widget and can't wait to see
what they'll come up with next.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.398
As you can see from the mocks
here it's a really interesting

00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:40.720
way to take conversations
happening elsewhere on the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.170
internet and embed
them in any site.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.440
Another application that I'd
like to highlight is Boxee.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.020
Boxees's been working with us
to help test the API and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.198
yesterday they introduced some
exciting new applications.

00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.600
Boxee users will be able to
share what they're watching

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.200
with friends on Google Buzz and
to import their Buzz feed into

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.198
Boxee to watch video
from their friends.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:05.078
And now you can see video
recommendations from friends

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:09.620
on Google, Buzz, Twitter,
Facebook and Boxee itself.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.440
As they say over at Boxee it's
like being able to channel

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.058
surf through water-cooler
conversation from your coach.

00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:18.360
Let's take a quick look.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.338
On the Boxee home screen you'll
be able to see a list of items

00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:25.152
from Google Buzz in your
feed on the left there.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.818
You click on one that looks
interesting and then it shows

00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:31.240
you the Buzz comment and
links you to the video.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.300
You hit play and you start
watching that video right away,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.138
shared to you from Google Buzz.

00:05:40.698 --> 00:05:42.860
Once you've decided you want to
share something all you have to

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.278
do is in the upper right-hand
corner hit that heart

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.118
icon to share.

00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:50.412
Enter custom text ot just
tell your followers you love

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:52.578
it and send them a link.

00:05:52.578 --> 00:05:54.800
We think this type of shared
recommendation is going to

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.160
be really cool and you can
check it out now on Boxee.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.258
All right and this is the
third demo that we wanted

00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:02.578
to show you today.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:04.498
This is what we built for
this session and it's

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:08.138
called Buzz Bingo.

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:10.660
Essentially this game is
Buzz Bingo as you've see

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.978
at conferences before.

00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:15.398
You get a Bingo board and it's
filled with keywords and you

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:18.878
mark them off and
you get a Bingo.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.578
But in this case you're playing
Buzz Bingo through Google Buzz.

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:25.160
So by joining conversations
you're marking off

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.758
keywords on that board.

00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:30.078
So I'm just going to take you
quickly through an overview

00:06:30.078 --> 00:06:31.378
here and then we'll look at
some screenshots and

00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:32.618
we'll do a demo.

00:06:32.618 --> 00:06:35.040
So first off you would
sign-in and auth for Buzz.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.960
It'll then generate
a board for you.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.520
You join conversations, it'll
mark the board with the

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.378
keywords in those conversations
that you've joined and

00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:46.358
eventually you get Bingo.

00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:49.338
Let's start with signing-in
and authing for Buzz.

00:06:49.338 --> 00:06:51.998
Pretty much you land on this
page, buzz-bingo.appspot.com.

00:06:55.878 --> 00:07:00.240
You sign-in to the game and
for this Cammy Crepe our

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.058
lovely test user, will be
signing-in to the game.

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:05.798
And we get brought to an
authorization screen.

00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:10.300
It tells you or any user what
this application will be

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.598
allowed to do with your data.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:19.920
Hit OK, grant the access and
then you've authed four of us.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.660
The game will then generate a
board for you and you'll notice

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.178
all the boards that it
generates are with keywords

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:32.120
from Google IO sessions
here today and yesterday.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.938
You then go out and join
conversations on Buzz.

00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:41.700
So in this case we see Tina
Tamarind has mentioned that

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.420
she's really excited to
come see this session.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.018
And she mentions social
web in her comment.

00:07:47.018 --> 00:07:49.958
Cammy Crepe then makes a
comment on Tina's

00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:57.558
post mentioning
buzzbingo.io@gmail.com and

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.278
we've joined that conversation.

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:03.998
The game will then find that
mention, look for keywords,

00:08:03.998 --> 00:08:09.238
and mark it off on
the Buzz Bingo Board.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:14.200
And eventually you get 5 in
a row and there's a Bingo.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.018
So it's a pretty
simple concept.

00:08:16.018 --> 00:08:19.898
What we think is a really fun
game built on Buzz and it uses

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:22.138
the Buzz APIs built
with App Engine.

00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:26.758
So let me do a quick demo here.

00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:37.740
Essentially I'm just going
to switch over to Cammy's

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.320
Buzz Bingo Board here.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.020
As you can see I've started
a new game and I have

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.120
App Engine marked off.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.360
I'm going to go over to this
other tab, this really

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.380
interesting article about our
new WebM video fomat and I'm

00:08:51.380 --> 00:09:00.540
going to Buzz about it.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:07.140
And I include the link.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.900
I'll even put an image,
how about that?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.020
And I'm going to mention
buzzbingo.io@gmail.com.

00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:23.920
Post this Buzz and it's
as simple as that.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.580
In a moment I'll go back over
to the board and you'll

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.640
see that HTML5 will be
marked off on that.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.380
It's just as simple as that.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.740
Being able to join
conversations on Buzz as part

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.298
of a game was something that
we found was really,

00:09:36.298 --> 00:09:37.320
really interesting.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.440
This idea of social gaining,
but occurring in a

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.300
conversational web format.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.060
All I have to do is make this
post and the App Engine game

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.018
will go out on the internet
and find that Buzz post

00:09:50.018 --> 00:09:52.360
using the Buzz API.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.900
Find that keyword in that post
and mark it off on the board.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.460
Let me switch back over
to the board here and

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.300
there we have it.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.980
The HTML5 square has
been marked off.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.100
Yay, the demo worked.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.374
Let me switch to
the slides here.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.940
All right, now I'm going to
turn it over to Bob who will go

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.400
a little bit more in depth with
how this works technically.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.112
BOB AMAN: All right, so I'm
going to be showing a lot

00:10:44.112 --> 00:10:46.280
of the code that we
used to build this.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.880
It's all written in Python
and it runs on App Engine.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.480
This is the architecture
diagram of how it's all set up.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.986
Your user is going to interact
through the-- is my mic

00:11:01.986 --> 00:11:05.500
working?-- through the Buzz UI
and they're also going to

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:11.560
interact through the Buzz
Bingo game on App Engine.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.540
And the game will also
communicate with the Buzz API,

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.900
which in turn also talks to us.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.500
So I'm going to walk through
the flow that we were

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.920
talking about earlier.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.080
Starting with signing-in
and authing for buzz.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.680
So this is the code that you
use to build your client

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.800
and authorize it.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.020
So the first thing you
have to do is set up

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.040
your oauth consumer.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.040
You have to obatin a oauth
consumer key in secret.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.480
You can do that from a
page on the accounts API.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.120
You have to register your
domain and it gives

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.200
you the secret back.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.140
And you need to
specify a scope.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.080
We're using a full access
scope here, but there's

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.760
also a read-only scope
that you can use.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.960
So the first step after you
have setup your consumer is

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.320
to obtain the request token.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:21.240
The request token, you need
to specify a callback, but

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.500
otherwise that's the only
parameter that you need.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.370
And you generate an
authorization URL using

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.720
that request token.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.432
You do need to first save
the request token to

00:12:33.432 --> 00:12:35.340
the datastore though.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.880
Then you redirect the user to
the authorization URL that was

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.920
built and that looks like this.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.700
And the user, once they click
through this page they will be

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.300
redirected back to the callback
that you gave them and that

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.820
callback will have a parameter
called the oauth verifier.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.400
You look up the request token
in the data store and pass that

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.178
back to the client and then you
have your access token which

00:13:11.178 --> 00:13:16.300
you fetch from the accounts API
using the verifier that it

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.760
gave you in the callback.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.180
And then you've upgraded your
request token to an access

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.060
token and you can save
that to the datastore.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.120
Now you have full
access to the API.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.020
Once have access to the API we
proceed to generate the board.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.220
The way that we do that is
actually pretty simple.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.140
We have a predefined
topic list, which we've

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.180
stored in a constant.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.420
We just choose 24 of the topics
at random just iterating

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:54.440
through the list picking 1 of
the topics until we

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.898
finally have a list
containing 24 items.

00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:01.738
And then we go and we
actually generate the

00:14:01.738 --> 00:14:02.900
scores in the board.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.700
We don't care about the
free space in the center.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.080
There's no topic for that so if
x and y are 2 we skip over it

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.720
and we commit the square
to the datastore.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.120
We name the key based on the x
and y location so that it is

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.420
fast to do the lookup for it.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.620
We give each square the topic
that's associated with it.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.820
And then for the convenience of
accessing it we then inserted

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.040
into a two-dimensinal array
inside our player

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.080
data structure.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.280
So then the user goes out and
they join conversations.

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:48.220
And while they're out joining
conversations the App

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.240
Engine game is pulling the
consumption feed for the

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.860
buzzbingo.io@gmail.com user.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:04.920
So it tries to mark off your
board as these tasks are run.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:12.640
So the first thing that happens
when we go to scan a new post

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:20.200
is we take the comment text and
the post text and we search

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.160
through our predefined list of
topics and we basically pull

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.880
out all of the comment or all
of the keywords that appear in

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.400
that topic list and we save
that in the topics found array.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.140
And then we take the list of
topics that the player actually

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.640
has that appear on their
board and we calculate the

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.800
intersection between the two.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.360
Because you're only going to
score topics that are on your

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.040
board and appeared in the
comment that we care about.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.060
And we're actually scoring
multiple players at the same

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.344
so that's why we have to
do this intersection here.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.240
And then we pick one of the
topics at random from the

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.180
intersection and score
the post on that topic.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.060
And when you go to score a post
you can only do that once per

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.420
player and it enforces that.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.980
When you go to score the
player-- or sorry, score the

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.340
post-- it then goes and
tries to award badges.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.720
And we have a whole bunch of
conditions that we check to

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.380
figure out which badge we
should award at any given time.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.540
So for example, with the share
and share alike badge that

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.820
Timothy demonstrated earlier
when he shared an article we

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.180
checked the post
for attachments.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.960
And if we find an attachment
of type article then we award

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.020
the player the share badge.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:55.720
If we have a geocode on the
post and the author of the post

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.160
wasn't the player then we know
that they've joined a

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.020
conversation with a geocode
metadata on it and we

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.720
award them the geo badge.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.700
But if on the other hand, it
was the player then we award

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.800
them the mobile badge for
posting a relevant comment

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.418
from their mobile phone.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.240
And when we give out a badge we
want to send a message to the

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.460
player telling them, hey we've
awarded you a badge, so we

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.940
start to assemble a message
that we transmit back

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.180
to the Buzz API.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.660
And so the first thing we do is
we create a badge attachment

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.640
containing the icon of the
badge we're awarding and we

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.640
assign that a type of photo.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.120
But we also want to advertise
the game so we attach a link

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.720
attachment to the game itself
so that you can easily

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.080
navigate back to the game.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.400
And we assign that a type
of article, a title, and

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.580
the appropriate URI.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.940
And then we go to actually
construct the post itself.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.920
We give it some post content,
we give it the two attachments

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.660
that we assembled just prior
and we decided that we wanted

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.840
to geocode all of the
posts to Mosconi.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.220
So we have a venue geocode
and place ID that we attach

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.880
to the post as well.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.200
And then finally we just simply
call a client, create post with

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.280
the post data structure
that we've built.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.310
And then finally when we want
to go determine that you've

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.600
made a Bingo we use
this algorithm.

00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:41.618
It's pretty simple.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.360
We have initialized two arrays,
which basically are the counts

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:53.180
of all of the marked posts in
each row and column and then we

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.020
just iterate over the board and
increment each of

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.080
those counters.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.778
And if any of the counters
reach 5 then you've

00:18:59.778 --> 00:19:00.518
achieved a Bingo.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.940
The interesting thing that we
did here to make it really

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.640
simple is we add the two ones
in the center there and that's

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.858
just for the free space.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.900
Then we award you the Bingo
badge if you have 5 of them.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.760
In order to keep track of the
leader board we also increment

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.700
a Bingo count so that you can
see who has the most Bingos

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.380
in the game so far.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.480
The source code for Buzz
Bingo is open source.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.000
So if you want to take a look
at what we've done you can go

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.100
to that URL and take
a look around.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.440
There's some really
interesting stuff in there.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.748
I sort of glossed over a lot
because it's just way out of

00:19:43.748 --> 00:19:46.340
scope, but it goes into a
lot of depth in the source.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.420
And you can play
around with that.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.578
You can run it on your own App
Engine instance if you like.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.160
The Google Buzz
API is live now.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.700
The documentation is here
and I'm going to turn it

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:01.920
back over to Timothy.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, so
one the reasons Bob and I

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.360
wanted to do this is that we
thought it would be fun to

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.920
write something that
was innovative.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.940
Something that you wouldn't
expect to be built on

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.020
the Buzz platform.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.340
You wouldn't necessarily expect
to be playing a social game on

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.020
a conversational web product,
but I think we've demonstrated

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.400
that not only can you build it,
but it's actually kind of cool.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.598
And I hope that you do all have
a chance to go out to

00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:35.680
buzz-bingo@appspot.com and play
with this and also to take a

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.750
look at the open source project
to see how it's built.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:47.480
At Google it's important for us
to make it easy for people to

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.420
build on top of our products
and even more importantly to

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.260
use open standards to do that.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.038
In the Buzz API we're using
activity streams, we're using

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:02.760
oauth, we're PubSubHubBub
and we're using Salmon.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.190
And these are open protocols,
they're opened standards that

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.060
are being used acrossed
the web today.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.960
And they're also what the
Buzz API is built upon.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.300
That makes it easy for
something like this, this

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.460
is the topology of the
game as it is today.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.420
This is what it actually looks
a little bit more like with the

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.118
activity streams and Salmon and
oauth and PubSubHubBub being

00:21:27.118 --> 00:21:31.858
the glue, being what holds
the Buzz API together.

00:21:31.858 --> 00:21:35.680
It can then become
something more like this.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.098
Is that although this game was
built with Buzz in mind, by the

00:21:41.098 --> 00:21:45.758
user interacting with the App
Engine app or interacting with

00:21:45.758 --> 00:21:47.240
the Buzz product itself.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.598
One day we're hoping that a
product like this could also be

00:21:51.598 --> 00:21:54.580
built for Buzz, it could be
built for Cliqset, it could be

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.358
built for Blogger, it could
be built for StatusNet.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.618
Because they're all using
the same protocols.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.480
We feel pretty strongly that
these protocols are a really

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.560
great choice and we're
excited that the API

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.956
is built upon them.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.278
And with that I'm hoping that
before we get to answer some

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:13.058
questions that you're all
feeling pretty inspired to go

00:22:13.058 --> 00:22:15.880
out there and build your own
products on the Buzz API.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.380
We've got some really
great resources out

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.700
there to help you.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.720
There are the docs on the code
site, which I believe is

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:30.880
code.google.com/API/buzz/docs
and from there you can also

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.934
find the developer forum
that's really, really useful.

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:38.480
So I'd like to open it up
for questions and answers.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.838
You can go to the wave
bit.ly/buzzbingowave and type

00:22:42.838 --> 00:22:46.600
in your questions in the
moderator there or you can step

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.264
up to one of these microphones
in the center of the room and

00:22:51.264 --> 00:22:53.316
ask your question live.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.400
AUDIENCE: So this is just a
general question about Buzz.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.578
It seems like it has a lot of
similar feature sets to Wave

00:23:15.578 --> 00:23:19.280
and when I first saw it pop up
I thought, oh, they must of

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.438
implemented Wave in Gmail now
and they're calling it

00:23:22.438 --> 00:23:28.140
Buzz, so why are they
2 separate products?

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You know,
that's a question that I've

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.038
heard a couple times and I
can tell you my personal

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:36.500
opinion on the differences
between Wave and Buzz.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.040
I typically use Wave as a
living document product.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.900
If I want to have a
conversation with somebody, I

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.460
want that to last a long time
and I'd like that to eventually

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.290
have that become kind of a
document that's a great

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.240
use case for Wave.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.300
Whereas, Buzz is more like
your daily conversations

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.780
or idea sharing.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.140
And I think the feature sets
involved in both products

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:10.460
really sort of support those
2 different use cases.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.100
All right, I'm going to turn to
the moderator gadget unless

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.664
anybody else wants to
step to a microphone.

00:24:13.664 --> 00:24:15.320
It's lots of fun.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.800
Oh, we got another
live question.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.280
AUDIENCE: Kind of piggy backing
off of that last question, are

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:26.320
we going to see more real time
in that daily conversational

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.800
activity stream that Buzz is?

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.640
Well, using some
elements from Wave.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm not
sure if I understand

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.100
the question correctly.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.650
You're asking, is there
going to be more real

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.500
time interaction on Buzz?

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.700
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah, one of
the features we see with Wave

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:51.178
is you know, active in context
conversations, right?

00:24:51.178 --> 00:24:52.540
So you can see the cursor,
for example, moving.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:59.770
That's not Buzz in a way, is
that done purposefully or

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.160
is there going to be more
of this live in context

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.600
conversations within Buzz?

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well I know in
the Buzz product today if you

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.780
were commenting on a post and
somebody else were to comment

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.840
on a post that would show up
in real time in the page.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.740
Is that the kind of thing
you're talking about?

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.960
Yeah, so I think some of
those features are already

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.440
build in, but you know--

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.680
BOB AMAN: Yeah we support
PubSubHubBub as already built

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.000
in and that's actually
already live and works.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Are you
familiar with PubSubHubBub?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.960
AUDIENCE: Yep, yep.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.900
BOB AMAN: Yeah, it works.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
totally in there and

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.840
it works swimmingly.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.860
Let's see if there are
questions up here.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:26:03.280
Well, so this first question,
is there any plan to integrate

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.700
Google linked Buzz services
such as reader so that when

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.400
sharing an item in reader the
users who both get the Buzz and

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.700
subscribe to the reader feed
only get the Buzz or read it in

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.960
reader only and not
see it in Buzz?

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.020
So this seems like a
de-duplication across

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.140
multiple services question.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.660
BOB AMAN: We are exposing ids
that we can use to de-dupe.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.720
And we already have a lot
of code in there for

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.786
doing de-duping.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:39.400
But I honestly didn't quite
understand the question.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:39.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:50.980
BOB AMAN: That would be
awesome, please clarify.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.940
AUDIENCE: You're basically
right on the money.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.260
It's a duplication, right.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.500
So I have my friend over
there, he gets both my Reader

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.280
feed and Buzz from me.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.618
He sees it in both.

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:03.080
We go into reader we have
to mark it as read in

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.460
Reader as seen in Buzz.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.900
and basically it seems like
kind of backwards from sharing.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.840
We want to mark it as read in
Reader automatically if he saw

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.800
it in Buzz and vice versa.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.860
BOB AMAN: OK, so we are
planning on supporting the Atom

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:25.880
cross-posting extension and
we're basically going to, at

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.080
any time a feed comes into Buzz
the id of that feed will then

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.170
get exposed on the way back out
in the Atom cross-posting

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.798
extension so that any other
services that are consuming

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:42.940
those feeds and looking at them
can do intelligent

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.460
things with that.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.632
And so it should be perfectly
possible to do that.
480
00:27:51,594 --&gt; 00:27:51,558
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Next question
here, how is a user supposed

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.620
to interact with both
Buzz and Wave together?

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:06.078
I just see Wave as
an improved Buzz.

00:28:06.078 --> 00:28:09.200
I think that's sort of
similar to the question--

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.760
BOB AMAN: Yeah, the
previous question.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think there
are really 2 different products

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.960
with 2 different use cases.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.400
Will Android users anytime soon
be able to upload captured

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.600
videos to their Buzz?

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.140
I don't know, but that
sounds really cool.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.920
BOB AMAN: It certainly does.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right now you
can upload to YouTube and you

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.838
can share YouTube videos
directly in a Buzz

00:28:32.838 --> 00:28:34.080
by linking to them.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.360
And that works very, very well.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.020
BOB AMAN: And you can also do
that through the API with the

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.120
client library that I showed.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Are there
any plans to-- oh,

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.440
that's the same one.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.500
Are there any plans to link
Google Buzz with Facebook

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.540
as has already been done
with Twitter and YouTube?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.780
I have no idea.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.860
BOB AMAN: It's a good question.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.200
Perhaps address it to
press@google.com.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.838
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, they
would be good ones to ask.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.338
The integration of Buzz into
Latitude has been very

00:29:03.338 --> 00:29:05.860
successful, are there
any plans to introduce

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.318
a check-in feature?

00:29:07.318 --> 00:29:08.000
I think that's a
really cool idea.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.298
I don't know if we've done
anything along those

00:29:13.298 --> 00:29:17.320
lines or not, but I'll
mention it to the team.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.200
Do we have any other
questions live from the

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.360
audience in studio?

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.098
No questions.

00:29:29.098 --> 00:29:30.700
Do we have anything else
to say about the API?

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.160
We've got a few minutes left.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.260
BOB AMAN: We have 3 client
libraries available.

00:29:38.858 --> 00:29:40.680
All of them make it
really easy to develop

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.980
against the Buzz API.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We
have a Python one.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.420
BOB AMAN: Python, PHP and Java.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And then I'm
also going to be working on an

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.700
action script one that should
come out in a few weeks or so.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:56.078
BOB AMAN: And there's a CSharp
library in progress as well.

00:29:56.078 --> 00:29:58.040
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So if writing
the code from scratch isn't

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.558
your thing there are libraries
available that makes

00:30:01.558 --> 00:30:02.900
this quite a bit easier.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.338
In fact, for the App Engine
game Bob used the Python

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:12.118
library to do it, which I
understand made it lots easier.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:31.640
Let me just bring up some
of those code pages.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.100
All right, so this is the
documentation and it's

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.140
written very well.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.500
I think you guys will really
enjoy it, so I encourage

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.780
you to visit this website.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.200
BOB AMAN: Yeah, it would help
if it was on the right screen.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There we are.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.700
I encourage you to visit
this website and check

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.020
out the API online.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.558
Look at this documentation.

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:54.960
Take a look at the libraries
available for working with the

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.840
Buzz API and think up something
really cool to do

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.380
and go for it.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:04.240
If you have any trouble get
in touch, we'd love to help.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.160
And with that I
think we're good.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.538
If you'd like to come up and
ask us any more questions

00:31:08.538 --> 00:31:11.088
off mic you're more
than welcome to.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:17.020
BOB AMAN: Thank you.
