00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.050
This ones the opposite. Now our Y value is $500, because ticket price is on the

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.160
Y axis. We plug the Y value in for our equation and we need to solve for X.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.620
What distance traveled will cost $500. Since this is a positive relationship.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.176
Any distance less than this value after we solve for it will cost less than

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:32.238
$500. We'll subtract $160.13 from both sides and then we'll divide by 0.2 on

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:39.650
both sides. We get that x, or the number of miles, is about 1700. Therefore, if

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.445
you travel less than that distance, you can expect that you'll pay less than

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:45.909
$500.
