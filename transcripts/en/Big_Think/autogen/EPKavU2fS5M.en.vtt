00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
policy it you know has reached a
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790
policy it you know has reached a
historical low and they basically are

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
historical low and they basically are
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.740

administration is kind of unthinkable

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180
administration is kind of unthinkable
 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.110
administration is kind of unthinkable
I'm not sure how how long lasting that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
I'm not sure how how long lasting that
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479
I'm not sure how how long lasting that
is I think some of that can change with

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
is I think some of that can change with
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010
is I think some of that can change with
the new administration if there's an

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
the new administration if there's an
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500
the new administration if there's an
Obama or Clinton or even and McCain

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
Obama or Clinton or even and McCain

that they do with with a George Bush

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
that they do with with a George Bush
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.750
that they do with with a George Bush
administration but I do think that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
administration but I do think that
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240
administration but I do think that
underlying that there is a bigger

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
underlying that there is a bigger
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700
underlying that there is a bigger
difference between now and the past

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
difference between now and the past
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.260
difference between now and the past
which is the fact that the Cold War has

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
which is the fact that the Cold War has
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.870
which is the fact that the Cold War has
ended and Europeans no longer depend on

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
ended and Europeans no longer depend on
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.530
ended and Europeans no longer depend on
the u.s. to protect them in the way that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
the u.s. to protect them in the way that
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240
the u.s. to protect them in the way that
they did during the Cold War and I think

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
they did during the Cold War and I think
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609
they did during the Cold War and I think
that that was a big structural change

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
that that was a big structural change
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319
that that was a big structural change
which is much more important than the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
which is much more important than the
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.149
which is much more important than the
Iraq war and maybe what happened over

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
Iraq war and maybe what happened over
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.130
Iraq war and maybe what happened over
the Iraq war was a reflection of the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
the Iraq war was a reflection of the
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.679
the Iraq war was a reflection of the
fact that Europeans could afford not to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
fact that Europeans could afford not to
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.060

some European governments could afford

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
some European governments could afford
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710
some European governments could afford
not to back the u.s. because they didn't

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
not to back the u.s. because they didn't
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.270
not to back the u.s. because they didn't
need American protection the way they

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
need American protection the way they
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
need American protection the way they
did

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750
 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.459
I think there are obsessive watches of

I think there are obsessive watches of
 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.499

energized lots of Europeans and I think

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
energized lots of Europeans and I think
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.580
energized lots of Europeans and I think

American political system has to
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.059
American political system has to
reinvent America and to give itself a
