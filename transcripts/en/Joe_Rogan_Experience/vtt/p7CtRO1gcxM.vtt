1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
My road and that road may or may not lead you in a good direction,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.270
but you're going to stay on that fucking road.

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:09.270
If you're attached to an ideology and it could be a terrible road,

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.500
it could be a road of,
you know,

5
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.410
circumcise your daughter's clearest because that's a fucking tradition.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.550
I mean these fucking crazy pitches in Africa than cut holes in their lip and

7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.590
stretch them out to put plates on.
Why is that?

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.720
Because they got on a fucking road and they stick.

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.660
They stuck with that road regardless of rational thinking.

10
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.250
They didn't use rational thinking at all.

11
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
They're just adapted a predetermined pattern or behavior that makes life so much

12
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.550
more simple and that's what every fucking religion is.

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.490
The problem is no one knows you cannot.
No.

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
You can have your own beautiful personal experiences.

15
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.410
You could have been the person that was actually touched by God,

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.500
but when you start yelling and random whatever,
who left the following behind,

17
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.320
you got two things going on at the same time,

18
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.730
Christian is going to be taken away first.
I know you're full of shit.

19
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.250
I know you're full of shit.

20
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.700
And you know your full chef and the real problem is you can't say it because

21
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.330
everybody's got this freedom of religion,
freedom of religion,
religious freedom,

22
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:58.620
the freedom to express yourself.

23
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.180
Even if you're expressing yourself with nonsense,
nonsense that helps.
Scared,

24
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.290
lonely,
sad.

25
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.800
People lock onto that nonsense so they feel like they're a part of something.

26
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.010
I mean,
that's what it is.
That preys on people whose lives fucking stock.

27
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.430
So it's all nuts.
It's not like your shit's cool at,
it's not,
and it's not big.

28
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340
You know,
Yoga is the answer or fucking mushrooms are the answer.
There's,

29
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.240
there's just questions and until we're honest about that,

30
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
we're never going to evolve as human race is stuck in a giant quagmire when it

31
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:32.550
comes to our behavior and our thinking about our behavior.

32
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.120
But there comes a certain point in time where you have to pop train out and you

33
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:40.230
have to recognize that all this morality that you've developed is good because

34
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.730
it's good to treat other people good.

35
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.000
It's good to treat other people the way you'd like to be treated yourself.

36
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.460
That's like a fucking golden rule.
And there's a reason for it.

37
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.880
And that reason is that we're connected in some strange way that we don't

38
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.270
totally understand.
Unless you are good to other people around you,

39
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.210
unless you are kind of friendly and warm and loving,

40
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000
you're not going to fucking enjoy this life.
You're just not.

41
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.580
You're going to be problems everywhere you go,

42
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.230
you're going to have problems everywhere you go.

43
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.100
You got to figure out a way to enjoy this fine line of it's not because of Jesus

44
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.990
is not because of Moses.

45
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:13.350
It's not because of anybody that may or may not have ever existed is because

46
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.620
that's how you fit in better in the world.
That's how you stay positive.

47
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.820
And it doesn't have to be some shit that was written 5,000 years ago on fucking

48
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.470
animal skins.
That doesn't have to be the golden rule because it's old.
You know?

49
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.170
That's dumb.
We need to figure out like now,
today what?
What is,
you know,

50
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.890
the best way to live your life?
What is the,
you know,
there,

51
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.710
there's gotta be ways that you can be putting forward the most positive energy.

52
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:39.860
I mean,
we know objective Lee,
what's causing pollution.
We know objectives,

53
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.270
what's causing birth defects and you know,

54
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.120
and we're taking it too much chemicals and not enough vitamins.

55
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.890
We know objective,
we all this stuff.

56
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.920
We know how to organize our world and yet we don't do it.

57
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.860
We know how to organize our health and yet very few people do it.

58
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.150
We know all these things.

59
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.360
The right path to like being like the happy healthy person is to do all the shit

60
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.140
that we already know you're supposed to do.
Take care of your body,

61
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.280
take care of your health,
take care of your mind,
your stress,
meditate.

62
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.280
Be kind people.
We all know that.
We need to ask anybody.

63
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.680
They know how to get by and to beat the,
the,
the,

64
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.290
the most evolved version of you that you can be mean.
It's not like a,

65
00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:18.310
a magical checklist and you talk to people about it.
You said,
okay,

66
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.320
here you got a person you want to improve them.

67
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:23.590
What are the things that are going to do that?
Okay.
Well,
if I was at life coach,

68
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.170
the first thing I would say is this guy's got to get on a diet that makes them

69
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.540
healthy.
I don't need to die just to lose weight.
I mean,

70
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:33.070
just healthy food in your body needs many,
many vegetables,
vegetables,

71
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.050
a lot of good,
good quality protein,
a lot of water.

72
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.580
Stop the sodas.
Stop the bullshit.

73
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.640
Start working out your body and get a better sense of like Kubus machine feels

74
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.570
when it's moving,
it's flowing better.
There's less tension in it.

75
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:53.950
Your mind feels like we are lax than enjoy every single moment of the day.

76
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.280
Better step one and putting those that stuff right.
What's step two?

77
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:00.550
Be Cool to be relaxed is when people come to smile as many cables,

78
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.970
you can have them smile back at you.
Tip.
Well,
when you go to a restaurant,

79
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.320
it just do the most.
You can be as nice as you can,
you know,
and it just still,

80
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.790
we manage five people walk.
Just get through the assignment.
What else?

81
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.770
Do what you want to do with your life,
right?
Don't,

82
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.500
don't go be doing something you don't enjoy or don't do something.

83
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.700
Don't get locked into,
you know,
a car they can afford and doing something crazy.

84
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.890
If you can need the modeling phone,
do what you want to look for,

85
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.690
fuck days you really want to do because if someone else is doing it,

86
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.460
you can do it.
You know?
I mean everybody makes their own path through this world,

87
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.080
but a lot of people don't follow them path that the real fucking deal.

88
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.980
Hope to the now because for whatever reason you've got negative programming,

89
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.221
you know,
when they're a kid,

90
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:47.610
someone told them to do it or total to take the short Todd or,
or take the,
uh,

91
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.470
the initial route.
That's a sad thing.

92
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.370
That was a little long.
I wisdom.
Very cool though.

93
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.230
It's cool.
It's cool that someone did that.
Whoever

94
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.230
<v 1>did that.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
What is his name?
No name or no name or,</v>

95
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.710
well,
I should find out,
right?

96
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.200
Well I can't because my cunt sucking website is down.
Cons.

97
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.310
Don't you hate that?
They shouldn't.
There's no reason for that.

98
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.180
My website's down a lot.
It really is no reason for that.

99
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:22.450
So I refer to my website is [inaudible] crazy.
Yeah.

100
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.810
This fucking things and as Shit,
I dunno what's happening.

101
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.100
Perhaps it's a dos attack.
Brian,
perhaps we're being attacked by hackers.

102
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.610
Um,
thank you very much for tuning into the podcast.
I'm sorry we're late,

103
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.080
but you know,
shit happens.
We're not very good at starting these things on time.

104
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.500
That's the beautiful thing about the internet and you don't really have to start

105
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:45.940
everything on time.
Yeah.
Do we have an echo going on the background?

106
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.450
It seems like we do.
Don't we go see if that shit is on?
I think it is.

107
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.660
I can't get this right.
I swear to God.
We try and try every week.

108
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.010
That's why you're supposed to have like,
but if you

109
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 2>had an engineer here,
what if he was a Weirdo?
You see the big circular thing,</v>

110
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:02.954
Brian,

111
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.500
<v 1>do you see it?
Yeah.
I just,
you tell him no,</v>

112
00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:11.190
you didn't see that big circular thing.
Touch it and it shuts off.

113
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.750
Okay.
Did you do that middle Starbuck?
Yes.

114
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.420
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's,
it's fuck.

115
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.440
Just shut it off to shut their computer off.
Yes,
there we go.

116
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.000
<v 2>God,
what kind of a show is this?
We have to listen to this.
Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

117
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.110
what I subjected you to,
I apologize.
The best shows are always that word.

118
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.011
Wonder what the fuck.

119
00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:40.740
We're just justifying the fact that we're completely unprofessional.

120
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.010
This show has all are sponsored by the fleshlight laser.
Gentlemen,

121
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.530
if you have not fucked one,
do you do not know what you're missing.

122
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.530
I think that's an official slogan.
Now,
keep it away from teething dog.

123
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.100
Outstanding masturbation device.
Mr. Coleman,
I suggest you use one.

124
00:06:53.101 --> 00:06:57.000
I actually have one for you.
I appreciate that.
I hope my hopes you have.
Yeah,

125
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.710
I got it.
I got one that I saved.
Especially for you.
Thank you.
It's um,

126
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.500
dress it up as a beer can apparently.
Nice.

127
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.900
Or is it pussy and now here it looks like a can.
Oh,

128
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.190
that's hilarious.
So like if you're a closet pervert,
so he gets to be,

129
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:17.510
you got this out,
you gotta you gotta do some weeks played it.

130
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.330
It's worth more if you don't turn it.
Take off the plastic though.
Why is that?

131
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.060
Because it's like more of a collector's item unit.
Fuck.

132
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:26.820
Are you talking about what makes you say a baseball card?
Dude?

133
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.060
It's a fake pussy collecting fake pussy.

134
00:07:30.061 --> 00:07:33.590
That is the craziest thing you've ever said.

135
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.620
Don't want to,
should could be [inaudible] natural light.

136
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.210
You snapped me out of it.
I hate that.

137
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:45.360
What is it about people that are in the like collecting old shit like that and

138
00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:48.180
keeping it in the wrapper?
This is the exact way it was made.

139
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.070
I used to do that with comic book cars.

140
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.960
Dude cars go for a fuck load of money.
Like old like corvette,

141
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.980
like original corvette,
some stamps and they want original.

142
00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:02.250
Everybody wants original radio,
they want original steering wheel.

143
00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:05.440
All the stuff that sucked.
They want all that stuff.
I think it's a,

144
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.820
it's that feeling of nostalgia.
It's like that you get to touch what was,

145
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.680
you know,
alive back then there.

146
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.800
It was so cool with kind of brings it brings them back to other memories or

147
00:08:13.801 --> 00:08:17.070
something.
It's a very strange just the knee collect.

148
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.890
There's always kind of remind me of people that do other weird stuff.

149
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.400
It's a form.
It's a fetish.
I ain't even comic books.
When you collect your,

150
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.090
it's a fetish now.
It could be stamped but it could also be like fingers.

151
00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:30.630
You know what I mean?
But have you ever done comic books?

152
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.900
Didn't used to do common?
Yes,
I used to do comic books,
read them,

153
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:34.770
but I would never collect.

154
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:39.330
It was one of my saddest moments of poverty when I was living in Boston and I

155
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:43.630
was totally,
I sold all my comic books,
did the exact same thing for rent.

156
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.160
Dude,
mine,

157
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.450
he didn't even barely cover my rent and it was boxes and boxes of comic books

158
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.550
mean they totally fuck you on the money.

159
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:52.760
Like if they're worth way more than they pay you for it.
But you got to do it.

160
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:56.820
You got to do like 300 issues.
Just the amazing spider man.

161
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.660
And I had every single macfarlane.
I had like 10 of a topic.
Violence.

162
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.140
First Time you did Spiderman.

163
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.850
I had weird a comic book tastes like I w I liked Conan.

164
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.170
I last cause he's a real person.
I used to read his real book.

165
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.520
Did I write everything?
Robert Frank presented it.

166
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.210
Oh fuck.
Those were the red.
Every single book he ever wrote,

167
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.520
and then he killed himself.
He was a young guy,
killed himself.

168
00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:25.500
He 30 and 30 years old,
so awesome that you're into Robert De,
oh my God.

169
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.390
He's actually a great writer.
I don't know anybody is rider.

170
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.120
That kind of fantasy writing.
He was the best dog.
He created a whole world.

171
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.700
I got the books.
We'll start with this epic battles,
this giant Sumerian,

172
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.950
just this guy with this volcanic glue eyes.
Finally,

173
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:44.670
some survival will turn and say,
who are you?
And he would say,
Hi,
I'm Colin.

174
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.880
Nice.
Yeah,
Dude.
The didn't looks like him.
That was the heartbreak.

175
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.240
Yeah.
It was very sad.
Set yourself up to such a golden standard.

176
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.940
That's traumatic for our Conan.
Yeah.
That's a invoice for,
is to realize,

177
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.680
I'm never going to be a superhero man.

178
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.110
I'm going to be a go kills dragons with a sword height.

179
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.690
I'm not even going to carry a soy.
They're illegal shit.
I can't carry a story.

180
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.980
They could make the Conan books into a real movie like with a really smart

181
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.860
director,
like instead of like,
like the Conan,
like Arnold sports thing.

182
00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:17.610
It was pretty cool.
It was pretty cool.
It wasn't bad man,

183
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.600
but it was so eighties you know what I'm saying?

184
00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:23.230
You've got a movie that was done like based like,
like with the Hobbit,

185
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.140
Peter Jackson to do it or something.
Get them to really invest in Conan.

186
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.740
Conan was like this freak warrior that just always an epic.
It was always,

187
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.890
he was like,
oh,
they were awesome store Ernie.

188
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.960
And he always learned something at the end of the book,
which was that,

189
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.640
you know steel makes right.
Isn't it fascinating man that,

190
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.810
that dude who wrote it,
Robert Howard's was just completely depressed.
Yeah.

191
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.360
Kill himself in the car.
I believe shot himself in his car.

192
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.350
He's just fucking couldn't take it,
just want it off the planet wanted off.

193
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.770
This guy was like,
well one,
I mean for that genre,
one of the best writers ever.

194
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:58.710
Really Fun stuff,
man.
Really cool stuff to read.

195
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.540
I love that shit when I was a kid,
but he also,

196
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.620
he lived in that fantasy world and I guess you know,
did Conan Fuck Rid Sonia?

197
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.910
It was that like,
I'm sure he for dating the same girl,
by the way,
if he met her,

198
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.780
he fucked her for sure.
Correct.
100% if he met her,

199
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.990
she just jumped on his dick like it was a grenade he shoes at immediately.

200
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.350
She was a brave soldier.
Yeah.
Listen man,
that's Conan.

201
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.740
Conan was the king of the world.
They're just like the baddest motherfucker ever.

202
00:11:22.741 --> 00:11:25.470
That was the best thing about the Conan series.
Like you knew,
no matter what,

203
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:28.650
just settle down,
son calling him.
Got It.
He got this.

204
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.360
What was the worst part of their Conan series?

205
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.190
What was the part of Conan that you hated though?

206
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.190
I didn't know nothing about nothing.
Perfectly ready.
You know,
really.

207
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.870
He used to pray to Chrom,
which was the,
the center of the earth.

208
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.080
And you know what he used to ask Krom cause you couldn't ask Krom.

209
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.650
You couldn't ask for forgiveness because he was up restless.
God.

210
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.940
The only thing he ever asked chrom of was a fighting chance.

211
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.820
He just wanted a chance.
They'd just give me a sliver of tie.
Well,
yeah,

212
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:56.260
I want to die.
Well,
yeah,

213
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.240
that's what every man [inaudible] son to be brave in the face of fucking evil

214
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.280
demons and shit.
Yeah.
Every man's fantasy is to be a hero.
Every man's spirit.

215
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.480
And he's a coward.
He got it all locked up,
man.

216
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.950
He had it all locked up in his brain.
You know,
his,
his depressed brain,

217
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.330
he created this intense fucking fantasy world.
Yeah.

218
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.840
And because in a way,
what he was talking about is somewhat timeless.
You know,

219
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.620
it's almost like just energy.
Like you found a path for it,
you know,

220
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:26.230
the depression for whatever,
it was fucked up in his life.

221
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.870
He figured out a way to divert it in this other direction,

222
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.860
this huge fantastical world.
You know,

223
00:12:31.861 --> 00:12:36.861
this fantastic world of fucking monsters in witchcraft and sword battles in this

224
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.200
fucking gigantic brawny Tan Brown skin man,

225
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.200
fucking just slaughtering people.
He used to call it,

226
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.320
he used to call it cutting a path of crimson cutting set path.

227
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.370
He used stars and yeah,

228
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.760
he had to have to survive in the fucking woods by eating pigeons,

229
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:59.290
thrown rocks at him and eaten them.
Ron share some of those stories were awesome.

230
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.570
Yeah,
I just go to the supermarket,
dammit.
Those doors or foods,

231
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.070
<v 1>those stores where the shit they really were when I was a kid,</v>

232
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:09.690
I used to do a magic tricks.

233
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.720
I had a little magic show in fisherman's wharf and I would do it.

234
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:16.790
So I get money for comic books too.
Like yeah,
put on a show.

235
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:19.950
I was like eight years old and I used to put on a wig and do some dancing.

236
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.820
I saw all these street performers in San Francisco and um,

237
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.570
I got a co like a um,
a box,
like the magic box,
you know,

238
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:29.550
like for Christmas it's like,
you know,

239
00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:32.610
a bunch of card tricks and bunch of shit in it.
So I brought the box of man.

240
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:35.220
I said,
I know what I'll do.
I'll get a cape,
I'll put a hat,
all acute.

241
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.650
Like I was aware I would look cute.
It was like eight,

242
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.670
and I was like a little eight year old criminal.
That's great.
Hustler.
Yeah.

243
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.820
And so that's how I first,
uh,

244
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.090
started performing really for comic books because I was addicted to comic books

245
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.230
and said,
what did you,
what kind of magic would you do?
It was terrible.

246
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.470
There was only thing,
it was cute because I was eight and I was by myself

247
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.800
till some,
uh,
here's the question.
Older kids bullied me and I got scared me.

248
00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:05.670
If I could give you one magical quality one,
what would it be?

249
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.933
What does it say?

250
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.370
<v 2>Date
is this ridiculous date with a contrived,</v>

251
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.790
obviously it would be for [inaudible] to be a palm reader cause he's a date with

252
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:23.750
a guy who believes in crystals.
What happened?

253
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.940
A guy who believes in crystals.
I'm a healer.

254
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.220
And if you could have one super power,
what

255
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.730
would it be?
I don't know,
man.
Uh,
if I really could think about,

256
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.860
I want to look like one of those miles stat cows at first.
I want to say flying,

257
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:46.810
but I'm so afraid of heights.
I feel like fly above this sky wouldn't matter.

258
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:48.820
You'd get.
I get somewhere,
I guess 15 minutes early.

259
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.920
Is there really that and how many places to really be?

260
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.070
Not really and you wouldn't fly?

261
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.370
<v 1>I'd be all sweaty.
Seems cool.
But then the head with birds and bugs,</v>

262
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:59.450
it's hard to take magic powers serious after you've had a real good mushroom

263
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:02.570
trip.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Magic powers.

264
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.820
Like DMT is way crazier than any fucking magic trick anybody could ever do.

265
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:09.350
What if I could?
What if I said to you,

266
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:14.000
you could see five minutes into the future for every time you were kind of on a

267
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.950
five minutes.
That'd be great and everything,

268
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.620
but then you'd be this at Douche bag who just knew about everything and

269
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:21.290
everybody else surprises.
Like you try to tell people and they're like,

270
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:24.200
how do you know?
How come I don't know that people would hate on you?
Believe me,

271
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:26.920
man.
The last thing you'd want to know is the future.
What if,

272
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.180
why didn't you tell me I was going to die?
You know,

273
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.720
my father could have been saved as you told us not to get on the train.
Yeah.

274
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.030
But what if you could change the future as a result,

275
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.100
we then change everything man.
And what do you do?

276
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.830
Are you going to keep people alive forever?
You lose it.
Venture will,

277
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:44.410
not only that,
but the reality is this is a temporary experience.
We know it.

278
00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:47.450
It's on paper.
It's been proven.
It's documented.
I like to,

279
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:49.180
I really liked what you were saying about,
um,

280
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.700
and that thing we just listened to about how people know,

281
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.480
they really do know the answers of how to take care of themselves.
Yeah.

282
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.040
It's getting out of their own way.
And it's always what I,

283
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:01.340
it brings me back to like what I always talk about when you have like mayor

284
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:05.690
Bloomberg and wants to outlaw trans fats and food or,
or you know,
when,

285
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:08.780
when Washington or any government agency wants to legislate good health,

286
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:12.890
whether it's making drugs to make people dumber,
well it's,
you're not gonna,

287
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.520
you're not gonna make people healthier people.
People know the answer.

288
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:19.100
There are a lot of really smart people that smoke.
You can't run,

289
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:22.920
you can't pull out fatty food shit,
but they're doing it.
It,

290
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.760
it doesn't mean they don't know it's bad for him.
It's a very,

291
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:29.450
there's a whole nother question.
It's why are people,
why are people,

292
00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:31.610
why don't people dare to be the best they can be?

293
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:36.140
Why it is because it takes effort?
Or is it more of a courages issue?

294
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:40.190
Are you afraid of what you might find or not find as a result?
You know,
that's,

295
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.060
that's really the question.
Yeah.
There's a lot of distractions going on with us.

296
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.630
You know,
people sabotage themselves all the time.
I see it all the time.
Yeah.

297
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:50.240
You create all sorts of bad habits so you don't have to deal with your own

298
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.020
bullshit,
you know?
But,
um,
I'm all for personal choice,
man.

299
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.290
I think it's very important that we encourage personal choice.
Absolutely.

300
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:00.020
Appreciate it much more if you earn it.
You know,

301
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:03.110
I'm writing this book and one of the things that I wrote about this book that

302
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.090
the only thing I'm really proud of,

303
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.170
of anything that I've ever done in my life is my peace of mind like that.

304
00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:10.850
I know that I worked on that.

305
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.851
I know that I got there because I grew up in a very fucked up tor turmoil filled

306
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:20.690
life and I figured out a way to navigate it to become a happy person.

307
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.990
It's like one of the only things that I'm proud of.
Yeah,
I think,

308
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:25.970
I think that knowing you for as long as I've known you,

309
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:28.880
which is going on 16 years,
I think that's a huge,

310
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.650
I absolutely see that transformation because you used to be so intense and used

311
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:37.880
to look at the world is I think as just full of barbs and thorns,
you know,

312
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:40.550
and you were always on the defensive.
Always read.
Cause I remember we'd be,

313
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:43.400
we'd be hanging out and somebody would say something stupid.

314
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.640
What you role is run into and and I,
and you just,

315
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.040
it was so hard for you to,
you just,
you

316
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 2>just immediately call them out on their ridiculous.</v>

317
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:57.291
A two plus two is 15 and Unicorns live in my backyard and I'd go that's great.

318
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:02.100
And you go ball shit,
I don't like this person.

319
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:05.490
And I'd be like,
ah,
what do I do with this uncomfortable confrontation?

320
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.460
He used to hang out with some knuckleheads though in all fair.

321
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:12.320
I really did all fairness.
We're hanging out with some crazy people,
truly,

322
00:18:12.321 --> 00:18:15.570
and I am not that way with reasonable rational people,

323
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.440
but when I'm there with meth heads and I know someone's a meth head and I'm
like,

324
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.980
um,
something's wrong here,
I smell stop.

325
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.560
This is not normal conversation we're having here.
We've got it.

326
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:28.950
We got an issue where we're not going to deal with how crazy this bitches and

327
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:30.570
I'd be like,
I can't say anything.

328
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:33.150
We would be out with one of Brian's friends that it would occur to be like five

329
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:34.140
minutes in the conversation.
Okay,

330
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:37.380
this is like a crazed fucking half home was criminal.

331
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:41.000
We're hanging out with and I'm like,
okay,
we have to deal with this.
Nah,

332
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.610
she's cool.
She's just a little nervous today.
She no,

333
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.100
she gets weird around people.
Yeah,
you're in intense guy.
She gets weird here.
She,

334
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.780
she's,
she's just start,
start.
Just starstruck.
Like she's doing meth fucking mind,

335
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:58.200
Bro.
I'm like,
this is a,
there's a monster disconnect here with this.

336
00:18:58.201 --> 00:19:00.840
Check you out.
I really did find meth in her purse.

337
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:06.030
And meanwhile she ruined my life.
Yeah,
it was a wreck.
I try Brock come out of it.

338
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.700
Do you remember when I was younger?
I'd think I'd be like,
oh,

339
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:09.780
that girl comes from a nice family.

340
00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:13.350
I'll take the go with the bat tattooed on her,
on her face,
and the track marks.

341
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.750
Bruises.
How crazy.
This girl was crazy.
This was w uh,

342
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.850
Brian and I met her at a bar and uh,
he told me,

343
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.710
I want you to meet this girl been seeing.
And she's really cool.

344
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:27.630
So I go and I meet him at the bar.
I talked to her for three,
four seconds,

345
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.110
three or four seconds,
she turns and walks away.
And I looked at him and I go,

346
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:35.520
she's fucking crazy.
I go,
that girl is crazy.
I go,

347
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:39.150
let's get Outta here right now.
I go,
get the fuck outta here.
I go,

348
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:42.630
you need to just change your numbers.
Shut your fucking phone off.
Let's go.

349
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:47.360
Let's get out of here.
I was like,
Nah,
she's fine.
She's cool.
Now,
you know,

350
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.930
you have a friend who you love to death,

351
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.130
but for some reason like he doesn't have those John Carpenter glasses from them

352
00:19:53.131 --> 00:19:57.210
thing.
He can't fucking see it.
Everybody else can see that this bitch is crazy.

353
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.170
He could not see it.
He just,
he did not just chose not to say it would,

354
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:02.970
you didn't just choose not to see,

355
00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:07.971
you would glaze over and become like locked into this is a project for me,

356
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:12.120
whether I'm trying to help her,
I want to change her.

357
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.150
And I was like crazy a survival boy.
I was like,
we gotta get Outta here.
You are.

358
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:22.080
But you were always right.
Cause I would have saved a lot of effort and time.

359
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:24.450
You're a healer,
Brian.
I don't have healer instincts.
I have,

360
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.980
I have runaway from monster and the healing your instincts are phoning to,

361
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.100
because what I was trying to do is just,

362
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:31.860
I just wanted a project where it was like I was the guy of the savior.

363
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:35.700
It was very selfish and Eh,
uh,
arrange,
blamed himself.

364
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.980
I mean you're being critical,
but assuming it was selfish,
but it was just,

365
00:20:37.981 --> 00:20:40.770
it's just a faction of all of these things,

366
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:43.860
all these crazy behaviors or just from our childhood.
That's all it is.
Yeah.

367
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:45.030
I think you're right.
That's what it is.
I mean,

368
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:49.480
you did not like the way you were raised and you were trying to literally raise

369
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.390
a chick.
Right.
You were trying to literally guide them.
I mean,

370
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.750
I know and fuck them and fuck them.
I mean that.
That's important.

371
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:56.770
That's part of the guidance.

372
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:00.990
A huge part of the guys and stuff on his stomach and part of the keynote.

373
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.440
Your bad universe.
Yeah.
Such an ad.
Fuck them and fuck them.

374
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.360
What a crazy fucking,
it occurred to me.

375
00:21:08.361 --> 00:21:10.960
I remember when I told you this occurred to me that the girls I was dating in
La,

376
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:15.100
I was like,
I like,
I looked at like the last four relationships and I was like,

377
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.790
wow,
all for relationships.
All of those girls for me,

378
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.090
they were all essentially a high tech pet.

379
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.380
They were not people.
They were high tech pets had to feed them.

380
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.190
I had to,
I had to be nice to them and pet them.
I had to go,

381
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:39.160
I had to talk to them like a little curious and that I had to fuck them.

382
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.890
And who hasn't thrown a wig on a dog?
The point age.
It's all about hacking them.

383
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.300
Oh my God.
It's so true.
It's so true.
It was weird.

384
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.830
Well,
his current women aside,
she's very nice and he's had a few in the past.

385
00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:56.740
They were very nice.
It's not all of them.
You know,

386
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.950
Patty Jenkins is one of the coolest humans on the planet.
No doubt.
Uh,

387
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.980
but Brian has like been the smartest guy that I know that is dated the dumbest

388
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:10.180
checks.
I mean,
just struck,
just dumb,
crazy straight.

389
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.890
Just,
just tell my girl,
my girl,
my girl,

390
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.710
my girl Tina,
who,
uh,

391
00:22:19.711 --> 00:22:23.560
I lived with Nick and she thought she didn't know who Freud was.

392
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.460
She didn't know Freud was,
she was 30.
And then she thought,
and she was,

393
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:31.810
this was an actress.
She thought that Shakespeare lived in biblical times.

394
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.220
I was like,
Hey,
you're already at my house.
How do I go through this?
Eviction?

395
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.170
Took a year.
Oh my.

396
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.550
See if I can procrastinate the ending of this for the next two years.
Wow.
Well,

397
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:45.910
you know what,
there's nothing wrong with not knowing something.
Well,
yeah.

398
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.210
I just get older though and you seems like you should know that thing is to get

399
00:22:49.211 --> 00:22:54.040
older and learn,
learn from your mistakes and not make the same ones.

400
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:54.580
You know?

401
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.670
The problem is a lot of people get programmed a certain way as they're growing

402
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:00.340
up and it's very hard to shake off their programming.

403
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.660
Sometimes it's better to have no programming as I think you did and I did,

404
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.900
where you just kinda were left alone to figure out life by yourself.

405
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.190
Sometimes I think that's better than having shitty programming because of a girl

406
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.190
grows up a shitty programming where there's a lot of dumb people around her all

407
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:18.610
the time offering they're dumb thoughts and she's with dumb people all day

408
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.850
instead of being left alone.
I think the,

409
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.980
the reason that I didn't grow up that way necessarily is I lived in so many

410
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:26.110
different countries.
I was always,
I was always literally moved.

411
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:29.170
I thought about it.
By the time I,
I,
this is a true,
this is true.

412
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.670
I didn't live anywhere for more than for the first 30 years of my life,

413
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.350
actually 33 years of my life.

414
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.680
I didn't live in one place for more than a year and a half.

415
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.250
I literally moved every year to year and a half and a lot of times it was a

416
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:44.230
totally different culture,
continent,

417
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.120
but I think didn't allow me to get pigeon holed or B,

418
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:51.590
I was exposed to so many different cultures and ideas that you have to kind of

419
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:55.340
keep reshifting and adjusting your paradigm cause what,
what you,

420
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:58.310
what you think is a preconceived notion.
For example,
you know,

421
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.470
you get this idea of what a lot of people will say,

422
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:03.260
well that's my idea of what an Arab is.
That's my idea of what a Jew is.

423
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.550
It's my idea of whatever,
whatever it is.

424
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.980
When you're exposed constantly to different people in totally different
settings,

425
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.850
what you really actually learned to do as a child to empathize with those people

426
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.350
because you start to realize,
yeah,
they're different,

427
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.560
but they're exactly the same.
Did you find

428
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.930
<v 1>yourself being a chameleon and blending into the new entity?</v>

429
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.920
<v 2>My Dad used to say,
my father said to me when I was,
I'm going to say,</v>

430
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.200
he said I was 15 and he said,

431
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.790
I've never seen anyone ever be a bigger chameleon.
They said,

432
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:35.920
your ability to ingratiate yourself and find your way into any situation and

433
00:24:35.921 --> 00:24:37.760
find a hole in any situation.
He said,

434
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.710
I remember him telling his first comment he ever gave me.

435
00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:42.380
He never even gave me a comment.
He said this,
it's,
it's,
it's,

436
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.750
it's remarkably because I've never seen anything like it in my life.

437
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.150
He saw me like I was in Switzerland or something and I just had no friends and

438
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.410
everything was a chameleon.

439
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.780
<v 1>We moved from New Jersey to San Francisco to Florida.</v>

440
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.570
To Boston.
Yeah,
and that's why your accents,
by the way,

441
00:24:58.571 --> 00:24:59.770
a lot of people don't know one thing about you.

442
00:24:59.771 --> 00:25:02.920
Your accidents are as good as anybody's and that's probably because you

443
00:25:02.921 --> 00:25:05.740
developed an ear.
Well,
I learned rhythm about my icing.

444
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:10.580
I won the Bay State Games Taekwondo Tournament and they put me on television was

445
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:15.100
the first one was on top and I was 19 and I heard myself on TV.

446
00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:18.760
I was talking about my instructor,
Mr. Michael Mallory,
and I was saying,

447
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.440
me and Mr O'malley,
we've been working out really hard and uh,
and I,

448
00:25:22.441 --> 00:25:24.960
I heard my accent,
I was like,
dad is the gross,

449
00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:29.200
this fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.
I had like a fake Boston accent.

450
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:30.560
I mean,
I had a Boston accent.
Yeah,

451
00:25:30.561 --> 00:25:33.490
you said I was so disappointed in myself that I picked it up that quickly.

452
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.730
I only lived in Boston for like three years and all of a sudden I had this crazy

453
00:25:36.731 --> 00:25:39.700
accent.
But that comes,
I think from having an ear for,

454
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.630
for the music of any situations by then,
six years by then,
then I'd be in Boston.

455
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.500
But six years in a developed like a hot hot.
Sure.
That's ridiculous.

456
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.050
We're social animals though too,
you know.
So I dropped it.

457
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.730
I learned and I dropped it.

458
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.900
I had hearing myself on TV maybe like consider my accent,

459
00:25:55.901 --> 00:26:00.250
like how ridiculous it was.
I was like affecting an accent set to fit in.

460
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.090
Is it ever come out of the blue though?
Like are you in Boston for sure.

461
00:26:04.091 --> 00:26:06.850
I mean I lived in Boston.
Boston is where I grew up.
If you know,

462
00:26:06.851 --> 00:26:08.230
you talk about my formative years,

463
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.770
my formative years or 13 to 24 I lived in Boston 13 to 23 something like that.

464
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.320
It's a long time.
That's time your boss.
That's the,
that's grown up.
That's my,

465
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.990
I mean if I think about a hometown,
Boston something was a rough town by the way.

466
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:23.380
Isn't this funny?
We just had the UFC in Boston.

467
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.560
There was no less than like 11 bench clearing brawls in the fucking stands.

468
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.900
I mean like full on soccer kicks,
pride style.

469
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.680
There's stories on the Internet of people getting their fucking head stomped and

470
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.920
there's all kinds of crazy story or not.
So this was at the UFC.

471
00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:42.620
In the stands there aren't many fights filled with,
yes,

472
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.460
they're savages.
Amazing.

473
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.460
I've never lived in a place where people were so quick to scrap.

474
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.530
It's why a lot of good comics come out of Boston though,

475
00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:52.830
because to be able to deal with those crowds as cynical crowds and navigate your

476
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:55.260
way through that.
Yeah,
we've talked about it on this show many,

477
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:59.100
many times with with other Boston guys like bill burr and Dane Cook,
and it's,

478
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.700
it's the place where,
you know,
it's like the proving ground for comedy.

479
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.800
There was so many good comics that came out of there.

480
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:05.760
So that's one of the reasons,

481
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:09.010
like you had to be so on your toes to make those guys laugh.
And if you,

482
00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:13.050
if they turned on you,
it was over.
If you know,
if a Boston crowd turns in,

483
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:15.360
you starts billing,
there's no rational thinking involved.

484
00:27:15.361 --> 00:27:17.550
Like if you go on stage with a fucking Yankee shirt on,

485
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.350
they're just going to start throwing shit at you.

486
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.520
We're not going to talk about this.
Hey,
come on

487
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.750
<v 3>guys.
I like New York.
You like Pasta.
What's a big deal?
Fuck you.</v>

488
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.530
They'll fucking throw glasses that you didn't give me shit.

489
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.180
They'll all together decide to beat the fuck out of you.
It won't be like,

490
00:27:32.181 --> 00:27:35.280
like one guy does it and the other.
Yeah.
The other people go,
hey,

491
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.200
we shouldn't do this.
No,
they don't go.
Yeah.

492
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:40.130
Get 'em the way a school of fish knows to turn to,

493
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.270
they'll break your windows if you're driving by with a New York license plate on

494
00:27:43.271 --> 00:27:45.300
your car,
like they're fucking crazy.

495
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.290
Guys haven't even read God in his autobiography.

496
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.560
<v 1>Yeah,
but there's something about that.
That town has a great sense of humor.
Man.</v>

497
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.590
<v 3>I noticed the truth in a way.
You know,
it's like you can't be it.</v>

498
00:27:57.591 --> 00:27:59.410
You can't bullshit your way into Boston.
Yes.

499
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.760
You show up in a pair of leather pants.
Hey guys,

500
00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:05.620
I just bought these limits and stuff.
Fuck.
Is he doing?
Heck,
kick those off quick.

501
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.450
I told you I,
my buddy carbon pro,
my provost,
not on New York's,

502
00:28:08.451 --> 00:28:12.830
a little bit like that I,
I bought,
I've been in Paris and this woman,
this,

503
00:28:12.831 --> 00:28:17.000
this really sexy sales woman told me that I looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger in

504
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:20.250
this leather jacket and I was like,
I do.
I must've gotten,

505
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.460
I literally like I've hurt myself on,
I must,

506
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.300
I think I put on muscle mass in Paris.
Like I literally,

507
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.430
this is what an idiot I am.
This how badly I've always wanted to be built.
Like,

508
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.840
like a guy like that.
So I go,
I'll buy the jacket.
And it was,

509
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:35.360
at the time it was like $400 I did not have any money.
I was like,

510
00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:37.820
that's ridiculous.
Shows you'll know.
It would go really well.

511
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.140
I was like Quoc in French.
She goes,

512
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.520
these leather pants.
And of course I'm like,
oh,

513
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.770
that's exactly what's missing from my life.
I'm really going to get girls.

514
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.330
By the way,
I wasn't 60 that was like 24 so I literally show up.

515
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.970
I literally,
oh,
by the way,
I bought,

516
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.730
I had to get boots that went with them because they didn't really fit.

517
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.910
So I had these boots that go with these pants and these chocolate chocolate

518
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.640
milk,
chocolate leather,
thick leather pants.

519
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.600
Not Suede fucking leather.
Okay.
Like couch leather.

520
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.070
So my buddies,
Eddie man,
only way,

521
00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.550
way too much.

522
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.290
They were so thick I couldn't run to thorn brier and being fine.
Really?

523
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:30.560
Yeah,
really.
They were literally,
I remember them being so thick.

524
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:32.930
I was like trying to get into him.
I was supposed to stretch him.

525
00:29:32.931 --> 00:29:37.100
It was a disaster and literally I walk out and my buddies,

526
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.250
I think Karma and Eddie Mccann,
Donnie Gannon,

527
00:29:40.251 --> 00:29:42.280
I mean all of these like Irish and Italian

528
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.860
<v 2>guys.
From there,
it kind of goes,
what the fuck is,</v>

529
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:48.040
he got on his legs and I'm like,
oh,
these are,

530
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:50.410
these are from before he even got Paris out,

531
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.390
they were on me pulling my pants off.

532
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.940
So just getting them off me to throw out the window.
Yeah,
we fucked,

533
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.070
oh,
sorry.
Sorry.
I,
I mean I erase.
Erase.
Is this on the delay?

534
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.450
Yeah.
Yeah,
we got it,
dude.
Imagine if that's all people wore.

535
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.500
Just animal skins.
If that's my,
that's my joke.
I'm always like,
I'm always like,

536
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:15.420
yeah,
that's a soft,
what is that now?
First Girls Go,
where'd you buy that?

537
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.410
I'm like,
buy it.
I caught it,
killed it and made it.
Oh my God.

538
00:30:19.411 --> 00:30:23.620
It's so fucking soft.
I'll kind of phrase that puppy.

539
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.080
Oh,
that's me.
But they had chicken heads.
We,
it was pretty funny until that.

540
00:30:28.081 --> 00:30:30.800
And then the kids,
that's what I do.
And then I,
and then I go,
yeah,
but if they,

541
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.130
yeah,
but you know what?
I would never do that.
But they're just,

542
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:37.000
they're easy to catch horrible video online where those four Chan guys are after

543
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:37.960
that bitch,

544
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.960
that bitch fuck put your happy face.
A chick who had a bucket full of puppies,

545
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:47.170
man.
And she walks up to a river and starts throwing the puppies in the water.

546
00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:51.190
The puppies are Yiping.
Where did it take place?
What country?
Ah,
fuck.

547
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:54.900
I can't remember.
No.
What country you can find it.
But four Chan is Internet.

548
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.110
You know,
it's a website filled with fucking site website.
Love weight website.

549
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.610
[inaudible] website on the road.
Joe,
funny shit that comes out of it,
man.

550
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.270
What's a website?
Four Chan.

551
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:09.070
That's where all the lll cat meme all came from that,
you know,

552
00:31:09.071 --> 00:31:13.510
there's really hilarious cats.
Stupid like almost ebonics shit.

553
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.200
It's all from says what you know,
like the NDC.
It'd be like,

554
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.480
it's funny in the thread,
one of the best websites ever.
That's the,

555
00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:24.670
one of the funnest thing about the internet is he's a little fucking Nigga.

556
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:25.504
You Gay,

557
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.570
no window motor shops in a fucking lake.
Gregory occurring jerk though.

558
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.970
But joke though,
like people will save them and you know,

559
00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:35.110
and you'll find them online.

560
00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:38.430
Like there's a lot of really funny ones that you can this man,
you know,

561
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.280
this thread smells gay,
you know,
and someone was spraying Lysol on the one thing.

562
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:44.170
No tip.
If you go to four Chan's website,

563
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.440
put it on private surfing mode on your browser or just clear cache and delete

564
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:52.360
your computer when you're done going to that website because you'll see some

565
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:57.010
crazy shit at that way.
So what you think is a lot of illegal stuff.

566
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.730
I mentioned that we don't want anybody getting locked up in the pokey.

567
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:03.270
Just be careful just because you hear about this website.
Um,

568
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.410
I was just at parlor live in Seattle by the way.
That's a great club.
Um,

569
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.500
have you ever done that parlor la live in Seattle?
No,

570
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:14.290
I've only done the underground,
that small place on the distance to place.

571
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:16.090
They pack it in.
I did a theater there,

572
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:19.800
they pack it in and it's run by this Guy Ruben.
And um,

573
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.840
it's,
it's probably,
uh,
like a solid 300 but,

574
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.970
but it's a smart group cause they're all Microsoft people.
They're all from,

575
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.770
it's really cool.
It's up in Bellevue where like Microsoft temporary.
Really?
Yeah.

576
00:32:32.771 --> 00:32:36.490
You get like a really cool,
kind of like eclectic but pretty educated audience.

577
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.860
So it's kind of,
I don't know,
it's kind of refreshing.

578
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:43.300
I that I've talking about San Francisco.
Yeah man.
And so,
uh,
anyway,
but the,
the,

579
00:32:43.301 --> 00:32:46.210
the one of the comics that was there,
um,
poor girl,
she,

580
00:32:46.211 --> 00:32:49.130
she was married and found out her husband was having an affair.

581
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.150
And the reason she found out was because there's a website called Dolly Madison

582
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:56.720
or something for married people if they want to have the stairs.
Yeah.

583
00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.300
Holly Madison.
Madison.
Yeah.
Holly Madison.
And she,
and she had a,
and he had a,

584
00:33:01.301 --> 00:33:04.880
his profile on there,
you know,
it's like way to get caught through.

585
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:09.740
And she was like,
she was like,
ah,
my husband's on the looking for,
this is weird.

586
00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:10.160
Loud.

587
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.210
You know how hilarious is that that someone came up with a website for people

588
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:15.920
that want to cheat?
Yeah.
For other emergencies.

589
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.620
So many people would cheat on other married people.
Again,
it's like,
Hey,

590
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:22.230
I'm married.
You're married to let's go back.
Crazy.
Great.

591
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.691
That's scary.

592
00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:28.691
It was scary that these go so dumb that he would create a fucking profile with

593
00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:33.050
his real name.
Yeah.
With his real name and picture.
Hey,

594
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:37.460
he put his pictures outside my profiles.
I want to get caught that go.
Oh my God.

595
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.560
Yeah,
come on.

596
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.530
Did you see that Twitter that I put out the other day about there was a website

597
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.560
using html 5.0 and it's called the wilderness downtown.com somebody else did you

598
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:54.680
do it?
No,
it's check it out.
The wilderness,

599
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:59.150
downtown.com you put in your address like I like the place you grew up in and

600
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:03.530
what it does is it takes Google like street view maps and it mixes it with like,

601
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.940
like videos of people running down streets and it shows like aerial views

602
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.900
zooming into your house.

603
00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:12.830
Like it's like in a helicopter and it just uses it from like this one address

604
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.080
and it's fucking trippy.
I mean it's not,

605
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:18.290
it's cool after like a few minutes you'd get the tricks and everything like
that.

606
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:21.770
But at first you're sitting there going,
wow,
this is bad ass.
So check it out.

607
00:34:21.771 --> 00:34:24.510
It's the wilderness downtown just preparing us.
Yeah,

608
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.400
they're premier preparing us for the one state of total connectivity.

609
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.020
The whole fucking world is corrected.
Takes up.
It's called the singularity.

610
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:35.400
That's they call called Cartwheel,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

611
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.160
The idea that there's going to come [inaudible] cubs right near all global hub.

612
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.450
Well,
I think that's one of the thing,

613
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.770
one of the reasons why people hate deception so much that people hate lies so

614
00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:50.000
much is that we were,
you know,
everyone's trying to figure life out.

615
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.150
And it doesn't help if you find out that someone's not being honest,

616
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.260
like you can help me,
you your revelations.
And they have,
you know,
we,
we,

617
00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:00.220
you and I have talked a bunch of times about some crazy shit.
Yeah.

618
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.650
And helped each other very much.

619
00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:05.270
And the reason why is because I absolutely believe that you're going to tell me

620
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:08.030
the truth and you know that I'm going to tell you the truth.

621
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.890
If you don't have that,

622
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.440
if one person is telling the truth and the other person isn't,
then you fucked.

623
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:14.830
Didn't.
You're in this weird situation like,
oh,

624
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.720
this guy's not even looking at reality.
This is bullshit.
He's not helping me.

625
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.420
He's actually hindering me.
It's getting in the way.
I see that.

626
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:23.450
But I see that all the time when often to find,

627
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.480
I find tiring about living in Los Angeles and maybe I'm being fair or unfair.

628
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:27.770
Dot.
Los Angeles.
Maybe it's everywhere.

629
00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:32.771
But I just always find that people are not only playing a character,

630
00:35:32.781 --> 00:35:35.000
they're not against themselves.
Yes,
they're,
they're,
they,

631
00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:37.160
they haven't even faced up to who they are because they're still,

632
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.410
they're still playing a character.
How,
how common is,

633
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.660
are these characters that they're clearly defined right there.

634
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:45.120
The actors are so clearly defined because they're almost archetypes.

635
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:47.190
They're like,
this is what a man is supposed to behave like.

636
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:48.990
So this is how I'm going to behave.
And by the way,

637
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:51.480
this is also how my wife is going to be at.
My woman's going to be here.

638
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:56.690
So you have to amended a woman playing characters and coming together on almost

639
00:35:57.211 --> 00:36:02.040
a f uh,
uh,
it just,
the platform by which they're coming together is already,

640
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.920
is already fake.
Nobody's being honest with,
you know,

641
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.360
you've been Kansas guy who's gotta be toe and this way and she's been cast as

642
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:12.710
this other person.
It's like watching a show.
Yeah.
You know,
I've,
I've watched,

643
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.390
<v 1>I watch people like actors talk at a party and it literally is like,</v>

644
00:36:16.391 --> 00:36:18.830
they're appearing on an episode of friends right there.

645
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.840
Say everything they're saying is affected and fake and there's like a certain

646
00:36:22.841 --> 00:36:27.400
quality to it a certain way.
You know,
I hate when people say good to see you.

647
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.750
You know why they say good to see you?

648
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:31.210
Because they can't remember if they met you or not.
You know,

649
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.920
they say good to see you.
And it's like,

650
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:36.340
it's creepy actor political thinking thing where I say,

651
00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:39.310
if I said Nice to meet you,
and someone goes,
oh,
we met already.
I'm like,

652
00:36:39.311 --> 00:36:41.830
I'm sorry,
I'm a retard.
When do we meet?
Like I just can't,

653
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.110
I just can't remember everybody.
That's just the problem.

654
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.320
It's like there's only a certain amount of hard drive space that human being has

655
00:36:47.321 --> 00:36:50.190
in his head for people.
Right?
They say it's like 150 people.
Right,
right.

656
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.650
There's like been calculations done on it.
Like at 150 people,

657
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:55.900
you can't remember anybody motor,
you don't have the space for it.

658
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.030
<v 2>I want to piggy back what you're saying on a,
and on this,</v>

659
00:36:59.031 --> 00:37:03.350
this quote I heard from Eleanor Roosevelt and she said,
she said,
um,

660
00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:09.220
a mediocre minds talk about people elevated.

661
00:37:11.301 --> 00:37:15.500
Mine's talk about events and great minds talk about ideas.

662
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.770
And so when you're talking about having a hard drive for certain,
um,
for,

663
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.830
for people,
you're not supposed to even aspire to talk about people.

664
00:37:21.831 --> 00:37:23.570
Think about what most people talk about.
Look a little bit,

665
00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:24.830
pay attention to the conversations.

666
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.410
And you know what you'll find most of the time they're gossiping.

667
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.920
They're telling stories about other people,
sort of shortcomings or point.

668
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.460
It's why US magazine,
those magazines are so popular.

669
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:38.180
It's why so many of these talk shows that deal only with what's going on in

670
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:42.990
Hollywood are so successful.
Uh,
people want to,
they want to,

671
00:37:42.991 --> 00:37:44.300
um,
they want it.

672
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.290
I'm always amazed at people's capacity for gossip and how people can actually

673
00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:52.070
give a shit about somebody's relationship if they happen to be in a movie.

674
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:56.120
And stuff like that.
Story's too,
though.
Everyone's always done that.

675
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.100
Back in the day you had stories,
good stories.

676
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.690
It's to our detriment.
It's serious.

677
00:38:02.691 --> 00:38:05.510
There's serious things going on in the world that,

678
00:38:05.511 --> 00:38:10.070
that raised very serious questions,
right?
We're all affected by it.
And,

679
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.870
and it seems to me almost this sort of,
um,
uh,
uh,

680
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.160
I don't know if the word is,
um,
this,
eh,
analgesics,

681
00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:24.161
sort of a quality to sitting back and talking about things that have nothing to

682
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:29.420
do with anything that are by their very nature,
completely ethereal.
For example,

683
00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:34.130
like how much weight this actress lost or how much weight this actress gained

684
00:38:34.131 --> 00:38:36.130
and things like that.
Do you ever

685
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.730
<v 1>watch keeping up with the Kardashians?
I do not.
I think you should get it up.</v>

686
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.320
It's really a good show.
I can't wait.
Hope they have the CD.

687
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.940
I have a theory about all this stuff,
this stuff,
you know,
gossiping and Shit.

688
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.670
I think what it really is is,
uh,
you know,
human beings.

689
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:54.010
I think it has a sort of a therapeutic effect on people.

690
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.480
I think the questions that are around us all the time are so big and so scary

691
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:02.500
and so slowly it of course it's a form of connection.
And I'm not talking about,

692
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:04.000
I'm not talking about connection.

693
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.500
I'm not talking about having a place for everything like that.
I'm,
I'm,

694
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.660
I'm saying that the problem is that when that is,

695
00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:15.661
when that becomes all people think and talk about there's something wrong when

696
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:17.310
there are other,
there are things that are allowed.

697
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.770
A lot of what's going on is I think people are inundated with too much data.

698
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.470
I think people,
there's there,

699
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.510
our brains are not set up to be on the Internet yet.

700
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.080
It's just the brain is just being overwhelmed by shit.

701
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:32.680
So I think we like to keep things really simple sometimes to distract ourselves

702
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:33.040
from that.

703
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.440
Well that's an instinct thing too because I was also thinking about how

704
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:39.220
technology and its exponential growth is kind of rendering masculinity in its

705
00:39:39.221 --> 00:39:43.720
traditional form.
Completely obsolete.
Someone sent me an email thanking me.

706
00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:44.111
He goes,

707
00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:48.640
thank you for connecting rational thinking and manly shit together because

708
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:52.240
normally it doesn't exist.
And he goes,
most people aren't open minded.
You know,

709
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.000
if you're into manly shit,
like everyone assumes you're a meathead,

710
00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:58.720
you're a dumb ass.
You can't enjoy it.
I can't be intelligent and enjoy this,

711
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.720
but I do.
So what's going on?
It's in my nature.

712
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.360
How can you tell me I'm wrong in your genes?
I mean,

713
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.670
how can you tell someone they're wrong with that?

714
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.500
But it's interesting how a lot of this stuff is becoming simulated.

715
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:12.100
One of the reasons I think video games are so popular is because it's a,

716
00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.160
it's an outlet.
It's an aggressive outlet for,
for,

717
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:19.161
for boys and men even to exercise that natural instinct to Hudson Killaly

718
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.860
natural man.
We're were fleeing.
Ricky Schroder was a on a couple of weeks ago,

719
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.940
two weeks ago,
and a Ricky like hunts like crazy.
He's like,
yeah,
he's a,

720
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.650
he would never strike everything man.

721
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:33.880
He hunts everything and we were talking about like hunter gatherer instincts and

722
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.400
it brought up the idea and I brought this up.

723
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:40.090
I think there's probably be like a series of genetic rewards we have for like

724
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.900
catching an eating things and killing things because it's good for you and

725
00:40:43.901 --> 00:40:45.220
because something is good for you,

726
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.550
usually there's like some sort of a natural award system going on.
Like with,

727
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:50.740
you know,
your brain chemistry,
you get like,
you know,

728
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.080
a little blast of dopamine or whatever happens,
you know,

729
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:54.160
a little blast of something.

730
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.130
And we were talking about it and we were talking about like fishing.

731
00:40:57.131 --> 00:41:00.210
Like you ever go fishing man and catch a big fish and then cook and eat whole,

732
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.910
it feels doubly right.
Yeah,
I should,
yeah.

733
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.490
I think we're getting away from all that stuff and we all have these reward

734
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:09.700
systems that are set up inside of our bodies and if we don't get them in some

735
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:14.470
direction and forced them into like a good exercise or,

736
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:17.500
or,
or some fucking creative path or something like,

737
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:22.360
we're basically making up for some rewards that we don't get all day anymore.

738
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.580
You know,
our lives now,
if you work a shitty job,
even if it pays well,

739
00:41:25.581 --> 00:41:27.250
if it's a Shitty,
boring ass fucking job,

740
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.330
it's not nearly as exciting as being a hunter.
Right.
You know,
you're a hunter,

741
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:32.800
you know,
you might not be successful everyday,

742
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.220
but there's some shit's going to go down.

743
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.350
You've got to stock and you've gotta look out for other animals.

744
00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:37.790
We're trying to jack you.
Yeah.
You know,

745
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:40.700
you got all keep an eye out for mountain lions and crazy shit.
I mean,

746
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:42.520
if we're talking about like thousands and thousands of years ago,

747
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.390
we still have those bodies.

748
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.570
We still have those bodies that are wired like sex feels good.
Why?

749
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:51.350
So you make babies.
It's set up for that.
The hunt feels good.
Why?
So?

750
00:41:51.351 --> 00:41:53.660
You keep hunting.
There's just a walk reward system.

751
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.270
So there's a deficit because we're not experiencing that.
We're not,

752
00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.220
even though we do have decks and we do have balls,
we are men like in society.

753
00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:05.290
Like there's,
there's very little outlets.
I'm saying,
does that vary?

754
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.250
There are very few outlets.
You know,
you can't,

755
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:09.350
you can't [inaudible] to kill Shit.
Right?

756
00:42:09.351 --> 00:42:12.560
We are designed to hunt for thousands of years.
I mean,
for a millennia,

757
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:15.890
we've been genetically programmed to provide and protect and which takes courage

758
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:18.860
and cutting.
And as long as we're eating meat,
okay,
if you're eating meat,

759
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:21.440
that means you're killing something.
Right?
And if you're killing something,

760
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.530
you have to be violent.
There's gotta be a violent release and,

761
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.050
and all of a sudden you're taking in all this animal poison like to tell you or

762
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.970
not,
but there is no violence with most of us.
There's no release.

763
00:42:30.971 --> 00:42:34.580
There's no explosion.
That's,
that's why everybody is fucking crazy with stress,

764
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.370
right?
We're eating meat and not being viable.
You had said,

765
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.140
you were all saying exercise.
I saw.

766
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.500
I so believe that that the first thing for anybody to do in my opinion is

767
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:46.480
getting your body.
Yes.
Get in it and feel the machine and,

768
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:51.340
and exercise I think is,
is uh,
is crucial.
It's a,
yeah,

769
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:55.700
it's maintenance for the mind,
the body.
It's important,
but it's the mind.

770
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.000
You can think way better.
If I have anything that's fucking with me.

771
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.360
I go out and I hit the punching bag.
I just think about nothing.

772
00:43:02.361 --> 00:43:04.390
Just hit the punching pack,
kick you punch it.

773
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:07.190
Kinda tend to do a few rounds and nothing bothers me when it's over.

774
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.690
I heard a statistic and I,
I don't know,
I don't know.
I don't have the,

775
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.500
it's not like Mayo Clinic and stuff,
but it was,

776
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.930
it came from a fairly reliable source.
Um,
that said that one in four people,

777
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.410
if you know by the one in four people will die of cancer,

778
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.270
but one in four people get cancer eventually,

779
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:24.830
whether it's in their eighties or nineties,
whatever,

780
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:29.390
one in seven athletes get cancer they found.

781
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.010
And there there are a couple of theories for that.
What is it?
Exercise,
you know,

782
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.080
moves lymphatic fluid through your body and that's how you keep your body clean

783
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:39.860
and all that stuff.
But,
and then,
then you know,
people who are,
who did sports,

784
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:41.180
who are at,
but they're talking about athletes,

785
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:45.760
I professional athletes and Olympic athletes,
one in seven versus a,

786
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:49.190
your standard one in fall.
What kind of cancer?
Breast Cancer.
All cancers.
All,

787
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:49.400
you know,

788
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.000
one interesting statistic that there's never been a professional athlete that

789
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.760
has lived to be over a hundred.
I believe that.

790
00:43:55.761 --> 00:43:58.920
And I think it's probably because of the stress.
I don't know if that's true,

791
00:43:58.921 --> 00:44:03.380
but I read that,
well,
athletes called the,
it was called um,
uh,

792
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.360
dead doctors tell no tales or something like that.

793
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:08.390
It was all about minerals and well,
from what I understood,
um,

794
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:09.530
professional athletes,

795
00:44:09.531 --> 00:44:13.790
you know from store at sports do die earlier as well.

796
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.490
It makes sense if you put this incredible amount of stress from your body,

797
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.990
your ass cancer from eating so much like proteins and hard meats and stuff like

798
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:24.130
that.
Maybe ask,
you have to go straight Brock Lesnar,

799
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.550
you get that one and two closer almost died from diverticulitis.

800
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.880
Is that a liver disease?
So it's from eating too much protein and no fiber,

801
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.390
we don't have yeah,
protein buildup in your,
in your gut.

802
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.480
And it was actually like rotting a hole through it and creating abscesses.

803
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:41.130
He had like a real problem getting sick or did,

804
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:44.370
he just doesn't feel good for a long time.

805
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:47.670
They said that he was operating at 60 to 80% of his potential,

806
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.700
which is fucking terrifying when you think of how fucking fast and strong and

807
00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:54.630
athletic that dude is.
And they think that he was,

808
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.810
he was like actually like sick the whole time.
That's so crazy.
Crushing do today.

809
00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.673
Six,

810
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.800
he's fighting Cain Velasquez in October in Los Angeles now in Anaheim and I am

811
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.130
now.
Um,
I've never seen anybody quite so explosive and so big.

812
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:10.330
I mean he walked around through freak ass.

813
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.860
Doesn't he walk around at 300 pounds and suck down?
Um,
you know,
not anymore.

814
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.140
I don't think he wants to take that toll on his body,

815
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:19.620
but he's a bit over to 65 is actually lighter now that he's ever been before

816
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:20.700
because he changed his diet.

817
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.160
Is he stronger when you talk to other guys who fought him?

818
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.850
Does he feel like Dushane who've traveled him say due to Trent?
Well,
you know,

819
00:45:27.851 --> 00:45:30.660
you've got clipped in the big punch.
You know,
Shankar when is so strong,

820
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:35.100
what the fuck too.
And he can bang dude,
chain car has serious,
serious,

821
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:35.970
serious power.

822
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.660
He's got power that there's not a single man on the planet that can take one of

823
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:42.960
those bombs and be okay.
We got fucked up and Brock knew it.

824
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.110
I think he felt it and was like,
Holy Shit,

825
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.170
this is like a new kind of thunderstorm coming my way.

826
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:51.810
I don't know anybody ever hit him like that.
I mean,
everybody's like,

827
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:54.930
Brock can't take a shot,
and Brock covered up and ran like no.

828
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.030
Brock survived and won the fight stupid,

829
00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.250
which he did with that two took a BD caught clipped.

830
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.770
We knew for sure that Shane was going to be the better striker,
but you know,

831
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.280
Shane has an,
but Brock has had some good,
you know,

832
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:09.930
like he dropped Randy with a right hand.

833
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:11.400
He dropped heath herring with a right hand.

834
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.310
It was just how quick Shane put it on him.

835
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:18.360
It was just as soon as you start a bomb and I'm just like,
oh shit.
It's like,

836
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.660
that dude's got some special power.
He's got something.
Oh,

837
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.480
like he hits dudes and you could see the look in their eyes.
They're like,

838
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:27.940
what the fuck?
Like when he hit Frank Mir,
like he kicked frank,

839
00:46:27.941 --> 00:46:32.070
we would like to short left hand inside and you could see frank mirs face like a

840
00:46:32.071 --> 00:46:33.840
couple of times before he dropped him.

841
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:36.930
He hit him with like the short and punches a friend.
It was that,

842
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:38.850
but it was the look in his face like Whoa,

843
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.270
like this is some fucking rocky shit we're doing here.

844
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.060
Like hammered like these are bombs.

845
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.510
He's seeing sparks to try to keep it together and he's not expecting that.

846
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.440
And then he's thinking,

847
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.590
what happens if this motherfucker gets his arms loose and starts raining the

848
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:57.300
Zombie?
I'm going to sleep.
And then he gets one the and loose.
I was like,
Oh fuck.

849
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:01.410
Here it comes.
Boom,
boom.
And when the mirrors legs give out,

850
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:03.490
I'm like God Damn America,
take a shot man.

851
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.020
He's a big guy who can take a shot because he took a gang of them before he went

852
00:47:07.021 --> 00:47:11.730
out.
He took a gang of them and Carmen was blasting him.
Man,
that's just calling.

853
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.880
If he can get his cardio together,
he can get a situation together.

854
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.210
I think it was a situation with the boss sizer fight.
He got really excited.

855
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:18.931
He thought it was over.

856
00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:21.030
He thought it was over and he was just going to try to stop the fight and throw

857
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:24.240
as many punches as possible.
He got,
well,
from what I heard,
he's got,

858
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.990
he got really strategy mistake.
He didn't breathe and he didn't,
you know,

859
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:30.670
he locked,
he locked up and then he got,
you know,

860
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.940
literally lactic acid froze his muscles in the second round.
He was done.

861
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.650
He can figure out how to get his strategy together and it might not even be the

862
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:42.130
be that pig man.
I mean,
he's like too,
he was like,
he told me he cut,

863
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:44.400
I think he said 16 pounds.
Cool.

864
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.180
So when I was talking to him the day of the fight,

865
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:50.680
he was 16 above to 65 so weird.
How big these guys are so weird.

866
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:54.930
He's a politician.
He's six one six two.
So weird.
What did he do?

867
00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:00.250
Redonkulous gorilla pause too.
He's just shakes your hand and you're like,

868
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.640
what the fuck is that?
That you call a hair?
What is this?

869
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.540
There's this giant thing,
my question own and you know,

870
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:10.960
and the ham hock just see,
well,
cause there,
there are bears and their dogs.

871
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.900
I'm a dog and he's a fancy bear no matter what happens,

872
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:17.620
the dog never be to bear on a fight.
But,
but um,
what,
what my question,

873
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:20.690
I'm sure you've been asked before is what I noticed about federal,

874
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:25.030
the Yanco is his timing,
his ability to,
the time punches.
And it's just so much,

875
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.760
it's so much better than everybody else's.
Everybody else in,

876
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:31.750
he's really good visibility and his speed,
he looks very fast.
Very dope.
Boy,

877
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:34.210
he's gotta be,
I bet you if he were to really trimmed down,

878
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.330
he's gotta be 25 pounds overweight.
I'm just talking about fat.

879
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.290
I think you're right.
And it's incredible.
It's incredible.
And uh,
I,

880
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:44.140
you know that,
that's the one thing I'd like to see him fight.

881
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:47.230
Brock said that I think that he could fight in middleweight and I'm not kidding.

882
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.530
I mean,
I wouldn't want to see him do it.
I,
I enjoy the fact that he fights it.

883
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:54.190
Heavyweight [inaudible] would stand up to him in middleweight.
I mean,
you know,

884
00:48:54.191 --> 00:48:56.290
I don't know.
I mean who knows,

885
00:48:56.291 --> 00:48:59.110
maybe the speed wouldn't be as big as an advantage at middleweight.

886
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.600
Maybe at middleweight maybe one of the things he's got going for him as he

887
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:04.450
really is a small guy and you know when he's throwing his punches,

888
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.450
it's sufficient power to drop these guys.
Cause I'll tell you what,

889
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:11.190
a guy like Patrick [inaudible] 185 pounder and can really punch that mother

890
00:49:11.191 --> 00:49:13.720
fucker could knock out anybody.
He can knock out a heavyweight.

891
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.230
Patrick [inaudible].
Patrick blasted them with a big shot.

892
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:20.620
He could put away a heavyweight for sure.
And maybe that's what faders doing.

893
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:24.760
Maybe him being like this lighter guy,
there might be a benefit in being lighter.

894
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.110
We'll fight that just up two 32 30 and fat.

895
00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.240
So if you look at rich Franklin,
okay,

896
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:35.740
rich Franklin is like above 200 pounds when he cuts down to one 85 and now that

897
00:49:35.741 --> 00:49:39.010
he's campaigning at light heavyweight at two oh five he's walking around,

898
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:42.550
I would say probably maybe two 20 or something like that.
Not too big but,
but,

899
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:46.690
but bigger.
And you know,
rich,
rich Franklin,
you know,

900
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:50.320
he's a fucking big guy,
man.
You know,
he's a big fucking,
I mean,

901
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:55.060
if you didn't want to be a fat guy,
he could be two 30.
Yeah.
I mean,

902
00:49:55.061 --> 00:49:57.880
rich Franklin was the UFC middleweight champion.
And if you put fat on him,

903
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:00.350
he could easily be fade or can you tell me why it,

904
00:50:00.351 --> 00:50:03.670
it really seemed to me like I'm the spider.
Uh,

905
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:07.700
Anderson Silva like his board or something.
He just didn't want to fight.
No,
no,

906
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.540
no,
no,
no.
That's not the case at all.
Chael Sonnen is a fucking monster.

907
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:14.350
That's about that beetle.
Chael Sonnen is a serious wrestler.

908
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.350
C is a hard nose motherfucker.

909
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.790
And he will take fucking five punches in the face to try to take you down and

910
00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.190
look when he's dedicated and when he's on and when he's right.

911
00:50:24.191 --> 00:50:27.620
And he wasn't Nate Marquardt fine and he was in the Anderson Silva fight.

912
00:50:27.621 --> 00:50:28.150
He's a bad

913
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:30.170
<v 2>motherfucker.
He can take down anybody.
Man.</v>

914
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:32.690
He could take you down and get beat the fuck out of you when he's on top of you

915
00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.970
and you're going to have to deal with that shit for five rounds because you can

916
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:38.230
keep doing it.
And by the way,
it's going to push the seven did deal with it.
Yeah.

917
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.730
And then it's hard.
Then he caught him,
you know Anderson Silva.
That's,

918
00:50:41.731 --> 00:50:44.150
that's a master right there,
man.
He waited for his opening.

919
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:47.480
He was always dangerous.
Two minutes left in the fight.
No one gave him a chance.

920
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.910
Slapped on that triangle pitch.

921
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.810
He's incredible watching it with my father.
My father was like,

922
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:55.970
this guy's not good.
And I go to and I said,

923
00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.410
he's been a champion for 10 years.
I go,
do not count them out.

924
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.580
You're not kind of special.

925
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:03.830
He might've lost every fucking round up until that moment,

926
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:07.040
but he saw the moment and he,
fuck.
Is that going to be rematched chuck?

927
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:12.190
I don't know.
I hope so.
Either that,
well,
I know that I'm chill son and is a,

928
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.910
I mean Chelsea on and wants to fight Anderson Silva gap,

929
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:18.940
but I also know that v tour,
uh,
is going to fight.
You should know Cami.

930
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.710
That's like the next five to just been announced.
So Vito is going to fight.

931
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.840
You should know Cami.
That means v not going to fight Anderson,

932
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:27.530
which means I think they're probably setting up an Anderson chill son and

933
00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:30.800
rematch.
I don't know the official word yet though,
but look man,

934
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.710
why not make the money?
This is the money's here.
Everybody wants to see it.

935
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:36.890
You know,
I know you can say,
hey,
chill son and he lost fair and square.

936
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:40.850
He needs to go up.
That's all well and good.
But I'd like to see what's this for?

937
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.160
I want to say it again.
Yeah,

938
00:51:42.161 --> 00:51:44.300
there everybody needs to get paid cause because that was it.

939
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:47.090
That was in some ways a draw and a lot of people's mind right when you,

940
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.720
you just have the fucking highlights from that first one and put them in a UFC.

941
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:53.630
Add Taka,
Taka,
taka,
Taka Chell sign.
And taking them down.

942
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.180
Don't let the truck over and over and over and over again.

943
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.350
You know the chill shun had dominated for four rounds until getting caught in

944
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:03.540
his triangle.
He vows to never let it happen again.
You know?

945
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.440
And then you have Anderson.
Would that buy duct bod?
I blocked blocked.
You know,

946
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.080
he stuck it in Portuguese for some reason.

947
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:13.610
You just have me slide by like this with a thumbs up and another shot with my,

948
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.620
with my average body.
The old spice guy.

949
00:52:15.621 --> 00:52:17.210
Do you ever feel like that old spice commercial?

950
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:18.800
Like somebody might've saw your act?
Somebody,

951
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.950
I've had a lot of people tell me that you watched that.

952
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.080
I watched that and I'm just like,
somebody saw Brian Collins at this is weird.

953
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.380
Like that stuff that you see in the old spice commercial.
What's really funny?

954
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.400
I mean we're not accusing,

955
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.500
there's from Amy's very possible they came up with her on their own,

956
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.190
but it's very possible they saw your,
your,
your calm.
Never worry about it,

957
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:39.680
you know,
I just figured as a comic you gotta just keep reinventing.

958
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:42.950
Keep inventing,
man.
Keep inventing you.
Yeah.
Your,

959
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:47.210
your persona though is far more intense and sexual than that guy's persona.

960
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.130
What Brian does is a lot of very similar type stuff on stage to what that guy

961
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:52.371
does,

962
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:56.920
but much more surreal and fucked up and sexual and like to the point where it

963
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.400
makes you feel comfortable sometimes.
Very,
very funny shit.
I mean it's just,

964
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:04.270
it's just like you got to see a influence to see live there.

965
00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.410
The stuff I'm doing now,
it's been,
I don't know,
it's been,

966
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.260
it's been very satisfying because I noticed that um,

967
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.410
the audience goes with me if I commit to it.
So I always just go,

968
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:16.220
this is what I think is funny.
Whatever.
I had a bunch of military too,

969
00:53:16.221 --> 00:53:19.580
so that I'd like this to be really obnoxious cause I walk up like I woke up,

970
00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.910
I think I was in San Antonio is a bunch of military guys named Macho tough guys.

971
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:26.190
And I was like,
I woke up and I go,
I was crying tight American apparel

972
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.640
<v 3>shirts guys.
First of all,
I want to apologize for my body.</v>

973
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:34.350
So I about being so shredded.
Uh,
I know,
I know my bag looks like a barrel,

974
00:53:34.351 --> 00:53:38.030
the snakes,
whatever.
Let's move on,
you know,
and uh,

975
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.350
and I was just completing,
I kept apologizing for my pod,

976
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.550
kept apologizing about fast and I'm like,
I'm 170 pounds regular dude.

977
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:50.310
All right.
And these guys were all just check.
And I just,

978
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:54.390
I think sometimes I have so much fun being completely either totally absurd or

979
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:57.750
just do what I just think is funny and just,
you know,
just,
and they get it.

980
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.240
People always seem to get it.
If you commit to it,

981
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.990
it's when you apologize and I think they sent,
you're lying,
but I'm not lying.

982
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.600
Yeah.

983
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.240
<v 1>Do what you think is funny.
You know,
Brian is a very,</v>

984
00:54:07.241 --> 00:54:10.410
he's got a very unique sense of humor and a thanks.
I mean,

985
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:14.230
it's not coming funniest.
The funniest things I've ever seen.
Anybody too.

986
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.740
We were in a hotel.
There's a video of it.
I'll get Eddie Bravo to Twitter,

987
00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:20.640
the video,
put it online,
but there's a video.
Do you know what the,

988
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.050
what the video is called on Youtube?
I don't know what it's called,

989
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:26.680
but I wish I knew.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I will,
uh,
I will find out later.

990
00:54:26.681 --> 00:54:31.681
But it's like if you look up like gay Jujitsu porno or something like that,

991
00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:36.010
young for porn out what it was,
was he started doing this character.

992
00:54:36.011 --> 00:54:37.480
We were just hanging out in this hotel room.

993
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.630
It was a weekend of the UFC like a long time ago.
And uh,

994
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.310
Brian just starts doing this character about a Jujitsu guy who fucks dudes.

995
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:45.144
When's he holds up?

996
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:51.890
<v 3>And it was literally funny to the point where I couldn't breathe.</v>

997
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.240
You fell off the bed.
I just slap read.
It was the literally,

998
00:54:56.241 --> 00:54:58.880
if I had to look back on one of the funniest things I've ever seen,

999
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.270
if I like vote for the funniest things in my entire life as a human than I've

1000
00:55:02.271 --> 00:55:03.920
ever seen,
I think you win.

1001
00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.260
I think that might've been the funniest thing I've ever seen.

1002
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.010
<v 1>Ever tell lots of anything.
We were so high though.
Oh my God.
We were so high.</v>

1003
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.260
This was when I was first really getting into pot too.

1004
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.740
How long have you been smoking weed?
How many years is it now?
It's been,

1005
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:20.910
what is it,
2010 now?
I think it's about nine years.
10 years.
10 years.

1006
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.440
Is it nine or 10?
You know,
I was getting high when nine 11 happened.

1007
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.980
I was already with high.
Yeah,
because I wrote about smoke first.
Uh,

1008
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.340
the first 30 years of your life or whatever,
you were completely,

1009
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:35.950
you never did anything.
I thought that all drugs are bad for you.
Yeah.

1010
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:39.240
I thought that all drugs just made you a loser and I was always terrified of

1011
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:42.900
being a loser.
That was the one thing that I was scared of more than anything.

1012
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.470
It's like,
you know,
I grew up in like this situation where,
you know,

1013
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.380
like Boston is like a,
it's a very harsh town,
you know,
and I,

1014
00:55:50.381 --> 00:55:53.910
I did not have a fucking clue as to what I wanted to do for a living and

1015
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:57.300
everybody around me seemed to know,
you know,
everybody was like,
you know,

1016
00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.280
going to college,
I didn't want to go to college.
I was like,

1017
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:00.780
what am I going to college for?
I'm going to college.

1018
00:56:00.781 --> 00:56:02.850
Just so just so people don't think I'm a loser.

1019
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:06.210
<v 3>Yeah,
I did what I want to do,
but I wonder,
what do you ever think?
I wonder,</v>

1020
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:07.830
why is it that like La,

1021
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:12.540
you can go to like bars in long island or Brooklyn or or or in Boston and get in

1022
00:56:12.541 --> 00:56:17.541
a fight so easily in Philly so easily you can walk in with the wrong hat and get

1023
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:21.130
in a fight.
Whereas it,
whereas in the Pacific northwest,

1024
00:56:21.131 --> 00:56:24.430
because west Seattle or whether it's in,
in San Francisco

1025
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:28.330
<v 2>or even la,
it just not the same thing.
People are awake at shot.</v>

1026
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.210
They're just wait,
well,

1027
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:33.280
not with a lot more mellow way more mellow than on the east coast.
Yeah.
Come on.

1028
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:37.030
You spend much time,
you spend much time in east coast.
Yeah.
I mean,

1029
00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:38.960
well for Ohio I have,

1030
00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:41.710
it's like where we would go for vacations or weekends and that's a little bit

1031
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:45.730
more Midwest [inaudible] notice the east coast people being aggressive.

1032
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.470
Yeah.
I mean,
there's definitely more drunks and like fights and like,

1033
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:54.250
especially like New York,
this fucking tires about the east coast though,

1034
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:58.930
there's a no bullshit clause that there's definitely no bullshit clause man,

1035
00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.970
that you don't get out here.
It's out here.

1036
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:05.830
Bullshit just breeds and runs rampant fucking feeds.
Well,

1037
00:57:05.831 --> 00:57:09.910
because you know,
it's what Sam Shepherd,
the great writer wrote about.
He said,

1038
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.730
why?
Why do you always look,
keep your,
why do you have all your characters?

1039
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:16.300
A lot of the characters in California and that around California,
the La area.

1040
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.930
And he said,
because this is a place people come to to reinvent themselves.

1041
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:24.400
It's a place that where people have no roots or they don't want to talk about

1042
00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:25.210
their roots,
you know?

1043
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:30.130
And so it gave them a chance to create these characters that were playing a

1044
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:34.420
character,
you know,
that they were basically lying,
you know?
And uh,

1045
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.240
I guess that's part of it.
Maybe.
Maybe you don't have,
like,

1046
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:40.000
I think a lot of times when you're coming from Boston and New York,
you're,

1047
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:43.600
you're,
again,
we were talking,
like you were saying,
you're cast in a role.

1048
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.290
You play a certain role,
you're given your attitudes,

1049
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:51.820
your given what to believe in your given.
You know,
how to behave as a man.

1050
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:56.590
They're a strong resilient lines to that and don't step out of him.
Okay.
And,

1051
00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.250
and whereas when you're in La,
there aren't as many people look and you,
you,
you,

1052
00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:03.040
you know,
a lot of people come here from somewhere,
so they don't,

1053
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:06.040
they're not sort of held down by that tradition.
Right?

1054
00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:08.530
You're not born into a system.
You're not born into a system.

1055
00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.970
You had neighborhood system especially,
right.
Man and neighborhood system is,
is,

1056
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.720
is,
is very powerful,
very powerful,
very hard to get out.

1057
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:18.910
If you don't get out of it.
And unless you physically move out of it.

1058
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.000
A lot of times what's really fascinating is when people start fucking other

1059
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:25.600
dudes,
wives touch.
It's fascinating.
You call it fascinating.

1060
00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:29.830
I call it a turn off in front of you.
Go,
dude,

1061
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:32.800
I bet you're wishing there's some,
some humans that I know,

1062
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.620
some civilians non-actor types,
um,
that are,
you know,
yeah.

1063
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.420
Having extramarital dalliances oh,
door neighbors was a lot.

1064
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.270
There's a lot of like that swing goes on.
Well,

1065
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:48.370
there's a lot of people doing it on a sneak tip too,
and I'm like,
Hey,
listen,

1066
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:50.140
I don't want to hear about you in the fucking news.

1067
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.900
I don't want any murders not to fuck in your friend's wife.

1068
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.330
It can you actually in your neighborhood like next door,

1069
00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:01.350
you know that guy is into your buddy,
say hi to him.
You guys,

1070
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.300
you've had that guy over for a barbecue,
right?
You did,
right?
Yeah.

1071
00:59:04.301 --> 00:59:05.440
And you're fucking his wife.
What?

1072
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.450
What do I haven't seen that actually I don't really,
maybe I'm naive freaks.

1073
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:10.390
There's a lot of that going on.

1074
00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:12.880
There's a lot of people wanting to distract themselves in this crazy world.

1075
00:59:12.881 --> 00:59:14.190
They want to fuck.
That's the,

1076
00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:17.790
what do they just want to scratch that itch clock and they might as well fucking

1077
00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.860
playing dungeons and dragons were sticking q-tips in that time to fuck.

1078
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:24.770
I'm too busy asking the big questions.
What's that?
I don't know

1079
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:28.670
distractions.
Yeah,
there's no,

1080
00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:31.610
<v 4>something crazy happened to me yet.
A Fuddruckers the other day.</v>

1081
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.930
Tell me about that story.
I said,
I'm in Burbank Fuddruckers and I'm eating,

1082
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.830
my girlfriend's across from me and I see her like staring kind of weird off the

1083
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:42.500
side.
Me.
I'm like,
what's she looking at?
Whatever.

1084
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:47.570
And then suddenly she stands up and taps this table that's behind me,

1085
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:50.330
the taps,
this guy on the shore and screams,

1086
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.800
this man's trying to steal your purse and points to this other guy that's

1087
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:58.790
sitting on the other side of me.
And uh,
he stands up and he goes,

1088
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:03.140
I did not try to steer it.
No,
you're mistaken.
And next thing I know,
he runs out.

1089
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.780
I'm like,
what the fuck just happened?

1090
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:09.170
And what supposedly happened is his guy comes in,
Indian guy,

1091
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:10.780
which is even weirder.
Uh,

1092
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:15.620
he sits down and then he takes his duffle bag and he pulls out a coat and puts

1093
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.200
it on this woman's purse that was on the floor.
Yeah.

1094
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.310
And then he was starting to scoop it up into his duffle bag bag,

1095
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.420
but stupid me runs out of fid Rutgers and chases that guy.

1096
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.730
And I'm like halfway down the street going,

1097
01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:32.690
why the fuck am I chasing after this guy?
Didn't even have the purse.

1098
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.560
Why am I running after him?
There was that incident.
Yeah,

1099
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:37.250
and there was a car get away car.

1100
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.880
He jumps in the getaway car and takes off in the car.
Was like a brand new car.

1101
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:41.714
It was like,
I'm brand new,

1102
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:43.710
<v 2>it's called,
it's called prey drive.</v>

1103
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.840
Do you think that you would have done that if your girl wasn't there?
No.

1104
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:50.890
I think if he wasn't Indian,
I would have not have done that.

1105
01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.070
I think that the fact that his body and I'm like,
oh,
it can't hurt me.

1106
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:59.040
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't know man.

1107
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.430
I got to beat your ass.
You know what?

1108
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:04.840
Let accents really hard to sound intimidating.
Yeah.
Don't fuck around.

1109
01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.470
I'll give you that.
That's really,
yeah.
No,
I really didn't.

1110
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.940
It's really too bad that that's a hack accent because it really is a fun one.

1111
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.260
Yeah.
Who knows?
Indian accents a fun one.
Yeah,
but that's,
that's,
that's,
and,

1112
01:01:16.261 --> 01:01:17.790
and you know any jihad accent,

1113
01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:21.810
those are happy to give you that tight smack a time joking.
Yeah.

1114
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:23.930
Don't fuck around with me.
It's,

1115
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.370
it's very offensive though that you find that funny.

1116
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.190
That's just how they're communicating.
Yes it is.
And I apologize,

1117
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.150
although it'd be funny to see I Hindu cop,
if you had one in,
in,
in Boston,

1118
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:34.770
nobody would stop you phase.

1119
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.890
Is that racist to make fun of them behaving like now it's a,
it's a,

1120
01:01:37.891 --> 01:01:41.160
it's a mannerism.
Their Voi look,
I have a lot of respect for any culture,

1121
01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:41.671
but I mean that,

1122
01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:46.230
that that's I think Hindi is you hold your tongue in a certain way and when you,

1123
01:01:46.231 --> 01:01:50.370
when you learn English,
you,
you,
that's how some of them speak.
However,

1124
01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:52.800
a lot of you know,
India was a British colony,

1125
01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:55.730
so a lot of them will speak sort of with an English accent.

1126
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.440
Sort of a combination.
I've heard that too.
Yeah,
that's a,
it's,
it's,

1127
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.050
it is fascinating.
There's a couple of different accents come over there.

1128
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.050
It's fascinating to think that the whole world,

1129
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:08.730
like basically like 150 years ago was equal to look the population of India.

1130
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:12.780
That's right.
I think,
uh,
there were whole world was like a billion.

1131
01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:14.490
There are more than 1 billion people now in India.

1132
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:18.270
India is becoming a huge powerhouse.
It's such a vast area.

1133
01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.070
There was an of Anthony Bourdain's

1134
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.350
<v 1>show.
You ever watched that show?
No.
No reservations.
No.</v>

1135
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.380
One of my favorite shows really love it.
It's fun.
He's really cool.

1136
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.770
He's this guy who is a chef and a,
you know,
he's like,

1137
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.840
he apparently was just a wild punk rocker type chef and he,
you know,

1138
01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.300
did a lot of drugs and wrote books about the,
the crazy world of,

1139
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:39.980
of chef lives at chefs are all getting fucked up after shows or after a,

1140
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.060
you know,
uh,
their chefs rather than the kitchen.
Yeah.

1141
01:02:42.061 --> 01:02:45.030
And then it just really hilarious stuff.
And He,
um,

1142
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.780
he goes all around the world eating and like these really cool places.
Hmm.

1143
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.410
And like,
you know,
everywhere,
you know,
I'll always love to do that.
Actually.

1144
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.540
I love food.
Oh Dude,
you got to watch this show.

1145
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:58.050
I've completely forgot what we were talking about.
What we're talking about,
um,

1146
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.020
about Ellis.
No,
no.
Um,
um,
um,
India,
India,
India,
India,

1147
01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.210
and how fast it's becoming too went out.
Right.

1148
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:09.810
So he went over there and we was in India and was a key,

1149
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:13.530
went on a set of like one of these dudes like doing those India fucking action

1150
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:15.840
movies.
Like how many movies they film over,
Dude,

1151
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.650
they think sane amount they made,

1152
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.610
they make something like five times as many as Hollywood or something like that.

1153
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.770
It's really,
um,

1154
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:26.490
in the has come such a long way in 19,

1155
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:30.750
well I think in 75,
uh,
even even in maybe even the early eighties,

1156
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.810
India couldn't feed itself really.
India couldn't feed itself.

1157
01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.740
Now India is a huge exporter of grain and rice and a lot of other goods.

1158
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.440
India customer is going to become,

1159
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.850
India is going to become decentralized.
It's,
it's actually,

1160
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:47.030
it's because it's government is so ineffective.

1161
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:51.240
You could make the argument in India is becoming,
um,
a huge economic,

1162
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:52.510
people don't think of that when you talk about it.

1163
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.040
<v 5>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's disrespect.</v>

1164
01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:58.700
You can tell India he's fingering this now.

1165
01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.860
I can't remember.
That one's off.
Flash.
That's yours.

1166
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.240
<v 1>That's yours.
Oh,
look at that one.
That's all yours.</v>

1167
01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.330
I'm speaking of India and countries and America.

1168
01:04:07.331 --> 01:04:10.930
Brian play that fucking crazy Glenn Beck thing.

1169
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.400
I am starting to get [inaudible] to me,
this is,
yes,
I emailed to you.

1170
01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.050
This is what I'm getting concerned about it.

1171
01:04:17.051 --> 01:04:22.051
I'm getting concerned about this tag team fucking duo of Glenn Beck and Sarah

1172
01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.840
Pailin because now they're like combining their retard superpowers and they have

1173
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:32.290
even more dummies that are into what they're saying.
Okay,
dude,

1174
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:36.190
there was a giant Glenn Beck Rally on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's I

1175
01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:39.330
have a dream speech.
You got to see this really is,

1176
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.290
<v 5>if you haven't seen this,
you've got to watch this on Youtube,
okay?</v>

1177
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:47.530
Glenn Beck and is pandering at its finest and he's doing it in front of it.

1178
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:51.120
Looks like a million white people and they're saying it's only a hundred

1179
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.960
thousand I call bullshit.

1180
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:54.850
I say they're trying to downplay this is they're worried about this mother

1181
01:04:54.851 --> 01:04:56.700
fucker taking over the world.
Okay?

1182
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.630
Because the retards are showing up in millions for this dude.

1183
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.920
At 300,000 students got it locked up.

1184
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:06.030
He's picked up the full retard vibration and knows exactly what they want to

1185
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:09.220
hear.
You gotta he's playing on the street.

1186
01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:15.320
Good Monument.
White people are going crazy.

1187
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.330
They're white.
People are acting.
They're minorities.
Is this,

1188
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.890
is this a Glenn Beck Rally?

1189
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:25.650
<v 2>Yes.
White people are trying to take back the world.
Watch this.
Look at this.</v>

1190
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.720
That is beyond man is happening.
Oh,

1191
01:05:29.721 --> 01:05:34.720
my phone cut today begins to turn back to God.
Okay.

1192
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:38.890
<v 5>Okay.
That motherfucker should be doing tricks right now and handing out a hat.</v>

1193
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.140
Okay.
He's putting on a fucking show

1194
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:45.760
<v 2>for too long.
He was a standup comic by the way.
Yes,
he was in a terrible one.</v>

1195
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.710
Yeah.
Heads one is a genius though for retarded.

1196
01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.890
Dramatic pauses.
He looks down,
he cries,

1197
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:57.640
we have awesome.
There's nothing scarier than dumb people.

1198
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.330
It sound smart guy.
Yeah,
he's a,
he's a sharp profile.

1199
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:06.340
Sharp talking Donald Dude worried about scars and thinking about the scars and

1200
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.560
he's a dangerous motherfucker.
You know people who are downplaying this guy,

1201
01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:15.640
concentrate on this guy is starting to learn how much power he has our to Trump

1202
01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:19.650
growing and growing and growing and his power base is dumb as he is,

1203
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.950
as crazy as he is,

1204
01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:24.670
as much sponsors pull off of his shell because he says that Obama's erases,

1205
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.610
that guy's getting,

1206
01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:29.440
that's why you've gotta be very careful of any play the Pailin one because this

1207
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:32.740
is fucking bananas to buy a Nana's.
There's,

1208
01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:36.640
there's a thing that's going on in this country where people are happy to be

1209
01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:39.640
dumb.
Plus it's fear based,
not thought based,
right?
It's fear based.

1210
01:06:39.641 --> 01:06:44.200
It's not thought paste and they also want a low bar.
The joy,
this low ball,

1211
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:49.120
the same one.
A Dad,
I want him to have a dad.
No,
it's not.

1212
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:52.300
Fast forward for a couple of steps and he brings up Sarah Palin.
Oh,
okay.

1213
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:53.134
I'm sorry.

1214
01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:58.580
And She's speaking to you today as a mother of someone in the military,

1215
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.650
ladies and gentleman is pretty sad.
Paleo.

1216
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.820
<v 5>This is terrifying.
This is the chapter in the book where Shit gets crazy.</v>

1217
01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:12.270
This is where the earth starts to fucking eat itself.

1218
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:22.350
This is like our fall grown right back Marion music.

1219
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.240
This is our flower in the background.

1220
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:27.420
Really dumb people are trying to hijack the country.

1221
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.650
Oh my gosh.
Nationals.
Oh my God,

1222
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.030
<v 6>and an honor.
What an honor.</v>

1223
01:07:38.031 --> 01:07:43.031
We stand today at the symbolic crossroads of our nation's history and all around

1224
01:07:46.821 --> 01:07:51.821
us are monuments to those who have sustained us over the years in word or deed.

1225
01:07:55.130 --> 01:08:00.130
There in the distance stands the monument to the father of our country and

1226
01:08:02.151 --> 01:08:07.151
behind me the towering presence of the great demands,

1227
01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:08.300
the pater.

1228
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.380
<v 2>There's a billion white tee shirt</v>

1229
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.810
<v 6>moment of its most perilous,</v>

1230
01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.440
probably one black guy crying free,
so happy.

1231
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:21.110
There's so many white people around him because he loves white people.

1232
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.810
I don't read these grounds where we are so honored to stand up,
shut it off,

1233
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:30.770
shut it off.
I can't tell you I can't take it.
She's not good.
I can't take it.

1234
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:34.850
<v 1>She's terrifying,
man.
That bitch is frightening the fuck out of me.
What?</v>

1235
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.390
No one together because I believe when?
When,
when you look at that,

1236
01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.630
when I look at Sarah Palin appealing,
I never even see a platform.

1237
01:08:40.631 --> 01:08:44.740
I don't see a philosophy.
I see ambition.
That's how I see exactly for power.

1238
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.750
That's scary to me,
man.
That scares the shit.
This shit history is littered with,

1239
01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.410
with,
you know,

1240
01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:55.150
Demi gods who ended up doing terrible things and in the name of what our team

1241
01:08:55.151 --> 01:08:59.470
and and,
and the truth and the truth with a capital t and we all have this,

1242
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.830
this desire to have someone lead us.
We all have this,

1243
01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:07.030
this feeling where we need someone who's smarter and wiser,
who represents us,

1244
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.530
you know,
and would you really fucking dumb?
The problem is really dumb people,

1245
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:15.280
they get a say in everything too.
And there's,
they're subject to a lot of tricks.

1246
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:18.670
There's subjects to the,
they're subject to nationalism.

1247
01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:22.360
They're subject to these kinds of ridiculous Rah Rah Rah America speeches that

1248
01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:24.430
don't say Jack Shit.
They say nothing.

1249
01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:27.950
It's all just this cheerleading fucking event and they're subject to it.

1250
01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:31.450
Then my team versus your team.
Yeah,
they can't help it.
They're dumb.

1251
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.930
They don't know they're being bullshitted.
D they grew up around dumb people.

1252
01:09:34.931 --> 01:09:36.430
They go to work with don people.

1253
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.250
There's no one in their family that's interesting or ask any questions at all.

1254
01:09:39.251 --> 01:09:41.260
And they just get sucked right into it,
man.
Right.

1255
01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:46.240
And she seems to speak real good.
She seems like a normal person.

1256
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.510
There is a scientist,
uh,

1257
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.730
heard a talk and I think it was on NPR somewhere and he was saying that human

1258
01:09:51.731 --> 01:09:54.580
beings are um,
uh,
what does the word,

1259
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.390
human beings are cognitively selective.
Okay.
Naturally.

1260
01:09:58.391 --> 01:10:01.140
So what we'll do is when we have,
we already have a point of view of,

1261
01:10:01.141 --> 01:10:03.250
based on our childhood,
based on our experiences,

1262
01:10:03.251 --> 01:10:04.300
and we have a strong point of view.

1263
01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.300
And what happens is we're listening to a speech or we're listening to a

1264
01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:08.590
philosophy or reading a book.

1265
01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.380
We'll cherry pick only the facts that support and bolster our argument.
Yeah.

1266
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.820
And one of the,
one of the difficult things to do as you get older,

1267
01:10:15.821 --> 01:10:19.900
and I think that's very important to do,
is to always sit back,
step back,

1268
01:10:19.901 --> 01:10:24.160
and take a look at the flaws in your own argument and the flaws of your own

1269
01:10:24.161 --> 01:10:27.880
philosophy and in the paradigm that you carry around with you.

1270
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.150
Because that's how you grow.
Take a look,

1271
01:10:31.151 --> 01:10:34.300
a critical and honest look at yourself all the time.

1272
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.740
And that's my favorite thing about you.

1273
01:10:35.741 --> 01:10:39.730
You always been so ridiculously critical and honest with yourself.
Not Critical,

1274
01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:43.040
but just always very honest.
Always reassessing.
I've always seen that with you.

1275
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.800
That's why you want to make mistakes,
man.

1276
01:10:44.801 --> 01:10:48.250
He can make mistakes cause of emotions to make mistakes because of insecurities.

1277
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:51.040
Huge.
It's very powerful to look at other people and go,
you know what?

1278
01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:55.150
I fucked up.
I fucked up.
I'm sorry I fucked up.
I,
you never look bad when you're,

1279
01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:59.110
when you're honest and vulnerable.
I know.
If you're a wild person,

1280
01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:03.550
like I know you are and I've been subject to being uh,
you know,
I mean I'm not,

1281
01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:07.680
I'm not very good at normal life.
You know,
when you're,

1282
01:11:07.681 --> 01:11:10.180
you're living like a,
a wild person,
you know,

1283
01:11:10.181 --> 01:11:12.220
basically a comic does whatever the fuck they want,
man.

1284
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.180
You live in as a professional comic,
you know,
and everybody else is,

1285
01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.900
is connected to some sort of a grid and you're,
you're living wild and crazy.

1286
01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:20.610
You're,
you're liable to do some crazy shit.

1287
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.320
You're liable to find yourself with some weird too.

1288
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:26.410
<v 2>Situation's a little too little time with nobody watching for a man in a bad</v>

1289
01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:29.170
situation.
Yeah,
yeah.
Look,
I've got all this cash.

1290
01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:30.770
Nobody's looking and I'm at vague

1291
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.100
<v 1>nuts.
You can make mistakes.
You know,
it's so easy to make mistakes.
Well,
I,</v>

1292
01:11:36.101 --> 01:11:38.700
that's that there's the zen poet that read it a really cool,

1293
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:42.090
wrote a really cool poetic book called one continuous mistake.

1294
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.560
That's what she calls life.
Life is one continuous,
it's like Jujitsu.
You know,

1295
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:47.251
you start out,

1296
01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:50.310
you get tapped all the time and eventually you get a little bit better and not

1297
01:11:50.311 --> 01:11:53.220
getting tapped.
Eventually you start tapping people,
but there's,

1298
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:58.020
there's always going to be more.
It never ends.
Never,
never doesn't go away.

1299
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.950
It just gets bigger and bigger and crazier and crazier.
It doesn't end.

1300
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.020
Do you ever surf by the way?
No,

1301
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:06.810
but I went boogie boarding in Hawaii and it was fucking awesome.

1302
01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:08.720
I did not think it would be so viscerally sound.

1303
01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.550
<v 2>I was just in France for nine days in the south of France called beer.</v>

1304
01:12:12.551 --> 01:12:15.130
It's don't worry about it.
My buddy made a fortune in the banking say this.

1305
01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:19.570
It makes me so attracted to know.
The point is,
the point is that,
uh,

1306
01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:24.520
I look number one great in a wetsuit,
but I took lessons from the,
uh,
sorry,

1307
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.540
I say that loud.

1308
01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:30.170
I took lessons from the current French national champion and [inaudible].

1309
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:34.240
He had me on a wave.
Holy Shit.
I served five waves.
I was like,

1310
01:12:34.241 --> 01:12:36.640
this is the greatest experience of my life.
But he was,

1311
01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:38.470
he was a huge part of catching,
wait,

1312
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.390
the huge part of being a great surfer is understanding exactly how to read the

1313
01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:47.140
ocean.
It's being able to catch the wave and the right way.
And that takes,

1314
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:51.670
that takes literally,
so it takes rhythm,
it takes patience,

1315
01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.240
it takes strength.
It's,
it's,

1316
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.410
I'm glad I didn't start surfing when I was younger because I would've been,

1317
01:12:56.710 --> 01:13:00.690
I would've been out there now with no resume and just,
uh,

1318
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.450
and a guy who could serve tubes cause that,
that addictive man,

1319
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.920
I can't imagine Dame hired.
Fuck.
Oh my God.
You know,
that's what everybody does.

1320
01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.710
Really.
What a surprise.
That's what they do.

1321
01:13:11.711 --> 01:13:13.660
I mean that surfer culture is like connected.

1322
01:13:13.661 --> 01:13:17.050
So have you seen riding giants and riding giants?
I was.

1323
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:20.670
I can't believe you haven't seen riding giant.
What is it?
Can you just take it,

1324
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.520
put it up on Youtube?
Well,
it's Laird Hamilton.
They surfed all,

1325
01:13:24.521 --> 01:13:29.410
I did see that in a six to nine stories.
High Mexico,
right.
All over the world.

1326
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:34.210
The ocean.
I didn't understand how crazy this was until I went to Hawaii.

1327
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:38.500
Bookie board the waves,
when they start giants,
they move at 35 miles an hour.

1328
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.440
So you have to be total Jackie.

1329
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:44.470
You fall way there at Hamilton who was riding and he wrote,

1330
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:47.490
he was riding and they said if he had fallen that way,

1331
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.570
if there's a 50% chance he would've just died.

1332
01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:51.250
You don't come up because when you fall,

1333
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.330
there's another way that six stories high waiting to hit you again.

1334
01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.990
Send a hundred yards into the ocean.
Oh my God.

1335
01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:03.790
You don't even have life vests on life fest.
Oh my turf.

1336
01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:07.970
That tube.
Or You die America though.
Let's find out.
They did have life vests.

1337
01:14:07.971 --> 01:14:11.200
Do they?
No,
they didn't.
They definitely know you've got to,
whoa my,

1338
01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:14.850
I had a life because then you can't dive under the water and be saved.

1339
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.640
God riding,
driving,
try it.

1340
01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.460
Stepped up a life vest.

1341
01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.010
No fucking waves are 90 feet high and you they do.
Yeah.

1342
01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.070
Oh no they don't.
No,
they don't do in this video,
you're not allowed to.

1343
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:31.270
You're not allowed to wear like those are the guys on the jet skis.

1344
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.900
Not The guy surfing.
Dude.
You know what that is?

1345
01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.070
That's a pad for when they with,
they hit 50 oak.
They hit the ground.

1346
01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:41.620
They don't get the wind knocked out of him and not and then go to sleep.

1347
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.860
Go to sleep.
Yeah.

1348
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:47.870
But a lot of dudes get paralyzed surfing a wave that you got to talk into the

1349
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:51.140
white car.
That's Laird Hamilton surfing a wave that he,
that,

1350
01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:52.870
that if he had fallen,
he wouldn't have made it.

1351
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:58.170
The video is entitled riding giants.
You'd find it on Youtube and,
and uh,

1352
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.040
oh my God.
Yeah,
it's Laird Hamilton.
It actually said,
oh my God.
I said,
oh my God.

1353
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:05.350
Yeah.
And this guy is the first big writer.

1354
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:08.530
There was a hurricane five or something in Hawaii and he went out on the water

1355
01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:12.640
and go into the water just to swim.
All this is very abstract.

1356
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:14.560
You don't realize the power of the ocean.

1357
01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.680
I know a lot of people that have never swam in the ocean before.

1358
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.880
You ever get caught in a wave or a in a tide.
We get pulled back.
Oh,

1359
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:24.510
that's scary as fuck.
Oh my God.
The ocean so strong.

1360
01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:27.190
And that does scary as fuck when you get caught in a tide.

1361
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.610
Fishermen and those guys never lose their respect for the ocean.
Never,
ever.

1362
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:32.030
It's like if you surf in the,
in the,

1363
01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:34.330
in like that crab fishing have you fall in that water.

1364
01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:38.300
You got about five minutes before hypothermia.
My vibe have like like a,

1365
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:40.090
like a cord in a helicopter,

1366
01:15:40.091 --> 01:15:43.420
like rent a helicopter to follow you around with like a safety core just in case

1367
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:46.190
if he could get fucked up,
they can't do that because what the,

1368
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.730
because the thing about surfing when you're surfing waves that are six stories

1369
01:15:48.731 --> 01:15:52.690
high is you have to have the ability to dive under the water.

1370
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:57.190
If you tried to be like just a helicopter with a thing to hold you there and you

1371
01:15:57.191 --> 01:16:01.270
got caught in that wave,
first of all it would,
it would break the cord.

1372
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.780
It would break the court order with rip you in half that wave,

1373
01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:08.110
those waves and those waves.
If you're unlucky enough,

1374
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.010
you'll get sent underwater 20 feet and thrown a football field.

1375
01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:16.990
Oh my God.
[inaudible] whole thing thrown a football field,

1376
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.340
a football field,
underwater water lying at 30 miles an hour.

1377
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:24.610
You're in a washing machine.
Oh my God.
Oh,
what's that?

1378
01:16:24.611 --> 01:16:28.480
A boulder [inaudible] there's your head stupid.
That's it.
That's a wrap sign.

1379
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:31.270
Guys die dead forever.
Oh,
they die all the time.

1380
01:16:31.271 --> 01:16:35.320
When they die all the time off of San Francisco would paddle out a half a mile

1381
01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:37.380
and they're sharks.
Everything.

1382
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:40.480
He'd have a wetsuit and there was a way that read up there.

1383
01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:42.610
That's where the sharks brief for 15 years.

1384
01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:46.180
He served that alone in an early morning and early evening.

1385
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:50.770
I would surf a waves that were literally six stories,
eight stories high.

1386
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.420
Oh my God.
The first day they've,

1387
01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:54.910
everybody they brought surfer magazine brought a bunch of the best surfers out

1388
01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:57.550
there.
One guy die waves that hi.
Oh yeah.

1389
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:02.320
There's a break where the waves are tidal waves,
real tidal waves.

1390
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:05.350
Is it only in the winter or is it all year round?
You haven't seen this.

1391
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:08.620
I'm terrified.
I'm terrified of getting riding giants.

1392
01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:10.070
There's two that I've always been

1393
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.300
<v 1>terrified of.
Golf and surfing.
Ah Man.
I know.
Cause at my,</v>

1394
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.730
when I had my problem with pool where I was playing pool eight to 10 hours a
day,

1395
01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:22.370
I mean it was,
it was,
it was a massive obsession buddy.
It was also fun as fuck.

1396
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.700
There's something really rewarding about getting good at pool.

1397
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.500
And I never got to like professional level,

1398
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.450
but I got decent where I could run out if I had an open shot,
you know?

1399
01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:33.380
And when I started playing when I was playing like eight,
10 hours a day,

1400
01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.700
you get like these like crazy rewards for figuring out racks.
There's like this,

1401
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.910
it's really like we're a little junkies for some chemical that you get when you

1402
01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:45.280
run out.
It's like,
it's a difficult thing to do.
So you get this weird like,
um,

1403
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.830
I figured it out reward,
you know,
like Ah,
like you're figuring out life.

1404
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:52.190
Meanwhile you're just stuck in a room knocking balls into a whole like a retard.

1405
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.550
Yeah.
But so your brain is flooded with this,

1406
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.670
this reward chemical and it,

1407
01:17:57.690 --> 01:18:02.690
it gives you the ability to solve problems and use patients and try to come up

1408
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.790
with creative solutions.
You know,

1409
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:08.450
even though it seems to be just like balls on a,
on a table with six holes,

1410
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.440
what it would,
it really is,

1411
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:13.130
is you gotta you gotta be creative in solving solutions and be rational and like

1412
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:16.280
how you do it and control the ball.
It's a very,
very,
very addictive.

1413
01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:19.080
But I know golf is too,
so I've been terrified of golf.

1414
01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:23.510
Golf is everybody I know that smart,
they get into it,
they knock the ball,

1415
01:18:23.511 --> 01:18:27.840
they're like,
it's like exciting and fun and so rewarding.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.

1416
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:30.090
Father takes lessons.
He goes to camps.
Yeah,

1417
01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:34.040
see nuts and golf apparently is way more popular than pool.

1418
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.300
So if that's the case,

1419
01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:38.270
then it's gotta be even more rewarding to totally make sense,
right?

1420
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.290
No doubt you're outside.
You're outside for,
I saw the setting and it's never,

1421
01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.790
it's all you're doing is swinging,

1422
01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:47.600
just swinging the club and you keep us with cigars are all about to,
you know,

1423
01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:48.890
cigars are all about two things.

1424
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.260
When you're lounging after you had a big fat steak.

1425
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.620
Or like if you're out with just a bunch of dudes and you know,

1426
01:18:54.621 --> 01:18:56.400
there's no chicks and just like,
just like

1427
01:18:58.170 --> 01:18:59.510
if you want to stink up their restaurant,

1428
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.980
they can [inaudible] I'm gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna knock this ball around.

1429
01:19:03.981 --> 01:19:05.060
I'm going to talk some shit.

1430
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:07.940
Let me tell you about this porno that I jacked off to the other day.

1431
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:12.080
I can say everything I want.
I can say,
Hey,
I won for when you,

1432
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.020
when you get married,
especially if you're a civilian,
if you get married,

1433
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:18.320
you have kids and you're at home all day,
you know,
or you know,

1434
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.530
after you get off work,
you're at work all day.
You have to adhere to one code,

1435
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.690
then you get home and you have to adhere to another code.

1436
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:26.000
Cause you're not even allowed to swear on the baby.
You know,

1437
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:31.010
you don't get much chance to cut loose and [inaudible] tell stinky pussy stories

1438
01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:36.770
from high school.
I'll fucking just smell my finger.
I remember that smell.
This,

1439
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.790
how many guys have told you to sticky pussy stores and you've been captivated

1440
01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:45.350
like it was a Goddamn Stephen King book
because we've all,

1441
01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.530
we've all had these stories.
Eddie Bravo has the best one because he was,

1442
01:19:48.531 --> 01:19:51.860
he was having sex with a girl and she had um,
uh,

1443
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:55.220
a yeast infection and her feet smelled at the same time.

1444
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:57.170
Try and he was having sex with her in a truck,

1445
01:19:57.590 --> 01:20:00.560
was like fucking her in an SUV and he had to open up the window.

1446
01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:04.520
It's tickets head out.
It's hilarious when he,
and he tells it,
it's brilliant.

1447
01:20:04.521 --> 01:20:07.520
Like actually Tony and when the podcast,
one of the ones,

1448
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.010
<v 2>you know,
it's funny,
you know,
it's funny,
as I've been told him,
opie and Anthony,</v>

1449
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.680
I've been,
I've been in situations where it's been,
you know,

1450
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:17.550
like did he use Jim Jim Norton's joke?
It smelled like an open grave.

1451
01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.470
Is that really the best way to describe it was an open grave.

1452
01:20:22.471 --> 01:20:26.010
I've been in this twist weapon,
like this is the worst smell I've ever had.

1453
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:29.550
It's worst get shot.
I keep going.

1454
01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.370
That's what I'm outside.
Worse Than Shit.
Girls will be like,
oh my God,
I'm like,

1455
01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.430
whatever.
It looks like shit in the toilets.

1456
01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:41.770
Girl doesn't or she doesn't react to the fact that it's happening.
Progress it.

1457
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.000
This girl I know that I really stinky pussy and I would know it was going to eat

1458
01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:46.860
her pussy out.
I still wanted to do it,

1459
01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:50.420
so I just gargle before I did and kept a little gargle and my mouth and just

1460
01:20:50.421 --> 01:20:51.650
kind of it on her pussy.

1461
01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:56.820
[inaudible]

1462
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.870
why is it so typically putting chemicals wet?

1463
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:05.610
[inaudible] just probably smelled like shit with,

1464
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:09.090
with Listerine and then unless burns the shit outta here.

1465
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.950
Oh God.
Oh.
I'll probably kill their chances of having no cavities either.

1466
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.210
I'm allergic to a spermicide on condoms,
man.
Really?
Yeah.

1467
01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:23.680
I've worn a condom since the 80s.
But the point
I saw one,
one,

1468
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.130
dude,
I get that and that,
that the Church and gets in my pee hole.
Holy Shit Man.

1469
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:33.780
I'm done for the next like,
you know,
fucking,
maybe that's Kinda Rhea anyway.

1470
01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:38.190
Oh No.
But I mean for Real,
man,
I'm,
I'm allergic to.
I'm allergic to that shit.

1471
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:39.780
Yeah,
man.
It's,
um,

1472
01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.840
there's a lot of God damn chemicals that aren't good for your system.

1473
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:47.810
What we're exposed to so many different chemicals all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1474
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.250
What do,
what do you think about fluoride in the water?
Is that all bullshit?

1475
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.210
I think it's all bullshit.

1476
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:54.310
But what do you think you think Florida is healthy to be drinking?
I didn't.

1477
01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.460
It's been around for 40,
50 years and we've had a pretty good control group.
Uh,

1478
01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:02.210
judging from what we've seen and Nah,
I don't think it's a,

1479
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:07.220
I don't think it has any effect [inaudible] these things have affected until

1480
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:09.980
they are combined with,
I think what happens with your,

1481
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.270
with the human body is we get exposed,

1482
01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:16.650
we can suppose by countless chemicals and who knows what they're liking.

1483
01:22:16.651 --> 01:22:18.960
Combination,
you know,
hydrogen and oxygen,

1484
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:21.600
you put them together in the right combination of warm water.
Right?

1485
01:22:21.601 --> 01:22:25.470
It means the same thing with cigarettes and birth control can be done,
right.

1486
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:27.870
It's really,
you're truly,
people died,
girls die.

1487
01:22:27.871 --> 01:22:31.280
If they are smoking cigarettes and I take birth control,
blood cots,

1488
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:34.530
they get blood clots,
they can go into a stroke.
And so,

1489
01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:37.080
so for me that's always what it is.
It's a question of,
um,

1490
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:40.620
what are we being exposed to?
What is the,
the umbrella of chemicals,

1491
01:22:40.621 --> 01:22:43.680
when and when is that happening and you know,
and all that stuff.

1492
01:22:43.681 --> 01:22:48.060
And what are the windows for it?
It's complicated.
It's very calm.
The body.

1493
01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:49.070
What I've found is I'm,

1494
01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:51.210
I've always been really into health and I've always been really into,

1495
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.970
especially keeping my energy where I need it.
And as I got older,

1496
01:22:53.971 --> 01:22:54.990
I would always take different things.

1497
01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:57.210
Like I tried to supplement and I tried this and more protein.

1498
01:22:57.570 --> 01:23:01.290
And what I find actually for me is if I get enough sleep and then I eat just

1499
01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:04.830
enough.
Your stomach is the size of a softball,
you know,
the adult stomach,

1500
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:09.050
you know,
don't mail stomach size of a softball if I eat.
Um,
you know,

1501
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.760
like just controlling my portions and eating good real food.

1502
01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:16.150
As long as I get enough sleep,
sometimes that's all I need.

1503
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:19.650
Just personally for me.
You know,
it's just,
it's just a question of,
um,

1504
01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.820
I can't remember what the hell we're even talking about.

1505
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:26.500
[inaudible]

1506
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:28.240
you're talking about,
you're talking about,

1507
01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:33.520
that's exactly why I went on a tangent.
That's what happened.

1508
01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:35.080
You're talking about if you go to the Applebee's,

1509
01:23:35.081 --> 01:23:38.080
just use your palm of your thumb.
If you could fit the food on there,
just eat.

1510
01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:41.980
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good luck.
That is true.
I mean,

1511
01:23:41.981 --> 01:23:44.750
I always feel better when I have small meals throughout the day.

1512
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.900
I don't feel like as lethargic,

1513
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:52.410
I'm a glutton and I will sit down and eat immense portions of food.

1514
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:58.180
Jake,
lately,
like dude all day.
Tell me about it.
When I work out,

1515
01:23:58.181 --> 01:24:01.160
if I do kettlebells or if I did you get to,
I just come home and eat steak three,

1516
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.280
bash them.
No,
it's not me.
It's not bad for you.
There's no evidence.

1517
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.090
What's the bad meat is bad for you.

1518
01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:09.220
I think meat is bad for you if you don't exercise,

1519
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:12.190
I think meat's bad for you if you don't also eat vegetables and things like
that.

1520
01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:14.020
I think you know,

1521
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.010
there's another thing that I read in this silly quote that I'm going to give you

1522
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.420
the,
I don't know if I could back up.

1523
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:23.980
There was in the same book about all people over a hundred that lived to be over

1524
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:27.160
a hundred.
Almost all of them were red mediators.
Well that's,

1525
01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:28.210
that's actually if you,

1526
01:24:28.211 --> 01:24:31.120
if you want go to ted.com and the guy who studied the six blue zones in the

1527
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:34.780
world where people live well over 100 years old and one is in Sardinia,

1528
01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:36.220
the other is in Okinawa.

1529
01:24:36.221 --> 01:24:39.970
And the other is actually the seventh day Adventists who live out in Montana.

1530
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:42.270
And he just took a look at these six different blue zones.
What,

1531
01:24:42.271 --> 01:24:44.530
what's the common thread?
All of them ate meat.

1532
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:48.370
Actually most of them eat some kind of a,
no,
most of them all of meat,
meat,
fish,

1533
01:24:48.371 --> 01:24:51.640
whether it's fish or,
but meat and all of them.
Um,
uh,

1534
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:53.710
the couple other things that they do,
but,
but,

1535
01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.950
but the other thing is a lot of them eat fermented things like yogurt and stuff

1536
01:24:56.951 --> 01:25:00.130
like that.
And that's very important in their culture.

1537
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:03.910
They also all have something to live for.
They all have a reason.

1538
01:25:03.911 --> 01:25:06.460
They get up every morning and a religious reasons or,
I'm sorry,

1539
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:07.540
the other major thing,
I'm sorry.

1540
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:10.720
The major thing that he found was it had nothing to do with religion.

1541
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:15.750
It has to do with how connected those communities where connection they find

1542
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:20.260
when people have strong bonded communities,
uh,

1543
01:25:20.261 --> 01:25:24.460
in villages and things like that where they take care of each other and where,

1544
01:25:24.461 --> 01:25:26.440
where even if somebody doesn't do as well,

1545
01:25:26.441 --> 01:25:29.230
if there's a cultural sort of notion that it doesn't matter,

1546
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:31.480
you take care of that person,
you make them feel safe.

1547
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:35.530
Those are the longest lived people.
Those,
and in the book,

1548
01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:40.330
the outliers where he looks at this place called Rosetta,
which was a,
uh,

1549
01:25:40.331 --> 01:25:40.651
this,

1550
01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:45.400
this village in Italy called Rosetta or Rosa foul founded this in the foothills

1551
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:46.420
of Pennsylvania.
They,
they,

1552
01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.930
they created this community build churches and they would all move in the marble

1553
01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:52.630
quarries and moved there.
And then there was a mobile query close to there.

1554
01:25:52.631 --> 01:25:53.920
So this town Rosetta,

1555
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.880
so this doctor went there to do this convention and he was talking to another

1556
01:25:57.881 --> 01:25:59.920
doctor who had been practicing and Rosetta for a long time.

1557
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.460
And this was in 1961 and he said,
you know,
I tell Ya,
um,

1558
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:07.950
these people cook with ward,
there are,
a lot of them are overweight.
Uh,

1559
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.950
but they all come from the same part of Italy and they,

1560
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.820
none of them die of heart disease.
They die of old age.
They went,

1561
01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:17.000
that's weird cause heart disease right now in our is an epidemic in our country,

1562
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:19.670
so let's go study it.
So he took a bunch of people and they were studying it.

1563
01:26:19.671 --> 01:26:21.620
They're like,
maybe they come from a really hardy stock,

1564
01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:23.990
but the problem with the people that would move out of that town and go to

1565
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:27.410
another town would die of heart disease.
So he's like,
that doesn't,

1566
01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.830
so it's not a genetic hardy stock,
although people there live long,
he said,

1567
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:33.670
what is it they're eating?
They're not even cooking with olive oil anymore.

1568
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.950
The clicking with Lard.
Uh,
and,
and,
and they do exercise,

1569
01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:41.120
but they don't exercise as much.
And what they found was that they had a really,

1570
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:46.121
really strong community and that they all had this incredible support system.

1571
01:26:46.161 --> 01:26:50.630
So if somebody didn't make as much money or was a little slow or they still felt

1572
01:26:50.631 --> 01:26:53.780
loved and when they would go to these medical conventions,

1573
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:57.440
they started trying to talk about health in terms of community.
In other words,

1574
01:26:57.441 --> 01:26:58.310
human beings.
Yeah,

1575
01:26:58.311 --> 01:27:01.550
you need to control your cholesterol and your fat and there's a science behind

1576
01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:01.970
it.

1577
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:06.440
There's also what is obviously very important for human beings for longevity is

1578
01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:08.150
connection,
feeling connected,

1579
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.170
feeling like they have connection and that they're loved.
It's like Avatar Bro.

1580
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.250
Yes it is.
And I'm a Navi.

1581
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:16.820
I think it's just cause they're so happy they get to fuck Asian women.

1582
01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.040
So that's why.
And you know all these different places,

1583
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:23.210
the hottest women happiness and you like Asian women.
Yes.
Not an Asian.

1584
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.330
That's a terrible theory base actually.

1585
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.960
I believe it's just lean fish cause don't you always think the health health

1586
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:31.730
definitely has something to do with it.
You know,

1587
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.370
diet has something to do with it.
Yeah.
You know,
and Italians,

1588
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.280
a lot of parts of Italy,
they eat a lot of seafood,
a lot of fish,

1589
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:41.660
a lot of fresh fish,
vegetables.
But we think of as American Italian food,

1590
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:44.870
like meatballs and sausages and stuff like that.
I mean they have that in Italy,

1591
01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:48.350
but that's not really Italian food.
A lot of Italian food is seafood,
right?

1592
01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:51.080
There's like you'll Grano that place.
You took us to,

1593
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:55.130
Brian introduced me to this really great restaurant and it's in Santa Monica or

1594
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:59.630
West la in West la in Santa Monica called the [inaudible] great restaurant in.

1595
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:02.990
The dude goes to the fish market every morning at six o'clock in the morning and

1596
01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:06.280
gets what's fresh.
It's unbelievable.
Who's a,
he's a bad motherfucker.

1597
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:11.030
He is Sal Marino and he does his,
he's like nine course dinners.

1598
01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:15.050
If you've got the Cheddar,
if you get a,
for this shit's on crazy expensive,

1599
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:20.000
expensive food is like an artist.
He's an artist.
He's a maestro.

1600
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:24.230
He goes to the fish market.
He prepares all the meals themselves.
He's fanatical.

1601
01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.860
The dude's dedicated to it.
Comes over to the table,
introduces himself,

1602
01:28:27.861 --> 01:28:31.160
talks to chats.
You explains to what each different thing is,

1603
01:28:31.161 --> 01:28:32.450
why they're together.

1604
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:35.420
Because this gives you one certain kind of taste and this like,
you know,

1605
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:38.900
he's got,
he grows I think 36 different kinds of tomatoes in his yard.

1606
01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:41.460
He's a maniac I suppose.
What's the name of [inaudible]?

1607
01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.860
He lives for food and lives for the details.
It's called Il Grano cry.

1608
01:28:45.861 --> 01:28:48.800
L.
G.
R.
A.
N.
Oh yeah,
it's on Purdue.

1609
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:51.680
In Santa Monica Bar Badass for West La.
You know,

1610
01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:54.140
that's one of the things about watching that Anthony Bourdain's show.

1611
01:28:54.141 --> 01:28:55.430
I've always loved good restaurants,

1612
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:58.460
but I never really understood like what was going on behind the scenes until I

1613
01:28:58.461 --> 01:29:00.610
watched to Shelly and I was like,
wow,
I want to fuck him.

1614
01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.090
Like he would bring you backstage

1615
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.170
<v 1>to where all the Mexicans are and he's like,
you know,</v>

1616
01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:05.220
he was in New York City and I was like,

1617
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:09.480
this is the backbone of all the best restaurants,
all the best chefs.
He goes,

1618
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:12.210
yeah,
did these Mexican guys came so hard?
Yeah.

1619
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:14.910
And there guys work so hard to restaurants.

1620
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.460
I don't know what it is in the culture,
like Mexican culture,

1621
01:29:17.461 --> 01:29:20.640
but I really have always been so impressed with how he starts work.

1622
01:29:20.641 --> 01:29:23.160
They bust their ass like I am anti immigration dude.

1623
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:27.480
These guys worked their ass off,
man.
They're nice people too,
man.
You know?
Look,

1624
01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:28.960
Mexicans in La,
you know you,

1625
01:29:28.961 --> 01:29:33.330
you're not going to have any more like assholes in the Mexican community per

1626
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:35.980
capita than you would in the white community or the black communities.

1627
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.740
There's always assholes per capita,
you know,
and I know a lot of cool Mexicans,

1628
01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:44.850
man,
I love Mexican food.
I love,
I'm not really into the music.

1629
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.610
They can keep that music.
You can keep them Mariachi.

1630
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.990
I love you.
Your food is awesome.

1631
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:54.450
Your people are cool as fuck you made the best boxers ever.

1632
01:29:54.451 --> 01:29:56.430
All my favorite boxers,
Julio,
Cesar Chavez,

1633
01:29:56.431 --> 01:29:58.430
my number one favorite boxer of all time,
Mexico.

1634
01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:02.940
Know ever see a movie called Amado Sparrows.
You don't want to have that on DVD.

1635
01:30:02.941 --> 01:30:03.550
That's one of those,

1636
01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:06.180
it's one of my favorite bar and never watched and that's one of my favorite

1637
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:09.870
written and directed by a Mexican guy.
Guillermo.
Something I think fuck up rent.

1638
01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.920
I think passion of the Christ cured me of anything with subtitles.

1639
01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:18.620
I have a,
I know it's a great movie.
I'm sure I saw those.
You'd love it man.
Yeah,

1640
01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:22.480
he did.
What other movie did he do?
He did pan's labyrinth.
Yes.
Oh,
that's cool.

1641
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:25.570
Guillermo del Toro then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dude.
Pan's labyrinth is a bad ass.

1642
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:30.420
Although I did not like his book,
man.
I read his book.
The strain.
Oh,

1643
01:30:30.421 --> 01:30:33.600
so disappointing because it started out so bad ass.

1644
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:38.870
It's a v a vampire book and it starts out where this plane lands and everyone on

1645
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:39.804
the plane is dead.

1646
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:43.950
They've all been jacked by a vampire and the vampire flew in from another

1647
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:46.980
country and killed everyone on the plane that landed the plane and he couldn't

1648
01:30:46.981 --> 01:30:49.200
communicate with the plane and they didn't know what the fuck to do.

1649
01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:52.950
It's how it starts out bad ass where you're like,
whoa,
where's this going?

1650
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.450
But at the end of the book,
it's like,

1651
01:30:54.451 --> 01:30:56.760
and then he killed this one and this one came out and he killed them.

1652
01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:58.350
It's like almost like they ran it like this.

1653
01:30:58.351 --> 01:31:01.140
Just finish this fucking book stupid.

1654
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:07.160
I would love it if I really wish they would go back and pick up where you got in

1655
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:10.650
like 30,
40% in.
Try it again.
Let's try the end again.

1656
01:31:10.651 --> 01:31:11.820
Let's try another edit the movie.

1657
01:31:11.821 --> 01:31:14.160
It wasn't one movie that scared the shit out of you more than anything else.

1658
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:19.350
The Blair witch project scared the fuck out of me but twice,
two times,
two times.

1659
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.210
The first time it scared me is because me and Chris Mcguire went to go see it in

1660
01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:24.961
Houston,
Texas.

1661
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:28.350
We were performing at the laugh stop and these dudes who worked across the

1662
01:31:28.351 --> 01:31:28.741
street at the,

1663
01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:32.730
at the movie theater came over to the show and this was like pre fear factor,

1664
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:35.490
you know,
it was,
I was on news radio.
Very few people really knew who I was,

1665
01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:38.940
but I had a good following in Texas for some strange reason and uh,

1666
01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.920
these guys came over after Sean and go,
hey man,

1667
01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.720
you want to go watch the Blair witch project?

1668
01:31:42.721 --> 01:31:45.650
We work at the movie theater will turn on while I'll go hang out there and we're

1669
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:46.471
like,
fuck it.
Yeah,

1670
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:49.920
let's go see me and Chris require go across the street with these two dudes and

1671
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:53.190
this dude's girlfriend and watch the Blair witch project at two o'clock in the

1672
01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:57.450
morning on a Saturday night after the midnight show.
And it was fucking scary.

1673
01:31:57.451 --> 01:32:00.010
And cause first of all was scary.
I didn't know what this

1674
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.580
<v 2>movie was about.
I didn't know if it was a hoax.
I didn't know.
I'm like,
I'm this,</v>

1675
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:07.780
I'm sensing bullshit.
I'm sensing acting.
I go,
this is a,
this is not real.

1676
01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:11.130
They're not trying to say this is real.
Like I knew almost nothing about it.

1677
01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.190
I just heard which they,
that woman,
they see it.
It was fucking scary.

1678
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:18.550
It was scary.
I mean it was obviously I was laughing cause problems.

1679
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:23.410
I saw that show when,
when everybody told me it was bullshit.
Oh No.

1680
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:25.420
That was before.
It was the first time.
It scared.

1681
01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.100
<v 1>Maybe the second time it scared me is when I took,
um,</v>

1682
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:30.840
I don't remember who I was dating at the time,

1683
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.990
but I took this girl to go see it with me and uh,
when I,

1684
01:32:33.991 --> 01:32:38.160
when I took her to go see it with me,
uh,
as I was,
oh,
I'm just Jessica.
And as,

1685
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.240
as we were watching it,

1686
01:32:39.241 --> 01:32:44.130
there was a dude who had his kid there and his kid was making so much fucking

1687
01:32:44.131 --> 01:32:48.210
noise and the kid was like six or f five or six when their kids,

1688
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.490
and so I shushed him,
I will my,

1689
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.350
and this Mexican dude freaked the fuck out on me and he was like,

1690
01:32:55.351 --> 01:32:58.980
mother Fucker,
don't shoot my kid,
motherfucker.
No fucking bitch.

1691
01:32:58.981 --> 01:33:02.790
Straight up bitch.
I'll kick your ass bitch.
And I'm like,
oh,

1692
01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:05.820
what are we going to deal with here?
What the fuck am I going to deal with here?

1693
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:07.590
So you know what I did?
I said nothing.

1694
01:33:07.591 --> 01:33:09.360
I just looked at the dude and said nothing.

1695
01:33:09.361 --> 01:33:11.160
And I tried to think about what's going to happen here.

1696
01:33:11.161 --> 01:33:13.650
Is this guy going to have a gun?
What if I put myself in?

1697
01:33:13.651 --> 01:33:16.650
What kind of a situation am I putting myself?
Best case,
worst case scenario,

1698
01:33:16.651 --> 01:33:18.510
best case scenario,
you have to beat him up and found this kid,

1699
01:33:18.511 --> 01:33:21.800
this guy was suck yelling at me,
you know?
And it was wild.

1700
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:24.450
So he didn't give a fuck that there's hundreds of people in this movie theater.

1701
01:33:24.451 --> 01:33:25.950
Like that's the craziest thing about La.

1702
01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:28.590
Like you never know when you to run into someone who's completely out of the

1703
01:33:28.591 --> 01:33:32.060
fucking mind and with his kid and people with their kids are crazy man.

1704
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:35.760
And this dude I was looking at,
I'm just like,
oh,
fleshy and Chubby.
I'm like,

1705
01:33:35.761 --> 01:33:40.080
this is not,
this is not Indian wants to fight.
This dude wants to shoot me.

1706
01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:40.750
You know?

1707
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:43.890
That's a scary thing about how many people in La have guns and the type of

1708
01:33:43.891 --> 01:33:48.080
person who will just come at you that aggressively out of nowhere.
Right.

1709
01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:51.180
You know,
when you look it really,
it's his fault.
Okay.

1710
01:33:51.181 --> 01:33:55.830
If that was me and my kid was in someone,
which I'd been like,
sorry,
I'm sorry.

1711
01:33:55.831 --> 01:33:57.330
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Let's go.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

1712
01:33:57.390 --> 01:34:00.200
We gotta take you out of here until you calm down.
But this motherfucker,

1713
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:04.590
rational guy,
this mother fucker yelled at me,
man.
It was like,
Whoa,

1714
01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:07.440
this is not good.
So that said,
I was scared twice by the way.

1715
01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.740
<v 2>That's the second thought.
Scarier.</v>

1716
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:15.580
Like every time I thought about that movie I thought about that.
I saw,
I saw,

1717
01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:20.080
I saw shooting.
Uh,
I always on Vermont,
I was on Vermont,

1718
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:22.130
literally like right near the one on one.

1719
01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.920
The two actually saw the shooting happen,
saw the shooting.
I was,

1720
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.320
I was in traffic.

1721
01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:29.460
It was like about four in the afternoon and these dudes get out of a car and go

1722
01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:34.900
through any empties,
equip a croc into this other car,
misses the car.
Oh my.

1723
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:38.920
And then he stands there and looks a,
I remember never,
he had his glasses,

1724
01:34:38.921 --> 01:34:41.830
his sunglasses on the back of his head and he stands there and looks and he's

1725
01:34:41.831 --> 01:34:44.170
just a,
he's looking like that and he just,

1726
01:34:44.171 --> 01:34:47.890
and he just casually casually walks back and I go,

1727
01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:52.210
Holy Shit.
I'm like,
watch this.
I'm stuck in traffic.
When this happens,

1728
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.040
I turn and a cop is right next to me and I go,
did you see that?

1729
01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:02.000
And the cop goes,
what?
I go,
that guy just emptied his clip,
that car,

1730
01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:04.160
they're emptied his clip into that car.

1731
01:35:04.161 --> 01:35:07.490
The dude had come around this way and went off and the guy goes like this,

1732
01:35:07.491 --> 01:35:11.870
the cop goes over there.
I go,
yeah.
And he goes,
AH,
right.

1733
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:15.410
And he grabs a thing and then the traffic started to move.
And I'm like,

1734
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:18.390
do you want to go ahead?
And so had he not seen it yet,

1735
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:20.870
and he was right next to me and then the guy emptied the clip,
but you know,

1736
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:25.610
outside,
how did he make it sound like,
oh,
Bobo,
boom,
boom.
But you know,

1737
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:29.060
you figure is it is a construction and I turn,
I see a guy emptying a gun,

1738
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.200
waiting the,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1739
01:35:30.201 --> 01:35:32.360
A cop should know what a god damn gun sounds like.

1740
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:37.390
I bet you he was his window or window rolled up.

1741
01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.720
He says,
you know,
here,
you know,
you don't care.
No one,

1742
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.190
especially if it's traffic and it's really loud.
Yeah.

1743
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:46.280
And the Dukes to empty the clip right there and they got away,
no problem.

1744
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:50.720
I kept driving and then kind of pull the other way and I was like,
well,

1745
01:35:50.721 --> 01:35:52.910
they're completely gone away.
Completely got away.

1746
01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.880
But you know how much investigation you think has done?
Zero

1747
01:35:58.850 --> 01:36:00.330
<v 4>file a report.
So many people.</v>

1748
01:36:00.331 --> 01:36:02.780
I hear like when I was talking about that purse and all the cops came,

1749
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:05.270
they were like,
Whoa,
so you got the license plate number?

1750
01:36:05.271 --> 01:36:08.090
And I gave it to him and he goes,
yeah,
tend to come up with anything.
I'm like,

1751
01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:12.170
well two of us,
two people sit all the license plate number if you use like,

1752
01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.560
like typing in a computer and go,
all right,
White Mazda,
you know,

1753
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:18.980
these are all the white Mazda's matched with five of the letters,
you know,

1754
01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:22.220
or something like that.
[inaudible] do any of them,

1755
01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:27.070
<v 2>Jordy crimes are still solved.
How almost all of them.
It's never CSI work.</v>

1756
01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:29.020
It's confessions.
Really.
Yeah.

1757
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:32.590
Still Confessions and human interaction and getting,

1758
01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:36.850
and cops were really good at getting people to just feel safe and saying,
look,

1759
01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:39.650
you've felt first.
They empathize.
You know,
there's just give them access to see.

1760
01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:44.650
I bet everybody would confessed.
Exactly.
I'm serious.
Give prisoners ecstasy.
Yeah,

1761
01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.170
just hit him over the tab.
Wouldn't stand up in court though.

1762
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.360
We need to change the court then.
Yeah,

1763
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.470
we need to change that and get him showed him anything that you say under

1764
01:36:53.471 --> 01:36:55.990
ecstasy.
If you're on ecstasy,
you're going to tell the truth.

1765
01:36:55.991 --> 01:36:58.680
There are drugs that are better than that though.
Are they?
Yeah,

1766
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.210
but they don't make you feel good.
You make someone feel good.

1767
01:37:01.211 --> 01:37:02.370
They're more likely to tell you everything.

1768
01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:06.130
Sodium Pentothal bull make you just relaxed or something.
If it did,

1769
01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.330
then people would take it at raves point ended up sodium pentothal set up at

1770
01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:14.200
raves.
I believe you're right.
ECSTASIES the shit.
But after I saw that shooting,

1771
01:37:14.201 --> 01:37:17.410
I remember I was really depressed and for three days I said to my buddy,
I go,

1772
01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.090
I don't know man.
I feel depressed or something.

1773
01:37:19.091 --> 01:37:23.800
Ever since I was told that shooting and my buddy goes,
yeah,
you're supposed to.

1774
01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.070
That's normal to feel really like scared and depressed.

1775
01:37:27.071 --> 01:37:30.540
When you see like to describe someone likes to see for people that have got post

1776
01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:32.390
traumatic stress disorder sense.
Yeah.

1777
01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.620
That's one of the things that they say that it's a beneficial thing by the way.

1778
01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:38.620
I think I don't,
I only took it actually wants,
it's just specify,

1779
01:37:38.621 --> 01:37:42.010
I've said this before,
I've taken twice scary.
I would never do it again.

1780
01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.210
I did not like how I felt the next day I had the next day I was so dumb I

1781
01:37:46.211 --> 01:37:50.200
couldn't read.
I literally couldn't read call,
this is terrible for your body.

1782
01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:54.190
When I'm doing that was not like mushrooms or anything where I got something out

1783
01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:56.010
of it,
but my body almost

1784
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.100
<v 1>better and like more energized.
You know,
you gotta go through a mushroom trip,</v>

1785
01:37:59.101 --> 01:38:01.740
you feel good at the end of it and they feel a little exhausted.

1786
01:38:01.741 --> 01:38:04.980
But you feel good.
Like physically,
you feel like you've lost a lot of stress,

1787
01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:09.060
you know,
did they used to prescribe it for,
or if they don't do it now,

1788
01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:12.750
still no wait.
But you know what?
People have done therapeutic tests using it,

1789
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:13.111
you know,

1790
01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:18.111
and there's a lot of evidence that it helps people with all sorts of things in

1791
01:38:18.151 --> 01:38:20.010
their life and their past dealing with things.

1792
01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:23.940
What does even better is Iba gain Ibogaine.
Is this a thing?

1793
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:27.780
My friend Ed clay was just telling me how it changed his life.
He began is this,

1794
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:31.950
uh,
this drug that is illegal in America but legal in Mexico.

1795
01:38:31.951 --> 01:38:35.640
So a lot of people go down to Mexico to take it and they have these Ibogaine,
uh,

1796
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.360
therapy places where they're like some incredibly high percentage,

1797
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:44.361
over 80% successful in curing people of opiate addiction with virtually no

1798
01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:47.550
hangover,
like literally rewires your entire brain.

1799
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:51.240
It's supposed to be like one of the most intensely introspective,
uh,

1800
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.980
experiences as a human being could go through.

1801
01:38:52.981 --> 01:38:57.460
Like my friend Ed said that it was like he re uh,

1802
01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.160
relearned his whole life,

1803
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:02.790
like literally went back over things that he did when he was a child and to

1804
01:39:02.791 --> 01:39:06.510
things that his father said to him when he was young that made fresh day and

1805
01:39:06.511 --> 01:39:11.100
yeah,
and but,
but graphically,
you know,
and,
and like high detail,

1806
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:13.470
like you're watching it in a film and you know,

1807
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:17.850
and brilliantly demonstrates all the areas in your life where you're behaving

1808
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:18.810
and acting in a certain way.

1809
01:39:18.811 --> 01:39:22.470
And what this addiction really is is some sort of a hole in the way,
you know,

1810
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:26.520
your,
your mind has been wired and it almost like sets everything,

1811
01:39:26.521 --> 01:39:30.120
resets everything and lets everything jingle into place and you get a much

1812
01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:33.360
better map of what your mind is and how your mind works.

1813
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:38.160
And it's like hugely successful and curing people of Heroin Addiction.

1814
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:41.490
Wow.
It's illegal in this country.
But he said,

1815
01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:45.090
he said it completely changed his life.
He started thinking about how,
you know,

1816
01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:45.451
his,

1817
01:39:45.451 --> 01:39:49.770
his relationships with his family and all his childhood shit and just saved is

1818
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:50.820
saved the way things.

1819
01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:54.900
So he just feels so much more loving and friendly and cool and Connie had like

1820
01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:58.320
an air of relief about it.
It was really kind of cool.
That's wild.
Yeah.

1821
01:39:58.770 --> 01:40:01.620
Illegal in America.
Why would you want to get enlightened?

1822
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.440
We don't have room for that.
No.
We got room for big MACs.
You know,

1823
01:40:04.441 --> 01:40:05.910
we've got no real for enlightenment.
We gotta look,

1824
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:09.570
they are a million people are going to see Glen Beck and Sarah Pailin at the

1825
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:13.410
fucking Washington monument on the eve of the Martin Luther King.

1826
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:15.900
I have a dream speech.
We have no room for enlightenment.

1827
01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:19.650
We don't have any room for you here.
You can do that in Mexico if you like.

1828
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.960
If you want to deal with the drug cartels,
you know they behead people.
Yeah,

1829
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:25.930
let's go.
Let's go down.
See that Terry Bunch.
Yeah.

1830
01:40:25.931 --> 01:40:27.130
You want to go down there and see God.

1831
01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:29.350
Mexicans had been rocking it for a long time.
Man.

1832
01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:32.230
Mexicans were rocketed and mushrooms way before we figured.

1833
01:40:32.231 --> 01:40:33.600
It's like pay Payoti you and dead.

1834
01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:37.450
Joseph Campbell wrote this book about why pay out came into existence and when

1835
01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:38.410
the native Americans,

1836
01:40:38.411 --> 01:40:42.980
the Peo to Indians were losing all their land and including even,
you know,

1837
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.960
they're animals.
They were,

1838
01:40:43.961 --> 01:40:46.720
the mythology was all wrapped up in the buffalo and the animals around them.

1839
01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.360
And when,
you know,
we went through that in the 80s,

1840
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:52.220
I mean at the 18 hundreds when they were essentially they in the railroad and

1841
01:40:52.221 --> 01:40:54.370
shooting all the buffalo lacing,
the body was strychnine,

1842
01:40:54.371 --> 01:40:58.000
all the other animals will eat it.
And you had 50 500 million animals.

1843
01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:00.790
They thought they think probably died in the space of 20 years.

1844
01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.110
Used to look like the plains of Africa.

1845
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.790
And when the PLTs realize that there are there everything that their mythology,

1846
01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:09.270
think about this all your home mythology.
Yeah.
Everything you,

1847
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:14.370
you did that you based your culture on is the animals themselves out gone

1848
01:41:14.691 --> 01:41:17.350
generation generations.
It was 20 years you,

1849
01:41:17.351 --> 01:41:19.060
and not to generalize it was two 20 years.

1850
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.760
And when that happens on such a drastic level,

1851
01:41:21.761 --> 01:41:25.870
they started taking the parody to go within their consciousness to find,
uh,

1852
01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:30.820
that nostalgia for something that should be,
so pod use only started when,
oh,

1853
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:35.650
I started in the 18 hundreds of the pod Indians.
The pit.
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

1854
01:41:35.651 --> 01:41:39.670
I did not know that.
And that's just cameras and eating.
Yeah.

1855
01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:44.730
Now indigenous people have always taken various,
I'm sure that aliens,

1856
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:49.840
he knew about the,
that particular,
maybe it was just for the Shama Mexicans were,

1857
01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.280
they had shotguns and they were big with cubensis mushrooms thousands of years

1858
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.410
ago.
They've had those for a long time.
Always.

1859
01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.610
The most fascinating thing to me about Mexico is how they're like a thousand

1860
01:42:00.611 --> 01:42:03.370
Mayan temples.
They believe that have not been discovered.

1861
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.610
Like they'll go digging up apartment buildings and shit in Mexico City.

1862
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:07.511
They're like,
you know,

1863
01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:10.300
replacing something to knock something down and then they have to stop because

1864
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:15.100
they find a Mayan temple that's like,
that's no bullshit.
No crazy.
That is,

1865
01:42:15.101 --> 01:42:16.480
they have fucking Mayan temples.

1866
01:42:16.481 --> 01:42:19.450
They find them when they're digging up like apartment buildings,

1867
01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:23.710
like one of the most complex.
And the bizarre cultures to ever exist.

1868
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:26.140
They used to play football with human heads.

1869
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:30.010
They made these incredible fucking geometric patterns for structures,

1870
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.110
yet they didn't even invent shoes.

1871
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:36.160
They had complex calendars that mapped out their solar system and predicted

1872
01:42:36.161 --> 01:42:39.730
solar and lunar eclipses.
Wow.
Fucking dude,
man.

1873
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:44.320
And then they just disappeared.
Is that there's a plague or don't know?

1874
01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.940
They don't know.
They don't know.
You know,

1875
01:42:45.941 --> 01:42:48.730
and they know that they used to have some,
a lot of shit written on paper,

1876
01:42:48.731 --> 01:42:52.240
but it's very difficult to find.
It's like the weight,
the weight,
um,

1877
01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.280
Mayan language is written to,

1878
01:42:54.281 --> 01:42:58.000
it's very difficult to decipher because like,
oh,

1879
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:02.710
like a word to them or a symbol to them actually means a sound,
you know,

1880
01:43:02.711 --> 01:43:07.450
so like,
like,
um,
Terence Mckenna described it.
He said that if you said,
like,

1881
01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.830
I saw aunt rose,
you would have to have an eyeball,
uh,

1882
01:43:11.831 --> 01:43:15.650
saw an aunt and a rose.
Oh Wow.

1883
01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:19.960
And so that's how you would say I saw aunt rose.
Wow.
So,
so it was all phonetic.

1884
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:24.370
Yeah.
So all these little,
little different dudes,
a little different characters,

1885
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:27.370
these weird fucking things that they would draw and they would put them all

1886
01:43:27.371 --> 01:43:31.750
together.
They all met different sounds.
So then you had to figure out like,
okay,

1887
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:35.130
it means a certain word and how's it?
How's it go with this though?

1888
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.730
You could almost say that's the same thing with,
with actually any language.
Yes,

1889
01:43:39.731 --> 01:43:43.390
but it's pictures they're drawing.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know,
they're,
they're weirdly,

1890
01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:44.620
there's little dots and stuff.

1891
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:46.600
There's certain things that they use to figure out dates,

1892
01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:48.780
but a lot of it is like these weird depictions,
you know,

1893
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.070
fucking moon with an eyeball and a snake,
you know,
these things all

1894
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.490
<v 2>mean different things.
This is very strange man.</v>

1895
01:43:54.690 --> 01:43:57.190
They really did this crazy complex society.

1896
01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.840
Or was that a phone call that living in the jungle,

1897
01:43:59.841 --> 01:44:03.350
this weird society that was mapping out the heavens,
you know,
I mean,

1898
01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:05.900
think about that back in the hunter side of their wonder though,
if that's,

1899
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:09.860
if that's a product of,
of not so much a culture,
but a,

1900
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:14.990
a set of circumstances.
For example,
like in,
in the why.
Why did,

1901
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:18.780
why did Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and had come out of a grease Wa,

1902
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.370
how did these become this,
this,
uh,
source of,
uh,

1903
01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:26.380
of a bulk of 'em a hub of civilization and [inaudible] stuff came from Egypt.

1904
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:27.770
No,
let's just that.
But what,

1905
01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:32.771
but the idea was that Greece was a country that because they could export

1906
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:37.400
timber,
olive oil and wine,
they can actually,

1907
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:40.220
they didn't have to live on a subsistence level.
So they had,

1908
01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.220
they had three months of the year just sit back and kind of hang out.

1909
01:44:43.221 --> 01:44:45.670
Think about that,
think about things.
So,
so,

1910
01:44:45.671 --> 01:44:50.671
so what cultures that had the luxury of being able to sell or not only their,

1911
01:44:51.001 --> 01:44:54.740
their merchandise or create a system where they could actually be well,
seamless.

1912
01:44:54.741 --> 01:44:55.490
Yeah,

1913
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:59.840
they had time to sit back and actually think about things.

1914
01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:04.160
So you probably in my end culture had a similar situation where four or five or

1915
01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:05.090
six or maybe,
you know,

1916
01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:09.980
whatever geniuses were given room to flourish.

1917
01:45:09.981 --> 01:45:11.600
I'm sure geniuses are born all the time,

1918
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:14.270
but they're just not in circumstances where they can flourish or have

1919
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:18.410
opportunity.
And this was a culture that allowed for that and they came up with,

1920
01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:22.580
you know,
it takes one great mathematician to change everybody's whole world,

1921
01:45:22.581 --> 01:45:23.240
right?
Yeah.

1922
01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:28.040
Take gene takes one genius artists come on Tesla a hundred and ventures at

1923
01:45:28.041 --> 01:45:32.390
fisheries and piggy and gives rise to all the other sciences will piggyback on

1924
01:45:32.391 --> 01:45:35.090
that.
So many people don't.
The first g wasn't for Nikola Tesla.

1925
01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:39.080
We'd probably be living back like they were in the 70s we probably be a few

1926
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.030
decades behind that.
I've heard he was the great genius.

1927
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:43.730
He's the craziest wizard ever,
man.

1928
01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:48.350
What a what an in scene inventor that guy was.
Hmm.
Yeah.

1929
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:49.640
I mean there's,
there's,

1930
01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:52.250
there's been a bunch of guys who changed cultural like that,

1931
01:45:52.251 --> 01:45:53.520
but I wonder if that's what it was were,

1932
01:45:53.521 --> 01:45:57.350
whether it was like some supergroup of mines that were like super intelligent

1933
01:45:57.590 --> 01:46:00.860
and then eventually they died off culture,
died off for the founding fathers.

1934
01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:03.170
I mean the,
the,
the idea that those guys wrote the constitution,

1935
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:05.390
a bunch of men in their thirties that's incredible.

1936
01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:08.150
It's an incredible document in the federalist papers,
the great,

1937
01:46:08.151 --> 01:46:09.440
one of the great ideas,
that philosophy,

1938
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:12.320
you're talking about men who are in their thirties who solve the political

1939
01:46:12.321 --> 01:46:12.710
problem,

1940
01:46:12.710 --> 01:46:17.120
they try to solve politics came here from another fucking country that sucked.

1941
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:20.720
I know.
Decided to start another country start over and they saw,

1942
01:46:20.850 --> 01:46:22.940
they solve the political problem.
They created the constitution,

1943
01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:24.590
they created the greatest government and then you know,

1944
01:46:24.591 --> 01:46:27.780
because we know why it was based on freedom and like you were talking about,

1945
01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:31.220
it was based on freedom for the individual and it wasn't based on government

1946
01:46:31.221 --> 01:46:35.360
bureaucracy.
Government was a a necessary evil for good.

1947
01:46:35.361 --> 01:46:38.450
It's possible to get back to that.
Is it possible?

1948
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:42.200
It's not possible if all these people are buying into Sarah Palin and Glen.
Look,

1949
01:46:42.201 --> 01:46:47.201
I think it's possible for the idea and it's very resilient and strong and

1950
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:49.440
American culture still and it's part of the American spirit.

1951
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:54.470
The concept and the idea that I as an individual have protection to speak my

1952
01:46:56.461 --> 01:46:57.060
mind,

1953
01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:02.060
to gain profit from my own ingenuity and my own risk taking to worship or say

1954
01:47:02.311 --> 01:47:07.200
what I want as long as it doesn't,
you know,
incite a riot or whatever,
et Cetera,

1955
01:47:07.201 --> 01:47:11.380
et cetera.
Those kinds of things I think are very strong and,
and,

1956
01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.670
and I think this country is always swayed from,

1957
01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.440
from one extreme to the other.
They or somewhere in the middle,
I mean they're,

1958
01:47:18.441 --> 01:47:21.330
they're always trends that pushed toward us towards the left trends that pushed

1959
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:22.164
us toward the right.

1960
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:27.120
I think the issue now is that you have so many people who for such a cheap price

1961
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:32.270
can get on TV and if they've got a good speaking voice or a sharp profile or

1962
01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:35.160
they say things that are,
are inflammatory,

1963
01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:40.110
you've got enough people where shit is changing so quickly today.
We don't,

1964
01:47:40.111 --> 01:47:43.200
a lot of people are just afraid at how fast things are changing,

1965
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.640
especially technology.

1966
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:49.410
You're going to have people who want to get back to the old way of living the

1967
01:47:49.411 --> 01:47:52.080
status quo,
God,
guts and guns,

1968
01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.630
whatever it might be to go to back to a John Wayne.
Yeah,

1969
01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:55.890
so it doesn't surprise me that when,

1970
01:47:55.891 --> 01:48:00.300
when when my boy Glenn Beck says we're bringing our country back to God,

1971
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.660
people go,
that's the nostalgia.
I remember the 50s of this of,
you know,

1972
01:48:03.661 --> 01:48:05.580
whatever it might be,
let's get back to basics.

1973
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.500
We human beings have always been that way,

1974
01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:12.580
that shit and allowed for a pause after performer.

1975
01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:17.040
He was like,
okay God,
when I said God,
that's going to get them.

1976
01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:19.200
That's going to get them.
They're going to be clapping then.
Okay,

1977
01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:24.090
so I'll take a deep breath.
Dramatic pause,
dramatic pause.
Go.

1978
01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:29.250
Exactly.
It's all the musical.
It's unfortunate that that it works,
man.

1979
01:48:29.251 --> 01:48:32.850
It's unfortunate.
We named Ed population on mushrooms.

1980
01:48:33.150 --> 01:48:36.660
We need to get this population on mushrooms,
drugs or where I draw the line.

1981
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:39.990
I draw the line with drugs as well.
I think that's the line.

1982
01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.040
I shouldn't take drugs.

1983
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.960
So it needs to fluctuate because you had examples and the kids,
man,
listen,

1984
01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:47.160
I'm not saying everybody should do drugs.

1985
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:49.770
What I'm saying to some people should do drugs.
What's your thought on this?

1986
01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.680
What's your thought on not only steroids in sports,

1987
01:48:52.681 --> 01:48:56.250
but the idea that technology is gonna allow us to start joking our genes and all

1988
01:48:56.251 --> 01:48:56.641
that stuff.

1989
01:48:56.641 --> 01:48:59.250
What do we do by Myostatin inhibitors were going to do when that happens,

1990
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:01.530
super body.
I'm going to show up.
I'm like,

1991
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:05.010
I'll tell you who's going to take him these scams like Coan ed,

1992
01:49:05.011 --> 01:49:06.120
you're going to look at that coat.
That's right.

1993
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:08.310
You're going to grow your hair long.
[inaudible] armpit.

1994
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:11.790
Hair's fucking tattooed now they're gonna be able to clone hair.

1995
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:14.900
That's what I want and I want them to genetically engineer and I want to just

1996
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:18.720
call me a whole new scalp.
This shit's useless.
Horse tail.
Get me a new one.

1997
01:49:18.721 --> 01:49:22.560
This one's a mess.
Upload your brain into somebody else's body.

1998
01:49:22.690 --> 01:49:27.050
You think that's going to be able to be possible.
Merge brains.
Maybe some luck.

1999
01:49:27.051 --> 01:49:30.070
It starts deleting files.
Crazy bitch.
You let her in your brain.
Well,
very,

2000
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.030
let your child that fuck you job had I met matters
flush,
flush.

2001
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.590
She does.
They say they're gonna be able to reverse engineer the brain.

2002
01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:42.610
The idea of learning how the brain [inaudible] to tap into somebody else's brain

2003
01:49:42.611 --> 01:49:43.141
through a net.

2004
01:49:43.141 --> 01:49:46.560
You'll have other experiences to experience what it's like to be somebody else

2005
01:49:46.561 --> 01:49:48.010
that's not as crazy as it is

2006
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.760
<v 1>to send a picture through the air to someone in Australia.
Right.
I can.</v>

2007
01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:54.670
You can do that right now.
Isn't that crazy?
It's beyond,
it's goes over the ocean.

2008
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:59.820
It takes 11 hours in a plane to go where that fucking picture goes in a couple

2009
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:01.000
of seconds.
Yeah.
That's why I cry.

2010
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.610
People who aren't scientifically minded who don't believe in the scientific

2011
01:50:03.611 --> 01:50:06.790
process and stuff always cracked me up because like you believe in the

2012
01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:08.860
scientific process about that stuff all the time.

2013
01:50:08.861 --> 01:50:11.620
Talk about somebody who think that science is arrogant because it doesn't

2014
01:50:11.621 --> 01:50:15.850
consider some things like astrology or site,
you know,

2015
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.400
psychic people with,
there's no,
there's no,

2016
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.950
there's no way to scientifically prove that astrology is the science can only do

2017
01:50:21.951 --> 01:50:24.730
something that happens over and over again and you can measure it,
you know?

2018
01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.340
I mean,
that's what it's all about you.
It doesn't grow from that.
Yeah.
So the to,

2019
01:50:29.341 --> 01:50:33.460
not that don't apply to everything,
you know,
but it's both my pee hole.

2020
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:34.590
You can go right over there,

2021
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:39.250
right in this direction and surrounded by a lot of cords around here.

2022
01:50:39.251 --> 01:50:43.090
This is very unprofessional.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize.
Brian,

2023
01:50:43.091 --> 01:50:47.020
do you have a song that can take us through this moment?
Well,
how come?
No,

2024
01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.360
we don't have to just go in there and p Bro,

2025
01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:51.810
we're going to come up with topics to talk about when you get back.

2026
01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:56.200
Just make a p p no,
no song.
We don't need any salt.
All right.
So,
uh,

2027
01:50:56.201 --> 01:50:58.840
what would you have done if that guy stopped and ran after you,

2028
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:01.220
the guy that you chased after,
when he,
you saw to,

2029
01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:02.350
for people who didn't hear earlier,

2030
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.300
Brian saw someone trying to steal someone's purse.

2031
01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.690
The Guy ran away and Brian chased after the dude.
Well,

2032
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:10.630
the problem is I wasn't fearful of him because if he was an Indian,

2033
01:51:10.631 --> 01:51:12.760
I have no idea why.
Like,
I mean,
swear to God,

2034
01:51:12.761 --> 01:51:15.560
if you would have Indian dudes all over the country,
they want to beat your ass.

2035
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.020
But Russell Peters is gonna throw a beating on you next time we see like Russell

2036
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.560
Peters mad at you.
Would you be,
I don't know,
Russell piece.
Peters.

2037
01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.260
I bet he's got a good job.
I just think,
you know,
even their movies,

2038
01:51:26.261 --> 01:51:27.280
like they're like,
they call,

2039
01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:30.970
they would movies that Indian people do that the main stars are like ridiculous.

2040
01:51:30.971 --> 01:51:34.400
Like India has a bunch of Badass wrestlers.
Yeah.

2041
01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.250
And he has a lot of Badass wrestlers.
Yeah.

2042
01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:38.980
There's a bunch of people that were working on the,
um,

2043
01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:43.250
the big giant skyscrapers in Dubai and a,

2044
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:47.060
this was another Anthony Bourdain show and while they're working,
um,

2045
01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.660
when they have days off,
they wrestle in the park.

2046
01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:54.370
They like wrestle for money and they like these bad ass wrestlers like Indian,

2047
01:51:54.371 --> 01:51:56.200
but fuck you up son.
That's what I'm trying to say.

2048
01:51:56.201 --> 01:52:00.570
It's not in their culture or something.
[inaudible] supplier.

2049
01:52:00.810 --> 01:52:03.250
There's Indian martial arts,
especially wrestling.

2050
01:52:03.251 --> 01:52:06.400
That goes back way a long time when their culture.
Yeah,
absolutely.

2051
01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:09.610
You know that video of that little Indian guide.
It's like a major yet though.

2052
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:11.200
That's pretty cool.
The superstar,

2053
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:16.850
<v 5>let me see that.
If you haven't seen that,
whose has,
that's why I'm not,</v>

2054
01:52:16.851 --> 01:52:19.630
that's one thing.
What does that have a billion hits on it?
How many hits?

2055
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:23.230
15 15 million.
15 minutes.

2056
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.570
That's just because it's only this copy of it.

2057
01:52:25.571 --> 01:52:28.060
There's a hundred or million versions of it on Youtube.

2058
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:30.370
That's why I'm not scared of Indian guys.

2059
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.260
Like all these guys that are in this video right here.

2060
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:35.050
Are you scared of any of these guys?
Well,
Indian people are pretty peaceful.

2061
01:52:35.051 --> 01:52:37.540
Consider there's a billion of them take their culture's night,

2062
01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:42.550
but they don't get along with those Pakistan.
He's very well,
hold on.

2063
01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:45.570
Did you shut off his was getting up and

2064
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:49.100
<v 1>I guess you didn't.
You've never met any seeks.
Yeah.</v>

2065
01:52:49.101 --> 01:52:53.020
He's trying to tell me that know that Indians aren't scary is a beat your ass on

2066
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:56.660
a seeks first of all artist versus video meet years.
That's why I'm not,

2067
01:52:56.661 --> 01:53:00.260
have you seen this video before?
No.
You haven't?
No,
but that's gene.
Wow.

2068
01:53:00.261 --> 01:53:04.720
I thought everybody's seen this.
Okay.
That little.
They all happy in general.

2069
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:08.750
Really?
I've never seen that guy's 30 by the way.
Yes.
Yeah.
I do this

2070
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:13.760
and they get to know the kid cigarettes too.
They give the kids cigarettes.
Yeah.

2071
01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:17.870
Awesome.
Kids smoking is a very fucking strange thing,
man.

2072
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:21.560
Especially that one kid.
Did you see that two year old?
Yeah,
so I was champion.

2073
01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:25.490
How have you never seen this video?
I know the Internet was made.

2074
01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:28.920
I'm worried about same day as this video.
Oh my God.
Genius.

2075
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:34.220
And now he works as like a choreographer in India.
Yeah,

2076
01:53:34.221 --> 01:53:35.210
I watched the show on him.

2077
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.530
He was like teaching people how to dance in this one movie or a video or

2078
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:42.530
something like that.
Let's go on this guy or something.
Yeah,
a little superstar.

2079
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:43.743
That's his name.

2080
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:47.420
He's not the same guy as the other guy that played like a detective in India.

2081
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:49.210
The little,
no,
no.
That's another dude that was,

2082
01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:52.070
I do think that dude from the Philippines.
Oh,
from Philippines.

2083
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.760
It was a crazy scene in my head.
All Indian.
So a little tiny,

2084
01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:58.790
a little little person who flies through the air and kicks dudes in the head and

2085
01:53:58.791 --> 01:54:03.070
fucked him up
the Internet,
man,
the Internet gets,

2086
01:54:03.090 --> 01:54:06.770
exposes you to some shit that you would just,
when we were kids growing up,

2087
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:09.560
kids today,
man,
you'd be a 15 year old boy today.

2088
01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:12.710
What kind of Shit are you getting into your brain?
Say I worry.

2089
01:54:12.711 --> 01:54:15.920
I think they're though they're growing up,

2090
01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:20.921
the most difficult generation to grow up ever young kids today and with some of

2091
01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:25.550
the most ridiculous influences.
Like when I was a kid,
there was no Kardashians.

2092
01:54:25.551 --> 01:54:26.540
There's no Paris Hilton.

2093
01:54:26.690 --> 01:54:30.260
There was no ridiculous people who are famous for doing nothing.
You know,
and,

2094
01:54:30.261 --> 01:54:33.530
and,
and so much attention was paid to them.
And I'm not hating,
you know,

2095
01:54:33.531 --> 01:54:35.840
if you can get it good,
good for you man.
You know,
why not?

2096
01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:37.960
You'll do a reality show about your life and drive around the belt.

2097
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:41.360
That's awesome.
For errors in May where we,
you know,

2098
01:54:41.361 --> 01:54:43.640
we talked about it maybe possibly even being therapeutic,

2099
01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:46.700
but what I'm saying is we were never exposed to anything that ridiculous as a

2100
01:54:46.701 --> 01:54:49.900
role model.
We were never exposed to anything.
You know,
that,
that,

2101
01:54:49.901 --> 01:54:52.250
that's strange where all these people are paying attention to it.

2102
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:55.070
I was listening to Nancy grace talk about Paris Hilton.

2103
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:58.160
I had to stop my car and I'm like sitting in my car,
shaking my hand.

2104
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.110
Nancy grace is a mad cause.

2105
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:04.910
Paris Hilton was pulled over with cocaine.

2106
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:10.150
She is a repeat offender and she is out on the streets.

2107
01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:14.900
Will that be happening?
If it was you [inaudible] and she's to her purse.

2108
01:55:14.901 --> 01:55:17.420
Joe,
I heard it wasn't even cocaine.
She thought it was candy,

2109
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:21.820
but she didn't even know what,
she threw it out the window by her own person.

2110
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:24.340
She has to borrow purses.
Homeboy,

2111
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:27.280
her boyfriend was blowing weed out the window like a knucklehead and a

2112
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:31.340
motorcycle cop boyfriend.
Now you are Brian.
You're going to move in and fix her.

2113
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:33.020
Show Ram.
Listen,
Paris,

2114
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:38.240
good person need to connect yourself with the right crowd for in a few years.

2115
01:55:38.241 --> 01:55:42.360
People Forget.
She's bone thin by the way.
I don't find her attractive.
Fuck her.

2116
01:55:42.361 --> 01:55:46.330
Lindsay,
a lion.
Lindsay Lohan.
Harder to heartbeats.
Garlic herbs,
a heartburn.

2117
01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:47.021
She's dirty.

2118
01:55:47.021 --> 01:55:49.390
That's my joke about Paris Hilton trying to have sex with a girl at skinny,

2119
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.120
like trying to take a nap and a wooden chair.

2120
01:55:51.150 --> 01:55:54.420
There's no girls that are built that way,
that aren't dirty girls dirty.

2121
01:55:54.810 --> 01:55:56.700
She's built the fuck.
Oh yeah.

2122
01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:58.890
I shouldn't say that because she's very young girl and she's got troubles.

2123
01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:01.950
I shouldn't ask.
She's 24 now.
She's a young girl.
She has troubles.

2124
01:56:01.951 --> 01:56:03.990
Brian growing up,
the creepy things.

2125
01:56:03.991 --> 01:56:06.900
We see the photos over when she was really young or video of her when she was

2126
01:56:06.901 --> 01:56:09.690
like a Disney kid and it's like,
wow,
this is strange.

2127
01:56:09.691 --> 01:56:13.920
Like this kid did grow up in front of the camera.
She plays a twin,

2128
01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:18.960
there's two of them to walk,
man.
Good luck.
Good luck with that.

2129
01:56:19.170 --> 01:56:23.070
That girl,
man,
that's,
that's a whole pot of problems growing up.

2130
01:56:23.070 --> 01:56:26.610
And your imagined growing up in La is this being a reality?
Like,

2131
01:56:26.611 --> 01:56:30.880
I mean she was like Ricky Schroder turned out well,
various.

2132
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:32.520
Yeah man,
he turned out awesome.

2133
01:56:32.521 --> 01:56:35.550
He's really got his shit together for a guy who grew up a child star.

2134
01:56:35.551 --> 01:56:39.000
I mean it's very impressive.
He's a really irregular dude.

2135
01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.410
He had an interesting way of putting it.

2136
01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:43.950
He said he thought that he was a regular dude because he grew up famous.

2137
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.010
He doesn't have any point of rep is not like all of a sudden they became famous

2138
01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:49.650
like wow,
I don't know how to handle this.
What it was.
Yeah.

2139
01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:51.120
It's not say by the way,

2140
01:56:51.121 --> 01:56:55.880
maybe man famous means you just get recognized a lot in airports and oh,

2141
01:56:56.150 --> 01:56:57.770
you know what I mean?
It means a lot more than that.

2142
01:56:57.771 --> 01:57:01.230
And it means people treat you different as a person communicates with you.
Yeah.

2143
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:04.370
But your,
your model of the world is going to be all fucked up.
Right.

2144
01:57:04.590 --> 01:57:07.290
Cause you're gonna start thinking that you're special.
You're like a prince.
Yeah.

2145
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.590
Yeah.
I mean how many actors have you ever met on the set?

2146
01:57:09.591 --> 01:57:10.411
And we've talked about this,

2147
01:57:10.411 --> 01:57:14.880
how God damn and furious at these idiots think that what they have to say and

2148
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:16.560
what they have to do is so important.

2149
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.560
Because the fact that there's a camera on them and because of the fact that all

2150
01:57:19.561 --> 01:57:22.440
these people are telling them how awesome they are because their job revolves

2151
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:23.333
around this person.

2152
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:26.820
So they start to believe it and then they start to act it out and then you come

2153
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:29.110
along and you have to meet this guy for the first time.
You're like,

2154
01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:30.690
oh this guy is in like the,
the,

2155
01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:35.700
the those swirling fucking death throes of a three year bizarre trip through

2156
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:39.840
ego.
And now I'm meeting him for years and he doesn't even know how crazy.

2157
01:57:39.841 --> 01:57:42.700
And he's acting like he's yelling at the fucking staff and,

2158
01:57:42.701 --> 01:57:46.860
and yelling at the director and you know,
and doing cocaine before the scene and,

2159
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:49.320
and the goes this career.
I mean come on man.

2160
01:57:49.321 --> 01:57:51.420
How many dudes have you seen like go into that death spiral?

2161
01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:54.010
<v 3>I'm married to this show with this guy who was no longer around.</v>

2162
01:57:54.011 --> 01:57:54.761
He's such a nice guy,

2163
01:57:54.761 --> 01:57:58.600
but he was so high and he was still doing so much blow and he kept calling to

2164
01:57:58.610 --> 01:58:00.990
trailer.
We were trying to suit the scene and he,

2165
01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:04.060
he was playing a copy editing and he had the guy in the chair and the guy goes,

2166
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:08.650
he ended line was what you better annunciate I can't hear you too clearly.

2167
01:58:08.651 --> 01:58:11.530
That's all he had to say.
And he was so high on coke.
He kept going.
What?

2168
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:15.790
You better now can I can't hear you.
See there's a cut.

2169
01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:21.030
It's annunciated he goes,
what's that on?
Yeah.
All right.
What you better Nancy.

2170
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:26.110
Ca.
And he did it 16 times in the head and finally like,
why don't we,
uh,

2171
01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:29.830
why don't we move on?
It's too high right now.
Oh my God.
Was it man,

2172
01:58:29.831 --> 01:58:30.910
that guy would have been something

2173
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:34.230
<v 1>nice guy.
You know,
when I met you,</v>

2174
01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:39.090
you were on mad TV and that's also when I met already.
Did you,
uh,

2175
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:42.000
did you stay in touch with him?
I do.
I haven't seen it.
I haven't talked

2176
01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.320
<v 2>already and probably,
you know,
four years now,</v>

2177
01:58:44.321 --> 01:58:47.440
but I mean I always would run into him and uh,
and he,

2178
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:49.210
in fact the other day is love seeing that guy.

2179
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:51.700
You know what he said about me on Stern,
like about a year ago,

2180
01:58:51.730 --> 01:58:55.720
my father called me up or Tuesday's the best guy I've ever seen with women.

2181
01:58:55.721 --> 01:58:58.570
I've never seen anybody better with women than Brian counts or something like

2182
01:58:58.571 --> 01:59:01.480
that.
I got,
I know I've got 50 calls.
My Dad was like,

2183
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:04.750
why is this guy saying you're a stud with women?
What is the yeah,
you know,

2184
01:59:07.410 --> 01:59:11.490
<v 1>he's a good dude,
man.
I would run into him like every couple of years somewhere.</v>

2185
01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:14.370
Like I ran into him at the Aspen Comedy Festival,
I think,

2186
01:59:14.371 --> 01:59:18.240
and I ran into him once in Vegas.
It's just running,
doing crazy.
Great.

2187
01:59:18.241 --> 01:59:22.500
Just a soap.
Such a nice human being.
He truly is a nice human being.
Yeah,

2188
01:59:22.501 --> 01:59:25.950
it's hilarious.
I just,
he's just tortured.
There's real tortured.
I mean,

2189
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.000
it felt like almost like,
you know,
exposing all that and you know,

2190
01:59:30.001 --> 01:59:33.330
and talking about it all the time,
it became worse,
you know?
Well what happened?

2191
01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:37.960
Do you know how he's doing now or,
I don't know.
I don't know anything.
Just,

2192
01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:41.850
you know,
I remember feeling really sad when I heard that,
you know,
that he would,

2193
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:44.040
that he could get to that place where we could do something.

2194
01:59:44.041 --> 01:59:47.610
I think it's always hard when when somebody suffers from that kind of that level

2195
01:59:47.611 --> 01:59:51.180
of despair and it must be really,
really hard on like,
you know,
you're,

2196
01:59:51.181 --> 01:59:51.961
you're like,

2197
01:59:51.961 --> 01:59:55.290
if you have a child is that way and you can't do anything to help them.
I met,

2198
01:59:55.291 --> 01:59:59.300
ran into a dude who was friends with rd.
I don't know if it was,

2199
01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:03.240
was the assistant at the time or someone who worked with him and this dude,

2200
02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:05.460
like I guess he lived in the same apartment building has already,

2201
02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:09.240
and he was talking to me about it to see years and years ago about how,
you know,

2202
02:00:09.250 --> 02:00:12.360
he really worried about already and you know,
he didn't know what to do.

2203
02:00:12.361 --> 02:00:14.670
And you know,
he wanted other people to talk to him and nobody,

2204
02:00:14.671 --> 02:00:19.170
but nobody knew what to say.
And it's like
terrible feeling to have a friend.

2205
02:00:19.171 --> 02:00:23.720
I've had many friends who had a serious drug problems and uh,

2206
02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:28.140
got real depressed.
My friend Johnny used to have heroin problems,

2207
02:00:28.141 --> 02:00:32.040
coke problems,
crack problems.
You'd have everything.
I friend Johnny,

2208
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:35.460
he was a great guy,
but he was a street hustler,

2209
02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:38.400
criminal fucking pool pool hustler.
Like if he,

2210
02:00:38.401 --> 02:00:39.760
if you told him that story about the,

2211
02:00:39.761 --> 02:00:43.560
the dude throwing the jacket over the person be like,
oh that's a strong move,

2212
02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.560
strong move.
Johnny was like this big fat,

2213
02:00:46.561 --> 02:00:50.130
Funny Jackie Gleason type character who was like,
you know,
how'd he die?

2214
02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:55.190
Some sort of an aneurysm.
Drug related.
Yeah.
We suspect drugs.

2215
02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.530
I mean he had like a real problem.
He had a real problem for a long time.

2216
02:00:58.531 --> 02:01:00.510
He would go one to the other and

2217
02:01:00.810 --> 02:01:04.010
<v 2>yeah,
there's some drugs like,
like math and blow.
It's like it never,</v>

2218
02:01:04.011 --> 02:01:05.250
it never like my friend was like,

2219
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:08.100
nobody's ever said that I had all these problems than I did a bunch of meth and

2220
02:01:08.101 --> 02:01:11.220
it got a lot better.
That's never a how it's working.
It's

2221
02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:15.570
<v 1>worked out.
Came out here to stay with me.
When I first got a TV show,
I was on a,</v>

2222
02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:19.740
when I was on hardball,
he came out here to stay with me to try to clean up.

2223
02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:24.210
He came out here for two weeks and for the first week who was trying to,

2224
02:01:24.211 --> 02:01:25.830
you know,
he didn't have any access to heroin.

2225
02:01:25.831 --> 02:01:27.150
I don't know if he brought any with them or not,

2226
02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:30.600
but it seemed like the first week he didn't have any access to it and he just,

2227
02:01:30.810 --> 02:01:34.110
all he would do his sleep.
He just could not get up.
I'm like,
dude,

2228
02:01:34.111 --> 02:01:36.450
he came to visit me and you're just fucking sleeping.

2229
02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:39.260
And then I sort of realize what's going on.
I'm like,
okay,

2230
02:01:39.261 --> 02:01:42.440
you're kicking some shit right now so that,
which Dylan and you know,

2231
02:01:42.441 --> 02:01:44.630
and he didn't want to talk about it.
He be like,
Yo,

2232
02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:46.430
I'm just not feeling that good.
I don't know what's up.
You know,

2233
02:01:46.431 --> 02:01:48.880
he would like lie about it,
you know,
I'd be like,
dude,
you're,

2234
02:01:48.881 --> 02:01:51.950
you're fucking like death.
Like do you need to go to a hospital?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2235
02:01:51.951 --> 02:01:53.980
I'm going to be good.
I mean,
does she eat some soup or something?

2236
02:01:53.981 --> 02:01:57.320
Maybe we got me soup and it,
we'd have a cup of soup in and go to sleep.

2237
02:01:57.321 --> 02:01:59.090
He did this for like seven,
eight,
nine days.

2238
02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.130
They stayed with me for awhile and then finally he got,
I,
I,
I flew him out here.

2239
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:07.190
Um,
because,
you know,
I want to see him.
And the plan was,
you know,

2240
02:02:07.191 --> 02:02:10.490
I had known him from back in the pool hall days and he's a really good pool

2241
02:02:10.491 --> 02:02:13.220
player and we used to go on these,
uh,

2242
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:16.760
gambling matches where I would take them to pool halls and I match them up in

2243
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:19.700
games.
There was a lot fun,
you know,
and it wasn't for a lot of money.

2244
02:02:19.701 --> 02:02:23.060
We do it for like 100 bucks or something like that,
but it was just exciting.

2245
02:02:23.061 --> 02:02:24.650
You know,
he had a chance to win a hundred bucks.

2246
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:27.980
I had a chance to watch some great pool action between two dudes were really

2247
02:02:27.981 --> 02:02:30.110
nervous trying to win money and you know,
we would set up games,

2248
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.260
sometimes we wouldn't money.
It was a lot of fun.
So the plan was,
and I'm like,

2249
02:02:33.261 --> 02:02:34.790
dude,
I've been playing out here in California.

2250
02:02:34.791 --> 02:02:37.550
There's a lot of guys who like to gamble so we could get some good games.

2251
02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:40.310
That'd be a lot of fun.
Let's do this.
And I think as long as you match up with,

2252
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:42.950
all right,
I'm on my way,
I'm on my way,
Bro.
We're gonna have a good time.

2253
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:45.200
And he got out here just the moment he landed.

2254
02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.620
He looked like a gray toilet paper roll.
I do a meth.

2255
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:50.750
I don't know what he was doing.
I think it was heroin.

2256
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:53.810
He was gray because I dated a girl,
the same thing.

2257
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:59.000
She show up in New York and she looked like gray and she'd sleep for days.

2258
02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:02.750
I know a lot of things.
Drugs though.
I didn't know that it was going on.

2259
02:03:02.751 --> 02:03:07.520
I wasn't drugged savvy.
I didn't know from so sad or iron deficiency people.

2260
02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:12.500
A lot of prejudice.
[inaudible] my friend Johnny though,
is he,
after nine days,

2261
02:03:12.501 --> 02:03:16.830
he finally came out of it like a seven eight,
nine days,
something like that.

2262
02:03:16.831 --> 02:03:19.790
It's slowly started coming out of it and I started taking them around and we had

2263
02:03:19.791 --> 02:03:22.280
a good time.
It was like one of the last few times before he died.

2264
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:24.440
We took him into it.
There was a place called players,

2265
02:03:24.441 --> 02:03:27.800
billiards in the valley and you going to say 24 hour place.

2266
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.200
We were out there Campbell until like four o'clock in the morning.

2267
02:03:30.710 --> 02:03:35.330
We're eating at Chaya when the day you found out he died.
Yeah,

2268
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:39.350
it was sad.
You know,
he was a fascinating human being.
Man.

2269
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:42.470
I've met a lot of fascinating human beings,
but you know,

2270
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.170
every now and then there's a dude who's in the wrong place,
you know,
like,

2271
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:47.840
what are you doing here?
What's,
what's going on here?
What the fuck?

2272
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:51.440
Like this super,
super smart dude,
like really smart.

2273
02:03:51.441 --> 02:03:56.300
Like you could throw numbers at them like 396 minus seven divided by four to 60

2274
02:03:56.301 --> 02:03:57.880
tools.
She would just bang it out like wow.

2275
02:03:57.950 --> 02:04:01.370
Literally that fast and mathematical genius could play chess in his head.

2276
02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:04.760
You could talk to him and he could play chess like they do in prison night took

2277
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:07.910
five,
you know,
he could be,
he could do that.
And he barely played chess.

2278
02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:10.940
He was just like a mathematical genius.
The reason why I'm so good at pool,

2279
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:14.090
he was like mathematical geometry and shit to him,

2280
02:04:14.091 --> 02:04:16.010
just like would like play itself out in his mind.

2281
02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:18.530
He would look at a pool table and he could like see the geometry,

2282
02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:21.550
could see all the angles.
You didn't have to break it down one to another.

2283
02:04:21.551 --> 02:04:24.710
It's like,
Oh yeah,
I'm out.
I'm out.
I'll go ahead,
I'll do that.
Blah blah blah,

2284
02:04:24.711 --> 02:04:27.640
blah,
blah,
blah about it.
We just see it,
you know?
But the point is,

2285
02:04:27.690 --> 02:04:31.130
the only problem was the drugs.
And his problem was,
he was kind of crazy,

2286
02:04:31.131 --> 02:04:34.210
which is why he was so mathematically look connected to fast and why.

2287
02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:36.220
And he played good music too.
He could play piano,

2288
02:04:36.221 --> 02:04:39.840
could play a bunch of different instruments.
I was like,
he's got genius.
Genius.

2289
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:43.920
No,
but a regular social guy.
Fun To hang out with.
Told jokes,
crack jokes.

2290
02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:47.520
Wasn't like he had autism or anything.
He was too low.
Very sociable at that.

2291
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.930
I'll take a colorful character like that with that kind of flavor over it.

2292
02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:54.090
Are you kidding me man?
Like my friend Joey,
your life,
they make your,

2293
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.460
he's the best.
He's the best.
Joey,
what a character.
I never,
I,

2294
02:04:58.461 --> 02:05:02.250
every time I run into that guy,
whether it's an audition or an club,
it,
I'm never,

2295
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:06.290
I'm never disappointed.
He's always inspiring.
He's inspiring.

2296
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:09.720
He's funny.
His stories,
the way he walked,
the way he talks,

2297
02:05:09.721 --> 02:05:11.550
you just can't take your eyes off.
He's a monster.

2298
02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.620
He's one of the funniest human beings I've ever met in my life.

2299
02:05:13.621 --> 02:05:16.920
He just makes me feel like there's a party going on.
You know when Joey said,

2300
02:05:16.921 --> 02:05:18.330
what's up cock suckers,
what are we doing?

2301
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:22.080
Let's get this party started and you're like,
Yup,
the party just of started.

2302
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.820
The party gets started.
Joey's here.
Great.

2303
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:28.410
It really feels like something's going on now,
girl.
What's that?
Yeah,

2304
02:05:28.411 --> 02:05:30.720
he's married man.
Yeah,
it's wife's Terry's awesome.

2305
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:34.320
She was a waitress at the comedy store.
And how's he doing?
Is He,

2306
02:05:34.330 --> 02:05:36.120
is he doing the road?
But no,
I'm sorry.
She wasn't a waitress.

2307
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:39.510
She was an accountant because he a drawn out on the road or he does well if he

2308
02:05:39.511 --> 02:05:41.400
wants to,
if he wants to go on the road,
people want to see him.

2309
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.070
I'm trying to get them to do that.
But you know,
Joey wants to get an acting gig.

2310
02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:48.180
He's working real hard at,
uh,
you know,
nailed it means a fucking hilarious actor,

2311
02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:50.640
you know,
so,
you know,
he was in the longest yard and stuff like that.

2312
02:05:50.641 --> 02:05:53.670
He wants to get more,
you know,
what do I think you would like a good TV show.

2313
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:56.880
He'd be fucking incredible on Voice of a cartoon would be amazing.

2314
02:05:56.910 --> 02:06:01.320
That'd be good too.
But he would be incredible on a sitcom.
Joey could crush us.

2315
02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:05.130
Hit it.
Kidding that character or a drama even,
you know,

2316
02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:10.470
as a funny guy on like a fucking,
like a,
you know,
like an informant,

2317
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:14.970
like the shield,
like one of those kind of shows.
He could be genius on that.
Yeah.

2318
02:06:14.971 --> 02:06:17.400
You know,
there's a lot of characters like that that you run into in life.

2319
02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:21.450
You know,
Joey has his shit together a million times more than Johnny did.
I mean,

2320
02:06:21.451 --> 02:06:23.760
Johnny was homeless most of the time.
I knew him and you know,

2321
02:06:23.761 --> 02:06:27.660
sleeping in pool rooms and you know,
and just gambling and you know,

2322
02:06:27.661 --> 02:06:31.100
and trying to try to win money,
right.
You may see people like that,
you know,

2323
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:33.770
you go,
that's it.
It's not going to be a happy ending.
You always kind of know,

2324
02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.480
well,
you know,
he just,
he,
you know,
he had an imbalance.

2325
02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:39.360
There were some imbalance and he self medicated,
you know,
but,

2326
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:42.930
but I got to see like genius because of all his crazy flaws.

2327
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:45.270
It's like we were talking about that robbery Howard guy,

2328
02:06:45.450 --> 02:06:49.050
that robbery Howard guy was so fucked up that he had to kill himself when he was

2329
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:51.810
like 30 something years old.
But yet he was so brilliant.

2330
02:06:51.811 --> 02:06:54.910
And so he had so much creativity,
wrote all this really fascinating shit.

2331
02:06:54.911 --> 02:06:58.240
And like in the 1950s.
Right.
You know,
there's people like that.
Right.

2332
02:06:58.241 --> 02:07:02.760
And Kim was talking about how,
um,
he doesn't remember writing Cujo.

2333
02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:07.320
He doesn't remember writing the book because he was so drunk and fucked up.

2334
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:09.960
And he said,
you know,
um,

2335
02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:15.420
his wife came in and she started putting all these beer cans in a bag and he

2336
02:07:15.421 --> 02:07:19.230
looked around and he goes,
um,
Jeez man,
I drank a lot of beer over the,

2337
02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:23.100
over the past month.
She goes,
that was yesterday,
dude,

2338
02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:27.600
you been drinking in the past two days or whatever it was.

2339
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:31.650
He would just black go fuck out.
He just keep drinking.
And she goes,

2340
02:07:31.651 --> 02:07:36.280
you drank this in two days and it was a month's worth of,
you know,
beer.
Literally

2341
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:41.200
<v 2>she was going fill in garbage bags full of beer cans.
Whoa.
And he said,</v>

2342
02:07:41.201 --> 02:07:43.060
you know,
I happen to have been a really,

2343
02:07:43.061 --> 02:07:47.530
really imaginative writer who had a substance abuse problem.

2344
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:51.730
So do you think that his like dealing with his substance abuse problem and then

2345
02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:55.540
all the,
the torture in,
you know,
of,
of being an alcoholic and doing cold calls,

2346
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:58.290
all this turmoil in his head created all that hard.

2347
02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.110
He would say no battles in his book on writing said No.
Right.

2348
02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:06.760
But what he said was that in fact,
regardless if he had been sober,

2349
02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:11.890
he would had the same Maginot of mind.
I believe that is not true.

2350
02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:16.660
This is why I believe that's not true.
I think I've learned a lot about writing,

2351
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:21.600
um,
over the past few years of trying to write comedy and you know,

2352
02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:24.850
20,
whatever,
20 plus years of writing and doing comedy.

2353
02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:28.720
And one of the things that I give credit to substances,

2354
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:33.610
I think substances have a dramatic effect on your creativity.
Yeah.
You can't say,

2355
02:08:33.611 --> 02:08:36.070
you can't say that.
You would have come up with that on your own.
Well,

2356
02:08:36.071 --> 02:08:41.020
caffeine for sure for me has a good effect.
But stimulant effect.

2357
02:08:41.021 --> 02:08:42.550
You know,
Nick Ken,
who is a rock journalist,

2358
02:08:42.551 --> 02:08:46.600
wrote a book called the dark stuff about that I read a while ago about rock and

2359
02:08:46.601 --> 02:08:47.570
rollers.
And he was,

2360
02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:51.550
he followed the Pogues and Lou Reed and the stones and Zeppelin,
everybody.

2361
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:56.020
And he wrote a book which actually said that most of those guys,

2362
02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:00.490
and there's been a lot of like there's some strong evidence to suggest that some

2363
02:09:00.491 --> 02:09:04.600
drugs,
yes,
other drugs w and hair.
Okay.
But this is,
this was my point,

2364
02:09:05.230 --> 02:09:07.000
my point why you can't say that first of all,

2365
02:09:07.001 --> 02:09:08.920
because he wrote all that stuff when he was fucked up.

2366
02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.260
That's why you can't say that he would have written it any way.

2367
02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:12.190
You cannot say that.

2368
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.740
You cannot say when you wrote something and you were fucked up,

2369
02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:17.500
you cannot say you would have written it any way.
That doesn't make any sense.

2370
02:09:17.501 --> 02:09:20.980
I wonder if they got there the way you think the alcohol changes,

2371
02:09:20.981 --> 02:09:22.600
the way you think caffeine changed the way you think.

2372
02:09:22.601 --> 02:09:25.540
Cocaine for short changes the way you think it's gonna increase paranoia.

2373
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:26.291
It's going to make you,

2374
02:09:26.291 --> 02:09:30.850
I mean you think about his most thrilling Harfield psychotic shit was off from

2375
02:09:30.851 --> 02:09:33.290
the time he was using.
Well,
yeah,
but,

2376
02:09:33.291 --> 02:09:36.490
but I mean it was right and they can say that are a lot of these guys got into

2377
02:09:36.491 --> 02:09:39.450
drugs cause a lot of their heroes work,
you know,
drug addicts like wait,

2378
02:09:39.630 --> 02:09:41.630
the blues are the guys in the,
in the shorts.

2379
02:09:41.850 --> 02:09:44.740
And he said in a lot of those guys ended up subset and Stanley crouch said the

2380
02:09:44.741 --> 02:09:45.410
same thing.
He goes,

2381
02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:49.720
the of these guys were subscribing to their heroes lifestyles and you can

2382
02:09:49.721 --> 02:09:53.650
actually see a fairly precipitous drop off on their prenup productivity,

2383
02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.820
not when it came to weed.
Right.
But when,

2384
02:09:57.130 --> 02:10:00.460
when heroin and cocaine I absolutely,

2385
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:04.600
however they become so all consuming that you end up doing that and not your

2386
02:10:04.601 --> 02:10:08.260
work.
Yes,
I absolutely agree that there is a detrimental effect,

2387
02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:11.560
especially with the ones like opiates and stuff that crushes your body very,

2388
02:10:11.561 --> 02:10:14.410
very fast.
You're getting into that more than you get into anything else.

2389
02:10:14.411 --> 02:10:15.340
I can definitely agree,

2390
02:10:15.490 --> 02:10:18.460
but I also think that we have to acknowledge that they're changing the way

2391
02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:22.000
people think.
The paths that you take and your creativity that they changed the,

2392
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:24.790
they changed the direction,
they changed the enthusiasm behind things,

2393
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:28.480
they changed the aggression behind things and those change that changed the
road.

2394
02:10:28.481 --> 02:10:30.820
You go down when you're creating things.
And not only that,
you know,

2395
02:10:30.821 --> 02:10:34.250
as we learn more about our genomes and how different we are,
genetically drugs

2396
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:38.620
<v 1>have a very,
a vastly different effect on one person versus two.
Yeah,</v>

2397
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.700
that's very important because I've talked to people about pot,

2398
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:43.790
even the kind of pot that I smoked.
I like though the figure out the universe,

2399
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:46.500
you know,
watch documentaries pot that,
that,
you know,

2400
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.770
sativas over the Indian indicas rather.

2401
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:52.820
Some people will smoke a sativa and they were describing a completely different

2402
02:10:52.821 --> 02:10:56.500
thing and they have a completely different effect on you.

2403
02:10:56.501 --> 02:11:00.050
The tech affects your mind more than yes,
yes.
Well it affects your body too.

2404
02:11:00.110 --> 02:11:03.220
You know,
it's still all of them make sex,
feel better,
baths,
feel better,

2405
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:05.750
showers feel better.
All of them do that and it makes you more sensitive.

2406
02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:07.790
The rewards for massages and stuff.

2407
02:11:07.791 --> 02:11:10.940
Like I never get a massage unless I get high first.

2408
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:13.480
Except today because I knew it was going to be a dude,
Robert.
Man.

2409
02:11:13.570 --> 02:11:14.960
I was just going to say,
yeah,
what if it was like,

2410
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:16.380
<v 3>guys,
we're going to be stowed within,</v>

2411
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:19.410
you don't want to be phoning how to go from stoning when a dude is,

2412
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:21.010
I hurt my back last week.

2413
02:11:21.070 --> 02:11:22.660
<v 1>Can Jujitsu and like a retard.</v>

2414
02:11:22.661 --> 02:11:26.260
Yesterday I got adjusted and then I tried to roll last night and like halfway

2415
02:11:26.261 --> 02:11:26.981
into the class,

2416
02:11:26.981 --> 02:11:31.000
my back just fucking completely gave out where I couldn't stop anybody from

2417
02:11:31.001 --> 02:11:33.100
passing my guard.
I couldn't explain it.
I couldn't move.

2418
02:11:33.101 --> 02:11:35.770
It was like just constant pain and I was like,
okay,
I'm hurting myself here.

2419
02:11:35.771 --> 02:11:36.604
I've got to stop.
Yeah,

2420
02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:39.370
so I knew that I had to go and get some deep tissue with the break up the scar

2421
02:11:39.371 --> 02:11:40.150
tissue and shit.

2422
02:11:40.150 --> 02:11:44.290
It's painful as fighting of a guy though because you have to get a duty to do
it.

2423
02:11:44.291 --> 02:11:47.110
First of all,
their sports dudes.
This isn't like you're going to go to a spa.

2424
02:11:47.111 --> 02:11:51.310
I go to a sports medicine center and they hurt you,
bro.
It's fucking hurts.

2425
02:11:51.490 --> 02:11:55.300
It's like there's this guy today was not as bad as the last guy went to the last

2426
02:11:55.301 --> 02:11:58.630
guy I went to.
I literally almost tapped out the doctor doctor's bag,

2427
02:11:58.631 --> 02:12:01.420
who's the main chiropractor there?
He told me he,
he actually fainted.

2428
02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:04.720
I just got hurt him so bad that he fainted because this mother is just awesome.

2429
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:08.110
He's just breaking down your world with his elbow.
He just,

2430
02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.770
all your injuries and it's breaking up the scar tissue,

2431
02:12:11.771 --> 02:12:16.060
literally tearing it open so that it can like breathe and get PR circulation in

2432
02:12:16.061 --> 02:12:18.850
their lasers for that.
I ever say they don't though.
They don't.
You just do.

2433
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:21.930
You have to take the pain.
I went to Brooks massage and I,
I,
it's,

2434
02:12:21.931 --> 02:12:25.990
I'm Beverly and I go in there and this Russian dude's then as I please,

2435
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:28.420
please you come here.
And I'm like,
oh good.

2436
02:12:28.690 --> 02:12:33.520
And I get on the slab and I come out a new woman,
right?
Because he's hitting me.

2437
02:12:33.521 --> 02:12:35.350
Literally I was,
ah,
and he was just

2438
02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:39.970
<v 2>bear of a man got,
and I was like,
Huh.
And I felt like such a girl,</v>

2439
02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:43.480
such a girl.
I literally grew bitch tits.
I had asked her to write into my body.

2440
02:12:43.481 --> 02:12:47.260
I was like this guy anyway,
so I,
it was great.
So I go,
um,
I looked at him,

2441
02:12:47.261 --> 02:12:49.450
I'm looking at him,
I look at his body.
I go,
did you,
where were you?

2442
02:12:49.451 --> 02:12:54.070
A sports guy goes,
yes,
I go,
were you uh,

2443
02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:58.450
did you do any kind of fighting?
Yes,
I was judo.

2444
02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:04.120
Judo.
I go,
did you compete it?
He goes,
yes.
Everywhere.

2445
02:13:04.540 --> 02:13:08.890
I have won the gold metal from a Sydney.
I go,

2446
02:13:08.891 --> 02:13:13.540
you are a gold medal.
Olympic gold medal.
Judo.
Judo Guy in Sydney.

2447
02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:18.610
Yes.
I go,
that must have been a lot.
This guy massage me for 65 bucks.

2448
02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:23.740
I got that must have been a lot of training and stuff.
Yes.
Did you lift a lot?
No,

2449
02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:26.410
just jeweled though.

2450
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:32.030
<v 3>He wouldn't give me anything.
I was like,
but dude,
you're gold medals and judo.</v>

2451
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.910
<v 1>It's incredible.
I know.
I'm a grapple.
I though grappling mouth than me.</v>

2452
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.480
He was like,
yeah,
I got this.

2453
02:13:36.481 --> 02:13:41.280
A deep tissue massage from this guy who was an expert in sports-related therapy

2454
02:13:41.281 --> 02:13:43.170
for like muscle injuries and stuff like that.

2455
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:46.830
So he does a lot of range of motion things and a lot of resistance things.
Yeah.

2456
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:48.510
Okay.
So we had gone through this whole,

2457
02:13:48.511 --> 02:13:51.750
it's like a half an hour massage of death,
right?
So we've gotten to the end,

2458
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:54.780
and this is what he asked me in the end,
he says,
I want you to get on your,

2459
02:13:54.810 --> 02:13:59.640
get on your knees.
Okay.
Getting like a cat position right here with your,

2460
02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.530
um,
with your forearms.

2461
02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:06.330
Like this puts some fascinated in Harris this position and just hold,

2462
02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.750
hold yourself in that position and I'm going to work your back and this is what

2463
02:14:09.751 --> 02:14:13.170
I want you to do.
I want you to go down.
Okay.
And then as you're resisting,

2464
02:14:13.171 --> 02:14:15.930
you know,
go up.
Okay.
So he says this right,

2465
02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.400
and he's going to do this with his elbow.

2466
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:20.280
This is where he's really going to Jack me.
So as he's got me in this position,

2467
02:14:20.281 --> 02:14:24.780
he goes really into that MMA,
you know,
it feels like around maybe 35 years ago,

2468
02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:28.960
it probably got into it myself,
probably even competed and he's got me,

2469
02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.050
he's got me on my hands to,

2470
02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:34.560
he's here and he's telling me that he does and he's bigger than me.

2471
02:14:34.561 --> 02:14:37.470
He's a big old dude.
He's a big old bear on the rest of my cock.

2472
02:14:37.471 --> 02:14:41.100
Between an easy fucking feel here and it hurts like a motherfucker and he's

2473
02:14:41.101 --> 02:14:42.120
getting me with his elbow.

2474
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:46.770
Maybe I would have competed and he hates you.
He heavy.

2475
02:14:46.771 --> 02:14:48.270
I take your back right now.

2476
02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:51.750
I have to fucking massage you punk and I'm younger than you or I'm older than

2477
02:14:51.751 --> 02:14:56.630
you on your are only for massages.
There was an implicit,
no,

2478
02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.320
no,
no,
no.
I'm,
I'm not making light of it.

2479
02:14:58.321 --> 02:15:01.800
But he's with a very important guy to know.
If you have muscle injuries,

2480
02:15:01.801 --> 02:15:04.080
those guys,
they'll fix you up,
man.
Yeah,

2481
02:15:04.081 --> 02:15:07.820
because you get a knot when you get an injury and you're going to hair,

2482
02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:11.130
you get inflammation,
you get tears and those tears not you up.

2483
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:14.790
And if you get an injury and you don't have it broken down and busted open like

2484
02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:17.640
that,
it's not going to heal.
Right.
You're going to lose range of motion.

2485
02:15:17.641 --> 02:15:22.110
You're gonna [inaudible] the actual,
you know,

2486
02:15:22.111 --> 02:15:25.590
nothing works like this.
You have to get in there physically.
You have to feel it.

2487
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.530
You have to know where it is and you have to break that shit actually get on the

2488
02:15:28.531 --> 02:15:33.510
actual,
yeah,
they hurt you son.
They hurt you.
They dig in.

2489
02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:36.390
There's a guy I went to before this guy was not as painful as the last guy I

2490
02:15:36.391 --> 02:15:40.680
went to with Alaska.
I went to fucking would get on to him was a strong yoga guy.

2491
02:15:40.681 --> 02:15:42.600
Like this guy does like power yoga and shit.

2492
02:15:42.630 --> 02:15:46.170
He's strong as fuck and he would get on top of you with your elbow,

2493
02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:49.980
with his elbow rather and just drive it into your spine like right where that

2494
02:15:49.981 --> 02:15:53.730
injury is because I've got this knot of scar tissue right next to my spine and

2495
02:15:53.731 --> 02:15:57.240
he's breaking.
I can fear like fucking tearing.
I'm like,

2496
02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.070
it's so,
it's so necessary but so hard to take.

2497
02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:06.360
You just want to run out of the room screaming.
You want to feel better.
Oh yeah.

2498
02:16:06.810 --> 02:16:09.390
Right after Toby.
Like thank you.
I did prolotherapy on my neck.

2499
02:16:09.391 --> 02:16:10.920
You ever done that?
Yeah,
I've done that on my rest.

2500
02:16:10.921 --> 02:16:14.490
I've done it on my book and I did in my neck and I worked,
but I've been doing,

2501
02:16:14.491 --> 02:16:16.770
this guy has me to tell people what that is,

2502
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:20.190
but prolotherapy is where they take dextrose and I shoot it in your muscle.

2503
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:22.620
And the reason they shoot dextrose with light it came,

2504
02:16:22.621 --> 02:16:26.550
but they'll shoot dextrose in and it's a dextrose is basically a sugar water.

2505
02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.100
But when it,
when it,
when it coats the muscle,

2506
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:34.420
the body rushes healing agents to it because it,
it views it as a foreign agent.

2507
02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:38.830
So what we'll do is we'll actually inflame the area and,
and uh,

2508
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.890
and create,
um,
and rush healing agents too.

2509
02:16:41.891 --> 02:16:45.520
And it makes actually mentally 40% makes it strong and make sure ligament

2510
02:16:45.521 --> 02:16:49.730
stronger.
Yeah.
And muscles up to 40% of deals.

2511
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:53.560
I had it done.
I've had problems.
I broke my wrist a long time ago,

2512
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:57.850
kickboxing and like 1989 I never did anything about it.
I just dealt with it.

2513
02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:00.430
And every now and then from Jujitsu,
a little start really hurting.

2514
02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.840
It used to hurt when I played quake.

2515
02:17:01.841 --> 02:17:04.250
When I'd move it around too much with a mouse,
I'd get like this painting,

2516
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:06.980
I tore a ligament in there or something.
There's something wrong.

2517
02:17:06.981 --> 02:17:09.190
I clicks a lot and shit,
there's something really wrong with it.

2518
02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:12.040
But I had them do that in there and then I had them do it in my name.

2519
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:13.450
It makes it,
makes my lower back,

2520
02:17:13.451 --> 02:17:15.580
has always been and always tightens up no matter what.

2521
02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:18.040
What are you going to work on your flexibility son?
Yeah.

2522
02:17:18.041 --> 02:17:21.400
I think that's one of the most important things,
man.
Working on your flexibility.

2523
02:17:21.401 --> 02:17:24.070
So important.
I do every day actually.
It's really important.

2524
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:26.050
You got to see my garage,
man.
You haven't seen my garage.

2525
02:17:26.090 --> 02:17:29.320
Oh you don't even know son.
All right,
let's,
let's uh,

2526
02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:32.380
wrap this show up cause we've been doing this for like six hours now,
right?

2527
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:36.110
Yeah man.
Brian,
how long have you done this?
Two hours and 20 minutes.
Um,

2528
02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.470
I wish we'd end on a bang.
Bang,
I've got a good story.
Wish I could sing.

2529
02:17:41.730 --> 02:17:42.790
I'll have one next week.

2530
02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:46.310
I tell you my story that I tell her when I was on a date up in this area where

2531
02:17:46.311 --> 02:17:51.311
you want a date with a Brazilian Jujitsu and so at the Poo pooed now who right

2532
02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:53.470

2534
02:17:56.741 --> 02:18:00.400

And now,
oh my God.

2535
02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:03.760
And you know what I did?
I'm talking to her and I go,

2536
02:18:03.970 --> 02:18:05.760
<v 3>I'm shitting now.
I ran away,</v>

2537
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:10.860
I ran away from her up the trail and I fucking head.
And I was like,

2538
02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.180
I literally ran.
And I was like,

2539
02:18:12.930 --> 02:18:17.490
and I got to run it by [inaudible] and are shooting.
And I'm like,
and I'm like,

2540
02:18:17.491 --> 02:18:20.190
how the fuck she is coming?
She goes,
so she goes,
what are you doing?

2541
02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.270
You trying to scare me?
And I go and I go,
yeah,
I yanked my shoulder.

2542
02:18:24.271 --> 02:18:27.870
I started kicking it and I go,
here.
I go,
but then I don't want her to look down.

2543
02:18:27.871 --> 02:18:32.670
So I go
and she goes,
why are you doing?
I'm like,

2544
02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:37.440
Yay.
Like that.
Meanwhile,
we're walking.
I go,
Holy Shit.

2545
02:18:37.441 --> 02:18:41.460
Thank God I was.
That was the worst thing.
I can't believe that your ass at all.

2546
02:18:41.490 --> 02:18:44.400
I got a parasite.
Am I?
Why am I ass?
I didn't have time to do anything.

2547
02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:48.420
I look around and go,
Oh God,
guess what?
I'm I have to shit.
Now again,

2548
02:18:48.630 --> 02:18:52.230

2549
02:18:52.231 --> 02:18:54.570
he just pulled your pants up.
This happened three t three times.

2550
02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:59.940

I'm shitting again.

2553
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:09.870
The third time I don't get all the way around

2554
02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:16.560
and I go,
and you here

2555
02:19:16.561 --> 02:19:18.090
My my,

2556
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:23.150
I go take dirt in the bag and I wipe it on my ass because I've heard that they

2557
02:19:23.361 --> 02:19:27.770
did in the desert.
So I'll try to go.
She stops and she goes,

2558
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.030

I smell like shit.

2561
02:19:36.450 --> 02:19:39.850
We have to go back down the trail and we have to go through the minefield.

2562
02:19:42.690 --> 02:19:45.490
I'm like,
Hey,
look up here.
Is that a kitten?

2563
02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:51.900
Ego.
I'm fucking see him.
Ryan,
about birds in the air and I fucking had to.

2564
02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.420
How bad did you smell?

2565
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:59.470
How bad fucking I had to take up a sync shit says shower fucking bathroom down.

2566
02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:03.960
I'm trying to get my ass.
He ever tried to get your ass in a stake?

2567
02:20:03.961 --> 02:20:07.170
One of the things you can't do it like bathroom.

2568
02:20:07.290 --> 02:20:12.210
Of course it was can get in there paying Topanga Canyon,
their individual ones.

2569
02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:15.770
I wouldn't have cared.
I would've got,
that shit was coming off my ass.

2570
02:20:16.930 --> 02:20:21.480
I don't care.
So now I sink clean,
I sink,
cleaned my crack,

2571
02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:25.890
we're sitting in the car and I have to drive her from Topanga Canyon all the way

2572
02:20:25.891 --> 02:20:29.570
up to Gower in,
in Los Filez.
I'm like,
anyway,
that was fun.
Uh,

2573
02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:34.050
just call me the poo guy.
No laughter.
Never talked to her again.
Saw her in,

2574
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:38.490
she saw me in a coffee shop a year later and ran the fuck.

2575
02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.950
She never returned my phone call.
I called her twice.
She was like,

2576
02:20:43.951 --> 02:20:46.260
fuck that shit disgusting.

2577
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:51.480
Have explosive diarrhea and get laid.
Just write that one off.

2578
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:56.610
That ain't going to happen.
Here's the reality.
If it was her,

2579
02:20:56.611 --> 02:20:58.290
you would still fucker.
Oh,
of course I would

2580
02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:02.390
