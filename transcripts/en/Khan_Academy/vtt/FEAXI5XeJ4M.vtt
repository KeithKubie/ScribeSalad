00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.450
- [Voiceover] In the previous video, we talked about

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.990
the importance of glucose as a simple sugar.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.950
We talked about its molecular structure.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.890
What I wanna do in this video is study how glucose

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.930
can be, how we can use it as a building block

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.420
for more complex sugars and more complex carbohydrates.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.330
So this right over here, I've copy and pasted

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.090
two glucose molecules, we can number their carbons.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.700
This is one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.020
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.710
We have them in their cyclic form.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.390
And what we're going to do is explore

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.120
what would happen if this oxygen right over here,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.250
I'll highlight it in this magenta color,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.650
were to use one of its lone pairs,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.020
one of its lone pairs, to do,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.200
what's in organic chemistry, referred to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
as a nucleophilic attack on the number one carbon

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.120
on the left-hand glucose molecule.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.050
And the reason why that could happen

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.090
is this number one carbon right over here,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.120
it's attached to two oxygens.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.490
Oxygens are very electronegative, they like to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.220
hog electrons when they're in a covalent bond.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.620
So that's gonna give this carbon

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.450
a partially positive charge.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.450
And this oxygen is very electronegative.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.520
It's gonna hog the electrons from this hydrogen

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.290
and the number four carbon

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.890
on the right-hand glucose molecule,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.850
so it's gonna have a partially negative charge.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.920
And so it is going to be nucleophilic.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.420
It's going to be attracted to, I guess you could say,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.590
the carbon nucleus, to the partially positive charge

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.990
right over here, and so as it does,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.920
it's gonna use a lone pair to form a bond.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.550
It's gonna share it with the carbon,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.190
and then the carbon can let go of another bond.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.290
So it could let go of, it could let go of

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.990
both of these electrons in that bond.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.720
Now you could say maybe that just goes

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.150
back to the oxygen and it forms a hydroxide anion.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.650
Or we could imagine, well, maybe it'll be used,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.990
maybe it forms a hydroxide anion first,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.620
or maybe that bond immediately goes

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.220
and picks up a hydrogen ion out of the solution

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.890
from another, from a hydronium ion sitting someplace.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.690
So this could be used to form

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.520
a bond with this hydrogen ion, which is really,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.950
this is just a proton here.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.420
You take an electron away from hydrogen,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.790
it's just going to be a proton.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.250
Well, what's that going to do?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.250
Well, that's going to link these two glucose molecules.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.720
And it's gonna link it just like this,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
and it's important to keep track of our molecules here.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.820
So this oxygen is now going to be this oxygen.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.920
It's now going to be that oxygen.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.220
This bond between the number four carbon

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920
on the right-hand side of that oxygen

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820
is this bond right over here.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.650
This, where we took this electron pair

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.320
to form this bond with the number one carbon,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.790
that is, let me do it in that magenta color.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.620
That is this bond, this bond right over here.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.820
The oxygen, this oxygen, is now this oxygen right over here.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.750
And this electron pair is now formed a bond

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.350
with this hydrogen, so we could say,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.020
oh, that could be, let me do that blue,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.890
that could be, that could be this bond right over here.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.990
Now the one difference is, based on how I've drawn it,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.120
this oxygen, or sorry, this oxygen, the way I've drawn it,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.230
it's attached to the number one carbon here,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.480
the number four carbon here.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.490
We have that over, we've already done that over here.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.990
Number one carbon on the left molecule,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.050
number four carbon on the right molecule.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.890
But we also have it bonded,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.690
we also have it bonded to a hydrogen.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.520
So just the way I've done it right now,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.690
it's still bonded to a hydrogen.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.430
It's going to have a net positive charge.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.153
Over here, it was neutral.

00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:53.520
It was neutral right over here, but then

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.490
it's now sharing its electrons.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.120
It's now sharing both of those electrons

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.850
in a covalent bond, and so you can think of it as

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.090
it's giving away an electron to this carbon,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.350
so it's going to have a net positive charge.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.620
But then to get back to neutral, you could imagine,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.250
well, maybe some type of a water molecule

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.720
could grab that ion, so maybe this one right over here.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.750
This one right over here could grab that hydrogen,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.720
and then these electrons, both of them,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.450
and it would just grab the hydrogen nucleus of the proton,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.320
and so these two electrons could go back

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.520
to this oxygen and then this oxygen would become neutral.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.350
And so what we would be left with,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.690
actually, let me just erase this,

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.810
is that this hydrogen would now be attached

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.290
to this oxygen, and we would have a hydronium ion.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.320
And this is reasonable.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320
We essentially had some hydronium.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.127
We had a hydrogen proton out here before and we still do.

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:03.720
Now it's attached to a water,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.620
so we've take a proton and we've given back a proton,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.990
so we have a net-net kind of added charge

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.890
or taken charge away from the system.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.590
But the important thing that we just saw is

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.890
as these two things essentially attached,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.690
we lost a water molecule, or I guess net-net,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.820
this system lost a water molecule.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.990
It took up a charge to do it, to build that water molecule,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.190
but the thing that really kind of escaped

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.590
from both of these two molecules is this,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.720
is this right over here.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.990
This H is this H, this oxygen is this oxygen.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.920
And this hydrogen is this hydrogen right over here.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.190
And so this type of a reaction in which

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.250
we're synthesizing a more complex molecule,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.190
a longer chain of glucose molecules,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.130
this is called a dehydration synthesis.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.550
So what we just did, this right over here

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.360
is called a dehydration synthesis.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.320
Why are we calling it a dehydration synthesis?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.890
Well, we've just taken a water out.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.460
If you imagine losing water, we talk about

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.790
you're getting dehydrated.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.220
And why synthesis?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.720
Well, we put two things together.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.050
We synthesized a larger molecule.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.120
Sometimes this would be called a condensation reaction.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.590
Condensation reaction.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.350
And by doing this, these two glucose molecules

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.950
are able to form a disaccharide now.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.720
So each individually, they were monosaccharides,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.150
so this one on the right, that's a monosaccharide.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.920
What does monosaccharide mean?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.750
Well, it means, mono means single or one

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.050
and saccharide comes from the Greek word for sugar.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.650
The Greek word for sugar is,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.420
I'm gonna mispronounce it, is sakcharon.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.950
When people talk about something being saccharine,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.788
they're saying something is very, very sweet.

00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:19.250
The Greek word for sugar is sakcharon.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.690
So saccharide means it's a sugar, it's a single sugar.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.150
So that meaning there, sugar.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.120
And the general term saccharide refers to

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.150
not just the simple sugars, monosaccharides,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.960
but it could mean two of these things put together.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.920
And there's other simple sugars, fructose and others.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.710
Or it could mean a huge number of these put together.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.190
You could have polysaccharides.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.550
And that whole class, saccharides,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.720
we also associate with carbohydrates.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.720
Now we went from two monosaccharides to right over here.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.620
This is a disaccharide.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.220
This is a disaccharide, we have two.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.390
Two monosaccharides were involved.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.990
This is a disaccharide, and this particular disaccharide

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.070
is maltose, or malt sugar. Maltose.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.750
So the whole point of this video is to see

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.720
how you can start with these simple sugars,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.690
these monosaccharides, and form disaccharides.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.110
In fact, you could keep going.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.590
You could keep having dehydration synthesis,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.850
condensation reactions to keep adding

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.690
more and more monosaccharides to build

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.720
longer and longer chains.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.050
So if you were to keep doing that,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.790
it you were to keep building chains of these things,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.550
now you're getting into the world of polysaccharides.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.450
Polysaccharides, or many simple sugars,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.853
many monosaccharides, many monosaccharides put together.

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:46.020
And this is the case for sugar, but this is something

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.150
that you'll see often in chemistry,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.450
where you have a single unit, here's a single sugar,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.220
but if we talk in more general terms,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.320
we would call it a monomer.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.020
And then if we have a bunch of these monomers put together,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.020
we would call it a polymer.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.520
Now polysaccharides are super important,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.790
and you have probably eaten some polysaccharides today,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.490
and you probably have some, in fact,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.150
I'm sure you have some polysaccharides

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.850
stored in your cells right now.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.990
If you put a bunch of glucose molecules,

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.890
if we were to keep this process going

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.730
and we were to have a bunch of glucose molecules together,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.786
when you find it in plants, it'll often be

00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:30.020
in the form of a starch.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.350
So a polysaccharide that you'll find in a plant

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.630
is a starch, a bunch of glucoses put together

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.790
in your own cells to have a immediate energy store,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.720
a bunch of glucoses put together is glycogen.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.810
So these macromolecules, these polysaccharides

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.560
that are made up of a bunch of simple sugars,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.250
a bunch of monosaccharides put together,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.260
these are very common in biology.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.050
You have eaten them and you are storing them

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.720
in your body right now.
