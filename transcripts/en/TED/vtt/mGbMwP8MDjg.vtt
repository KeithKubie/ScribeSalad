00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.936
"Judge, I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you something.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.696
I been watching you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.616
and you're not two-faced.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000
You treat everybody the same."

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.096
That was said to me
by a transgender prostitute

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.376
who before I had gotten on the bench

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.936
had fired her public defender,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.936
insulted the court officer

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.096
and yelled at the person
sitting next to her,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.856
"I don't know what you're looking at.
I look better than the girl you're with."

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.576
(Laughter)

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.496
She said this to me

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.056
after I said her male name low enough

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.016
so that it could
be picked up by the record,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.096
but I said her female name loud enough

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.760
so that she could walk down the aisle
towards counselor's table with dignity.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.976
This is procedural justice,
also known as procedural fairness,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.576
at its best.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.296
You see, I am the daughter
of an African-American garbageman

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.576
who was born in Harlem

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.616
and spent his summers
in the segregated South.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.416
Soy la hija de una peluquera dominicana.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.936
I do that to make sure
you're still paying attention.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.296
(Laughter)

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.576
I'm the daughter of a Dominican beautician

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.416
who came to this country
for a better life for her unborn children.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.456
My parents taught me, you treat everyone
you meet with dignity and respect,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.896
no matter how they look,
no matter how they dress,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.176
no matter how they spoke.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.816
You see, the principles of fairness

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.576
were taught to me at an early age,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.536
and unbeknownst to me,
it would be the most important lesson

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.376
that I carried with me
to the Newark Municipal Court bench.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.216
And because I was dragged
off the playground

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.976
at the early age of 10
to translate for family members

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.376
as they began to migrate
to the United States,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.536
I understand how daunting it can be
for a person, a novice,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.040
to navigate any government system.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.816
Every day across America
and around the globe,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.976
people encounter our courts,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.856
and it is a place
that is foreign, intimidating

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120
and often hostile towards them.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.136
They are confused
about the nature of their charges,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.376
annoyed about their encounters
with the police

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.336
and facing consequences that might impact
their relationships, their finances

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.336
and even their liberty.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.816
Let me paint a picture for you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.400
of what it's like for the average person
who encounters our courts.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.376
First, they're annoyed as they're probed
going through court security.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.776
They finally get through court security,
they walk around the building,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.816
they ask different people
the same question

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.320
and get different answers.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.776
When they finally get
to where they're supposed to be,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.400
it gets really bad
when they encounter the courts.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.936
What would you think if I told you

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.096
that you could improve
people's court experience,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.400
increase their compliance with the law

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.136
and court orders,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.976
all the while increasing
the public's trust

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.256
in the justice system

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.840
with a simple idea?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.640
Well, that simple idea
is procedural justice

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.456
and it's a concept that says

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.976
that if people perceive
they are treated fairly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.176
and with dignity and respect,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.640
they'll obey the law.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.976
Well, that's what
Yale professor Tom Tyler found

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.376
when he began to study
as far back in the '70s

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.320
why people obey the law.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.936
He found that if people
see the justice system

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.976
as a legitimate authority
to impose rules and regulations,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.896
they would follow them.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.816
His research concluded

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.336
that people would be satisfied

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.296
with the judge's rulings,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.336
even when the judge ruled against them,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.936
if they perceived
that they were treated fairly

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.840
and with dignity and respect.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.456
And that perception of fairness
begins with what?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.680
Begins with how judges speak
to court participants.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.336
Now, being a judge

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.336
is sometimes like having
a reserve seat to a tragic reality show

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.496
that has no commercial interruptions

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.080
and no season finale.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.896
It's true.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.576
People come before me handcuffed,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.616
drug-sick, depressed, hungry

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.680
and mentally ill.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.216
When I saw that their need for help

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.976
was greater than my fear
of appearing vulnerable on the bench,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.056
I realized that not only
did I need to do something,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.280
but that in fact I could do something.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.096
The good news is is that the principles
of procedural justice are easy

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.176
and can be implemented
as quickly as tomorrow.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.616
The even better news,
that it can be done for free.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.656
(Laughter)

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.656
The first principle is voice.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.856
Give people an opportunity to speak,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.016
even when you're
not going to let them speak.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.296
Explain it.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.896
"Sir, I'm not letting you speak right now.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.256
You don't have an attorney.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.336
I don't want you to say anything
that's going to hurt your case."

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.216
For me, assigning essays to defendants

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.120
has been a tremendous way
of giving them voice.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.296
I recently gave an 18-year-old
college student an essay.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.480
He lamented his underage drinking charge.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.176
As he stood before me reading his essay,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.696
his voice cracking
and his hands trembling,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.856
he said that he worried that he
had become an alcoholic like his mom,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.800
who had died a couple of months prior
due to alcohol-related liver disease.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.336
You see, assigning a letter
to my father, a letter to my son,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.656
"If I knew then what I know now ..."

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.296
"If I believed one
positive thing about myself,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.136
how would my life be different?"

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.856
gives the person an opportunity
to be introspective,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.176
go on the inside,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.576
which is where all the answers are anyway.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.416
But it also gives them an opportunity

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.416
to share something with the court
that goes beyond their criminal record

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.680
and their charges.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.776
The next principle is neutrality.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.096
When increasing public trust
in the justice system,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.896
neutrality is paramount.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.816
The judge cannot be perceived
to be favoring one side over the other.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.816
The judge has to make a conscious decision
not to say things like,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.696
"my officer," "my prosecutor,"
"my defense attorney."

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.496
And this is challenging
when we work in environments

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.056
where you have people
assigned to your courts,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.360
the same people coming
in and out of your courts as well.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.576
When I think of neutrality,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.696
I'm reminded of when I was
a new Rutgers Law grad

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.776
and freshly minted attorney,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.296
and I entered an arbitration
and I was greeted by two grey-haired men

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.136
who were joking about
the last game of golf they played together

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.456
and planning future social outings.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.000
I knew my client couldn't get
a fair shot in that forum.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.416
The next principle is understand.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.696
It is critical that court participants
understand the process,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.096
the consequences of the process

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.176
and what's expected of them.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.496
I like to say that legalese
is the language we use to confuse.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.576
(Laughter)

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.336
I am keenly aware that the people
who appear before me,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.936
many of them have very little education

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.496
and English is often
their second language.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.976
So I speak plain English in court.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.616
A great example of this
was when I was a young judge --

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.536
oh no, I mean younger judge.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.576
(Laughter)

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.216
When I was a younger judge,
a senior judge comes to me,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.576
gives me a script and says,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.856
"If you think somebody
has mental health issues,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.616
ask them these questions
and you can get your evaluation."

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.176
So the first time I saw someone

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.536
who had what I thought
was a mental health issue,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.016
I went for my script
and I started to ask questions.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.136
"Um, sir, do you take psycho --
um, psychotrop --

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.800
psychotropic medication?"

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.680
"Nope."

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.680
"Uh, sir, have you treated
with a psychiatrist before?"

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.776
"Nope."

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.816
But it was obvious that the person
was suffering from mental illness.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.576
One day, in my frustration, I decided
to scrap the script and ask one question.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.016
"Ma'am, do you take medication
to clear your mind?"

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.656
"Yeah, judge, I take Haldol
for my schizophrenia,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.640
Xanax for my anxiety."

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.896
The question works even when it doesn't.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.656
"Mr. L, do you take medication
to clear your mind?"

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.336
"No, judge, I don't take
no medication to clear my mind.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.776
I take medication
to stop the voices in my head,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.056
but my mind is fine."

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.656
(Laughter)

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.736
You see, once people
understand the question,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.616
they can give you valuable information

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.016
that allows the court
to make meaningful decisions

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.000
about the cases that are before them.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.536
The last principle is respect,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.416
that without it none
of the other principles can work.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.176
Now, respect can be as simple as,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.480
"Good afternoon, sir."
"Good morning, ma'am."

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.376
It's looking the person in the eye
who is standing before you,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.280
especially when you're sentencing them.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:57.336
It's when I say,
"Um, how are you doing today?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.816
And what's going on with you?"

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.096
And not as a greeting,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.840
but as someone who is
actually interested in the response.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.736
Respect is the difference between saying,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.376
"Ma'am, are you having difficulty

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.776
understanding the information
in the paperwork?"

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.256
versus, "You can
read and write, can't you?"

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.496
when you've realized
there's a literacy issue.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.216
And the good thing about respect
is that it's contagious.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.536
People see you being
respectful to other folks

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.936
and they impute
that respect to themselves.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.656
You see, that's what
the transgender prostitute was telling me.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.840
I'm judging you just as much
as you think you may be judging me.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.896
Now, I am not telling you what I think,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.976
I am telling you what I have lived,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.536
using procedural justice
to change the culture at my courthouse

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.080
and in the courtroom.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.696
After sitting comfortably for seven months

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.656
as a traffic court judge,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.816
I was advised that I was being moved
to the criminal court,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.016
Part Two, criminal courtroom.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.656
Now, I need you to understand,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.896
this was not good news.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.936
(Laughter)

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.216
It was not.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.616
Part Two was known
as the worst courtroom in the city,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.176
some folks would even say in the state.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.856
It was your typical urban courtroom
with revolving door justice,

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.496
you know, your regular lineup
of low-level offenders --

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.736
you know, the low-hanging fruit,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.176
the drug-addicted prostitute,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.336
the mentally ill homeless person
with quality-of-life tickets,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.616
the high school dropout petty drug dealer
and the misguided young people --

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.096
you know, those folks
doing a life sentence

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.560
30 days at a time.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.896
Fortunately, the City of Newark
decided that Newarkers deserved better,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.656
and they partnered
with the Center for Court Innovation

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.096
and the New Jersey Judiciary

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.696
to create Newark Community Solutions,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.816
a community court program

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.856
that provided alternative sanctions.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.336
This means now a judge

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.176
can sentence a defendant
to punishment with assistance.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.776
So a defendant who would
otherwise get a jail sentence

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.456
would now be able to get
individual counseling sessions,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.176
group counseling sessions
as well as community giveback,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.120
which is what we call community service.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.536
The only problem is
that this wonderful program

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.496
was now coming to Newark
and was going to be housed where?

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.976
Part Two criminal courtroom.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.776
And the attitudes there were terrible.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.296
And the reason that
the attitudes were terrible there

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.216
was because everyone who was sent there

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.696
understood they were
being sent there as punishment.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.336
The officers who were facing
disciplinary actions at times,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.816
the public defender and prosecutor

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.016
felt like they were doing
a 30-day jail sentence on their rotation,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.936
the judges understood
they were being hazed

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.800
just like a college
sorority or fraternity.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.496
I was once told that
an attorney who worked there

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.936
referred to the defendants
as "the scum of the earth"

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.216
and then had to represent them.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.976
I would hear things from folks like,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.856
"Oh, how could you work
with those people? They're so nasty.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.176
You're a judge, not a social worker."

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.656
But the reality is that as a society,
we criminalize social ills,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.280
then sent people to a judge
and say, "Do something."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.816
I decided that I was going
to lead by example.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.856
So my first foray into the approach
came when a 60-something-year-old man

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.936
appeared before me handcuffed.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.736
His head was lowered and his body
was showing the signs of drug withdrawal.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.576
I asked him how long he had been addicted,
and he said, "30 years."

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.960
And I asked him, "Do you have any kids?"

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.096
And he said, "Yeah,
I have a 32-year-old son."

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.216
And I said, "Oh, so you've never
had the opportunity

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.400
to be a father to your son
because of your addiction."

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.920
He began to cry.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.296
I said, "You know what,
I'm going to let you go home,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.976
and you'll come back in two weeks,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.536
and when you come back, we'll give you
some assistance for your addiction."

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.800
Surprisingly, two weeks passed
and he was sitting the courtroom.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.056
When he came up, he said,
"Judge, I came back to court

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.536
because you showed me more love
than I had for myself."

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.216
And I thought, my God,
he heard love from the bench?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.656
I could do this all day.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.696
(Laughter)

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.856
Because the reality is that
when the court behaves differently,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.576
then naturally people respond differently.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.656
The court becomes a place
you can go to for assistance,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.416
like the 60-something-year-old
schizophrenic homeless woman

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.856
who was in distress

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.856
and fighting with the voices in her head,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.256
and barges into court,
and screams, "Judge!

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.256
I just came by to see how you were doing."

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.976
I had been monitoring her case
for a couple of months,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.016
her compliance with her medication,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.016
and had just closed out her case
a couple of weeks ago.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.656
On this day she needed help,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.936
and she came to court.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.376
And after four hours
of coaxing by the judge,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.696
the police officers and the staff,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.536
she is convinced to get into the ambulance

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.656
that will take her to crisis unit

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.520
so that she can get her medication.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.016
People become connected to their community

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.176
when the court changes,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.616
like the 50-something-year-old man

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.136
who told me, "Community service
was terrible, Judge.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.336
I had to clean the park,
and it was full of empty heroin envelopes,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.576
and the kids had to play there."

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.696
As he wrung his hands, he confessed,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.136
"Judge, I realized that it was my fault,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.296
because I used that same park to get high,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.816
and before you sent me there
to do community service,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.216
I had never gone to the park
when I wasn't high,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.640
so I never noticed
the children playing there."

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.096
Every addict in the courtroom
lowered their head.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.960
Who better to teach that lesson?

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.816
It helps the court reset
its relationship with the community,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.096
like with the 20-something-year-old guy

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.776
who gets a job interview
through the court program.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.376
He gets a job interview
at an office cleaning company,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.616
and he comes back to court to proudly say,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.336
"Judge, I even worked in my suit
after the interview,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.760
because I wanted the guy to see
how bad I wanted the job."

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.056
It's what happens
when a person in authority

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.456
treats you with dignity and respect,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.776
like the 40-something-year-old guy
who struts down the aisle

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.576
and says, "Judge,
do you notice anything different?"

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.936
And when I look up,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.376
he's pointing at his new teeth

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.736
that he was able to get after getting
a referral from the program,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.136
but he was able to get them
to replace the old teeth

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.976
that he lost as a result
of years of heroin addiction.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.576
When he looks in the mirror,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.656
now he sees somebody who is worth saving.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.656
You see, I have a dream

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.776
and that dream is
that judges will use these tools

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.016
to revolutionize
the communities that they serve.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.776
Now, these tools
are not miracle cure-alls,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.096
but they get us light-years closer
to where we want to be,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.536
and where we want to be is a place
that people enter our halls of justice

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.376
and believe they will be treated
with dignity and respect

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.480
and know that justice
will be served there.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.176
Imagine that, a simple idea.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.416
Thank you.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.760
(Applause)
