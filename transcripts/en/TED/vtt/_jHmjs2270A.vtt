00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.279
Take a look at this work of art.

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:17.697
What is it that you see?

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:22.715
At first glance, it looks
to be a grandfather clock

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.482
with a sheet thrown over it

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:26.402
and a rope tied around the center.

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:30.705
But a first look always warrants a second.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:32.741
Look again.

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:34.901
What do you see now?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.743
If you look more closely,

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:41.917
you'll realize
that this entire work of art

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.469
is made from one piece of sculpture.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.438
There is no clock,

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:48.002
there is no rope,

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:49.456
and there is no sheet.

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:53.805
It is one piece of bleached
Honduras mahogany.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.659
Now let me be clear:

00:00:56.683 --> 00:01:01.201
this exercise was not
about looking at sculpture.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:03.659
It's about looking

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.215
and understanding
that looking closely can save a life,

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.709
change your company

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.996
and even help you understand
why your children behave the way they do.

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:18.408
It's a skill that I call
visual intelligence,

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.011
and I use works of art to teach everybody,

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.724
from everyday people
to those for whom looking is the job,

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:30.513
like Navy SEALs and homicide
detectives and trauma nurses.

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:35.270
The fact is that no matter how skilled
you might be at looking,

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.608
you still have so much
to learn about seeing.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:43.061
Because we all think we get it
in a first glance and a sudden flash,

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:47.576
but the real skill is in understanding
how to look slowly

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.475
and how to look more carefully.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.871
The talent is in remembering --

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:55.948
in the crush of the daily urgencies
that demand our attention --

00:01:55.972 --> 00:02:00.025
to step back and look through
those lenses to help us see

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.802
what we've been missing all along.

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:06.238
So how can looking at painting
and sculpture help?

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.883
Because art is a powerful tool.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:14.771
It's a powerful tool
that engages both sight and insight

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:19.278
and reframes our understanding
of where we are and what we see.

00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:23.576
Here's an example of a work of art

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.529
that reminded me
that visual intelligence --

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:28.503
it's an ongoing learning process

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:30.579
and one that really is never mastered.

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:34.911
I came across this quiet,
seemingly abstract painting,

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:37.238
and I had to step up to it twice,

00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:38.478
even three times,

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:41.564
to understand why it resonated so deeply.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:46.456
Now, I've seen the Washington Monument
in person thousands of times,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.454
well aware of the change in the color
of marble a third of the way up,

00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:53.678
but I had never really looked
at it out of context

00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:55.635
or truly as a work of art.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.534
And here, Georgia O'Keeffe's painting
of this architectural icon made me realize

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:04.748
that if we put our mind to it,

00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:07.934
it's possible to see everyday things

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.901
in a wholly new
and eye-opening perspective.

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:15.951
Now, there are some skeptics that believe
that art just belongs in an art museum.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.615
They believe that it has no practical
use beyond its aesthetic value.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.180
I know who they are
in every audience I teach.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.949
Their arms are crossed,
their legs are crossed,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.625
their body language is saying,

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.222
"What am I going to learn
from this lady who talks fast

00:03:31.246 --> 00:03:33.187
about painting and sculpture?"

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.341
So how do I make it relevant for them?

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:41.309
I ask them to look at this work of art,

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.594
like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.

00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:46.406
And I ask them to step in close,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.651
and even closer still,

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:50.912
and while they're looking
at the work of art,

00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:53.636
they need to be asking questions
about what they see.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.083
And if they ask the right questions,

00:03:56.107 --> 00:03:57.725
like, "What is this work of art?

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.524
Is it a painting? Is it a sculpture?

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:00.698
What is it made of?" ...

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:03.951
they will find out
that this entire work of art

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:05.719
is made of a wooden board,

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.372
10,000 nails

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:10.002
and one unbroken piece of sewing thread.

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:12.841
Now that might be
interesting to some of you,

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:15.886
but what does it have to do
with the work that these people do?

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.753
And the answer is everything.

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:22.061
Because we all interact with people
multiple times on a daily basis,

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.491
and we need to get better
at asking questions

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:26.327
about what it is that we see.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.981
Learning to frame
the question in such a way

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.056
as to elicit the information
that we need to do our jobs,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.855
is a critical life skill.

00:04:35.664 --> 00:04:37.950
Like the radiologist who told me

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:40.474
that looking at the negative
spaces in a painting

00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:44.524
helped her discern
more discreet abnormalities in an MRI.

00:04:45.072 --> 00:04:50.237
Or the police officer who said
that understanding the emotional dynamic

00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:51.819
between people in a painting

00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:56.132
helped him to read body language
at a domestic violence crime scene,

00:04:56.156 --> 00:05:01.555
and it enabled him to think twice
before drawing and firing his weapon.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:06.585
And even parents can look to see
absences of color in paintings

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:10.127
to understand that
what their children say to them

00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.451
is as important as what they don't say.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.480
So how do I --

00:05:16.472 --> 00:05:19.560
how do I train to be
more visually intelligent?

00:05:20.384 --> 00:05:22.661
It comes down to four As.

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:25.167
Every new situation, every new problem --

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.725
we practice four As.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.238
First, we assess our situation.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.497
We ask, "What do we have in front of us?"

00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:32.059
Then, we analyze it.

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:33.408
We say, "What's important?

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.164
What do I need? What don't I need?"

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:38.954
Then, we articulate it in a conversation,
in a memo, in a text, in an email.

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:41.577
And then, we act: we make a decision.

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:44.819
We all do this multiple times a day,

00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:48.487
but we don't realize what a role
seeing and looking plays

00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.090
in all of those actions,

00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:53.778
and how visual intelligence
can really improve everything.

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.291
So recently, I had a group
of counterterrorism officials

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.274
at a museum in front of this painting.

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:02.728
El Greco's painting,
"The Purification of the Temple,"

00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:06.839
in which Christ, in the center,
in a sweeping and violent gesture,

00:06:06.863 --> 00:06:09.770
is expelling the sinners
from the temple of prayer.

00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:13.932
The group of counterterrorism officials
had five minutes with that painting,

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.868
and in that short amount of time,
they had to assess the situation,

00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:19.582
analyze the details,

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:21.298
articulate what, if anything,

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.845
they would do if they were
in that painting.

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:28.729
As you can imagine,
observations and insights differed.

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:29.904
Who would they talk to?

00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:31.434
Who would be the best witness?

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.044
Who was a good potential witness?

00:06:33.068 --> 00:06:34.219
Who was lurking?

00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:35.643
Who had the most information?

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:39.603
But my favorite comment
came from a seasoned cop

00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:41.742
who looked at the central figure and said,

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.401
"You see that guy in the pink?" --

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:44.655
referring to Christ --

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.321
he said, "I'd collar him,
he's causing all the trouble."

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:50.473
(Laughter)

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:55.894
So looking at art gives us a perfect
vehicle to rethink how we solve problems

00:06:55.918 --> 00:06:57.560
without the aid of technology.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.267
Looking at the work
of Felix Gonzalez-Torres,

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.378
you see two clocks
in perfect synchronicity.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.966
The hour, minute and
second hand perfectly aligned.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.292
They are installed side by side
and they're touching,

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:14.394
and they are entitled
"'Untitled' (Perfect Lovers)."

00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:17.543
But closer analysis makes you realize

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:20.716
that these are two
battery-operated clocks,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.575
which in turn makes you understand --

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:23.841
"Hey, wait a minute ...

00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:26.568
One of those batteries
is going to stop before the other.

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:29.748
One of those clocks is going
to slow down and die before the other

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:32.255
and it's going to alter
the symmetry of the artwork."

00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:36.181
Just articulating that thought process

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:39.497
includes the necessity
of a contingency plan.

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:43.367
You need to have contingencies
for the unforeseen,

00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:45.867
the unexpected and the unknown,

00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:48.544
whenever and however they may happen.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.747
Now, using art to increase
our visual intelligence

00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:55.832
involves planning for contingencies,

00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:58.254
understanding the big picture
and the small details

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.913
and noticing what's not there.

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.853
So in this painting by Magritte,

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:06.027
noticing that there are no tracks
under the train,

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:08.215
there is no fire in the fireplace

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:10.417
and there are no candles
in the candlesticks

00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:13.258
actually more accurately
describes the painting

00:08:13.282 --> 00:08:16.797
than if you were to say, "Well,
there's a train coming out of a fireplace,

00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.907
and there are candlesticks on the mantle."

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.594
It may sound counterintuitive
to say what isn't there,

00:08:21.618 --> 00:08:23.655
but it's really a very valuable tool.

00:08:24.398 --> 00:08:27.158
When a detective who had learned
about visual intelligence

00:08:27.182 --> 00:08:28.333
in North Carolina

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:29.833
was called to the crime scene,

00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:31.297
it was a boating fatality,

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:34.881
and the eyewitness told this detective
that the boat had flipped over

00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.616
and the occupant had drowned underneath.

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:41.705
Now, instinctively, crime scene
investigators look for what is apparent,

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.929
but this detective
did something different.

00:08:43.953 --> 00:08:46.540
He looked for what wasn't there,
which is harder to do.

00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:48.360
And he raised the question:

00:08:48.384 --> 00:08:51.296
if the boat had really
tipped flipped over --

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.538
as the eyewitness said that it did --

00:08:53.562 --> 00:08:56.317
how come the papers that were kept
at one end of the boat

00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:57.942
were completely dry?

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.288
Based on that one small
but critical observation,

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:06.273
the investigation shifted
from accidental death to homicide.

00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:10.897
Now, equally important
to saying what isn't there

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.540
is the ability to find visual connections
where they may not be apparent.

00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:19.494
Like Marie Watt's totem pole of blankets.

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:23.602
It illustrates that finding hidden
connections in everyday objects

00:09:23.626 --> 00:09:25.357
can resonate so deeply.

00:09:25.796 --> 00:09:28.477
The artist collected blankets
from all different people

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.969
in her community,

00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:33.247
and she had the owners
of the blankets write, on a tag,

00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.815
the significance of
the blanket to the family.

00:09:36.448 --> 00:09:39.113
Some of the blankets
had been used for baby blankets,

00:09:39.137 --> 00:09:41.337
some of them had been used
as picnic blankets,

00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:43.773
some of them had been used for the dog.

00:09:44.386 --> 00:09:47.192
We all have blankets in our homes

00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.767
and understand the significance
that they play.

00:09:50.704 --> 00:09:53.045
But similarly, I instruct new doctors:

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:54.965
when they walk into a patient's room,

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:58.181
before they pick up that medical chart,

00:09:58.205 --> 00:10:00.007
just look around the room.

00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.326
Are there balloons or cards,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.562
or that special blanket on the bed?

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:09.171
That tells the doctor there's a connection
to the outside world.

00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:12.892
If that patient has someone
in the outside world

00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.829
to assist them and help them,

00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:19.217
the doctor can implement the best care
with that connection in mind.

00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:23.261
In medicine, people
are connected as humans

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:26.517
before they're identified
as doctor and patient.

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:30.254
But this method of enhancing perception --

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:31.756
it need not be disruptive,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.580
and it doesn't necessitate
an overhaul in looking.

00:10:35.173 --> 00:10:39.142
Like Jorge Méndez Blake's sculpture
of building a brick wall

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:42.000
above Kafka's book "El Castillo"

00:10:42.024 --> 00:10:46.859
shows that more astute observation
can be subtle and yet invaluable.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:49.613
You can discern the book,

00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:51.963
and you can see
how it disrupted the symmetry

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:54.338
of the bricks directly above it,

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.838
but by the time you get
to the end of the sculpture,

00:10:56.862 --> 00:10:58.670
you can no longer see the book.

00:10:59.108 --> 00:11:02.228
But looking at the work of art
in its entirety,

00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:06.532
you see that the impact
of the work's disruption on the bricks

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:08.864
is nuanced and unmistakable.

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:10.926
One thought,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.612
one idea,

00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:16.298
one innovation can alter an approach,

00:11:16.322 --> 00:11:17.852
change a process

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:19.770
and even save lives.

00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:24.352
I've been teaching visual intelligence
for over 15 years,

00:11:24.376 --> 00:11:27.592
and to my great amazement
and astonishment --

00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:30.392
to my never-ending astonishment
and amazement,

00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:33.944
I have seen that looking at art
with a critical eye

00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:37.380
can help to anchor us in our world
of uncharted waters,

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:39.643
whether you are a paramilitary trooper,

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:42.616
a caregiver, a doctor or a mother.

00:11:43.156 --> 00:11:45.730
Because let's face it, things go wrong.

00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:47.679
(Laughter)

00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:48.913
Things go wrong.

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:50.284
And don't misunderstand me,

00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:51.955
I'd eat that doughnut in a minute.

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:53.037
(Laughter)

00:11:53.061 --> 00:11:57.706
But we need to understand the consequences
of what it is that we observe,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.101
and we need to convert observable details
into actionable knowledge.

00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:06.913
Like Jennifer Odem's sculpture
of tables standing sentinel

00:12:06.937 --> 00:12:08.989
on the banks of the Mississippi River

00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:10.431
in New Orleans,

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:13.670
guarding against the threat
of post-Katrina floodwaters

00:12:13.694 --> 00:12:16.479
and rising up against adversity,

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.352
we too have the ability
to act affirmatively

00:12:19.376 --> 00:12:21.163
and affect positive change.

00:12:21.923 --> 00:12:24.221
I have been mining the world of art

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:27.298
to help people across
the professional spectrum

00:12:27.322 --> 00:12:30.006
to see the extraordinary in the everyday,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.441
to articulate what is absent

00:12:33.727 --> 00:12:37.120
and to be able to inspire
creativity and innovation,

00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:38.605
no matter how small.

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:40.188
And most importantly,

00:12:40.212 --> 00:12:44.012
to forge human connections
where they may not be apparent,

00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:48.909
empowering us all to see our work
and the world writ large

00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:50.421
with a new set of eyes.

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.030
Thank you.

00:12:52.054 --> 00:12:58.277
(Applause)
