ALAN SEALES: To perform a
few songs for us now, please

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.516
welcome the cast of
"Spring Awakening."

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:08.418
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:27.266
[MUSIC - "MAMA WHO BORE ME"]

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:32.640
[MUSIC - "DON'T DO SADNESS"]

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:23.875
[MUSIC - "THE SONG OF PURPLE
 SUMMER"]

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:12.175
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:13.300
ALAN SEALES: Keep it going.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.883
One more time.

00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:17.940
Cool.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.140
So please go down the line
and introduce yourselves.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.020
And talk about what
you do in the show

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.010
and how you got involved.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.026
ALI STROKER: Hi.

00:09:25.026 --> 00:09:26.150
ALAN SEALES: Redundant mic?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.500
We need it?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.390
ALI STROKER: Hi, my
name is Allie Stroker

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.590
and I play the role
of Anna in the revival

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.050
of "Spring Awakening."

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.330
And I became involved in
production a year and a half

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.340
ago when I auditioned in
California, in Los Angeles.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.200
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: My
name is Austin McKenzie

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.690
and I play the role
of Melchior Gabor.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.890
I, too, joined a year ago, when
we did the show in Skid Row,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.230
in Los Angeles.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.690
And I sent in an audition
tape from Chicago

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.342
and got cast from there.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.700
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:13.310
Hi, my name is Sandra Mae
Frank and I'm from Kentucky.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:19.540
I play the role of Wendla.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.090
And so I also sent in a
tape from Washington DC,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.450
where I was at the time.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.730
And I didn't hear anything
for about a month.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.850
And the next thing I knew,
I was out in California

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.272
with a whole varied
cast, with a whole bunch

00:10:32.272 --> 00:10:33.480
of people that came together.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.280
That was about a year
ago, and here we are now.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.760
Yay.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.260
KATIE BOECK: My
name is Katie Boeck,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.530
and I am the voice of Wendla.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.010
So the show kind of
functions in this cool way,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.160
where the deaf actors
have voicing counterparts,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.620
some of which are
also in the band.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.160
So I play guitar and
kind of shadow her

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.948
and follow her
around as her voice.

00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.390
ALEX BONIELLO:
I'm Alex Boniello.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.900
I am the voice of Moritz,
which is played by Daniel.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.294
And I do basically
the exact same thing

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:05.210
as what she just said.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.160
I play guitar in the
band, shadow him about,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.084
voice for him.

00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:11.000
Whenever he's signing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.458
I'll be speaking
for the most part.

00:11:16.692 --> 00:11:18.108
DANIEL DURANT
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:11:18.108 --> 00:11:23.080
Hi, my name is Daniel, and I
play the character of Moritz.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.772
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:11:25.772 --> 00:11:28.136
I mean, I myself
am from Minnesota.

00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:30.510
I've been involved in the
theater, was out in California,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.750
and now I'm happy to be here.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.220
ROBERT ARIZA: Hi,
I'm Robert Ariza.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.245
I'm one of the swings for
the production of "Spring

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:36.830
Awakening."

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.192
And I joined here in
New York, actually.

00:11:39.192 --> 00:11:39.900
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.520
So this was put on, or, I
guess the revival came on,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.870
through Deaf West.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.420
So where did the idea come from?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.250
Are any of you privy to how
the idea even came about?

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.840
KATIE BOECK: Well, Michael
Arden is our director,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.040
and I'm pretty sure
that he and Andy, who

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.840
is Hanschen in our cast,
had this brilliant idea

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.830
to do a production of
this show, which centers

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.792
on the themes of basically
the breakdown in communication

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:16.000
between parents and children.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.380
And how, especially when it
comes to sex and, you know,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.730
educating children about that
phase of life of adolescence,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.260
how-- at least in this time
in the show, and even still

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.310
today-- how difficult it can be.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.070
Because it's uncomfortable,
it's awkward,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.111
parents don't know how to
talk to their children.

00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:38.290
So they had this amazing
idea to revive it

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:44.590
with Deaf West, casting two
of the three main characters

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.440
as deaf characters
actually within the show,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.860
to just sort of amplify
that theme of the difficulty

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.460
in communicating.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.874
So some of the characters in
the show have deaf parents.

00:12:56.874 --> 00:12:58.290
Some of them have
hearing parents.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:05.280
And so in many of the scenes,
that idea of communication

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.475
is really amplified.

00:13:06.475 --> 00:13:09.836
And, I don't know, maybe
you can elaborate on that?

00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:11.294
AUSTIN MCKENZIE:
Well, actually, we

00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:12.953
should talk about
the Milan Conference.

00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:14.786
KATIE BOECK: Oh, yeah,
the Milan Conference.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.860
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.560
OK, so the Milan Conference
was a gathering that took place

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.290
sometime in the 1880s.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.470
Back then, the sign language,
ASL, was readily available.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.170
But at this conference, they
decided to come together

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.530
to talk about communication.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.279
And they decided that
they would no longer

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.600
allow people to use ASL.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.800
Instead, they would have to use
an oral means of communication.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.660
And that way, everybody
would learn English

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.600
and be able to
communicate with everyone.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.330
And if you wouldn't be able
to use your voice or speak,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.340
then you wouldn't make
it through education.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.440
And so that was
happening at the time

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.072
the original play
was being written.

00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:58.530
So it's kind of
interesting to look

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.460
at the parallels
about communication.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.870
And it fits really perfectly.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.536
I mean, even though
it wasn't trying to.

00:14:03.536 --> 00:14:05.440
But there's a lot of parallels.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.880
ALAN SEALES: So how did
the success of the show

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.830
out there lead it
to Broadway now?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.439
I mean it seems to me--
is that a big leap?

00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:15.980
Or is that kind of
like the next step

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.354
for what it was-- for where
it was out on the west coast?

00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:21.770
ALI STROKER: Yeah, I think
this has been a really special,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.270
unique situation.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:31.130
You know, we put up this
show almost exactly a year.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:38.015
Our first show, downtown Los
Angeles, was a year to the day

00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:41.930
that we opened our first
preview on Broadway.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.770
And we did two different
performances, or productions,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.780
in LA before we
came to New York.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.010
We did a production
in a 99-seat theater.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.160
And it was kind of like
a black box setting.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.380
It was small and it
was really a time

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.290
for us to explore how we
were going to tell the story.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.610
And then that went really well.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.260
We got extended.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.200
It was sold out.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.400
People were really,
really excited.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.540
And then we did it
at a bigger theater

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.710
in Beverly Hills called
the Wallis Annenberg

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.410
theater this past spring.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.382
And there had been a
little bit of buzz,

00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:21.090
like, oh, maybe it
will move to New York,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.190
or maybe something will happen.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.731
And then all of us were like,
we're not getting our hopes up.

00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:25.730
We'll see what happens.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.190
And then a month
later, we found out

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.100
that we were going to be
opening this fall on Broadway.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.286
And so, here we are.

00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:35.910
ALAN SEALES: So Robert, you said
you joined in New York, right?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.510
But the rest of you were all
part of the original cast,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.010
right?

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.650
ALEX BONIELLO: I joined
at the second production.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.190
So I wasn't at
the 99-seat thing.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.910
So I guess I kind of got to
miss the hard, hard, hard part.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.830
I kind of just hopped in and
lived my life in Beverly Hills

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.730
with these guys.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.880
KATIE BOECK: The
majority of the cast

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.835
is almost entirely from
the original version

00:15:58.835 --> 00:15:59.710
that we did downtown.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.140
ALEX BONIELLO: Right.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.389
KATIE BOECK: There's been
some changes here and there.

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:05.507
Some of the adults, a couple
of the swings and voices,

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:06.340
and stuff like that.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.040
But almost everybody--

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.450
ALAN SEALES: I think all
of you on stage right now,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.512
this is like everyone's
Broadway debut, right?

00:16:13.512 --> 00:16:14.220
KATIE BOECK: Yes.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.510
ALEX BONIELLO: Yes.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.560
ROBERT ARIZA: That's correct.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.580
ALAN SEALES: So I just want to
acknowledge that real quick,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.038
because this is
amazingly talented.

00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:21.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.530
See, the show was
phenomenal and you guys,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.450
I would've never thought
that you had never been

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.122
on Broadway before, but--

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.330
ALEX BONIELLO: We fooled you.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.270
ALAN SEALES: Haha.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.030
The magic of theater.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.300
And so, on the surface, the
show is about teenagers,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.170
and discovering their sexuality.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.544
And have you found
that a lot of people

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:44.710
come to the show with
different expectations of what

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.240
it's about?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.823
Because the friend of mine that
I brought when I saw the show,

00:16:47.823 --> 00:16:49.330
she was like, oh,
it's a tragedy.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.980
And I said, oh yes,
you just wait, right?

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.100
Do you find that is common
in the feedback that you get?

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.930
ALEX BONIELLO: I'm finding
because the first production

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.610
of the show on Broadway
was kind of recent--

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.690
some would say very
recent-- a lot of people

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:09.010
have ideas of what this
show is based off of that.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.349
And I think that when
you come to see the show,

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.067
you realize what we
and our creative team,

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:15.900
and what Michael Arden
and everybody decided

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.420
to do with it is a complete
reinvention of what

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.260
the show is, right?

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.780
I mean, by setting
these characters,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.895
making them actually deaf, it's
not like a theatrical conceit

00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:27.020
that there's sign language.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.356
You know, it's actually
part of the story now.

00:17:29.356 --> 00:17:30.980
And I think that the
second that people

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.550
who have any kind of expectation
as to what the show is

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.280
sees what's going on and your
brain takes a minute to adjust,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.391
you're like, OK, so I'm
listening to that person,

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.390
but I'm going to watch
the person who's signing.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.170
Then once everything
clicks, I think

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.740
you understand what it is
that we're trying to do.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.290
And I think overall,
the reception

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.770
has been overwhelmingly
positive.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.020
And that feels very
good for all of us.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.990
I'm sure.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.781
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.850
Well, what was that
translation process like?

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.984
How did you approach
this, or the director?

00:17:57.984 --> 00:18:00.150
How did you approach this
and say, all right, here's

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.900
this amazingly well put
together, finalized show?

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.080
And then kind of
open up the surface,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.174
put the sign language
aspect on top of it,

00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:09.590
and then put it
all back together?

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.140
Because in my opinion,
the original choreography

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.390
had a lot of hand movement.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.280
Obviously none of it
had to do with signing,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.010
but a lot of that
original integrity

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.090
is still maintained
in your production,

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.950
even though the
entire show is signed.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.360
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: I think that
going through the translation

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:34.210
process-- we have four
genius translators.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.150
Let's see, their names,
Linda Bove, Shoshannah Stern,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.880
Anthony Natale, and
Elizabeth Greene,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.810
and they're all geniuses at what
they've done with the script.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.250
All of the scenes, and
the time period, is 1891.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:56.760
So all of that is almost old
signs that were used back then.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.080
But all of the music is--

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.330
ALAN SEALES: So the
signing-- ASL progresses?

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.190
SANDRA MAE FRANK THROUGH
INTERPRETER: If I may,

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.780
I can expand on
that a little bit.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.300
So just like English
has changed over time,

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.860
and it grows and develops, and
some words aren't used anymore,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.660
and new words come in-- the
same thing with sign language.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.630
And so there are different
signs that we use.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.750
I mean, we still do use
modern terms throughout.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.010
But there are some signs
that are done differently

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.930
as an homage to that time.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.720
It's the way we
produce the sign.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.450
I mean, the 1890s was a
more uptight kind of area.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.670
So we try to reflect
that in the language

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.830
and sign in a proper
manner and what would

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.520
have been done at that time.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.520
ALAN SEALES: Proper--
wow, that is something

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.436
I never thought about.

00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:51.910
KATIE BOECK: The
original production,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.510
though, really made a
distinction between the time

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.950
period being very-- the
language being very proper

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.220
in the scenes, and the songs
themselves sort of taking you

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.330
out of that time to this
modern rock musical score.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.490
So that was a big distinction
in the original show.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.430
So the fact that
that's being reflected

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.780
in the sign in this show,
and with the band being

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.970
on stage in this show, I think
that is one aspect that we've

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.560
been able to really-- because
we know the show is totally

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.010
different, we're doing a
completely different thing

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.176
than we did in the original.

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:25.160
But that aspect of
it, I think, is really

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.245
being maintained
in this production.

00:20:28.245 --> 00:20:30.370
ALAN SEALES: So how much
of what is signed actually

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.970
corresponds to
what is being sung?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.152
Are the lyrics maintained
in the sign language?

00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:35.693
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.485
No, no, it's
completely different.

00:20:38.485 --> 00:20:39.610
It is completely different.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.431
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: When it comes
to the words of the music,

00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:47.180
I mean, as I was saying
before, the scenes

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.850
are all pretty straightforward.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.150
The words, they make sense.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.950
It's regular communication.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.940
But when the songs come
about, they're very poetic.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.322
And it's almost Shakespearean.

00:21:00.322 --> 00:21:01.780
You might not
understand completely

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.910
what they're saying just
hearing it the first time.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.326
You really have
to think about it.

00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:08.780
It really challenges
the audience members.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.110
And so with our translators,
the four translators,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:18.410
they did a brilliant job
with duplicating that essence

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.740
of beauty and poetry.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.080
And it's still in sign language.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.470
But you know, like
many languages,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.990
the word order is different.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.450
So you'll be singing a
word, but maybe you're

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.920
not signing that word.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.240
Maybe it's flipped int a
different part of the sentence.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.410
Just structurally,
I mean, that's

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.486
syntaxually a thing that's not
very exciting to talk about.

00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:49.530
But the essence of the
songs, of the poetry,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.040
is still in the sign language.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.860
Daniel, did you want to--?

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.084
DANIEL DURANT
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:21:53.084 --> 00:21:54.000
No, you're doing fine.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.800
You said it all.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.341
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.440
You know what, I will
say, as an example,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.220
there's a line from the song
that we did that-- I'm just

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.970
going to sign it.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.580
But the line that
talks about signing,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.260
and that I would do a new dance.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.410
OK that's the ASL.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.710
So it's not exactly what
the English is going to be,

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.840
but this is what it looks like.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.500
KATIE BOECK: Here is
Sorrow doing a new dance.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.041
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:25.100
So instead of following exactly
what the English words are,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.940
we go for more of the concepts.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:34.060
And so once people see what
the signs are, and they're

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.480
hearing the words, even if they
don't understand each one right

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.240
away, it all comes together.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.270
And I feel like the ASL adds
a whole strong layer that

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.460
makes it oh so very visual.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.580
ALAN SEALES: So talking
about, I guess, the union

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.360
between actor and
voice actor who

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.810
is also a band
member-- that adds,

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.010
like, two extra
layers, in my opinion,

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.600
to what's going on here.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.150
Was the rehearsal
process, or was

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.519
the discovery and the creation
of the character different,

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.060
do you think, than
that would've been

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.950
if you had been approaching
a character on your own?

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.180
ALEX BONIELLO: Well,
ours is particularly fun

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.490
because, like I said, I
joined the second run.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.610
So he had already done
all this work, right,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.070
on what his idea of
this character was.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:26.680
And I-- up until, like, a day
before we started rehearsals--

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.820
I had never even
met a deaf person.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:33.010
So we had absolutely no means
of communication whatsoever.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.030
So when Daniel and
I met, it started

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.400
with him using his
phone to type to me,

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.470
which is the only thing
I had to talk to him.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.062
And so through that,
we would sit down,

00:23:45.062 --> 00:23:47.020
we would look at the
script, and before we even

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.100
talked about character choice or
what this character's feeling,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.230
he would show me
all these signs.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.700
And you know, I may
not be able to know

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.210
exactly what it is that he's
signing in all of our scenes

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.950
together.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.610
But him and I have
worked really,

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.110
really hard, and
with the ASL masters,

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.060
to make sure that we
understand that when he's

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.780
on this part of the
sequence of sign language,

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.700
that means I have to be on this
word, and things like that.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.640
And then comes the whole
discussion of sitting down

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.857
and Daniel will tell me,
this is what is going on

00:24:20.857 --> 00:24:21.690
with this character.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:28.490
Because it's, I would say, like
a 70%-30% collaboration here.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.160
The physical actor needs
to be the one taking lead.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.789
And it needs to be
our job to support

00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:36.830
what it is they're doing.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.246
But, you know, again, that
doesn't mean there's not input.

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:42.224
And I'm sure Daniel has plenty
to say about this as well.

00:24:42.224 --> 00:24:43.890
DANIEL DURANT THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Sure.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.470
Right.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:50.297
I think that I don't have
any musical lines at first.

00:24:50.297 --> 00:24:51.380
We didn't start with that.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.920
But he can see the
emotion, the energy

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.750
and then when it comes to music,
he kind of takes the lead.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.240
And so I follow his
timing and where he

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.770
is with the rhythm and whatnot.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.410
Because I can't hear it at all.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.260
So we use cues for one
another, and right, I

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.760
take the lead when it's
a non-musical part.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.120
And then I follow
his lead otherwise.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.140
And it is a challenge.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.480
I mean, I don't have a lot
of experience with music,

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.930
and I need to learn when to go
faster or when to go slower.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.560
There are different instruments
used at different times.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.867
So these are things
we've worked on together.

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:24.450
ALEX BONIELLO: And
you actually saw it

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.074
when we were singing
our song together.

00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:28.350
If you notice, I
was tapping myself

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.320
just so that he knew when a
certain line was starting.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.950
Because in the
context of the show,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.324
there's a lot more going on,
obviously, than just the two

00:25:35.324 --> 00:25:37.900
of us standing there and
me being able to watch him.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.840
There are lights and things
like that that will help him

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.257
and then--

00:25:42.257 --> 00:25:44.840
ALAN SEALES: What other kind of
cues do the rest of the actors

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.120
use?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.280
DANIEL DURANT
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.860
Well, the choreography
has really

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.800
worked with how we're
moving on the stage.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.220
There may be a prop
that's handed off,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.700
or some other movement
or action on the stage,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.000
so that each of us know
that, OK, that's my cue.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.770
When that happens, she takes
a paper, then I do this.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.145
AUSTIN MCKENZIE:
I will say, too,

00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:05.630
that I think in this production,
it's not so much of--

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.130
and I think it
started off this way,

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.530
but as we all kind of grew
together and understood--

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.240
and even Michael, I
think, as he started

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.900
to explore this and understand,
really, what the show was--

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.690
I really feel like the
voice actors aren't just

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:18.260
voice actors.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.480
I think you guys are
your own characters.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.170
People have equated them to the
subconscious of the deaf actor,

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.850
or imaginary friends.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.360
I see them as guardian angels.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.950
And it was even a
couple weeks ago

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.660
when I have a very
intimate scene with Sandra,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:40.020
and I didn't realize that
Katie was making choices

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.780
and communicating with Sandra.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.527
And I think it's really--
I wish I could see that,

00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:46.610
because it's so beautiful.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.010
KATIE BOECK: I think that speaks
to the creative part of working

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.350
together.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.183
Because obviously there
are technical things

00:26:51.183 --> 00:26:53.850
like making sure her
signs are the same amount

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.260
of time as my line.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.820
So that's a very
technical thing.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.310
Or squeezing her
shoulder so that she

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.650
knows that-- you know-- we
don't have anything like that.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.496
I squeeze his shoulder, but
for her, any time I touch her,

00:27:05.496 --> 00:27:06.210
it's a cue.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.990
I'm not just touching her
arbitrarily to touch her.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:14.992
It's because I'm trying to
cue her within the song.

00:27:14.992 --> 00:27:17.200
So that's all the technical
side of working together.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.574
And then creatively,
I think this

00:27:18.574 --> 00:27:22.390
is a really interesting point,
because we have a relationship

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.740
on stage, you know?

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.820
There are things
we do to ourselves,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.860
you know, in our
own lives that I

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.310
now, as her voice and sort of
her subconscious, her guardian

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.130
angel-- her angel on
her right, her devil

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.460
on her left, whatever--
I'm guiding her

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.870
as sort of a big sister figure.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.930
And that, from a creative,
artistic standpoint,

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.835
is really cool, because I get to
embody some of her subconscious

00:27:48.835 --> 00:27:51.210
thoughts that-- as an actor,
you have an inner monologue.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.668
If you take an
acting class, people

00:27:52.668 --> 00:27:54.310
will say, you're
speaking your lines,

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.160
but what are you saying
underneath all that?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.540
And I really get the
opportunity to explore

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.010
those kinds of feelings.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.950
And if you see the show, there's
moments where we connect.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.064
And it's funny, because
she's looking to me, like,

00:28:08.064 --> 00:28:09.480
should I go talk
to this cute boy?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.771
And I'm like yeah, yeah, you
should totally go do that.

00:28:11.771 --> 00:28:14.100
Or, should I have sex
with this cute boy?

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.557
And I'm like, uh.

00:28:15.557 --> 00:28:21.290
And what's interesting is,
part of my exciting process

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.280
has been using
the lyric as a way

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.610
to inform this relationship.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.150
So many of the songs are in
a past tense, which-- that's

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.180
just what the writer gave us.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:38.090
And so for me, trying to justify
why I'm here on this stage--

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.730
starting at the
beginning, I really

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.640
wanted to allow Sandy to create
this character for herself,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.630
and without a lot of influence
from the voice inside her head.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.920
I wanted her to have that
opportunity, so I would only

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.606
really step in in
terms of, like, here's

00:28:52.606 --> 00:28:53.980
what I think this
character would

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.560
do if we reached a point of,
what would this character do?

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.050
If we really needed to kind
of collaborate on that.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.080
But so much of that has
been honoring her choices,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.980
allowing her to be
free within the moment.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.030
Because there's so many
technical aspects, in order

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.550
for her to feel like I can
make new choices every night,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.680
it's really on me to be
focused and following her.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.800
If she wants to take more
time on a certain line,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.900
I can't just do my own thing.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.884
I really have to watch
what she's doing.

00:29:23.884 --> 00:29:25.300
And going back to
the point I made

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.008
about the lyrics being
in the past tense,

00:29:27.008 --> 00:29:29.270
for me, being
outside of it, it's

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.030
really been this experience
of a remembrance, almost.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.610
Like, I go through the
show and I'm almost

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:42.466
remembering what my former
self, the choices she's made.

00:29:42.466 --> 00:29:46.105
And it has become sort of like
a spiritual aspect of the show.

00:29:46.105 --> 00:29:47.771
I think a lot of
people come to our show

00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:50.270
and feel like, wow, that was--
because so many of the themes

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.920
are religious and spiritual,
and about how the Church has

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.890
caused so many people to feel so
ashamed of their human desires.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.170
And so I think having
these voiced in characters

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.190
has really amplified
that spiritual element

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.046
of the show, at least for me.

00:30:07.046 --> 00:30:09.670
ALAN SEALES: Well, I want to do
another awkward transition here

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.130
and pull out our n
plus 2 redundancy.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.090
And I found another mic, which
I think belong in the aisles

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.550
here.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.030
There we go.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.660
Pay no attention to
the man in the corner.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.507
So yes, if you have any
questions for the cast,

00:30:26.507 --> 00:30:28.340
please come up to the
mics here once they're

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.980
both on the stands, and
you can talk to them.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.110
Austin, this is not only your
Broadway debut, but apparently

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.430
your theatrical debut.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.460
Like, where did you
come from, dude?

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.100
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: It's
also Miles-- Miles Barbee

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.990
who plays Otto, his as
well-- right over there.

00:30:50.569 --> 00:30:51.360
Well, I don't know.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.234
I connect with him
through fear, because this

00:30:53.234 --> 00:30:54.566
is such a scary thing to do.

00:30:54.566 --> 00:30:56.232
ALAN SEALES: What did
you do beforehand?

00:30:56.232 --> 00:30:58.310
Did you do like TV, film, right?

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.985
Or were you just like, hey, I'm
gonna sit at an audition table?

00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:02.386
Oh, I'm on Broadway.

00:31:02.386 --> 00:31:04.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.140
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: Well, I
blinked an eye and here I was.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.400
No, I was attending college to
become a special needs teacher,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.030
and I mean, truly, all
this just happened.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.980
And I woke up, and
I'm not sure if this

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:25.220
is some sort of nightmare or
some sort of dream come true.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.546
But you know, it's nice to
have the consistent show

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:32.170
to go to every night, and I have
a family to go to every night,

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.520
and I love that.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.360
ALAN SEALES:
Welcome to New York.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.690
Yeah, you've got
the Jonathan Groff

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.940
embodiment going on there.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.300
You've been told that
before, you've got the hair?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.880
So I guess speaking of
original cast members,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.060
you were on "The
Glee Project," Ali,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.820
and then you got your role
on "Glee" for a few episodes,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.299
right?

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:01.340
Were you working on this
at all during that time,

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.030
like did you talk about this
with Lea Michelle at all?

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.460
ALI STROKER: Yeah,
it's very odd, right?

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.730
No, I was not involved
with this at all.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:14.380
I saw Lea do the show on
Broadway when I was in college,

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.280
and I had some friends that
were in the original production.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.850
And I never thought
I'd be a part

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.750
of "Spring Awakening,"
because I'm 28

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.135
and these characters are 14.

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:29.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:33.020
ALI STROKER: But there I was
on "Glee," playing 16, so.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.752
Yeah, so no, they
were not connected,

00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:37.960
but it's kind of interesting.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.020
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
it's very ironic.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.853
You're also the first
person in a wheelchair

00:32:40.853 --> 00:32:42.328
to ever be on Broadway as well.

00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:45.316
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.270
ALAN SEALES: So yes,
lots of firsts here.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.725
But I want to go
back to the-- what

00:32:54.725 --> 00:32:56.477
do we call it-- people
swapping, whenever

00:32:56.477 --> 00:32:57.560
there are understudies in.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.389
And that's why, Robert, that's
where you come in, right?

00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:01.930
So how many people
do you understudy?

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.300
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: He just
went in for our Hanschen

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.050
a couple nights ago,
and he was brilliant.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.920
He was genius.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.170
ALAN SEALES: And so he should.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.534
And so how many characters
do you understudy?

00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:15.325
ROBERT ARIZA: I cover
four different roles.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:22.150
I have also never swung before
I started this production,

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.160
and all of the
characters that I cover

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.560
sign the entirety of the show.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.559
AUSTIN MCKENZIE:
It's an easy job.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.350
ROBERT ARIZA: I've also
never swung before.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.360
I've been an understudy
before, for like one character

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.720
in a show or
something, but swinging

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.440
for several different roles is
definitely its own challenge.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.640
And I feel like I
was very lucky enough

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:50.020
to come to this point in my
life very prepared for this job,

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.040
because I have done two
different productions of Spring

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.300
Awakening prior to this.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.280
And actually, right before I
got my audition for this job,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.190
I had just closed a production
of Spring Awakening upstate

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.860
where I was playing Melchior.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.840
So it was fresh in my mind,
and I was ready to audition.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.449
And then they called
me back and they

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.449
had me do an ASL work session.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.904
And it was two hours of
intense, like, OK, you're

00:34:12.904 --> 00:34:15.320
going to learn a scene and a
song for your final callback,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.090
and then kind of prove to
us that you can learn ASL

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.800
fast enough.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.394
And it's really hard, because
like they were mentioning

00:34:26.394 --> 00:34:28.560
before, a lot of this cast
has been together already

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.370
for a year, developing
the show and everything,

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:37.340
and the swings-- I think
almost all of us are new.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.889
We had to learn it just from
watching them in rehearsal.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.710
We didn't really get any special
attention until after opening.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.889
So our first rehearsal
was the Tuesday

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.951
after we opened on Broadway.

00:34:49.951 --> 00:34:51.909
ALAN SEALES: That's like
a week and a half ago.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.480
ROBERT ARIZA: Yeah.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.000
I had really only one actual
rehearsal for Hanschen

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.030
before I went on, because
I went on Monday night.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:06.080
And I had never been
so under-rehearsed

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.450
for a performance ever
in my entire life.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.880
And I've been in performing
for 11 years now.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.920
But the support that I got
from the cast and everyone

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.170
backstage, the crew, everyone
was watching out for me.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.835
Whenever I was just
a little bit off,

00:35:20.835 --> 00:35:22.460
I would get a little
shove from someone

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.180
to make sure I was
in the right spot.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.859
It was very, very
shoved with love.

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.900
Every time I came off
stage people were like, OK,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.700
how are you feeling?

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.325
How's it going?

00:35:31.325 --> 00:35:33.630
And I was like, good, good.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.010
It was just the craziest night.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.680
KATIE BOECK: He also had 100
people in the audience to see,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.800
which was amazing.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.070
We have an incredible cast.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.528
ROBERT ARIZA: So
I'm from New York.

00:35:41.528 --> 00:35:42.355
I'm from Queens.

00:35:42.355 --> 00:35:45.950
And being from New York, I've
lived here all of my life,

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.480
and my family and friends
are all here, basically.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.990
And so I knew that I
had the date on Monday,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.420
that was going to be
my first night on,

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.170
from the day I got the job.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.100
And so I told people right
away, get your tickets

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.090
for October 5th.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.130
That's my Broadway debut.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:10.676
And word got around, and I
had about 150 people there

00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:13.490
to see me.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.964
It was the wildest
night of my life.

00:36:16.964 --> 00:36:19.130
ALAN SEALES: Looks like we
got a question over here.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.556
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just
recently saw the show.

00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:21.170
It was great.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.010
I was curious if you could
explain the beginning where

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.240
you are all in
your undergarments

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.568
and the significance of that.

00:36:28.835 --> 00:36:29.960
ALEX BONIELLO: I'm clothed.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.320
I don't--

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:31.820
AUSTIN MCKENZIE:
That's true, yeah.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.361
KATIE BOECK: I think
it's basically--

00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:38.844
Michael wanted it
to be like, not--

00:36:38.844 --> 00:36:40.510
he didn't want there
to be a time period

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.560
to be clear on stage.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.010
And at the end of the
show, everyone also

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.010
takes their undergarments off.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.660
So it's really this time where
we come on stage as ourselves,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.000
and we leave as ourselves.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.825
And without--

00:36:48.825 --> 00:36:50.700
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: We take
our clothes off back

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.039
to undergarments.

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:53.080
KATIE BOECK: Right, yeah.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.930
In the last song--

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.330
KATIE BOECK: We don't
get naked or anything.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.920
We're not nude on stage.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.530
That's a different musical.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:07.070
But we all have-- everyone
except for the musicians,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.144
which I think is a cool
picture at the end, too.

00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.185
We're in modern clothing.

00:37:10.185 --> 00:37:13.420
The musicians are all in
modern clothing the whole time,

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.540
but the undergarments,
I think, serve

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.300
as just a wiping away of time.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.800
It's not about it
being set in that time.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.430
It's these themes
are relevant today.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.559
Parents and children still
have trouble communicating.

00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:31.600
That's why there's this
big outrage about Planned

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.120
Parenthood-- people
need other places to go

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.030
to get this information,
because parents sometimes don't

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.780
know how to talk to their kids.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.599
And so I think that just
really serves as a device.

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:44.390
ALI STROKER: I'd like
to add something too.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.330
This show is really
an ensemble piece.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:51.580
We work together so closely,
not just the technical sides

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.400
of the signing, but we
have to all be together.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.525
And so that is a moment
before the show starts

00:37:59.525 --> 00:38:01.130
where we're all
on stage together,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.310
and we can connect like,
OK, here we go, team.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:05.530
Let's tell the story.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:09.260
Let's connect with each
other before we do this.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.577
So I think it also serves
as a moment for all of us.

00:38:12.577 --> 00:38:14.660
KATIE BOECK: Right, and
then when Sandy and I come

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.370
to the mirror, she
hands me my guitar

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.610
and I hand her her
dress, her period dress.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.830
And so I think
that really serves

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.530
as a technique to
just illustrate

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.190
how the show's going to work.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.840
She gives me the
permission to be her voice,

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.000
and I give her permission to
go forth and to tell the story.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.040
And that ends up
setting the stage

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.880
without having to
have someone explain.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.040
That does it for that.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.700
ALAN SEALES: So you guys are all
on stage as the house is open,

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.033
like the audience is loading in.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.540
How much of that is
choreographed and scripted?

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.760
Or are you guys actually
just up there having fun

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.280
and being yourselves?

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.630
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.740
We're just playing.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.240
We're just having fun with each
other, warming up together.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.740
Yeah, it's really
been a great thing

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.330
because it helps us to relax.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.720
It helps us to know
we're coming together--

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.691
we're working together.

00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.190
And I don't know
about other people,

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.350
but for me it was
like, OK, I'm ready.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.100
Here we are.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.710
I'm putting on this character.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.400
And so no, nothing
of it is planned out.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.730
It's our playing ground
before the show starts.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.240
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: It also makes
you a little less scared,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.700
because that
nightmare where you're

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.065
in front of the class with
just your underwear on?

00:39:22.065 --> 00:39:25.230
Well, we did it, so.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.517
Every night.

00:39:26.517 --> 00:39:28.600
ALAN SEALES: Have you ever
had any weird happening

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.650
where you had to hold
the house, and you're

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.130
sitting there on stage for
like 10 minutes saying,

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.922
why can't I put
my clothes on yet?

00:39:33.922 --> 00:39:35.130
ALEX BONIELLO: Opening night.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.088
ALAN SEALES: Oh really?

00:39:36.088 --> 00:39:38.790
ALEX BONIELLO: Yeah, a lot
of people who were very fancy

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.820
had to arrive.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.560
We knew that was
going to be the deal,

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.130
but you're just standing there.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.332
You're trying to be
in the show and not

00:39:50.332 --> 00:39:52.540
be too excited, because it's
opening night and stuff,

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.414
but then you're like,
ah, there's Kelly Ripa.

00:39:54.414 --> 00:39:55.376
Hello.

00:39:55.376 --> 00:39:57.126
People are getting
dressed, and then we're

00:39:57.126 --> 00:40:01.340
standing there trying to--
but it hasn't been that bad.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.590
KATIE BOECK: It's t-shirts and
boxers, and slips for girls,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.900
so old-timey underwear
is more conservative

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.180
than modern underwear,
which is nothing.

00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:16.930
ALAN SEALES: I'll go
back to the underlying

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.320
message of the
show for a second,

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.200
because in the show
you deal with suicide,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.320
and with teenage pregnancy
and abortion, and just

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.640
overall general topics
that now are still

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.010
somewhat taboo, unfortunately.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.560
Have you had anyone reach out
to you through the show, maybe,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.310
that has voiced
support through you,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.450
or looked for support from you?

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.530
DANIEL DURANT THROUGH
INTERPRETER: Well, yeah.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.625
One of the favorite parts
that I've experienced

00:40:47.625 --> 00:40:50.350
is afterwards, going
out to meet the fans,

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.286
and sign the autographs,
and talk to people.

00:40:52.286 --> 00:40:53.660
And there have
been people who've

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.490
approached me and talked about
their own personal experiences.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:01.020
And it's just fantastic
to see the variations

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.830
amongst our fans, but the common
threads and the similarities--

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.890
the experience of coming through
a dark time and depression.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.050
And for people to be able
to see that on stage,

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.430
that has been inspiring
to me to honor that,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.620
and hope that we're reflecting
that in an honorable way.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.520
But yeah, it has
been, to me, to meet

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.070
the fans and the
various emotions

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.530
that this generates, people
who have experienced loss.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.264
It's a pretty human experience.

00:41:26.264 --> 00:41:27.805
SANDRA MAE FRANK
THROUGH INTERPRETER:

00:41:27.805 --> 00:41:31.140
And I would also add that
we've gotten letters,

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.170
or people on Twitter
or Tumblr, and even

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.430
some personal direct emails.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:41.560
There was one story that a
woman sent about having grown up

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.580
hearing and having become deaf
and having to try and learn

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.090
sign language, and she
hadn't really gotten into it.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.020
But by virtue of
seeing the show,

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.940
she felt like
there may have been

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.700
an opening in our
community, and that she

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.740
felt motivated to go out
there and learn sign language.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.460
She's deaf, and there's
lots of people out there

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.460
who lose their
hearing, but they try

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.110
to get through just
with reading lips

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.739
and without learning
sign language.

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:05.030
And they never are comfortable.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.020
They never have 100% access.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.320
And so for us to
represent that experience,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.150
that was kind of
heart-wrenching for me.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.981
That was touching.

00:42:11.981 --> 00:42:14.230
ALI STROKER: And I'd just
like to add one other thing.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.855
I've had some really
cool conversations

00:42:15.855 --> 00:42:19.540
with people in the disabled
or differently-abled community

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.570
about how rarely the two topics
of sexuality and disability

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.830
are put together.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.210
And that this is a
really unique opportunity

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.060
to be able to share
that story, when you

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.990
add this other element onto it.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.350
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: I think
the biggest thing is--

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.550
so many people come
into this show, I think,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:47.470
ignorant to this culture that's
alive and well and beautiful,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.664
and I don't think
that it's a tragedy

00:42:49.664 --> 00:42:50.830
to be ignorant to something.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.440
I think the real tragedy is when
you continue to be ignorant,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.231
and you choose to be
ignorant to something.

00:42:55.231 --> 00:42:57.490
And I think that
for people who have

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.090
seen the show who are deaf,
or-- it really doesn't matter.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.880
I mean, for any audience
member in the show, I think,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.930
seeing this production this
way, it's putting forth the idea

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.020
that there is a
place for everyone.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.900
Regardless of anything
that has to do

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.170
with your physical challenges,
everyone has something.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.150
And there's a place for
every single person.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.490
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.989
Well the closing number that
you guys performed here for us,

00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:25.342
"Purple Summer"-- purple
summer is a flower that

00:43:25.342 --> 00:43:26.550
only blooms in summer, right?

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.160
And I think that's what-- it's
supposed to be metaphorical?

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.990
Or is it a literal thing?

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.270
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: It's beautiful.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:32.907
ALAN SEALES: So it's this
flower that only blooms

00:43:32.907 --> 00:43:34.920
in the summer, which I
took to interpret-- this

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.420
is me reading into
it-- which I took

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.630
to interpret as the spring,
everything is just blossoming.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.890
Everything is growing,
but everything

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.220
is pretty much time boxed.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.330
So if things are bad, that
basically this too shall

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.970
pass, like, it will get better.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.770
Time moves on.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:51.730
Time heals all wounds.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.600
ROBERT ARIZA: And I think
that's one thing, and through

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.040
every iteration of this
show that I've done before--

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.860
and I was a huge fan of the
original when it came out.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.850
And it came out a
time where I was

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.980
going through a lot of things
that this show just shed light

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.520
on.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.030
It just helped me through.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.570
It was like the soundtrack
of my life at the time.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.797
And one thing that's
always been consistent,

00:44:13.797 --> 00:44:15.630
one message that has
always been consistent,

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.250
is that as tragic
as the story is,

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.180
when you get to "Purple Summer,"
it's that message of hope.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.640
You have to leave the audience
with that message of hope,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.280
that there is more.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.190
That there is a light at
the end of all of this.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.750
And "Purple Summer" is not meant
to be an ending to the story.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:33.600
It's a coda.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.700
In the script, it's
written as a coda.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.310
The story ends at the end
of Melchior's last song,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:38.830
as you know.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.840
And then the actors come out and
tell you what the message is,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.860
of why we told you the story.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.400
AUSTIN MCKENZIE: You
need to experience winter

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.690
to get to summer.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.090
ALAN SEALES: Good point.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.370
All right, so if there
are no more questions,

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.550
then we are out of time here.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:02.320
So please help me in
thanking them for coming in.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.680
Thank you so much.
