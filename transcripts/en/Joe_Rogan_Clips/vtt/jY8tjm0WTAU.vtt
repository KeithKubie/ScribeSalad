00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.830
Hello freak bitches. So, okay. Gender, Jordan Peterson. Um,

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.870
so I'm completely absolutely with him. You know when it comes to that,

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.630
when it comes to policing of language and,

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.420
but he, as I said, he, I, I re I could be wrong about this,

5
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:20.231
but it sounded to me,

6
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:23.170
and I've listened to him on your show and I've listen to him elsewhere and a lot

7
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:26.710
of people have pointed him to me and vice versa cause they think we agree on

8
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.170
these things and we don't, which is that he thinks,

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.250
it seems to me that gender is biologically determined that there are two

10
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:36.060
genders, they're fixed in nature. And that's the end of that discussion.

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.310
If he's ever said that. I don't know. I really don't think he has. Yeah,

12
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:40.144
I really don't.

13
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.350
Well I think you said that when it comes to gender identity that he doesn't

14
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.580
believe that we need more pronouns. No, he thinks it's just wrong.

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.030
If you think you're a woman when you were born with a penis, it's just by,

16
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.920
it's just sort of absolutely wrong.

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.090
I think you'd have to find him saying that before you really glad to hear you

18
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.450
say that. Cause I wasn't sure where you stood on that. No, I mean fuck man,

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.310
that's a big deal. I think that's a big deal. It can get super weird when,

20
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.530
okay. How about Rachel Dolezal, she identifies as being black, right? Yeah,

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.430
she's a trans racial. How do you feel about that? I think she's correct.

22
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.870
Ah, not now. Hang on, let me, let me, uh,

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
let me tell you what correct means. They're not in a,

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.110
not in an absolute way, right? Not in a scientific objective way,

25
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.740
but it's just as true as anything else.

26
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.660
Meaning that because so race and the, here's where a, here's,

27
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:40.750
here comes Sam Harris now and I'm sure Jordan Peterson's in this boat too,

28
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.280
but I know Sam Harris's,

29
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.430
cause I just heard him talking about this with Charles Murray. Um,

30
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.820
he believes there's, there are races of people.

31
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.590
He thinks that race is a real thing. He's,

32
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:52.930
he's definitely subtle about it and nuanced. He says, you know,

33
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:56.650
it's the divisions between races and the lines are blurry and you know,

34
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.880
but he believes there's a biological basis to race. He's very clear about that.

35
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:05.740
And that is to me, absurd and completely unscientific.

36
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.600
And it's easily disprovable by according to his own standards and by scientific

37
00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:13.650
standards. But then you see a black guy from Kenya, you see a white,

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.920
a Chinese guy from China. [inaudible] what's the difference? No difference.

39
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.700
Well, here's, here's the answer you tell me. Right? Which is that.

40
00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:22.750
So historically,

41
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.550
the differences between them have changed that we, people,

42
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.551
human beings have said different things have created different categories and

43
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.870
fill those categories with different characteristics over the centuries.

44
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:41.500
Those have changed constantly, right? And my first time I was on here,

45
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:43.270
we had a long discussion about what's in my book,

46
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.070
the Renegade history on immigrants and the Irish and the Italians and the Jews.

47
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.550
When they got here to the United States here and in Europe,

48
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.350
they were largely considered to be Negroes, right? Right.

49
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.090
And now there is white. Does anybody, right? So what are they? Um,

50
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.130
at that time in the early 20th century, it was not like,

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.340
when I say common belief, I mean it was taught in schools.

52
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.470
The following taught at Harvard,

53
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920
the following that Europeans were made up of three distinct races.

54
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300
There were the Nordics and Northern Europe, the Alpines in central Europe,

55
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.580
and the Mediterraneans in the S in Southern Europe.

56
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.520
And they were very different biologically.

57
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.690
The Nordics were rational, intelligent,

58
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.140
disciplined. They were the ones who made civilization.

59
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.890
They should run the country. The Alpines were okay.

60
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.040
They could be decent farmers, but they're never going to do algebra.

61
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.510
And they certainly can't run a government.

62
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.140
The Mediterraneans were basically either like Negroes are really close and

63
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:54.100
therefore should be slaves or just peasants. That's my people. Yeah, no, yeah.

64
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.670
You're talking about a long time ago. No,

65
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.270
we're talking about a hundred years ago, which historically, long time ago,

66
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.640
you're holding your breath. But you know, you love ancient history. I mean,

67
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.520
if you look at the whole sweep of human history, that's five minutes ago, right?

68
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.990
It is. But it's still a long time in terms of how we address it today.

69
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.120
But if we address it today, if you're looking at it,

70
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.080
someone from China or you're looking at a dark black man from Kenya, yeah,

71
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.160
there's something different about them. Do you think it's just melanin? Sure,

72
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.050
of course. There's something different about them right now.

73
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.830
Many different things. Where do you draw the line about around races though?

74
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.400
Right? So look at, take all the people in Kenya. Okay. Um,

75
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.570
which ones are Kenyans and which ones are they all Kenyans and what makes them

76
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.830
Kenyan or are they all Africans? Well, you know, you can do, they all black,

77
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.100
right? So those are all passed on someone and find out where their,

78
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.790
their origins are. You can find out how much Irish you have in you,

79
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.220
how much South African you can meet. You can do all that.

80
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.370
You can go all the way back to, you know, your family lineage through jeans.

81
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.760
I get that total. If you want to go all the way back, we're all African. Sure.

82
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.580
Well there you go. That's another way to disprove this whole thing. Right,

83
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.050
right. But it's disproving it because I mean these proving it. Sorry,

84
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.440
that's a bad word to use. Here it is calling it out as a fiction,

85
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.300
as a social construct,

86
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.360
which is that these lines have been drawn all the time in all kinds of different

87
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.130
ways over the centuries by human beings who just look at all the people in the

88
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:21.580
world. They line up the 7 billion people right in their mind,

89
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.370
and they draw lines and say, Oh, these people over here and this side,

90
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.190
those are the Negroes. And over here, these are the Mongoloid.

91
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.860
And over here these are the Asiatics. And over here these are the Nordics.

92
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.900
And over here are the Ariens and the Jews and dah, dah, dah.

93
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.700
And those change all the time. But these are just categories we invent, right?

94
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.720
So who's black? Jimi Hendrix? Black. Well,

95
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.820
Jimmy Hendricks has a mixed background, right? I mean, wasn't his mother white?

96
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.750
What's his race? What's his race? Is he black or white? It's a good question.

97
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.970
There you go. Got it. A lot in them, but so,

98
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.120
but there's a big difference between someone like Jimmy Hendrix and someone that

99
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.270
like very, very dark. Okay.

100
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.290
Comes from a specific part of the world where everyone around them is very,

101
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.340
very dark. Let's do that.

102
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.600
Very obvious and repeatable characteristics that Congo,

103
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.480
these knives come from the Congo. Okay. The people there,

104
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.600
they're Pygmies actually it's an even more specific group.

105
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.110
We can just even do West Africans. Okay. Where a slaves,

106
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.130
where the West of where the Western slaves, American slaves come from. Um,

107
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.940
and just across the continent, not even that far away. You know,

108
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.200
there's Somalia, you know what Somalians look like, right? Yeah.

109
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.580
And Ethiopians, right.

110
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.510
You think about them and how they look and think about how, you know, uh, West,

111
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.830
uh, West Africans look, are they the same race? Well, very,

112
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.650
very physical characteristics. Very dark. Somali.

113
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.370
Somalis looked different than everybody clearly. Right. You know,

114
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.320
as Somali immediately, right? Same continent, same pigmentation basically.

115
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.030
Very thin. Yeah. Their facial structure, very different. Uh,

116
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.490
why are they black? Why are they the same race?

117
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.600
Is the question that the same race or, I mean what I'm saying about Somalians,

118
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.700
like would you,

119
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.570
would you consider Somalians the same as like Ethiopians or as the same as

120
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.490
Egyptian? My thing is also Africa.

121
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.650
My thing is let's get rid of these categories.

122
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.580
These are all silly made up categories. There's no reason to.

123
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.950
They're all arbitrary. Okay.

124
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.210
The lines have been drawn between groups of people arbitrarily over the

125
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.880
centuries. Well, what did you see?

126
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.980
You're arguing against something that Sam Harris said.

127
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.770
So what did Sam Harris say specifically Tim? Him. It's a lot of people.

128
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.370
So you don't agree that there is any race at all?

129
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.350
I'm just saying it's a fiction. It's made time, right? It's just, it's like,

130
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.193
is it a fiction?

131
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.820
How is it a way we're trying to define the variations between human groups

132
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.140
because there are variations. Oh, that's definitely what it's been about.

133
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.810
That's definitely been the motivation. Right?

134
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.860
And think about what the consequences have been. Okay. But it's never been good.

135
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.120
Just because there's consequences for variations or recognizing variations

136
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.450
doesn't mean you should stop recognizing actual variations, but then you make,

137
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.130
but they always make claims right after that. Like what? Sam Harris a straw man,

138
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:07.761
isn't it? I mean,

139
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:10.670
you don't have to make a claim that Chinese people are different because they

140
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:12.740
look different. No. But then it's just, well,

141
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:17.210
this is what a Chinese person generally they have these very stringent

142
00:08:17.211 --> 00:08:19.280
characteristics. They don't have blonde hair,

143
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.800
they don't have blue eyes and not tall and skinny.

144
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.510
They look like Chinese future. But then again, Chinese people all look the same.

145
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:29.210
I mean, there's [inaudible] to say that, right? But again,

146
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.680
there's clear characteristics.

147
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:35.380
A difference between a Chinese person and a black person is very clear. Uh,

148
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.940
not really well and not always Kenyans who lives in Kenya who is born and raised

149
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:45.140
multiple generations deep. And their parents are Kenyan,

150
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:46.160
their grandparents are Kenyan.

151
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:50.150
There's a very big difference between them and someone who lives in Shanghai.

152
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.390
Yeah. But who was born in Shanghai? Their parents are born in Shanghai.

153
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.680
They go all the way back. You know, many,

154
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.720
many generations of being pure Chinese. Right.

155
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:01.140
But there are infinite variations even among the people who have lived only in

156
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:04.380
Shanghai. But what do you want to call the variations? Nothing but, but,

157
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:08.410
but you're talking about something that's clearly identifiable or you just

158
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.280
[inaudible]. I would say that there's, of course,

159
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.570
there are genes that run in families. And I completely agree that, you know,

160
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.140
genes determine in large part how we look fine.

161
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.270
So you can certainly say this person is likely because of their genes connected

162
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.360
to that person, last generation to that generation to this, you know,

163
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.650
and his family lineage. Sure. Well what does that give you? I dunno. Nothing.

164
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.970
I mean it's the thing is that people have taken that and they've said,

165
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.210
Oh well these particular characteristics are human beings.

166
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.700
We're talking about complexity and human beings at the beginning of this, right.

167
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.550
People are infinitely complex. Right. Okay.

168
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.540
So the thing is what people have done historically is they've just picked

169
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.870
certain characteristics among people and said, ah,

170
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.690
that is what determines your race is the issue.

171
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.240
The word race is maybe the issue.

172
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.390
Like there are obvious physical characteristics.

173
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:05.391
The difference between like a someone who is a Mongol versus someone who a is a

174
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.230
Brazilian versus someone who is,

175
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.380
there's some pretty obvious physical characteristics for geographic areas.

176
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.350
Which would you agree like or common physical characteristics for some

177
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.420
geographic areas? Sure.

178
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.440
You could say on average people in China are shorter than people in Polynesia.

179
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.140
Here's the place where you could do it. Canada, like try to find a Canadian,

180
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.020
like you don't know what a Canadian looks like. They could be English,

181
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:32.220
they could be American,

182
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:36.720
they could use trying to entertain your strongest argument. Okay, so like China,

183
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.920
right. You could certainly say that people in China are on average, on average,

184
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.430
shorter than people in Polynesia. Right? Well, they look different. Yeah,

185
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.820
but that's one way in which they look different. A facial,

186
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:51.210
you're talking about physiognomy facial features, bone structure.

187
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.920
Polynesians find to be like really stout people. Suppose you could say,

188
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:56.850
you know the,

189
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.290
the width of their eyes is narrower or whatever on average and whatever. Sure.

190
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.030
Okay. Okay, so what, that's it. I mean what did we, okay, so they,

191
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.590
they are likely to be in lineage from that part of the world.

192
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.470
Fine. That's cool. I've got no problem with that.

193
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.880
But what else do you want to say? The thing is, Joe, no one stops there.

194
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.680
They always go on to that.

195
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.460
They always go on from there and they start to make all these other claims. Oh,

196
00:11:23.461 --> 00:11:28.020
well that race is really good at math. Their IQ is higher.

197
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.450
This is what actually Sam Harrison, Charles Murray were just saying.

198
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.930
They can do the, they can do the, um,

199
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.310
they can do the coding for Google better than, than other people can, whatever.

200
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:43.110
Right. They are more, they are more scrupulous. They smoke cigarettes more,

201
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:43.861
whatever it is, you know,

202
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:47.790
they used to be accused of being a more easily addicted to opium, you name it.

203
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.960
Right. Things change. But that's the problem is that once you start there,

204
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.080
people have those differences for other reasons,

205
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.370
almost always,

206
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.090
which are nefarious and injurious and have done terrible things to people.

207
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.350
Your problem is recognizing those characteristics and those differences and

208
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:13.351
calling it a race and then attaching all sorts of other claims to this category.

209
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:18.220
Precisely. Okay. Yeah, that's exactly what Sam and Charles Murray,

210
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.410
this is Charles Murray's thing, although it's actually,

211
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.460
it's only a small part of his work and he gets accused of it being central and

212
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.280
it's not, but anyway, he does still nonetheless believe this.

213
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.113
And so does Sam Harris.

214
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.180
And so do other people that there are differences in IQ among races.

215
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.340
Okay. Now on the surface level, they are completely correct.

216
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.520
There's no question meaning that IQ scores among people that we identify as

217
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.610
African American have been lower than among the people we define as white

218
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:58.990
American. Totally true, totally true.

219
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.850
And they are right that that is suppressed,

220
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.480
that we are not allowed to even talk about that data, which is there and it's,

221
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.320
I have no problem with that. I'm sure that's true. Here's the thing though.

222
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.120
How do we define African American and how do we define white first?

223
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.880
That's the first problem. Those, as you know,

224
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.130
definitions have changed over time.

225
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.150
So Jews used to be in the African American group and Italians used to be in the

226
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:26.290
African American group. No, no, never. Never called African Americans.

227
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:28.720
They were, they were called Negroes. Well, yes, they were.

228
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.360
Jews were called Negroes. A book written Xin.

229
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:35.260
My book Renegade history in ninth in 1911 there was a book written by a scholar

230
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.790
and this was one of many, the title of which his name was Arthur Abernethy,

231
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.430
the title of which was the Jew is a Negro. That's the title of it.

232
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.680
This was common. This is what people is what year this is.

233
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.490
This is all through the late 19th and early 20th centuries from about the 1880s

234
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:55.690
when the Jews started coming over in big numbers from the 1880s into the 1940s

235
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.483
this was, I'm not,

236
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.520
I'm saying this is what was taught in college classrooms that Jews were of a

237
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:06.850
different race and there was some difference of opinion about whether they were

238
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:10.510
black or whether they were just some other kind of inferior race,

239
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:13.100
but they certainly weren't white. That was,

240
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.830
that was widely agreed upon until world war II basically. All right,

241
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.300
so how do we define African-American? Is Jimmy Hendricks African-American?

242
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:24.100
Does he keep talking? There's a big difference,

243
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.940
isn't there in the term African American versus Negro, right.

244
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:29.980
Because like it's the same thing.

245
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:33.040
It's just a different name for the same category. Yeah. But it's from Africa.

246
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.860
They knew that these Jews weren't from Africa. So the,

247
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.260
so the one drop is a continent. I dunno. They believe that they,

248
00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:42.760
they believe that the genes and they're right about this, right.

249
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.270
The jeans [inaudible] yeah. So that's, you know,

250
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:49.480
and they're bright but so do all of our genes. Right, right. Um,

251
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.280
so that was part of their claim and that they were from, you know,

252
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.650
part of Europe that was a bit closer to African.

253
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:58.160
This is what they said about Italians in particular, Sicilians, right.

254
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.980
They were like, all right, look where it is. That's why these people, you know,

255
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.370
are fucking all the time and having babies and crew and are lazy and can't work

256
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:08.120
and fight and bars and get drunk and, right. Right. So,

257
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.020
so how do we define these terms? What does white mean? That's totally changed,

258
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.750
but how much of it is right? The real guys, just how much of it is cultural?

259
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:19.370
So there's that hold on and then, and then IQ. Well,

260
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.810
um, I think it does measure something. I think that's real. I do, I really do.

261
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.890
I think there is something called, this is a G factor, which it, it, it,

262
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.340
it tests, it measures G factors. This thing that was invented, this concept.

263
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.670
It's a category but it's a real category in the world we operate in,

264
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:37.730
which is your ability to do rational thinking,

265
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:39.950
reasoning like math,

266
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.610
like writing scholarly essays. You know,

267
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.800
I'm sure my G factor is higher sort of than other people's,

268
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.210
although I'm terrible at math.

269
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:55.040
So that's yet another problematic wrinkle for these people. Um, but yeah,

270
00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:00.080
I, I believe that IQ measures that stuff, that kind of thing.

271
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.560
But is that what intelligence is and only is

272
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.010
clearly, no, no, no. There's a lot of variables that IQ does. Cute test tests,

273
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.820
right? The tests, all kinds of intelligence. They test emotional intelligence.

274
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:16.250
Do they test the intelligence of Jimmy Hendricks?

275
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.190
Do you think he was great at calculus? I don't know. I started out it,

276
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.780
was he smart? Was he intelligent? Clearly in different ways.

277
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.290
Clever with a guitar, that's for sure. So then how do you define intelligence?

278
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.270
Fellow creativity is unquestionably some sort of measurement or expression of

279
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:36.140
intelligence. We separate that off though. And we always have as a society,

280
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.280
we shouldn't. That's why you don't do well unless you're really, really,

281
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:42.230
really good. If you're just creative.

282
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.090
And the way we define that and not intelligent in the way IQ tests to find it,

283
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.100
there's a, so it's all problematic. Um,

284
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.300
and just all it does is ask question. It just keeps raising new questions.

285
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:58.490
It never has answers. And so that the attempt to,

286
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.450
there's this thing that goes on where like certain people just need to keep

287
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:06.620
finding racial differences that are innate, biological,

288
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.380
fixed that can't be changed. And it's like, first of all,

289
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:12.770
you've never done this because it's so fluid and you're always,

290
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.580
you never really answering it. And then what if you did finally prove it?

291
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.180
What are we going to do with that information? You know,

292
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:22.250
we just recognize that there are variables.

293
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:24.380
Like when you're talking about Polynesian people,

294
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.920
are we talking about people from Tonga, very stout, strong people,

295
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:31.190
Samoans tend to be very stout, strong people.

296
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.870
I mean that's a characteristic actually a positive characteristic that's

297
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:38.780
attributed to people from that area. Do you ignore that? Like,

298
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:40.340
how do you address that? Of course not.

299
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.190
I would say that people from Polynesia are more likely,

300
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:47.990
men from Polynesia are more likely to be offensive lineman in the NFL.

301
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.180
So your issue is calling it a ratio itself. Yeah.

302
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.680
And then attributing other things to it.

303
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.580
All I'm saying is guys from there tend to be bigger. Yeah. Hell yeah.

304
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.500
No doubt about it. But so what? That's the end of it.

305
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.550
Is there a part of the world where people are generally thought to be dumb?

306
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.910
Yeah. Africa, the country that the, sorry,

307
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.310
the the continent we've been talking about, that's,

308
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.070
that's the history of this country. This is the history of Europe.

309
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:15.000
That's the history of the modern world is the belief that people from Africa are

310
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.320
dumber than whites. Well,

311
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.770
isn't the problem that Africa is also where the pyramids were created?

312
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.170
That's what justified. That's what justified slavery.

313
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.520
That's what justified colonialism.

314
00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:26.160
That's what justifies has justified all sorts of things. Right.

315
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.560
So that's the problem here is that these,

316
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.120
these attempts to define people by race and by the way, by gender,

317
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.310
have done nothing but terrible things.

318
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.880
Nothing but terrible things and you can't do it anyway.

319
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.020
It's scientific bullshit. It's total superstition. It's utterly arbitrary.

320
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.290
The lines are always being redrawn by the people who do this stuff.

321
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.150
So why are you still doing it guys?

322
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.430
Like it's where do you draw the goddamn line?

323
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.430
All the people in Africa are black. Really?

324
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.880
Egyptians are the same race as people from the Congo as the people from South

325
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.680
Africa, as the people from Somalia. I mean,

326
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.250
how are they the same race because it's pigment skin pigment.

327
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.840
Is that the only determination? Well,

328
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:10.950
it's a fascinating thing when you call people African Americans or call them

329
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:14.190
Italian-Americans because Italy isn't actually a country.

330
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:17.010
Whereas Africa is a continent. Fantastic point.

331
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.820
It's weird to call people [inaudible] who's an Italian, right?

332
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.540
Because guess what? Italy didn't even exist until the 19th century.

333
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.050
I mean it was just a bunch of city States until then,

334
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:29.670
and there was no such thing as an Italian.

335
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.670
People who lived there didn't call themselves a team. It wasn't a concept.

336
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.990
It wasn't a name of nothing.

337
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.010
And then they made it into this nation state that they called Italy.

338
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:41.430
And now ever since. Ever since then, every sorry,

339
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.910
but every dipshit Italian American is like really proud that I'm Italian. Well,

340
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:48.510
that dude that has no meaning really in the deepest history at a some weight

341
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.230
meaning sure. But they talk about it as if it's like rooted in nature.

342
00:19:52.231 --> 00:19:56.580
Like it's biological. They love being a part of that stupid team. Soprano.

343
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.450
They lose Sopranos. It's tribalism. It's tribal as it is tribal,

344
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:05.250
and it's stupid. And if it were just stupid, I wouldn't care. It's that. It has,

345
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.680
as I said, it just leads to bad stuff.

346
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.390
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
