00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.804
- Bienvenidos<i> to Taco Temple.
 Can I take your order?</i>

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:05.905
- Yes, hi.

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:07.473
[laughs]
How you doing?

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:11.077
Uh, I'd like
one King Quesadilla,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.212
some steak tacos--
- Two churros.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.348 align:end position:100%
- Hold on, man, okay?
I got this.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:18.317
A grande rice pudding taco

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.819
with the chocolate shell,
of course--

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.154
- And two churros.
- You know what?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.155
I'll take two churros too.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.356 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Shut up, all right?

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.724
I do the ordering, okay?

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.059
This is the only thing
I'm good at.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.360
Don't take this away from me

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.995
like you take away
everything else.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.696 align:start position:0%
- What the hell
are you talking about?

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.265
- Guys, let's not fight, okay?

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.499
- I'll tell you
what the hell I'm talking about.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:34.600
You think humans are stupid.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.002
<i> Well, just 'cause you have</i>

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.370
<i> green skin
 and multiple brains</i>

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.739
doesn't make you
better than me, okay?

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.574
All you ever do
is [bleep] all over my planet.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.342
- Oh, please.
- Huh?

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.244
- I drove for seven hours
to show you the Grand Canyon,

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:46.779
and you didn't even
pretend to be interested.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.214 align:start position:0%
- Well, it was a crack
in the ground, Jeff.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.782 align:start position:0%
I mean, on our planet,
we fix those.

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:52.051
- Guys, can we please,
please stop fighting?

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.619
- Wasn't that, like,
eight months ago?

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.089
How are you still
holding on to this stuff?

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.356
- I'm holding on to it

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.059
because I actually
have feelings,

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:03.429
not like you guys,
a bunch of cold-blooded Nazis.

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:04.630
- Oh!
- Oh, great.

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.731 align:start position:0%
- Here we go again
with the Nazi thing.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:06.732
- That's right, here we go.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.201
- You can't just compare

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.802
everything you don't like
to Nazis, Jeff.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.404
- It's lazy!
- Of course you'd say that.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.874
[chuckles] Everything
seems lazy to a Nazi!

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.242
- Call me Nazi one more time.
- Oh, you see? You see?

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.443
- Do it again.
- Stop it! Stop it!

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:20.313
That's enough!
[sobbing]

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.548
<i> - Sir, I'm sorry. I'm having
 trouble understanding you.</i>

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.317
<i> Did you say you wanted
 three burritos?</i>

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.486
- No, we want two churros.
- Oh, I'll [bleep] kill you.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.587
[all clamoring]

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.621
[horn honking]

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.657
- [screams]
- Come on!
