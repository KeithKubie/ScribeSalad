Hello, my name is Magnus and I
work in the Developer Relations

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.500
team here at Google.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200
In this video, I
will show you how

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.860
to run the Quickstart app
for the Google Drive Android

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.010
API, a new API we just launched
that enables you to easily

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.770
create great Android apps
that use Google Drive.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.710
The prerequisites to
run this Quickstart

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.420
is that you install the Android
SDK and Google Play services.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.480
Both of these can be
downloaded and installed

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.920
using the links displayed here.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.180
Then we can get started.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.080
The first step is to download
the Quickstart code, which

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.314
is available on GitHub under
the Google Drive folder.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.730
Once you have
downloaded this, you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.140
should install it
on your computer.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.860
Then it's time to build the app.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.580
If you use Eclipse,
for example, you

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.920
do this by creating
a project, select

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.250
New, Other, Android
project from existing code.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.370
Select the code you
just downloaded,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.000
then make sure to include
the Google Play services.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.140
After that, it's time
to build the project

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.060
and generate the APK file
that will be later installed

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.220
on the Android device.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.310
Now we're going to register
the app with Google.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.760
And the first
thing we need to do

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.390
is to generate the app
signature in the form of a SHA1.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.040
And this picture may look
really, really scary,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.370
but it's actually
very, very easy.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.580
In your terminal window, you
execute the Key Tool program

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.410
of the Android SDK with
the command line options

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.780
highlighted in the
green box at the top.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.160
Enter the default
password, Android,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.010
hit Enter, and take note of
the SHA1 field being displayed.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.390
This is important as we will
need that value shortly.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.870
Now that we have
this value, we can

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.300
proceed to register
our app with Google.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.850
And we use the Google
Cloud console to do so.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.740
The following link
will bring you to page

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.530
where you can do this.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.000
In the Google console, the
first thing you want to do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.630
is to create the project.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.560
The only thing really
you need to fill out

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.160
as part of this process is the
project name you want to use.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.530
Then select the
API's alternative,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.070
and make sure to
enable Drive API.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.919
By default, the Drive
API is disabled.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.140
So you need to find
it by scrolling down,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.230
and then switch it
to the on position.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.110
Now we're ready to
register our apps which

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.960
will have the Drive API enabled.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.630
So select Registered Apps to the
right, and give the app a name.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.600
Then select Android
as the platform

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.960
since we're building
an Android app

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.800
and accessing our APIs
directly from Android.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.240
The last thing you need to
do when registering your app

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.230
is to enter the
Java package name

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.240
of your app and the SHA1
value that we previously

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.060
generated using Key Tool.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.680
And with this, we have
successfully registered an app

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.320
with the Google Cloud
console, and we are now

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.100
ready to execute the app.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.070
I will demo the app on
a real physical device.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.290
So in order to do this,
I must transfer the APK

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.050
to that actual device.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.600
This can be performed by
connecting the device,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.120
and then using the ADB
command from the Android SDK

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.580
to transfer the APK that
we previously built.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.810
All done.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.930
Let's run the app.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.080
So now the application
has started.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.360
And I can go in here and take
a picture with the camera.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.400
That's a great picture.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.150
I'm taking that.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.990
It's asking me to
upload it to Drive.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.065
So I'm accepting that.

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:26.250
And then I can go
over to Drive, and I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.240
can see the picture being
uploaded here, and there it is.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.080
Excellent.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.100
So I took a picture and
it was uploaded to Drive.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.830
And that's it.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.280
We have now installed and
run the Quickstart app

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.160
for the Google
Drive Android API.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.570
There's also lots of more
sample code on GitHub

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.840
that you can
download and look at.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.010
And now it's all up to
you, so go out there

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.370
and create some great apps.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.560
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
