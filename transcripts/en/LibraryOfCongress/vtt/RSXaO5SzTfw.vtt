00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Hi, I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.610
I'm Director of the Center for
the Book her eat the Library

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.260 position:56%
of Congress, and I'd like to
welcome you to this afternoon's talk

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.120
with the Books and Beyond
program that we have.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.410
We are very excited to have
today's conversation and thrilled

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.830
that you're here with us.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.310
As some of you may know, the Center
for the Book is a unit that is

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.100
in the National and International
Outreach Unit of the Library

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.500 position:56%
of Congress, and it's our mission --

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.360
the Library's mission is to
provide the American people

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
with a very rich, diverse, and
enduring source of knowledge,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.690
one that can be relied upon to
support people in their creative

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.390
and intellectual endeavors.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450
So we're glad for you
to join us as part

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.980
of today's intellectual endeavor.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.750
At the Center for the Book, which
includes the Young Readers' Center

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.640
and the Poetry and Literature
Center, we promote books

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.360
and reading, literacy and
libraries, poetry and literature,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.230
knowing that they are the best
tools to create, and sustain,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.000
for form societies,
and the best weapons

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.730
against ignorance and intolerance.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.700
And our mission is carried out
through a national affiliation

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.980
with several groups
of organizations.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.650
There is a Center for the Book
in every state in the country,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.860
and the District of Colombia,
and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.950
And we also have a partnership of
reading and literacy promotion,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.650
organizations throughout both
the country and the world,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.830
in part because the Center for
the Book administers the Library

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.440
of Congress Literacy Awards
program that annually awards more

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.380
than $250,000 to organizations
around the country and the world

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.540
in support of their endeavors
to advance the cause of literacy

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.410 position:56%
in a variety of ways, both
innovative, sustainable, replicable.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.230
Now today we're here for
a particular kind of talk

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.570
that does promote the
Library's mission and focus

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.210
on literacy and literature.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.760
But before we get started, and
to avoid unnecessary distraction,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.070
I do want to ask that you
take a moment to make sure

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.830
that your electronic
devices are silent.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.390
Also, we are recording today's
event, and if you ask a question,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.830
you should know that you'll
become a part of our webcast.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.260
The Books and Beyond talks are --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470
and all of our webcasts
and live events --

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.340
are available online at Read.gov.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.810
We do have more than 250 talks
from authors of all kinds of genres

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.690
and experiences available for
your viewing pleasure there.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.000
We should mention today also that
the author's book is available

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.840
for sale at the entrance
to this room,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.880
and following the presentation
there will be a book signing.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.570 position:56%
And you'll have a little more chance
to talk with our author today.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.790
The chief criterion for deciding
which books to feature in the Books

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.050
and Beyond series is that there
must be a strong connection

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.880
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.720
Either the books are about
the Library of Congress,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.110
or the author did research
here and used one

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.480
of our many reading rooms research
facilities and resources available.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.300
So we encourage that,
and we celebrate that.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.800
And today is another
example of that.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.640
And we also have the special
pleasure of partnering

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.580
with the Law Library as our
cosponsor for today's event,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.560
which is actually where our
author did much of his research.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.590
The Law Librarian of
Congress is Roberta Shaffer.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.570
And as Law Librarian,
Roberta oversees the largest

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.350
of legal materials -- collection
of legal materials in the world.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.060 position:56%
She was the driving force behind the
successful Magna Carta exhibition

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.920
just of last year in 2015.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.090 position:56%
And just to mention, Roberta has a
very long and successful career here

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.430
at the Library, including
being Associate Librarian

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.100
for Library Services, where
she managed 53 division

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.320
and over 2000 employees.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.790
I -- you know, I count
you as my friend.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.520
I honor you and celebrate you for
your contribution to the library,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.280
for your expertise, and
your extraordinary knowledge

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.580
and commitment.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.230
And I'd like to bring forth Roberta
to introduce our -- today's author.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.530
Thank you.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.000
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Well, thank
you so much for that, Pam.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.360
So totally unexpected,
and particularly today

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.940
when we're honoring such
accomplished people, our author

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.660
and the subject of his book.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.960
And so we in the Law Library
really enjoy these collaborations

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.260
with the Center for the Book.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.050
We recently did one
on poetry in law,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.770
and we hope you'll
look at that video.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.040
Sorry if you missed it.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.340
We're celebrating --

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.880
we were celebrating James Madison's
exact 265th birthday on March 16th.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.390
And Michael was supposed to
join a panel at that time.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.120
But you may or may not remember

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.230
that that was the day Metro
unexpectedly decided to close

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.970
down for something like 72 hours.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.300
And we all could not envision
what traffic would be like driving

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.230
from Charlottesville that morning.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.460
So we thought we would continue
with the other two panelists,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.940
Mary Sarah Bilder and
David O. Stewart,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.310
and that we would save
Michael for a later date.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.720
And in doing that, we decided

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.520
that that would mean we would
continue celebrating James

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.930
Madison's birthday.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.200
We weren't really sure if
James Madison would approve,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.860
but according to what David told
us that day about Dolly Madison,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.020
a real party girl, she
would be fine with the fact

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.800
that we've now celebrated

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.920
for 10 months the 265th
birthday of James Madison.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.940
But actually, at the Library
of Congress, and indeed,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.450
specifically the Law
Library that lives

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.340
in the James Madison Memorial
Building, we should be --

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.280 position:56%
and I hope we are -- celebrating
James Madison every day of the year,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.490
whether it's his birthday
or not, because he set

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.530
so many important precedents for us
in terms of our own legal system.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.230
But he reflected in many
ways some of the values

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.400
that the Law Library holds today.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.710
On the very basic level,
he was an amazing linguist.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.750
I recently -- in studying on
Sunday night for Michael's talk --

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.310
learned that he was entirely
fluent in both Latin and Hebrew.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.910
And of course, you know he
served as Secretary of State

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.950 position:56%
and had an immense interest both in
the development of the United States

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.580
as its own nation-state, but in our
relationships with foreign nations.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.440
And of course, that is a key
aspect of the Law Library's mission

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.980
and function within the
Library of Congress.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.610
But looking at James Madison
a little bit in more detail,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.060
and then getting to know
Michael at least on paper

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.090
in a little more detail, I
realize that there are a number

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.630
of similarities between them.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.190
And so I'll just point out the
ones that I could easily glean

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.990
without really knowing Michael,
and of course, only knowing Madison

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.140
through his legacy
and not personally.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.610
And the first one that I
would like to point out is

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.450
that they both were married to --

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.570
or are in one case --
extraordinary women.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.150
So we, of course, know all about
Dolly Madison and her many,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.520
many attributes that
sort of set the standard

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.820
for first ladies going forward.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.660
But we have Emily Blout
on the Michael side,

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.980
and she is an accomplished
scholar in her own right.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.480
I think she could be in the room.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.240
If you are, Emily, would you mind
just giving us the Queen's wave?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.370
She might not be, but she will be
here in and out during the morning.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.610
And she is an accomplished
scholar and professor

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.970
in the Communications School
at American University.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.200
Her area of expertise is
in Middle East Relations.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.670
Both Michael and James
Madison grew up in Virginia.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.040
I can't say the Commonwealth
in the case of James Madison,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.670
but I can say that in
the case of Michael.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.410
They both are graduates
of Princeton.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.750
Now James Madison, as you all know,
went to the College of New Jersey.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.390
It didn't become Princeton
until a little bit later.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.370
Both extremely scholarly.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.360
Michael Signer has
a PhD from Berkeley.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.620
And I think because
we assume from history

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.720
that James Madison did read all
the books that Jefferson sent him

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.960 position:56%
from Paris, boxes and boxes of them,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.050
that he at least would have
qualified for his oral exam

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.490
under any PhD committee today.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.890
Both have strong connections
to the University of Virginia.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.290
Michael is a graduate
of its Law School.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.990
Madison was very involved
in the founding of it,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.020
and then ultimately too a very
strong leadership role in --

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.730
at the University of Virginia.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.800
Both were and are active
in politics on the state,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.650
national, and local levels.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.710
Michael is the current
Mayor of Charlottesville.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.930
Both -- and both actually -- and
this is plug or buying the book --

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:41.140 position:56%
both depend, or depended, in some
way on revenues from their writings.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.760
Madison, of course, as you know,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.560
near the end of his life faced
some financial challenges and hoped

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.520
that he would be leaving
some money for his stepson

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.770
and Dolly by selling his writings.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.540
I think Michael just wants
to share his knowledge

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.030
and inspire conversation,
but it will not hurt today

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.440
if you buy the book [laughter].

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.740
So they share that.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.050
But to stop being glib and to
say that they've both proved

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.990
in their writings -- many writings
in newspapers in the case of both

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.930
of them, but in Michael's case
very interesting book not only

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.910
on Madison, but on
demagogues and democracy,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.700
that they are very deep
thinkers about the country

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.540 position:56%
and about the future of the country,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.190
and that they are also
great patriots.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.850
And so with that, I would
love to welcome Michael Signer

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.150
to the podium [applause].

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Well, thank you
so much, the Library of Congress.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.320
Thank you, Roberta for that very --

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.620
I mean, we could just
stop now [laughter].

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.130
I think that for most authors
this really would be --

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.360
this is kind of a pinnacle.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.000
It's a real honor to be here.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.350
And you all do provide a critical
national resource for scholars,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.310
for people working on, you
know, off parts of our history.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.970
My father, who is a retired
journalist, Bob Signer,

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.150
has been working at the Library of
Congress of years on the history

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.990
of the New York World newspaper,
so comes here regularly.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.450
And you all provide that
sort of resource for scholars

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.650
and practitioners around
the country.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.840
And so we really -- I
really appreciate it.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.560
So I was going to do a kind of
conventional book talk today,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.910
but I'm not going to do that.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.700
I'm going to do a -- more of a talk
that connects both of my books --

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.440
this is on request -- and
some current challenges

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.970
that we have as a country.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.810
So I think that that
-- we're in Washington.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.670
We're at a really unique
moment in our history,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.890
and I would like to
kind of go for the --

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.250
go for something a little
deeper with this talk.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.990
So -- and I'm really appreciative
to the Library of Congress

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.300
for creating that opportunity.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.600
So thank you very much.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.540
All right, why write a book
about Madison for five years?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.250
There's other books out there.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:15.440
This particular book to me beckoned
for a couple different reasons.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.930
The first was I do feel,
being in Charlottesville,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.330
that Jefferson overshadow
Madison to our peril.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.190
We do have a section of the
Virginia code, which requires us

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.140 position:56%
to quote Thomas Jefferson anytime we
start speaking in public [laughter].

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.870
I throw people in jail for it
all the time if they don't.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.170
No, I'm just kidding.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.870
But Madison is overshadowed,
to our peril.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.380
There are significant parts
about his legacy and his thinking

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.790
that do get overshadowed.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.900
So in writing the book I wanted
to sort of crack his legacy

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.350
in a different way, and that was
one of the reasons for focusing

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.630
on his youth in a more empathetic
narrative structure of the book.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.760
The second one is he, just as a
thinker and as a person of note

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.950
in our history, had a way
of marrying both the hope

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:12.210
and the aspirational potential of
human beings with a very realistic

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.400
and almost pessimistic
take on our worst sides.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.670
And the marriage of hope
and pessimism, of idealism

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.620
and realism is, I think, unmatched
with our founding characters.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.410
And I think it helps explain a
lot of why we lasted to today.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.910
So the book tries to get at that.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.440
Another reason was we really are in
a crisis today in thinking about,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.490
much less realizing, statesmanship.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:43.170
And this book really is about
Madison as the key architect

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.800
of a statesmanship
ethos in our country.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.220
Another reason for
writing the book was sort

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.410
of in noodling on those big ideas.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.730
I tripped into what I think is
one of the great untold stories

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.030
of our founding period, which is
this incredible rivalry he had

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.820
with Patrick Henry where they
had this -- they were very close,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.770
then they were knock-down-drag-out
enemies.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.810
And they had this battle royale
over the future of the country

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:12.500
when they had a fight about passing
the Constitution in Richmond.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.580
And that's the climax of the book.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.610
Finally, there was this kind
of puzzle about how somebody

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:23.610
who was 5'4", and 100 pounds,
and incredibly hypersensitive,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:28.910
and hypochondriacal, and very shy,
how could he become so dominant?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.210
It's just kind of in interesting
puzzle about what was it about him

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:37.740 position:56%
that allowed him to overcome so many
obstacles and become so powerful

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.380
and influential, not
just in his time,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.330
but over the course of
modern human history.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.970
And then the last reason
was I needed a sequel

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.680
to my first book [laughter],
which is called, "Demagogue."

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.090
So with your indulgence, I'm
going to talk a little bit about

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.750
"Demagogue" here, and that's
at the request of some people.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.310
It's been a lot in
the news recently.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.970
I've written pieces for the
Washington Post, and "Time,"

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.650 position:56%
and VOX, and New Republic, and a few
other places sort of linking up some

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.470
of the arguments with
the time that we're in.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.100
And it is relevant in,
and it does connect

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.400
to the book "Becoming Madison."

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.750
So this was "Demagogue, the Fight

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.660
to Save Democracy from
Its Worst Enemies."

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.140
It came out in 2009.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:21.170
I would be the first to admit it
had a fallow period as a book.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.860
But "Demagogue" presents
six instances

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.110
of great political
thinkers confronting

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.370
in very different ways
what I describe

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.050
as the demagogue problem
in democracy.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.860
Plato, who after Socrates,
his mentor,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.640
was murdered by a democratic
mob, sought to crush

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.190
and control democracy through his
various writings and thinking.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.250
Aristotle, Plato's student --

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.870
and rebellious student who
saw demagogues as pernicious,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.250
but as controllable
through an educated

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.770
and responsible middle class.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.740
Thomas Jefferson who sought
to inculcate what I described

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.960
as a constitutional
conscience among the electorate,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.600
including through institutions
like the University of Virginia

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.900
that would educate kind of citizen
statesman Alexis de Tocqueville,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.150
who thought that American-style
democratic mores or a culture

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.970 position:56%
about these values could help
prevent democracy in its second trip

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.100
through Europe -- the first
one ended up in the guillotine,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.720
and Robespierre and Napoleon --

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.400
could help prevent
democracy from turning,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.650
and slipping, and becoming tyranny.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.550
Hannah Arendt, who thought a
heightened constitutional awareness

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.670
that began in the founding
period was central

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.540
to understanding American
democracy success.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.110 position:56%
And Leo Strauss, the sort of
founder of neoconservative thinking,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.890
who saw democracy as
structural, self-fulfilling.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.710
He thought it should be run
by sort of a lead gentleman

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:48.990
and whose neocon adherence created
on those premises, a very ruinous

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:54.460
and fragile democracy in Iraq,
vulnerable to demagogues.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.760 position:56%
So this book that I'm speaking about
mostly today, "Becoming Madison,"

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.720
is a sequel to "Demagogue."

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.660
"Becoming Madison" tracks
both the political thought

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.990
and the political action of James
Madison in the years leading

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.400
up to the ratification
of the Constitution.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.870
The book has a narrative structure
that concentrates on the rivalry

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:14.960
between Madison and his former
friend and boss Patrick Henry.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.940
But in my mind it is
through and through --

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.260
I trained as a political theorist
and a political scientist,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.430
not primarily as a historian.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.100
And there is a book by Hannah
Arendt called "Rahel Varnhagen."

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.960 position:56%
This will be somewhat obscure but
she focuses basically an entire book

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.310
as a biography on the
life and thought

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.120
of a prolific German Jewish
woman and hostess in Berlin

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.630
in -- before the Nazi period.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.900
And it was sort of a deep dive
through the life of one woman

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.290
into the thought and thinking

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.210
of civilization before
nihilism took over in Germany.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.500
So it's sort of a lens
into a deeper world.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.400
And in "Becoming Madison,"
similarly I wanted to go

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.770
into basically what is a case
study of the normative ethos

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.070
of statesmanship that is
core to -- I don't know --

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:14.140
successful American democracy, and
where leaders seem to challenge

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.850
and educate the public and to
embrace long-term complex policy,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.350
and above all, to govern
the passions.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.760
In both respects, "Demagogue"
and "Becoming Madison" are

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.740
about pathologies of democracy,
when democracy becomes ill

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.040
or unhealthy in some respect.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.180
"Demagogue" is about
a bottom-up problem,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.880
which is when democracy's masses,
or the large groups of people,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.330
begin turning against
the system itself,

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.200
begin giving over their
freedom to dangerous impulses

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.450
that could turn against the system.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.860
"Becoming Madison" is about another
pathology, which is top-down,

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:59.240
which is the sickness of when a
democracy's leadership classes give

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.520
up on their leadership role.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.560
Both of these are, of course,
intensely relevant in this time

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.740
when we've seen high levels

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.190
of dysfunction among our leadership
classes here in this very town,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.130
and when we've seen a lot of
people among the regular ranks

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.440
of regular Americans giving

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.830
up on what we have always thought
are the basic norms and ethic

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.710
of democratic citizenship,
and checks and balances.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.200
With those notes, let me go
a little bit more into each

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.150
of the ideas on each work.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.220
The word demagogue has
always fascinated people.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.100
In 1649 the poet John Milton
called it a goblin word.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.570
The term is often deployed
as a blunt instrument,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.930
and it's lost a lot of its power
through repetition and through kind

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.760
of deployment as an attack.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.040
But it would surprise a lot of
people that the original word of --

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.960
use of the word in the
Oxford English Dictionary is

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.370
actually positive.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.150
That shocks people,
but it makes sense

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.820
when you examine objectively
how demagogues work.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.210
So in my book I employ a four-part
definition, which is drawn in part

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.620 position:56%
from an 1838 essay by James Fenimore
Cooper called "On Demagogues."

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.840
First the demagogue presents
himself as a mirror of the masses,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.570
usually in the process
attacking elites.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.450
So kind of being a regular person,
and avatar of regular folks.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.060
Demagogues, for that
reason, are often vulgar.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.810
They often attack the upper
classes intentionally.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.950
Second, the demagogue triggers
great waves of emotion,

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.430
usually through charisma,
flattery, propaganda,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.200
any combination of those.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.860
They use that third emotion
for political benefit,

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.240
which distinguishes them
from an entertainment,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.010
or religious, or commercial figure.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.190
And finally, and this is the
most important they threaten

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.520
or break established
rules of governance.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.310 position:56%
When you put those four elements
together, you get a political figure

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.920
who essentially creates
a state within a state

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.030
that is accountable
to him or her alone.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.670
And that's why demagogues
can pose an existential

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.300
to democracies themselves.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.540
Aristotle wrote that
the most dangerous form

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.730
of democracy is the one
in which not the law

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.530
but the multitude have
the supreme power

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.800
and supersede the law
by their decrees.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.770
This is the state of affairs
brought on by demagogues.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.200
The ancients saw demagogues
as the central trigger

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.440
in what they called
the cycled regimes.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.140
In the "Republic," Plato described,
"Democracy's insatiable desire

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.730
for what it defines as the
good is also what destroys it."

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.400
This happens through the
demagogue who he said was, quote,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.460
"The ruler who behaves
like a subject."

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.550
Two centuries later, Polybius
in Rome described the cycle

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.660
of constitutional revolutions

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.300
where rule disintegrates
into its base forms.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.930
So this idea that demagogues
will convert democracy

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:49.100
into tyranny is grounded
in a kind of pessimism

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.170
about the human condition itself.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.540
Polybius described the
lawless ferocity of democracy

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.110
as like a natural dissolvent

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.920
which rotted democracy
from within, inevitably.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.400
It turned on the demagogue
who Polybius said needed

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.610
to be sufficiently ambitious
and daring to serve as, quote,

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.820
both a master and a
despot of the people.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.950
The cycle of regimes played out
most vividly in the last century

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.390 position:56%
in Weimar, Germany where a very
hopeful constitutional democracy was

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.080
taken over from within
by Adolf Hitler.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.980
But we've seen many other
examples, including in Venezuela

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.870
where Hugo Chavez rising from
within a fairly healthy Venezuelan

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.970
democracy converted it into more

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.480
of an autocratic system
through demagogic means.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.490
The entire American experiment
sought to arrest the cycle

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.350
of regimes through a new sort of
constitutional democracy premised

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.590 position:56%
on the self-salvation of the people,
by the people, through an agency

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.150
and choice which was
enabled by democracy itself.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.340
"The Federalist Papers" begin with
Alexander Hamilton worrying about,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.120
quote, "The military despotism
of a victorious demagogue."

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.570
The question we face in a democracy
is what to do about demagogues.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.440
History is littered with
frustrations about them.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.370
Some of our best writing about
demagogues in ancient Athens came

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.940 position:56%
from the playwright Aristophanes who
squared off with a man named Cleon,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.510
who was the general who deposed
Pericles, the great statesman,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.090
on trumped-up charges of
corruption and later went

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:26.100
on to propose mass slaughter
in the Mytilenian Debate.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.610
Aristophanes brutally mocked
Cleon as a plunder and a flatterer

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.470
in a series of very public plays
where thousands of people attended.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.500
But the satire had no effect.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.580
It only empowered Cleon to go

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.080
on to become more powerful
and more dangerous.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.170
Based on examples like that,
I've long believed that satire is

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.720
of limited use when
confronting a demagogue.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.150
If the demagogue depends on
the passions for his rise,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.350
satire that amplifies the passions
in any direction perversely can end

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.190
up increasing the demagogue's
centrality and power in ways

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.840
that can only confirm rather than
deny their appeal among the people.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.480
Demagogues also, because of that,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.250
can storm across formal
checks and balances.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.710 position:56%
We saw that with Joseph McCarthy
using an obscure Senate subcommittee

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.580
as the mechanism to create
an entirely new power center.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.090
We saw it with Huey Long exploiting
radio to become what FDR called

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.270 position:56%
"the most dangerous man in America."

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.370
The key site from Athens
thinking about this

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.760
and confronting demagogues
was the agency of the masses.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.920
There is an underlying problem here
that goes through democracy itself,

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.350
which is are the collective
people individually responsible

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.430
for the choices they make
in selecting demagogues?

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.270
Or put another way, is there
a counterfactual scenario

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.730
where the people -- where
demagogues do not succeed?

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.070
And if there is, can you,
therefore, blame large groups

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.910
of people collectively
for the demagogue's rise?

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:53.440
That back and forth between agency
and determinism is at the heart

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.170
of many studies of demagogues.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.430
In "Hitler's Willing Executioners,"

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.740
Daniel Goldhagen blamed individual
Germans acting as a group

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.790
for their agency, for their
choices in enabling Hitler's rise.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.920
He placed moral weight, and
therefore, blame on them,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.860
meaning that they chose immorally.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.380
Whereas in Hannah Arendt's
"The Origins

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.370
of Totalitarianism" there is
a much more mixed picture.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.330
She assigns plenty
of agency to Nazis,

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.870
but when she describes why the
German people chose the Nazis,

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.980
she focuses more on structural
variables, alienation,

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:29.200
and loneliness that operated
like a wave rushing through them.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.280
And that means that demagogues
-- and I'm getting to Madison --

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.050
raise a fundamental
question of optimism

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.510
and of the arc of history itself.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.680
It's not overstating things to
say that the demagogue is a proxy

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.520
for the very question of
humans' ability to decide

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.930
to save themselves from themselves.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.290
The answer that unites agency

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.530
and what I believe is
an optimistic model

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.140
of history is constitutionalism.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.260
Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote, "I am convinced

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.570
that the happiest situation

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:07.250
and the best laws cannot maintain
a constitution, despite mores.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.720
Whereas the latter turn even
the most unfavorable positions

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.780 position:56%
and the worst laws to good account."

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.370
Mores were our habits,
our attitudes, our values,

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.120
our culture about the
democratic system itself

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.400
and our responsibilities within it.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.950
De Tocqueville said that our
goal was "to instruct democracy

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.090
to purify its mores, to substitute
little by little the science

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.540
of affairs for its inexperience."

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.500 position:56%
Jefferson wrote -- here's my
Jefferson quote, even though I'm not

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.530
in Virginia -- "Where is our
republicanism to be found?

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.650
Where is our republicanism
to be found?

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:50.400
Not in the constitution, but merely
in the spirit of the people."

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.620
And in Federalist 57, James Madison
said, "If it be asked what is

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.920
to restrain the House

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.590
of Representatives making
legal discriminations in favor

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.710 position:56%
of themselves and a particular class
of society, I answer the genius

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.490
of the whole system, the nature
of just and constitutional laws,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.960
and above all, the vigilant
and manly spirit" --

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.220
it's gendered language --

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.680 position:56%
"the vigilant and manly spirit which
actuates the people of America,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.720
a spirit which nourishes freedom
and in return is nourished by it."

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.550
In other words, this is on us.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:32.490
That observation brings
me to "Becoming Madison."

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.630
Formally, "Becoming
Madison" is an intellectual

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.600
and psychological biography
of young James Madison.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.970
But Nietzsche observed that,

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.010
"Philosophy is often the
personal confession of its author,

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.470
and a kind of involuntary
and unconscious memoir."

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:53.210
And in this case, as
you so persuasively saw,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.890
that is certainly the case for me.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:03.230
I have been deeply troubled both
as a scholar and as a practitioner.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.420
I am the Mayor of Charlottesville
so, you know,

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.930
shifting gears can sometime
be a little sudden for me.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.700
Last night I was just dealing with
whether we change a natural --

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.400
whether we allow mountain biking
in a natural area that we have,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.430
which it was an hour-and-a-half
long hearing

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.850
in our city council
meeting last night.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.570
So I'm working on very
practical issues

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.430
at the local level all the time.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:30.800 position:56%
Both in my scholarly and my
practical life, I am deeply troubled

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.620
by the state of thought in
contemporary American democracy

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.670
about leadership itself
and the vacuum

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.040
around statesmanship,
whatever that is.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.200
If we even talk about statesmanship
anymore, which we don't very often.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.590
The root of this book began
in a conversation I had

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.760
with my friend Tom Perriello,
who's a former Congressman

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.180
from the Charlottesville area.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.860
Soon after he arrived in Congress,

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.810
where he frequently observed what
he described as an abandonment

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.560
of responsibility by the
nation's leadership classes

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.430
over our most fundamental problems.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.850
We have seen this in recent
scholarship about a Congress

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.060
that seems beyond broken.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.130
In the scholarly thinking about
leadership there's more focus

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:19.770
on horizontal, or leaderless, or
quote, unquote cellular movements,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.130
whether the Occupy
movement or the Tea Party.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.830
And in the collapse of
traditional vertical leadership

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.410
under a great deal of very
harsh skepticism about what used

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.020
to be called the great
man theory of leadership.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.260
James Madison, it might
surprise folks,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.110
faced a similar set of issues.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.100
In the late 1770s,
after the Revolution,

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.380
when he was in Richmond
working as a senior advisor

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.660
to Governor Patrick Henry, in
his mid-20s, Philadelphia --

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.640
which was where the Confederated
States we meeting -- was broken.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.010
George Washington was
writing letters back to people

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.550
in Virginia describing the,
quote, "idleness, dissipation,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.140
and extravagance" in the capital
city, how men were infected

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.490
by what he said was "an
insatiable thirst for riches."

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:10.250 position:56%
The delegates were distracted by
the indulgences of the capital city,

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.150
the decadence did not, quote,
"only take men off from acting in,

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.480
but even from thinking of
the business before them.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.780
Party disputes and personal
squirrels -- quarrels," he said,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.540
"had become the great
business of the day."

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.320
Sounds familiar.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.620
&gt;&gt; Amen.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: The custom
was for congressmen to leave

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.380
for Philadelphia after their
election before the winter

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.680
to avoid the roads.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.700
In 1779 when Madison was elected to
Congress, he could have done that.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.360 position:56%
But he instead chose to stay home on
Orange County, where he was living

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.510
with his parents, and to spend
the winter on a private project

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.970
which was analyzing the
nation's hyperinflation problem.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.730
At this point you had several
different kinds of currency.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.950
They were -- all of the states
were printing their own currency.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.710
The federal government had
a couple different kinds.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.670
They were seeking to replace
their old currency with a new one.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.360
But it was -- none of it was
working, and there are records

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.860
of him getting to Congress and
spending thousands of dollars

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.160
on haircuts, for instance.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.200
It was -- so you had a
galloping inflation problem.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.790
So Madison stayed at home and
wrote this kind of private essay.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.880
He didn't publish it
for over a decade later,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.710 position:56%
but he analyzed the problem that the
country was experiencing as not one

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.870 position:56%
about the money supply itself, but
about the confidence that people had

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.050
in the entity that would
redeem the money --

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.350
basically the federal government.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.250
That seems obvious now, but
when you have 13 separate states

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.270
that were just figuring out their
life together, it was not obvious.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.020
So it was sort of the first
lightbulb that clicked

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.930
on when he stared understanding
that he was going to need

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.150
to be the prime driver
under the effort for a --

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.700
what he described as a
coercive federal government.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.610
So Madison wrote this essay,
stayed back, came back to --

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.230
came to Philadelphia after
the roads had improved,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.450
and kind of had his
mission and his blueprint

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.400
for what he was going to work on.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.070
After arriving in Philadelphia,
he took a look around him --

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.440
at the folks around him, and he
saw the same lack of leadership

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.670
that Washington had observed.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.030
And the first letter Madison
wrote back after writing

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.330
to his father was to Jefferson.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.900
And he said, "Whereas the country
required," quote, "the most mature

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.670
and systematic measures."

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.720
Instead they were getting hasty and
half-baked ideas like exchanging 40

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.520
of the old dollars for one of
the new money called specie.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.370
And here is what he wrote,
"Congress from a defect

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.000
of adequate statesmen,"
word for word, "was, quote,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.200
more likely to fall
into wrong measures

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.910
and of less weight to
enforce right ones."

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:43.150
That was so controversial that he
would describe his peers that way

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.150
that that language was
omitted from his --

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.030
from both the 1840
and the 1900 versions

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:51.800
of Madison's official papers.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.300
And what's amazing to me about it
was if you actually look at these,

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.690
he wasn't even saying we
needed extraordinary statesmen.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.840
Adequate [laughter] would be fine.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.290
And that gets us into the question
of what statesmen were to Madison.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.590
What was he talking about?

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:11.080
We tend to use that word today
in a narrow sense to think

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.310
about state-on-state
diplomats, foreign policymakers,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.840
people traveling to
foreign capitals, statesmen.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.710
But he was talking about
going to the nation's capital,

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.010
and dealing with domestic issues,

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.720
and just being an adequate
statesman.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.090
So what was he talking about?

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:32.460
The great theme of Madison's
political theory was platonic.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.840
It was drawn from a very
old strain of thinking

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.150
about governing the passions
that we still see today.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.130
We are still laboring
under a misunderstanding

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.830
that Madison himself
was passionless,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.040
and cold, and calculating.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.910
One book a number of years
ago was titled, "James Madison

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.200 position:56%
and the Heartless Empire of Reason."

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.910
To give you a sense of where I'm
coming from, the original title

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.370
of this book before my wife
convinced me otherwise was,

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.630
"The Passions of James Madison,"
which is not a bad title.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.790
But "Becoming Madison" was better.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.670
That was Emily's insight.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.780
In his dialogue "Phaedrus,"
Plato described the passions

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.360
as two steeds, as these
mighty horses.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.390
One was good, and one was bad.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:21.360
The horse that was the follower
of true glory he described

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.040
as this beautiful and
dignified grand horse.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.750
The other one was surly, and it
had this blood-red complexion.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.680
This is a very vivid dialogue.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.210
And when the passions take control,

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.200
he said that the dark steed
would suddenly gallop away

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.500
from the charioteer.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.470 position:56%
And he said that we can only control
the dark steed by yanking at his bit

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.180
so violently that it
wrenches from his mouth,

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.570 position:56%
and then forcing these dark passions

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.160
to the ground, and
then whipping them.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.900
It's an extremely violent
and intense dialogue to read.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.130
Only then, Plato said,
would the passions be tamed.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.480
But he described an alternative.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.890
He said, "When opinion by the help
of reason leads us to the best,

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.070
we could conquer the steed
through temperance instead,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.520
through a habit of
governing ourselves.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.180
In other words, the violence
could be avoided by training

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:17.400
that dark steed not to bolt away
through moderation, through reason,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.160
and through politics,
through political habits.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.620
So Madison built a country that was
meant to be governed and supported

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.000
by population committed
to mastering the passions

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.450
for the sake of the common good.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.050
A clue lies in a lecture delivered
just before the American Revolution

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.040
in 1775 by -- and I -- one
of the major characters

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.480
in the book is John Witherspoon
who is this magnificent character

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:47.520
in the founding of America,
very larger-than-life, sardonic,

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.430
dark kind of -- just
a big personality.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.200
He was described as
having more presence

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.930
than anybody else in
the founding period.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.000 position:56%
He became the President of Princeton
University, a mentor to Madison,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.390
and a cosigner of the major
documents they served together

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.930
in the Congress.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.170
Witherspoon was a Scottish-born
cleric, President of Princeton.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.070
He delivered a sermon in 1775 --

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.050 position:56%
it was the first political time
that he ever decided to be political

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:17.340
in front of his congregation --
titled "The Dominion of Providence

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.720
Over the Passions of Men."

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.090
And in that he called for a
revolution against Great Britain

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.260
that would at once
be morally inspired,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.170
deeply conscientious, and humble.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.800
He said, "Every good man
should take a deep concern

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.750
in promoting public virtue and
bearing down on impiety advice.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.650
He described the new
democracy that was coming

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.540
after the revolution would require
certain classes of me who would be

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.300
under peculiar obligations
to discharge that duty.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.310
He said those certain classes would
include magistrates, ministers,

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.540
parents, heads of families,
commanding military officers,

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.560
and those whom age has
rendered venerable.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.550
In colonial America
those groups shared the

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.220
following characteristics.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.520
They were educated.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.580 position:56%
They held the leadership roles in
crucial spheres of American society,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.470 position:56%
family, the church, military, towns.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.610
And they often had relationships
at least with those in power.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.620
And all those played into their
capacity or their requirement

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.750
to discharge their duty
to promote pubic virtue.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.370
Madison was taught by this man.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:21.210
This is through and through his
own action, and his own thought,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.470
and what he did in the country.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:28.000 position:56%
And he believed that there should be
a structural social role for people

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.630
who would challenge the system
to live up to its better angels.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.580 position:56%
When Madison was a teenager he first
wrote about the Socratic Method --

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.540
are there any lawyers here?

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.490
Couple, okay.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.790
It's incredible insight.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.430 position:56%
In the book I spend a lot of time --

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.850
one of the luxuries of kind
of slowing down and focusing

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:54.320
on his youth was I could focus in
more detail and slower on passages

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.630
from when he was younger.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.930
And this is when he's a
teenager and in boarding school.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.550
And he's taking notes
on the Socratic Method.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:04.940 position:56%
And he comes up with an insight into
it that is more profound than a lot

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.070
of people who spend
their life studying this.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:13.710 position:56%
Socrates was murdered by a mob under
these trumped-up charges, as I said,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.570
which frustrated Plato
for the rest of his life.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.740
He said -- the Socratic Method was
basically when you led somebody

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.240
down the garden path where you
know the answer, and they don't

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.330
And Socrates would
do it all the time.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.110
And Madison describes it as very
-- this is his words, 14 years old,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.280
about, "Very captitious [sic]
and insidious," and said,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.290 position:56%
"It probably helped to kindle and
blow up that hatred against Socrates

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:38.880
which helped put a violent
period to his life."

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.810
So I believe that Madison developed
what I describe in the book

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.800
as a different, quote,
unquote, method --

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.100
I call it Madison's Method --

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.910
that he used to confront differing
opinions and to challenge,

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.820
to become a statesman, to create
an entirely different politics

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.450
around reason, around governing the
passions that he actually embodied

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:58.750
and that he used to great effect.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.760
And that helps explain
why this 5'4",

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.120
100-pound weakling
could be some dominant.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.520
I come up with nine instances
when he employed this way of being

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.070
in public dealing with the
nation's inflation crisis right

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.160
after arriving in Congress,
arguing for the federal impost

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.700
which was a requirement that the
states fund the federal government

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.820
beginning in 1783, confronting
Patrick Henry's proposed religious

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.250
assessment which was a tax

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.220
to fund Christian churches
beginning in 1785.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.390
This was what led to Madison's very
famous "Memorial and Remonstrance

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:33.670
Against Religious Assessments,"
which was this lecture

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.770
that he delivered,
and later a petition;

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.620
when arguing for the Virginia Plan
in the Constitutional Convention

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.050 position:56%
in 1787; and finally, when he fought

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.570
to ratify the Constitution
itself in 1788.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:47.540
It had nine key elements.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.610
First, find passion
in your conscience.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:53.240
Conscience comes up everywhere, in
Madison's thought, in the thought

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.540
of the people around him.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.840
And it was not abstract.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.410
It was not even Jiminy Cricket.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.520 position:56%
It was something that he believed --

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.910
these folks believed that you had
a voice in you that was part of you

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.540 position:56%
that could be educated or that could
be ignored, but you needed to pray

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.000
and derive counsel
from your conscience.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.080
And if you did, other
people would trust

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.060
that you were operating
in the right vein.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.250
They might disagree with you,
but this is where the idea

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.680
of conscientious objectors,
conscientious this,

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.980
that, and the other thing.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.430
It's a different ground for
coming into public life with.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:29.030
Second, focus on the
idea, not the man.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.700
Madison would go to
pains never to engage

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.040
in ad hominem debate or attack.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.590
He always was focused on the idea
behind individual personalities,

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.760
and that wasn't because
he was afraid of conflict.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.170 position:56%
It's because he knew that that was a
much more powerful grounds to engage

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.700
in changing the country on.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.230
Third develop multiple
and independent lines

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.180
of engagement and of attack.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.150
We are very stuck on coming

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.790
up with a silver-bullet
argument or a good idea.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.000
Madison, when you read most of
the times that he would engage,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.490
he would have 12 or 15 different
grounds that he was trying

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.740
to convince you on, and
they were all well-informed.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.280
And he wasn't infatuated with kind
of coming up with a silver bullet.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:15.370
He would employ logic, history,
moral argument, law, anything

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.040
and everything -- if he knew
what he was talking about --

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.560
to try and win his points
and change the politics.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.230
Fourth, embrace impatience.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:28.780
Again, got this character, this
minute sort of shy individual.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.080
Not at all.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.290
He wanted to be a change
agent eminently

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.920
when he could affect change.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.020
And he did it, and he changed the
country around him as a result.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.310
Fifth, establish a competitive
advantage through preparation.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:43.500
Again, how does somebody so --

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.600
like with his debilities
become so powerful?

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.140
And it was because he
out-prepared everybody.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.910
He knew much more than anybody else
around him, and they knew it, too.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.650
Conquer bad ideas by
dividing them, sixth.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:02.530
Very frustrating thing for people
who are married to lawyers,

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.170
I can say, is that we're
always dividing things

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.470
into one or the other.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.050
But Madison did that
to the Nth degree.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.310 position:56%
There are but two causes of
faction latent in the nature of man.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.990
He was controlling and thinking

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.630
about how do you split
any policy option,

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.600
anything that we're faced
with, into one or the other.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.550
And so he was basically
designing and plowing ahead

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.860
on a path that he had envisioned.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.280
And the country ended
up where it did in part

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.520
because he was so successful
at that.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.230
Eighth, push the state to the
highest version of itself.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:40.490
He was pushing a lot of
nihilism about state,

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.160
the government itself,
just like today.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.510
This is 10 generations ago.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:45.810
It's not a long time ago.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.820
So the antifederalist forces
were basically wanting

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.690
to destroy a new federal
government that would be set

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.900
up by the conclave in Philadelphia.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:00.720 position:56%
He was on the other side, fascinated
by how do you refine, and develop,

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.820
and invent a more accomplished
form of government itself?

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.900
Government was the art form.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.800
Government was statecraft.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.360
Ninth, and finally,
govern the passions.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.730
And I've spoken about that.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.380
"To an adversary" -- this is
a passage from the book --

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:21.200
"Madison's Method was maddening
at best and infuriating at worst.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.600
He always knew more
than his adversaries.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.840
He had anticipated most of their
moves and seemed to have planned

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.540
out everything he would say.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.400 position:56%
He would drag his audience toward --

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.160
through a series of
choices they had no option

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.360
but to make toward conclusions
they had no choice but to accept.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.930
It was a Socratic dialogue
without the question marks,

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.310
a symphony of precision,

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.540
preparation, discipline,
and control.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.880
If you responded to one point,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.410
there were always countless
others to deal with as well.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:50.900 position:56%
As slight as he was physically, he
seemed indefatigable, almost to burn

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.590 position:56%
with an inner resourcefulness and
conscience in every attempt you made

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.280
to bait him, to trick him,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.320
or play to his ego would be
avoided by a return to the plan.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.550
And most importantly, if you ever
revealed yourself to be combatting

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:08.420 position:56%
for any selfish or special interest,
that fact would become garish

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.660
in contrast to his self-evident
conscience, in contrast to the fact

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.830
that he really did have the best
interest of the public at heart.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.500
Statesmen who would abjure
the lowest common denominator

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.920
where demagogues flourish
and who would so challenge

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.240
and uplift public opinion were
key to his [inaudible] democracy

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.510 position:56%
and to the optimism that he felt
would lift this particular brand-new

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.290
nation, very fragile one, out
from the cycle of regimes.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.060
So he did famously observe

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.960
in Federalist Number 10
that, "Men are not angels."

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.210
But he also wrote that, "Human
beings' basic qualities deserved,"

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.550
what he said, "Esteem
and confidence."

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.200
For him the very goal of the
constitution was to enable leaders

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.840
with what he said was "the most
wisdom to discern and most virtue

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.390
to pursue the common
good of the society."

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.060
In a memo titled "Vices
of the Political System

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.190
of the United States,"
which was completed

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.550
in April just before the
Constitutional Convention,

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.060
he argued that Americans
should, quote, "certainly extract

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.890
from the mass of the
society the purest

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:13.030
and noblest characters
which it contains."

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:18.410
The climax of this book is the
ratifying convention in 1788

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:21.520
in Richmond where Madison and
Patrick Henry, who he had worked

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.310
for before, been an aide to,
had this real battle royale

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.650
for three weeks as the leader
of their respective forces,

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.660
the Federalists and
the Antifederalists.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.770
At the ratifying convention,
Madison sought --

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.880
and it's the last 1/3 of
the book, blow for blow --

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.170 position:56%
he sought, to borrow a later phrase,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.020
to become the change he
wanted to see in the world.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:46.080
He hurled himself into this
ring again and again to take

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.130
on Henry and the Antifederalists.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.840
Over those three weeks he refused
to allow Henry and his blustering,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.730
nihilistic attacks against
anything Federal to stand.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.040
And he subjected them
through this steady,

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.890
fierce method to withering
assault by logic and by history.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.000
Just as an example, one day the
topic was the congressional power

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.090
to appoint federal judges.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:11.740
Madison saw a window to deliver
his vision of republicanism.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.120
He began by conceding
that many gentlemen

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.920 position:56%
around him supposed the new Congress
would do every mischief they

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.220
possibly could.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.260
While he admitted that he did not
expect the most exalted integrity

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.420
and sublime virtue from the
men in the new government,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.300
he proudly declared his faith

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.780
in what he said was this
great republican principle,

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.250
that the people -- the people
would have, quote, "virtue

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.280
and intelligence" to select
men of virtue and wisdom.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.960
And he challenged the
Antifederalists and Henry,

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.300
who opposed the constitution
on those grounds.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.700
He said, "Is there
no virtue among us?

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.550
Without virtue," he said, "we
are in a retched situation."

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:48.140
No theoretical checks
could save the country.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.700
Without, quote, "virtue
in the people,"

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.260
even liberty itself
would be, what he said,

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.770
"a chimerical idea," a fiction.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.870 position:56%
He believed that the Antifederalists
were not only weakening the new

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.730 position:56%
nation's politics and economics,
they were actually hastening defeat.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:07.120
He reminded them that the
Constitution required confidence

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.010
for Americans, and then
he proceeded to use

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.390
that word four times
in four sentences.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.810
"Confidence," he said, "was better
than the circulation of money.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.720
Confidence produces the
best effects in justice."

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.130
It would even raise
the value of property.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.960
He was talking about confidence
in the federal government

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.030
and in statesmen themselves.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.430
That was the constitution.

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:31.050
Patrick Henry then rose
to attack the notion

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.920
that federal representatives
would mend every deed.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.190
Of the idea that the nation could
rely on the wisdom and virtue

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:41.920
of our rulers, he snapped, quote,
"I can find no consolation in it."

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.870
But Madison won.

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.340
Optimism and the people's
self-salvation became the basis

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.680
of the Constitution.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.940
At the end of the convention a
man named Zachariah Johnson --

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.390
one of the cool things about
doing this research and spending

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.170
so much time was getting
to know these characters.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.900
He's not written really
about anywhere else.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.710
He was a soldier who was
quiet otherwise during the

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.090
ratifying convention.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:05.990
He rose to praise Madison's Method.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:08.430
He criticized the Antifederalists
and Henry for, quote,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.910 position:56%
"The strained construction which has
been put on every word and syllable,

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.940
and for endeavoring
to prove oppressions

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.280
which can never possibly happen."

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.630
And he said that he would
vote for the Constitution.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.360
In the end it was thousands of
Zachariah Johnsons who stood

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.940
with Madison, who were persuaded
by conviction, by fact, by history,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.940
by reason itself to cast their
lot with a radical new plan

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.960
for the country rather than
prejudices, and political attacks,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.790
and the fear of the unknown.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:39.710
And victories like that, I
believe, give us empirical grounds

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:44.630
for the aspirational optimism and
the statesman ethos that is woven

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:49.080
into and is essential to the
American democracy working

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.270
as planned and as designed
by Madison.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.200
In closing, Madison wrote
to the United States that,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.500
"The people who are the authors

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.610
of this blessing must
also be its guardians."

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.650
In other words, the ultimate checks

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.740
and balances are not
the institutions,

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.270
but the people themselves,

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.450
who Madison called "the
highest authority."

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.940 position:56%
Those are my thoughts from the book.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.280
That's where the book ends.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.770
I will say that recent
events have shaken my faith

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:23.890
in this optimism being
self-fulfilling.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.720
My book "Demagogue" has as its root

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.460
and its branch a very
factual argument

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:37.830
that American democracy always
ultimately repudiates and rises

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:41.300
above the demagogues
who have challenged us.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:47.550
We are right now in the
thick of a profound test.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.850
I've written many places,
so there's no secret

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.080
that I do believe Donald Trump,
our President-Elect right now --

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.830
although that term
has no legal meaning

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.540
because the Electoral
College has not met -- is --

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:04.780 position:56%
has chosen to be a demagogue in very
strict conformance with that term

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.080
and what demagogues have done.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.850
That's a choice that he's made.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.730
He has done a lot of other -- has
created a lot of other threats

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.000
to our norms, and our values,
and our checks and balances,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.440
and this fabric that I've spoken
about, and has taken advantage

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:25.160
of a faltering and a lack of
confidence in both the lower

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.090
and the upper parts of this
healthy constitutional democracy.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.600
It's a dangerous moment.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.080
It's a threatening moment.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.140
It's going to fall
to these people --

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.670
that's why I went through
the Witherspoon quote.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:40.420
It's going to all to all of us,
anybody who cares very deeply

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:47.160
about what the country
actually, factually is built on.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:51.130
So these stories, I think, have
become more crucial than ever.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:52.430
But they're not stories.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.350
They are the fabric, and
the ethos, and the ethic,

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:59.160
and they are something that
we live every day in our lives

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.780
as citizens of this republic.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.510
So thank you very much.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:11.120
[ Applause ]

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.420
We can do questions?

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.720
Of course.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.780
Yeah, we can do questions
for as long as we're allowed.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.080
Yes, ma'am?

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.480
&gt;&gt; You said something about
satire and demagogues,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:25.510
that it actually helps
-- that it helps --

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:26.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Yeah.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.110
&gt;&gt; -- the demagogue.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.070
So I think about "Saturday
Night Live."

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:38.600
So you're telling me that that
[inaudible] help Donald Trump?

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Do
you think it's hurt him?

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:43.350
&gt;&gt; I don't --

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:44.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer:
I'll tell you what,

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:49.010
I would rather have
one Walter Cronkite

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:54.710
or Tim Russert do a 45-minute
long informed, tough,

00:51:54.710 --> 00:52:01.520
unrelenting confrontation at
some point early in the campaign

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:08.310 position:56%
with this particular candidate -- if
I could choose, I'd rather have that

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:11.530
and watch that than have
"The New Yorker" print --

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:15.140
you know, there's one issue
where they had 45 cartoons

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.350
of Donald Trump, or the
"Saturday Night Live."

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.970
I think on two levels, I think
one, it does what I said.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.320
It highlights the passions
in this character.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.390
These are entertainment figures
who are operating on the plane

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:29.420
of what they used to
call the appetites.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.720
This is Trump's comfort zone.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.310
So it doesn't distract.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.990
It only adds to that
fundamental gut connection.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.290
It doubles it.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:39.590
It triples it.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.920
And the other thing
is, it distracts people

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.490
who might otherwise be very
capable, serious critics,

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.070
from the work that they need to do

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.010
if they think that's
actually doing the work

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.110
of confrontation, which it's not.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.410
So it's distracting.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.710
So I don't have any -- I'm not --

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.740
I don't have any problem
with people doing satire.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:01.830
I just think that it can actually
backfire and be distracting.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:04.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Yeah?

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:10.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How is your research and your
study of [inaudible] figures changed

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:18.670
or impacted your [inaudible]
your job as Mayor --

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:19.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: well, you know,

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.520
these are very practical
questions for me.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:28.020
Last night we had a very difficult
situation in Charlottesville

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.450
where we -- the Vice
Mayor of the city had --

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.610
about a week and a
half ago there were --

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.840
he's done hundreds
of thousands tweets.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.140
He's a 30-year-old guy.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.680
There were tweets, several dozen
of them, from up to four years ago

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.280
that are highly offensive, that
include, you know, a lot of race,

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:52.330
and gender, and misogynistic
speak, and upset a lot of people.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:56.120
He resigned from the
State Board of Education.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.860
There were -- there's a lot of --

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.820
there were some Alt-Right
kind of white,

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.180
racists who were doing
a lot of attacks on him.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.950 position:56%
And last night we had a city council
meeting where there was -- there --

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.380
at the beginning there was almost
some physical altercations.

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.240
It was a very challenging
-- after being Mayor,

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.610
this is probably the most
challenging governance thing I've

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.550
had in terms of an actual
thing in front of me.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.610
How do you run the meeting?

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.350
I don't think it's a stretch to
say that all these principles

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:23.580
about prioritizing order,
deliberation, fairness,

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.630
equity, calming things down.

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:30.740
I did a talk at the beginning
about how we needed to be --

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.360
we could disagree without
being disagreeable.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.860
We needed to have civil
and civic debate.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.330
I had everybody look around
at people next to them.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.540
We're all human beings,
and we all have frailties.

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.840
We've all made mistakes.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.260
This was me as a human being
trying to figure out how

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.430 position:56%
with this particular very tumultuous
thing in front of me, how do I try

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:53.040
and convert this into a process
where we're actually going to hear

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.040
from people in our matters by
the public and just order it?

00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.660
And I believe it was successful.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.160 position:56%
It took a lot of thought beforehand.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.950
It -- there was no altercations.

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:06.060
I got a bunch of, you know,
comments afterward and emails

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.830
from people saying, "That
was a very well-run meeting

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.630
in a very difficult situation."

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.620
I had to -- I had to
advert to our rules.

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.220
I had to -- several times
people were interrupting.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.070
They're not allowed to interrupt
without being recognized

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.370
by the chair of the meeting.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:21.670
It was myself under our rules.

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:24.320 position:56%
I had to say, "I'm going to shut the
meeting down if you all can't stop,

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.110
if you all can't let this proceed."

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:29.720
But you know, as an example, I
think that it was a very good --

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.700
I don't know about Madisonian
-- but I think that he --

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.290
you know, there's a back and
forth in the ratifying convention

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.690
where Henry just -- they had
agreed on a plan of debate

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:41.270
of the provisions of the
Constitution, and Henry --

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.440
this was true-to-form for
him, very Donald Trump-like.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.740
He just said, "I'm
going to ignore it."

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.350
And he just started rampaging
through the topics, as opposed --

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.840
and it made everybody -- but
they couldn't control him.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.270
Madison succeeded in getting
the convention to agree

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:58.620
that the rule was you had to
go topic, by topic, by topic.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.830
You didn't just set -- throw
grenades and set fires.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:05.990
So running meetings, and the
order, and the deliberate nature

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.420
of a public -- and the
person running the meeting,

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.470
the leader I think
matters an immense amount.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.130
I think that it gives
people confidence,

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.010
and it allows you to
get to conclusions.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.700
That's just -- I could come
up with many other examples.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.480
But I don't think I would have
had that opinion and that approach

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.880
to running this meeting last
night if I hadn't worked

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.180
on this book for five years.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.480
I really don't.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.780
Yeah?

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.900
&gt;&gt; I want you to say
something about how Madison

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.610
in the broadest sense
understood [inaudible] the role

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:37.210
of the Electoral College.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:38.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Well, okay.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.800
So I've been -- Madison --

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.430
Madison initially favored
popular election of the President.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.930
So the Electoral College,
there's not a tremendous amount

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:53.750
of evidence during the
debates in Philadelphia --

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:57.330
there's not a huge amount.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:58.630
There's some.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:59.980
There are the notes
that Madison was taking.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.540
So I haven't -- I've
been writing a lot

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.350
about the Electoral
College recently --

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:07.970
that's actually the last 15 minutes
of this talk that I chose to --

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:11.270
but I can condense
it into a minute now.

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:14.670
The best information on
the Electoral College comes

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:22.080
from Hamilton who wrote Federalist
Paper 78, I believe it was,

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:24.840
where he described the purpose
of the Electoral College.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.420
The Electoral College, I mean,
it's kind of the marriage

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.040
of the two parts of this talk.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.920
It was put in place
to stop the danger

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.350
of a demagogue from
becoming President.

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:39.680
The electors were supposed to
be in this statesman-like vein.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.890
They were really supposed
to be prominent people

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:44.700
who had thought about their role.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.960
The -- this Federalist 68
actually it is, it talks in great,

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.670
specific detail about how
the electors were supposed

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.840
to stop before an interference
in our councils.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.060
They were supposed to stop a
candidate who was practiced

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:03.380
in what they -- what he said
was the low arts of popularity.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.340
There -- who might promise
tumult and disorder.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:15.040
The -- so it -- and it's a --
it's kind of a lock-shut case.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.630
A lot of people have said,
"Well, the 12th Amendment

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:21.700
in the Constitution was passed in
1804, and that changed the process

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.420
from the original Electoral
College to now the --

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.990
it was a different setup
for how the President

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:30.620
and Vice President were nominated,

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.090
because prior to that you
didn't have political parties."

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.520
But it didn't alter the fact

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.080
that these were human
beings who have this role.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.380
Why do they have this role?

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.680
They get together on December 19th.

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.980
What are they supposed to do?

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:44.400
Why are they not automatically
machines?

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.140
Now 29 states have passed
laws because of the danger

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.260
of so-called faithless electors.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:55.620
Twenty-nine states have passed laws
that require the electors to vote

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.640
for the winner of the
popular vote in that state.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.240
There was a Supreme
Court case saying

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.110
that those electors can be
required to sign a pledge,

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:06.490
but there's no enforceability.

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.530
You can't coerce that
person to sign the pledge.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.300
You can just give them a
500 or $1000 fine afterward.

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.860
And to me and to a
lot of other scholars,

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:21.250
we have now in this moment faced
the first real test in our country

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:25.840 position:56%
of somebody who -- I don't think
the demagogue is a matter of opinion

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.690
or -- I think it's a
fairly objective test.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:33.150 position:56%
But even setting that aside, you
have absolutely a foreign government

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:36.410
who attempted to interfere
and influence the result

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:39.100
of this campaign, Russia.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:43.500
And you have at least a set of
facts that electors should be able

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.790
to investigate and deliberate.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.860
In Federalist 68, it's very clear
that electors should be able

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:53.750
to investigate these
questions as they chose.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.340
And I think that means that these
electors -- there's two weeks left.

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.420
They ought to be able, under court
order, to ask for tax returns,

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.540
for instance, which would show
if there are entanglements.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.810
The Emoluments Clause
is a whole other thing.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:08.810
We saw yesterday in the New York
Times the first Republican elector

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:12.260
to publicly say that he was not
going to side with Donald Trump.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.580
And he cited this line of thinking.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.260
So this is why constitutional
thinking matters.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.140
These institutions we have might
get a little dusty over time,

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.260
but that doesn't mean you can't
take a brush and dust them off,

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.970
and they're just as
vital as they ever were,

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:32.710
because we haven't really had
this kind of a character come

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:36.290
up this far before who has
threatened freedom of religion,

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:40.170
and freedom of the press, and
political violence, and you know,

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:43.190
a whole host of other -- you know,
breaking treaties, and torture,

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.070
and you know, this
is what we've heard.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.370
It's not me making it up.

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:47.670
It's what we've heard.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:49.890
So these should be cause for
grave concern for electors

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:52.870
as they are designed
very specifically --

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:56.090
not me saying it, it's our
constitutional history saying it.

01:00:56.090 --> 01:00:57.670
And so that's what
I've been arguing.

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.130
And I would just --
I would stay tuned.

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.750
I think there will be a lot
on this in the next two weeks.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.050
Yes, sir?

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:09.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the questions that
I have particularly around Madison,

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:15.280
in 1812 Madison meets with a
black sea captain [inaudible].

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.510
And [inaudible] I've been
surprised at the relationship

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.740
between the war -- the period
of the War of 1812 and now.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.150
And your talk has really
underlined some

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:31.980
of the connections
that I didn't see.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:45.130
So the question that I have in
terms of Madison, was Madison more

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:51.940 position:56%
in favor of Africans leaving America
to a foreign country, or east --

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:55.640
or rather west of the Mississippi?

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:06.160
And as we look at the situation
now, as most of the people point

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:14.490
to Trump, it's actually the people
behind him that voted for him.

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:22.240
And he also now has or will have
the ability to appoint a judge.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.760
And aside from whatever
else [inaudible] say, to me,

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.750
purely is did Madison have any
questions about vested interests

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:36.230
where for a billionaire to be able
to appoint a Supreme Court judge.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.800
That on the face of it, to
me, should be enough to be

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.960
at least controversial if
not disqualify the person.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.310
&gt;&gt; All right, let me just take
-- it's a multipart question,

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:52.350
and I want to make
sure that I -- other --

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.760
let me just take the
first part -- the --

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:04.390
about race and what he wanted
to do with African Americans,

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:08.450
which I think is a complicated
enough question here.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:12.650
He had -- I spend a fair amount
of time in the question of race,

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:19.200 position:56%
and his relationship to African
Americans, and the slavery question.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.860
He had an incredibly complicated,
unsatisfying picture on race.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:27.240
And I think that it's
one -- I mean, I --

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.590
it's hard to come out of
dealing with any Founding Father

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.060
with a good feeling, or any
aspect of our history, really --

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.530
you know, at least in
many parts of the country.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:41.410
And this is one of them.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:46.680
So he -- in the 1820s
-- he was an abstract --

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.870
as much as he was a
practical political operative,

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.800
he was also an abstract
thinker who one

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.950
of his weaknesses was
he could dream schemes

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:01.580
that might not work in practice.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.180
Some of the schemes did,
but some of them didn't.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.590 position:56%
He became the President in the 1820s

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:13.260
of the American Colonization
Society,

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:19.400
which was the leading national
organization for the establishment

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.690
of Liberia and for moving
-- what became Liberia,

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:26.470
and for moving African
Americans back to Africa.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:33.700
In his mind, that was a solution to
this difficult problem for everyone

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:39.210
of how do you reckon
with what had happened?

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:43.620
He also -- it's an
incredibly frustrating legacy,

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.680
dealing with Madison on race.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.260
On the one hand, he -- when he
got to Philadelphia the first time

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.630
as a Congressman, there
was a slave who he owned --

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:58.410
his father had given him --
named Billy who he manumitted.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:01.880
He freed him because -- and
he wrote back his father --

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.800
it was one of his first acts
of defiance against his father

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:11.260
who was a very powerful,
controlling man

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:13.790
who I talk about a lot in the book.

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:16.210
And he said, "He's
just not fit for this.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.510
He doesn't take to it."

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:20.540
And he said, "I'm going
to defy you and free him."

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.550
He needed to go through a process
in Pennsylvania at the time

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.890
of freeing him, but
he ultimately did.

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:29.620
And then they ended up working
with the man as a contractor

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.120
with the family later on.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.500
On the other hand, he refused
to free his slaves in his will.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.540
And he had this decade-long
correspondence

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.460
with a man named Edward Coles
who was a Virginian who felt

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.100
so powerfully about the slavery
issue that he moved to Illinois

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.310
with his slaves, freed them, and
became the Governor of Illinois

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.800
on an abolitionist platform.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.710
And he pleaded and pleaded, and he
had been basically his chief aide

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:58.130
when he was in the White
House as a younger man --

01:05:58.130 --> 01:06:01.130
and he pleaded with Madison
over, and over, and over.

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:05.090
He said, "You and Ms. Madison,
this should be your legacy.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.390
You should free your slaves.

01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:07.690
You should."

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.990
And Madison's responses are weak,
and technical, and frustrating,

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:10.290
and -- but they are as human
as him in his worst side.

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:11.590
He said, "I don't think
they would succeed

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:12.890
out in the world, out
from Montpelier."

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:14.190
He said, "We can't afford it,"
which was the most offensive thing,

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:15.490
but he was a terrible businessman.

01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:16.790
I spend a lot of time
in the book talking

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:18.090
about his frustrations
of finding a career.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.390
He really wasn't good
at anything else other

01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.690
than being in public life.

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.990
So you saw all of his frailties
and failures come together

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:23.290
in this unbelievably
frustrating part of his career.

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.590
But he did try and come
up with a solution.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.890
Wasn't the right one.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.190
And he saw the Civil War coming.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:28.490
I mean, he had -- he saw
every aspect of this.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:29.790
And one of the reasons
that he wanted, you know,

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:31.090
coercion was he wanted
the federal government

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.390
to have a stronger hold
on dissenting states.

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:33.690
So that's a very long-winded way
of getting part of your question.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.990
The appointment of judge
is a whole other thing.

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.290
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I wonder
if I could insinuate myself.

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.590
Unfortunately -- this is
a great conversation --

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.890
but we are on a time limit, and
we do want to have the opportunity

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:40.190
to have everyone purchase books.

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:41.490
So if you don't mind stopping
at that moment and that thought,

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:42.790
I will give you small gift
from the Law Library --

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Thank you

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:45.390
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: -- which
is our famous gavel pencil.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:46.690
We felt that it was
appropriate for your many roles.

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:47.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer:
Well, I will use this.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:49.290
I'll have this up in
the [inaudible] with me.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:50.590
That's great.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.890
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: It's a pencil.

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.190
You know that George
[inaudible] said

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:54.490
that [banging gavel] really we
should -- the name of this city,

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:55.790
because the pen is
mightier than the sword,

01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:57.090
we should be called Madison,
District of Columbia.

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:58.390
But in any event, we thank you
so much for this very, very --

01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer:
Thank you very much.

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:00.990
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
-- fascinating --

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:02.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Signer: Thank you.
