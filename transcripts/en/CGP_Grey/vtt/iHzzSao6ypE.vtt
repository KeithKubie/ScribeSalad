00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
Stuck at an intersection,

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.700
you always watch unfold 
the Fundamental Problem of Traffic.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.680
On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.940
and then the next, and then the next, and then you,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.460
only to catch the red.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.540
Had the cars accelerated simultaneously

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.380
you would have made it through.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.320
Coordination - not cars - is the problem,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.460
because we are
monkey drivers with slow reaction times

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.180
and short attention spans.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.360
Even if we tried getting everyone to
press the pedal on 3-2-1-now

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.680
would be challenging.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.040
This dis-coordination limits
how many cars can get through an intersection

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.200
and when one backs up to the next,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.700
that's when city-sized gridlock cascades
happen, taking forever to clear.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.540
In general, more intersections equals more 
dis-coordination which equals more traffic.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.580
This is the motive behind big highways:
no intersections.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.460
Splits and merges, yes. Intersections, no.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.399
No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.639
Well that's the theory anyway.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.180
Intersections outside of a highway
 will back up onto it.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.940
Again, because human reaction times
 limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.260
when the light changes.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.600
But, even without intersections,
there would still be traffic on the highway.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240
Traffic can just appear.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.520
Take a one lane highway with happy cars flowing

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.440
until a chicken crosses the road.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.860
The driver who sees it brakes a little,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.380
the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately
and brakes a little harder than necessary,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.220
the driver behind him does the same 
until someone comes to a complete stop

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
and, oh look, cars approaching at highway
speeds must now stop as well.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.060
Though the chicken is long gone,
it left a phantom intersection on the highway.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.740
This is what's happened when
you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.120
"There must be a deadly pile up ahead"
and then suddenly, the traffic's over

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.060
with no wreckage in sight, 
to your relief if you're a good person

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.680
and mild annoyance if you aren't.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.860
You just pass through a
phantom intersection,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.640
the cause of which is long gone.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.140
And this phantom intersection moves.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.080
It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.520
eating oncoming cars at one end
and pooping them out the other.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.740
On a ring road, a single car slowing down

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.560
will start an Ouroboros of traffic that will last forever,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.340
even though there's no problem with the road.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.880
If the drivers could coordinate to
accelerate and separate simultaneously,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.860
easy driving would return.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.160
But they can't, so traffic eternal.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.040
On highways, traffic snakes grow
if cars are eaten faster than excreted,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360
and they shrink if excreted faster than eaten,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.500
dying when the last car accelerates away
 before the next car must stop.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.820
Now, in multi-lane highways,
 there needs be no chicken to start gridlock.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.760
A driver crossing lanes quickly
with cars too close behind is enough

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720
to birth a traffic snake that lives for
hours and leagues.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.920
It's this quick crossing that causes
drivers behind to over-brake and begin a chain reaction.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.620
But we *can* make traffic
snakes less likely by changing the way we drive.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820
Your goal as a driver is to
stay the same distance from the car ahead

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.420
as from the car behind at all times.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.510
Tailgating is trouble. Not just because
it makes accidents more likely but

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.069
because you as the tailgater can start a
traffic snake if the driver ahead brakes.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.989
Always in the middle!

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.209
This gives you the most time
to prevent over-braking

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.540
but also gives the driver
behind you the most time as well.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.640
And when stuck in traffic,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.299
this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.440
That's the simple solution to traffic:
getting humans to change their behavior,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.860
perhaps by sharing this video to show
how and why traffic happens,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.000
why tailgaters are trouble, and how we can work together to make the roads better for all.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.020
The End.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.560
Except, yeah...

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.800
wishing upon a star that people are
better than they are is a terrible solution.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.580
Every time.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.780
Instead, what works is a
structurally systematized solution

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.450
which is exactly what self-driving cars are.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.070
Self-driving cars can just be programmed

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.520
to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.500
They'll just do it.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
The more self-driving cars at an intersection,
the more efficient the intersection gets.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
A solid lane of self-driving cars
vastly increases throughput.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
Hmm, actually!

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.980
If you ban humans from the road
(which we should totally do anyway)

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.300
you can get rid of the intersection entirely.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.419
After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers
on one road to communicate with drivers

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.579
on another, poorly and coarsely.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.380
Red equals "Don't go now,
we are coming through the intersection."

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.640
Green equals "good to go."

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.400
But self-driving cars can talk
to each other at the speed of light.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.220
with that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
Just as with the highway, the best
intersection is no intersection.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.990
Humans will never drive this precisely.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.880
At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.720
that you watch unfold, as well as everything, is people.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.340
So the real simple solution to traffic:

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.260
is no more monkeys driving cars.
