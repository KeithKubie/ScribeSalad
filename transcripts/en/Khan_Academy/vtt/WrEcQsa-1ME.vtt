00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.720
Well, I've been requested
to do several problems by

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.530
our friend [? Akosh. ?]

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.280
So I thought I would
keep doing them.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm skipping around
a little bit.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.910
Because I think if I did
all of them, it would just

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.520
generate too many videos.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.030
But I encourage all of you all
to let me know if you feel that

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.450
there's something that
I might have missed.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.790
But anyway, I'm just going
through some of the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.550
problems he gave.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.620
So this one-- and I actually
almost find it funny, because

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.340
they use such formal language
for something that's actually

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.890
a pretty intuitive concept.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
Well they say, use the
monotonicity theorem to find

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.995
where the given function is
increasing, and when

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:32.260
it is decreasing.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:45.990
Monotonicity theorem.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.840
It make sound very serious.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.120
Well all the monotonicity
theorem-- at least if I'm

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.750
remembering things properly--
all it says is when the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.890
derivative is positive, when f
prime of x is greater than 0,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.540
your function is increasing.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.540
And when the derivative is
negative, your function

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.100
is decreasing.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.480
And why am I kind of
disparaging of this?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.240
Well what's the derivative?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.730
The derivative is the slope.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.400
And you learned in Algebra
1, that if the slope is

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.610
positive, the graph of
the line is increasing.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.500
And if the slope is
negative, the graph of

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.980
the line is decreasing.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.360
And the only thing that's
different now is that this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.610
function isn't necessarily
a line, it's a function.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.400
So it could be a curve.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.230
But having a positive slope
means that the value of the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.210
function is increasing.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.630
For every change it x, there's
a positive change in y.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.980
And similarly, a negative slope
says that for every change in

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.350
x, no matter how small, there's
a negative change in y.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.660
So there's nothing fancy here.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.850
But let's see, they
gave some examples.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.090
So they want us to use this
theorem to find where the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.400
given function is increasing,
and when it is decreasing.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.060
So the first function
they give is f of x is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.800
equal to 3x plus 3.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.950
What's the derivative of this?
f prime of x is equal to 3.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.950
For any value of x
this is a positive.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.420
Right?

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.470
F prime of x is positive
for all values of x.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.460
So this thing, using the
monotonicity theorem

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.250
is positive.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.630
Sorry, it's increasing
for all values of x.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.910
And you could have done
that in the 9th grade.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.610
How?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
Well you would have said, this
is the slope y-intercept.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.070
The slope is 3.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.055
So this is an
increasing function.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.125
The function will look
something like this.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.990
The y-intercept is 3.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.870
And the slope is 3.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.030
So this function looks
something like that.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.350
And so it's increasing over
from minus infinite to positive

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.580
infinite over that interval,
if you wanted to be fancy.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.120
But this is really just a lot
of fancy terminology to talk

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.000
about, I think, something
fairly straightforward.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.755
Anyway, the next one looks a
little bit more interesting.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:16.590
H of z is equal to z to the
fourth over 4, minus-- and I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.420
hope I'm reading this right--
4 z to the third over 6.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.900
So let's see if we can figure
out when this is increasing,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.130
and when this is decreasing,
when the function is

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.910
increasing or decreasing.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090
So what's the
derivative of this?

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.820
H prime of z is equal to 4.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.770
This will cancel out.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.580
So it's z to the third,
4z to the third over 4.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:54.510
So it's z to the third minus 3
times 4 is 12z squared over 6.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.720
So it's 2 2z squared.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.140
So we just have to figure out
when is this function greater

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.380
than 0, and when is this
function less than 0.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.960
And to figure this out, we
really just have to break out

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.100
our algebra toolkit to figure
out well one, when does

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.390
this function equal 0?

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:20.760
So let's set z-cubed minus
2z squared is equal to 0.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.720
We could factor
out a z-squared.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.660
And then we have z
minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.250
So we know that either
z-squared is equal to 0, or

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.580
z minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.830
So the points at which the
derivative is 0, so H prime

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.030
of 0 is equal to 0,
and H prime of 2.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.750
And that's just our Algebra 2.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.180
So H prime of 2 is equal to 0.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.010
And so we just have to figure
out what happens in the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.662
interval maybe when we're
below 0, between 0 and

00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:01.070
2, and then above 2.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.210
So what is the derivative?

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.520
So when we're below 0,
let's just take a point.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.340
Let's say H prime of negative
1 is equal to what?

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.890
That is equal to negative 1 to
the third is negative 1, minus

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.660
2 times negative 1 squared.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.820
Well negative 1 squared
is just positive 1.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.120
So it's minus 2.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.400
So it equals minus 3.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.320
OK, let's take a point
in between these two.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.380
Well 1 is in between them.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.950
So let's just take H prime
of 1 is equal to 1 minus 2.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.870
Lets make sure I'm
doing that right.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.180
Because it's 1 squared.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.090
So it equals negative
1, H prime of 1.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.625
And then what happens when we
go of z values greater than 2.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.480
So let's try 3.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.010
H prime of 3 is equal to what?

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.520
H prime of 3 is equal to 27--
what's minus 2 times 9.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.610
It's equal to 9,
right, 18, right.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.300
So it's positive.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.970
So, what do we know?

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.880
We know that in all fairness,
this is kind of an

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.210
interesting problem.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.370
Because the derivative
is negative.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:37.080
So if we were to draw the
derivative of this, what are

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.500
the interesting points?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.660
It's 0.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.600
So that's the x-axis.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.765
That's 0.

00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:50.000
And then we had 2.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.640
And I'm going to draw
the derivative.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.900
I'm not drawing the
actual function.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.690
Because the monotonicity
theorem, we care about

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.480
whether the derivative
is positive or negative.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.640
So what this tells us is
that the derivative, it

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.560
was a negative when we're
to left of 0, right?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.650
Because we just
took a test point.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.160
Because we know it's 0 here.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.010
But then what happened?

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.560
It's not like it
got positive then.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.100
It went back negative
again when we tried to

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.940
derivative it once.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.320
It probably does
something like this.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.092
Now what would it be?

00:07:34.092 --> 00:07:39.910
Then it goes up at 2 where
it's greater than 0.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.560
Right.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.240
I was confusing
myself for a second.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.470
Right.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.020
So the derivative, it starts.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.790
But it never goes
above right there.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.580
So the derivative probably
has a bit of a maximum

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.680
point there or something.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.000
This is the
derivative, remember.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.040
That's why I was
confusing myself.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.870
And then it probably
flips around, and then

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.590
goes above there.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.740
But from the monotonicity
theorem, what do we care about?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.020
We care about the intervals
where the derivative

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.890
is positive, and the
derivative is negative.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.200
So if the derivative is
positive for all of

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.600
these values, for z
is greater than 2.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.790
So we could say, using the
monotonicity theorem, this

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.015
function is increasing
when z is greater than 2.

00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:24.230
So let me write that.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.990
And then we can say that the
function is decreasing.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.870
We could say flat or
decreasing, right?

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.410
Because the slope of the
function is 0 right here.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.210
And remember this is the
graph of the derivative.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.060
So we could say flat
or decreasing when

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.850
z is less than 2.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.910
You normally do consider flat,
monotonic in one direction.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.980
So you could say monotonic
increasing would still

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.000
include something that
kind of flattens out.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.720
Well anyway, I'm
pushing ten minutes.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.170
And I don't think I have time
for the next problem, which I

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.970
might do in the next video.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.010
But hopefully you found
that a little bit helpful,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.740
and not too confusing.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.220
I will see you in
the next video.
