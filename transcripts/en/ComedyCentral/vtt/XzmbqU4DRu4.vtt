00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:04.738
(tiny bleep)

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Can you make the hairs
go in one direction?

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.507
- I'm trying to, but I'm
trying to give it, like,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.441
a posing pattern.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.676
- Just go in one direction.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.078
- Wow, what do we have here?

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.513
Monsters twink?

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.016
(laughing)
- Uh, no?

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.685 align:start size:97% position:3%
For your information, we're
going to Concert Fest.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.754
- Too cool for the
likes of you, Betsy.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.155
Or should I call
you "the Comish"?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.323
(laughing)

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.824
(smooches)

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.494 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We may not be cool enough
to get over priced heatstroke,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.864 align:start position:0%
but Cornell and I were sneaking
into IMAX movies all day.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.566
I'm the human snackbar.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.469 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Woah, where's
the fire, two-eyes?

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.874 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm gonna spend the weekend
at my girlfriend's house.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.244 align:start size:94% position:6%
Things have gotten a
little tense around here.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.415
(dramatic guitar chord)

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.249
- Coyote!

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.218
Thought it was the mailman!

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.186
- What?

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.554
- Like coyote in the house!

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.056
(ravenous snarling)

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.257
- Oh my god, he's right!

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.224
Everyone run!

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.426
There's a coyote in the house!

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.794 align:start size:81% position:19%
(screaming)
- Guys, split up!

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.062
It can only eat some of us.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:06.232 align:start size:75% position:25%
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.271
(whooshing)

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.907
- Animal control says
they have to pick up

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start size:97% position:3%
a snake, a raccoon, and a
possum before they get to us.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.079 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now that sounds
like a fun car, right?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.613
- Let's just hang tight here

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.148
and we will be fine.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.818
- Wait a minute, who
made you leader, huh?

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.953 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't see your
butt-boy Nick anywhere.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.988
- Okay, don't be jealous
'cause I'm a born leader.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.025 align:start size:84% position:16%
People trust me,
they're scared of you.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What? You guys
talkin' behind my back?

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.262
- Because I have files

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.298 align:start size:94% position:6%
with all of your
grandmothers' information.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.132
Huh?

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:39.966
(horrified gasp)

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.834
(dramatic tone)

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.368
- Cal!

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.570
Hey buddy, hang in there,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause a lot of
people care about you,

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.140
and they really, really
need you in their lives.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.509
(smacking)
- God dammit!

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.645 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now I'm gonna miss my
fun concert day with Cal,

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.913
because of you!

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.682
- What? I didn't let
a coyote in the house.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.584
- Yeah, but we were
just about to leave,

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.719
and then you started talking
about your dumb girlfriend,

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.154
and we felt bad for you,
'cause you're so lame.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.355
- (Mumbling), man.

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.823
What's your fucking
problem with me?

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.458 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh, I think you know what
my problem is with you.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.293
- (frustrated sigh)
Maybe you're jealous?

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.896 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because you have an unhealthy,
codependency with Cal?

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.665
(laughs, scoffs)

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.235
- No.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.870
In fact, ever since
you've moved in,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.838 align:start size:88% position:13%
I've been super jealous,
'cause I'm dependent

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.673
on Cal for a lot of things.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.542 align:start size:97% position:3%
(stomach gurgles dangerously)
- Ah, guys, uh.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.378 align:start size:88% position:13%
Okay, I ate a bad
GoGurt, and I gotta go.

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:26.312
Now.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.214
(dramatic tone)

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.550 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You're such a
benevolent leader,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.986
so long as everybody
does what you say.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.387
- Yeah.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.856 align:start position:0%
- Is that why Nick got a
tattoo of your face on his ass?

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.291
- It was a hot brand!

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.026 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's worse than a tattoo!
- I love him!

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.594 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's not awful!
(Betsy yelling indistinctly)

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.795
People love me!

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.898
(both arguing indistinctly)

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.199
- Will you guys please, please,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.801
would you just go
ahead and do it?

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.836
- [Both] What?

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.004
- I'm serious.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.207 align:start size:84% position:16%
I saw this
documentary on NatGeo,

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.676 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it showed how
heightened human pheromones

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.444
can scare away predators.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.346
Now if you guys are
willing to put aside

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.316
your differences and
do the stinky deed,

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.651
we might get out of this.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.886
(dramatic tone)

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.188
(groaning)
- Alright.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.622 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hang in there,
Corny, come on, man.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.458
(panting, groaning)

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.694 align:start size:81% position:19%
(screams in pain)
- Hey, hey!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.129
Hey, who's a pretty boy?

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.498
(whimpering)

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.666
- Will you give me
another GoGurt, man?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.500
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.501
- No. No.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:22.902
- Right, no, man, just,

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.771
look, I know you gotta
poop real bad, okay?

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.972
But just hang in there,

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.607
there's a ravenous
coyote outside, okay?

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.875
You're gonna have to
ride this one out.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.076
(gentle sobbing)

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.844 align:start size:75% position:25%
Wait.
(dramatic music)

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:32.679
He needs to fart.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.580
- What?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.315
- Fart? Pass gas? Toot?

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.649 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, man, I know
what a fart is.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.884
- Well he's got a poop in there.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.052
And there's pressure
building up behind it,

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.887
so we gotta relieve it somehow.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.456
If we can coerce a fart
out around the poop,

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.058
not through it, around it,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.460
without breaking the poop up,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.195 align:start size:84% position:16%
we may have a chance
of saving him.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.297
I'm gonna need some help.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.300
Oh!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.001
I'm kidding, yeah,
I need your help.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.336
(dramatic music)

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.037
- Yeah, I would never
have sex with you.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.306 align:start size:88% position:13%
Even if you were wearing
a Liam Neeson mask.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.041
- Well I would never
have sex with you,

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.377
even if you were the mom of...

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:06.012
Wait a second.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.081
We have to do this.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.415
We were friends once.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.617
- You're right.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:11.751 align:start size:84% position:16%
If we wanna be the
leaders of this house,

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:12.752
we have to act like it.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.753
- Yeah.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.587
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.822
- Okay.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.390 align:start size:84% position:16%
I want you to put
your dick inside me.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.324
- I'm gonna put it in,

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.425
I'm gonna slide it right in!

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:23.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Put it inside of me!
(screaming)

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.698
- [Cornell] Ow, ow!

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.699
- Stay with me, Cornell.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.001
Cornell, stay with me.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:28.835
Stay with me.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.337
(synth music)

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:47.186
(screaming in pain)

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.377
♪ Be my everyday

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.348
♪ Savior

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.391
♪ Be my everyday

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:27.860
♪ Savior

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.595
(screaming in pleasure)

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.764
(howling)

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:33.599
- Get it out, man!

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.567
Get it out!

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:35.835
(screams)
(farts)

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.805
(panting)

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.808
(relieved laughing)

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.146
(sighing)

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We have the animal
under control,

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:55.521
you can all come out now.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.024
(relieved groans)

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank God.
- What a day, right?

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.394
- Wow.

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:02.795
- Thank you, and
thank all of you.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:05.164
(gentle guitar)
Especially Betsy,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.866
who I just had sex with.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:07.900
You know, I never realized--

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.735
- Do I have to be here for this?

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:09.669
- Yes.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.070
All we needed to get along

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.439
was just to get to
know each other.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.640
- Looks like that
coyote turned out

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.775 align:start size:84% position:16%
to be quite the
blessing after all.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.176
(gentle laughter)

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.412
- Oh, that wasn't
a coyote. (laughs)

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was the next-door
neighbor's dog.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.783 align:start size:81% position:19%
His head got stuck
in the radiator

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:27.954 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we had to put 'er down.
(horrified gasps)

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.656 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Well, this is
everyone's fault but mine.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:31.891
- What?

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It is only your fault.
- How is it my fault?

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:34.160
- Everyone was on edge.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.728
(all furiously arguing)

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.830
(thumps)

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.803
(gentle guitar)

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.450
(heavy dance music)
