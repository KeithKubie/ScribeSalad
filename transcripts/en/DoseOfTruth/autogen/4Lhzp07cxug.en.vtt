00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 align:start position:0%
now divided because one child is the
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 align:start position:0%
now divided because one child is the
favorite<00:00:44.910><c> of</c><00:00:44.969><c> the</c><00:00:45.030><c> mother</c><00:00:45.329><c> and</c><00:00:45.660><c> that's</c><00:00:46.170><c> Jacob</c>

favorite of the mother and that's Jacob
and<00:00:47.280><c> one</c><00:00:47.579><c> child</c><00:00:47.820><c> is</c><00:00:47.940><c> the</c><00:00:48.059><c> favorite</c><00:00:48.360><c> of</c><00:00:48.480><c> the</c>

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
and one child is the favorite of the
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
and one child is the favorite of the
father<00:00:48.809><c> and</c><00:00:49.079><c> so</c><00:00:49.170><c> Jacob</c><00:00:49.800><c> is</c><00:00:49.920><c> kind</c><00:00:50.160><c> of</c><00:00:50.250><c> a</c>

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 align:start position:0%
father and so Jacob is kind of a
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330 align:start position:0%
father and so Jacob is kind of a
mother's<00:00:51.210><c> boy</c><00:00:51.480><c> I</c><00:00:51.750><c> guess</c><00:00:52.050><c> to</c><00:00:52.199><c> use</c><00:00:52.350><c> an</c><00:00:52.500><c> a</c><00:00:52.680><c> rather</c>
