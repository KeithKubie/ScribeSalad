DAVID HODGE: So what are we
going to be talking about

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.960
today is whether or
not numbers exist.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.590
We're going to be thinking about
three different schools

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.820
of thought on this.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
First one's Platonism, second
one's nominalism, and the last

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.940
one is fictionalism.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.330
So mathematical Platonism takes
its lead from Plato,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.780
obviously, as the
name suggests.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.010
And the idea is that
numbers exist.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.470
They really are things.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.510
They're objects.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.120
But they're abstract objects,
so they don't exist in the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.380
same way that tables
and chairs do in

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.940
space and in time.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.620
Numbers exist outside
space, outside time.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.470
They don't cause other
things to happen.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.920
They're totally abstract
objects.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.080
One of the reasons that people
like mathematical Platonism is

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.090
that we think that a lot of
claims about numbers in

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.240
mathematics are true.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.140
Right, so certainly I think
that things that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.500
mathematicians say are true.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.060
I think that's a good
starting point.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.440
But they say things like
there's a number

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.450
between 6 and 8.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.390
That seems like it's a true
thing, it's the number 7.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.990
And Platonists think that that
means that there must exist an

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.480
object that is the number 7,
even if it's not an object

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.530
that you can touch.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.560
And they appeal to kind of
similar reasoning about the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.120
way that we speak about
the ordinary,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.440
kind of concrete world.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.940
So if I say to you that there's
a nose between two

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.760
eyes, that nose had better exist
for what I say to be

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.270
true, right?

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.500
If there's no nose here, then
what I've said is false.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.670
So in the same kind of way,
right, if there's a number

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.190
between six and eight, that
thing had better exist.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.220
Platonists aren't happy to use a
loose sense of "exist" here,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.740
so they think that exists
just means exists.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.880
And so in the same way that a
table exists, a chair exists,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.220
a number exists.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.590
All the numbers exist,
in fact.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.250
It just so happens that
they're not located

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.040
in space and time.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.020
So it's a difference about
location, rather than whether

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450
or not they exist, or whether
they exist in a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.620
different kind of way.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.630
All sorts of fun problems
with the view.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560
The first of which that you come
across, particularly when

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.060
you start teaching this stuff,
is that's crazy.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.300
So numbers exist outside
space and time?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.080
What does that even
mean, right?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.759
It's really, really hard to kind
of get your head around.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.570
But we can be a bit more refined
than that when we're

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.290
objecting to mathematical
Platonism.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.620
So one of the things that we
said was that mathematical

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.840
claims are true, but that
mathematical claims are

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.380
actually claims about these
abstract objects.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.010
These abstract objects don't
causally interact with us

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.970
because they're abstract.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.970
OK, but we think that
mathematicians

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.480
are massively reliable.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.090
So what they say, pretty much
guaranteed to be true.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.990
If their claims are actually
about these abstract objects,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.910
then it looks like we need some
explanation of how those

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.860
mathematicians so reliably
track that

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.770
world of abstract objects.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.590
So if a mathematician tells you
that 6 times 7 is 42, then

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.645
what he's saying is true.

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:57.410
What they're saying is true.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.340
How is it that they're so
reliably managing to access

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.470
this world of abstract
objects?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.050
Answering that question's
really hard for the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.940
Platonists, because they just
don't think we can interact

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.810
with that world.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.040
Our second theory is
mathematical nominalism.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.280
So what the nominalist
wants to do is

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.640
agree with the Platonist.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.220
That all of our mathematical
claims are true, but that our

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.320
mathematical claims should best
be understood as claims

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.220
about objects in the world.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.240
So tables, chairs, pencils,
those kinds of things.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.400
And to get a kind of bit of
intuition on this kind of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.620
thing, often helps to think
about the way you might teach

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.570
a child to count.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.120
So children don't tend to be
born with these kind of

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.050
abstract principles.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.900
One, two, three, four,
five, six, and so on.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.620
What we tend to do is to say,
like, here's a pencil.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.630
Here's another.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.100
Now you've got two pencils.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.470
And it seems that what we do
when we learn to count is we

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.320
count with respect to a
particular type of objects, or

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.120
to objects in general.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.770
And what the nominalist says is,
well, that's all there is

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.300
to number talk, right?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.350
What you mean when you say 6
times 7 is 42 is that if you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.500
had 6 lots of 7 objects,
you'd have 42 objects.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.000
That's what mathematics
is about.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.640
It's about concrete things
in the world.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.540
This kind of nominalist view
begins to run into trouble

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.540
when we start to think about
more complicated numbers or

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.000
numerical concepts.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.680
So if we start to think about
the square root of minus 1,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.120
for instance, and the imaginary
numbers and so on.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.460
So it's really easy to say 2
plus 2 equals 4 is about these

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.880
2 objects and those 2 objects,
and there being 4 objects.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.800
Much harder to see what object
or thing might be the square

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.100
root of minus 1.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.410
So if you're a mathematical
Platonist, it's really easy.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.370
It's just another number,
just like all the rest.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.990
But if you're a nominalist,
what's the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.720
thing that it's about?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.980
Looks really, really hard to see
what that's going to be.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.780
So pi is also similarly
complex, right?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.240
So if you're a nominalist, it
looks like you're going to

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.610
think that numerical
talk is just talk

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.520
about concrete things.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.100
But of course, pi doesn't seem
to have a precise value, or at

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.260
least we certainly can't
calculate that value.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.820
So there's a real question
for the nominalist here.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.670
How are you going to understand
pi as a thing, or a

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.825
collection of things, when
we can't ever get to that

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:22.330
terminating value?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.000
Our third group in the
philosophy of mathematics is

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.550
the mathematical fictionalist.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.480
So I said at the start that I
think it's a good thing to say

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.130
that what mathematicians
say is true.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.200
And the fictionalist doesn't
quite agree.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.040
So the fictionalist says,
actually, mathematical

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.070
discourse is false.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.720
It's really useful, really
helpful, but it's

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.520
systematically just false.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.780
That's quite an extreme view to
take, given the success of

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.090
science within which mathematics
is embedded, but

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.290
that's the view that
the mathematical

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.330
fictionalist takes.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.570
So the fictionalist says numbers
don't exist, whereas

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.040
the Platonist says numbers are
these existing abstract

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.220
objects, and the nominalist says
mathematical discourse is

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.530
about concrete objects
in the world.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.670
The fictionalist says it's
not about anything.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.680
It's just a useful story that
we've developed to help

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.842
ourselves get on in the world.

00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:20.460
BRADY HARAN: But surely the
mathematical fictionalist uses

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.630
modern communications, is
dependent on satellites.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.850
How do they explain
those things?

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.130
Because obviously they
use numbers.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.395
How do they explain that they're
using something that

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:33.640
they say doesn't exist?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.120
DAVID HODGE: So what the
fictionalist has got to do is

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.940
try and explain away the success
of mathematics and the

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.170
success of science.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.710
But without saying that
mathematical claims are true.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.040
And one strategy that the
fictionalist can deploy around

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.830
here is to say that success in
the world isn't a hallmark of

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.340
truth, or needn't be a
hallmark of truth.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.930
We were talking about modern
communications, technology

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.150
relying on all of this
mathematics.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.945
What the fictionalist will say
is what that indicates is that

00:07:06.945 --> 00:07:08.940
the mathematics is successful.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.850
It doesn't indicate
that it's true.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.110
If it was true, says the
fictionalist, these

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.140
mathematical objects, these
platonic objects that the

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.540
mathematical Platonist thinks
exist, those things

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.050
would have to exist.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.370
But they don't.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.540
And so in fact, our
mathematical

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.580
discourse can't be true.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.300
It can at best be a
useful fiction.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.422
There are appeals that they can
make around here that kind

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:34.390
of help bring out the sort
of thing that they

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.230
might want to do.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.490
Imagine that you thought that
the Bible was a work of

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.640
fiction, for instance.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.670
Some people do, some
people don't.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.870
But you might think it codifies
a really useful set

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.830
of moral principles.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.620
And you might think that there's
no such thing as truth

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.690
and morality.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.110
But you might think as guiding
principles go, these are

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.900
pretty helpful.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.880
They help us get on
in the world.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.140
Don't kill other people.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.840
Help societies develop, which
helps us develop in

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.620
interesting kinds of ways.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.100
The mathematical fictionalist
might say very similar things

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.760
about the language
of mathematics.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.680
Helps us get on, but that it
helps us to get on doesn't

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.000
mean that it's true.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.960
BRADY HARAN: Where do you
stand on all this?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.080
You've very neutrally given
me the three positions.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.780
Is there one that resonates
with you?

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.860
DAVID HODGE: So the view that
resonates with me the most, I

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.940
guess, is mathematical
nominalism.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.820
So I don't think that there
are abstract objects.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.560
I don't think that there
are numbers.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.350
I think that it's too much of
a stretch to think that

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.150
mathematics is false.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.669
My colleagues in the math
department will, I'm sure, be

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.020
delighted by this.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.080
So I adopt the middle ground,
what I take to be the middle

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.150
ground, anyway, which is
a kind of mathematical

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.580
nominalism.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.630
BRADY HARAN: You were telling
me that the nominalist runs

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.460
into problems with some of
these more spectacular

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.290
irrational numbers.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.150
Do you run into problem
with those numbers?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.310
DAVID HODGE: Yes, that means
that I inherit all of the

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.340
problems that the mathematical
nominalist faces.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.940
The kind of move that I like
to make around here with

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.390
respect to pi is to say that
whenever we actually calculate

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.630
with it, when we're using it
mechanically, if you like,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.780
what we're doing is we're using
a best approximation.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.250
Now, that's a spectacularly
accurate, well, it's a

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.340
spectacularly long
approximation, anyway.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.950
I really shouldn't say it's
accurate, because I don't

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.820
think it maps to a
platonic ideal.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.580
But it's a spectacularly long
and very useful approximation.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.700
But I don't think there's
anything other than that

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.620
endless sequence, I guess.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.150
And of course, you can derive
that perfectly acceptably.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.010
I think the reason that
philosophers get into the

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.250
philosophy of mathematics, one
of the reasons, anyway, is

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.920
precisely because there
are so many things to

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.020
philosophize about.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.780
It's another thing for us
to get excited about and

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.560
interested in.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.190
The grand tradition of thinking
about numbers, it

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.020
goes right back to
Plato, hence the

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.070
mathematical Platonism.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.360
And so people just get excited
and interested in it, I think.
