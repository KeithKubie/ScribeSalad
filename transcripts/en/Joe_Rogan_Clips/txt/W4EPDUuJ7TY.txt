Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. When you think about the future? Uh, at least me though one, let me tell you my concern. Yeah. I'm worried that rich people are going to get a hold of this technology quick and they're going to have massive unfair advantages in terms of intellect, in terms of physical, athletic ability, all, I mean we, we really can have a grossly imbalanced world radically quickly if this happens fast, when we don't understand exactly what the consequences of these actions are until it's too late. And then we'd try to play catch up with rules and regulations and laws. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:36          that's a very, very real danger. And that's why I've written this book. That's why I'm out speaking everyday about this, this topic because we need to recognize that if we have, if we approach these revolutionary technologies using the same values that we experience today where, you know, we're here and very comfortable, but just down the road there are people who are just, who are living without many opportunities. There are people in parts of the world like Central African Republic where there's just a warzone kids are born malnourished. Um, if those are our values today, we can expect that when these future technologies arrive, we'll use those, those same values. So it's real. And right now we have an opportunity to say, all right, these technologies are coming whenever we do these technologies that are coming, there's a better possible future and a worst possible future. And how can we infuse our best values into the process to optimize the good stuff and minimize the bad stuff. And certainly what you're saying is a real risk thing of what happened when European countries had slightly better weapons and slightly better ships than everybody else. They took over the world and dominated everybody. And so, yeah, that's very real. That's the government's need to play a role in ensuring broad access in regulating these, uh, these technologies to make sure we don't get to that kind of dystopian scenario that you've laid down. Well, it's also

Speaker 1:          01:57          in terms of governments regulating things, like why are they qualified? Who are they? Who are the governments? So just people, right? It's people that are either elected or the, uh, you know, or, yeah, some sort of a monarchy earn. You're, you're dealing with either kings and queens and sheikhs or you're dealing with presidents. And we've seen in this country that sometimes our presidents don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Right? So who are they to disrupt science to s to disrupt this natural flow of technology?

Speaker 2:          02:26          Well, we decide we need somebody to do it. We need some representation of our collective will, but just to avoid some of the things, like you're just like you just mentioned that that's the reason why humans banded together and made these kinds of, the of made created governments. And the reason for democracy, especially if you have more functioning democracies, is that your government in some ways reflects the will of the people in the government does things that individuals can't do. And I know there are a leather libertarian arguments. Well everyone should just like, if you want a little road in front of your house, either go build the road and pay some somebody. But there are a lot of things in, even in that model that won't get done. There are a lot of kind of big national and even global concerns that you need some kind of, uh, of regulation because what we're talking about is the future of life and life on earth.

Speaker 2:          03:16          And there have to be some kind of guardrails. And that's why what I'm arguing for is we really need a bottom up. And I think we every person, and that's why I'm so thrilled to be here with you today, Joe. Every person needs to really understand these revolutionary technologies like genetics, like AI and all of our responsibilities and opportunities to say, hey, this is really important. Here are the values that I think that, uh, that I cherish. And just like you said, I don't want it to be that the wealthiest people are the ones who have kids with higher iqs and live longer and healthier than, than everybody else. And then, so we have to raise our voice and our needs to be a bottom up process and a, in a top down process. And it's re it's really hard.
