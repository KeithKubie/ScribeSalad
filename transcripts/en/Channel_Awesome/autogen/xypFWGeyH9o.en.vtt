clever it were it just works

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.250
clever it were it just works
 

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.480
clever it were it just works
um yeah I think that's the idea behind

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.490

it would work but at what cost no it
wouldn't work and the costs are

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520
wouldn't work and the costs are
 

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.210
wouldn't work and the costs are
incredibly obvious that no one would

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220
