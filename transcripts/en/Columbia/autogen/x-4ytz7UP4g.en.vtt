make a few comments about the paradoxes
 

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.720
make a few comments about the paradoxes
underlying the patterns of cooperation

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:07.730
underlying the patterns of cooperation

there's clearly one that is different is

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880
there's clearly one that is different is
 

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.090
there's clearly one that is different is
much more important as much more weight

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.100
much more important as much more weight
 

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.820
much more important as much more weight
and and a whole different role in the

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:42.830
and and a whole different role in the
 

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.560
and and a whole different role in the
region than the others and that is

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:44.570
region than the others and that is
 

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.620
region than the others and that is
russia and that is very clear if you

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:47.630
russia and that is very clear if you
 

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.730
russia and that is very clear if you
look at the

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:48.740
look at the
 

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.310
look at the
bilateral relations between EU Member

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320
bilateral relations between EU Member
 

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.890

States and Russia but somehow the EU

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:53.900

regional policy conceived in Brussels

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320
regional policy conceived in Brussels
 

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.360
regional policy conceived in Brussels
was followed a rationale that somehow

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:00.370
was followed a rationale that somehow
 

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.080
was followed a rationale that somehow
Russia didn't really matter or existed

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.090
Russia didn't really matter or existed
 

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.970
Russia didn't really matter or existed
so really there is really a greedy

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:06.980
so really there is really a greedy
 

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.980
so really there is really a greedy
failure to recognize Russia as a

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:08.990

regional power in in Europe's own
 

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.610
regional power in in Europe's own
neighborhood and so also lack of

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:15.620
neighborhood and so also lack of
 

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.919
neighborhood and so also lack of
coherence is in treating it as such and

00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:17.929
coherence is in treating it as such and
 

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:21.460
coherence is in treating it as such and
so that is clearly a strategic fela more

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.470
so that is clearly a strategic fela more
 

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.940
so that is clearly a strategic fela more
specifically in terms of the regional

this neighbourhood policy and what it
 

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.210
this neighbourhood policy and what it
offered what we have seen is that

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:30.220
offered what we have seen is that
 

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.280

of institutional expertise it was

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.050

largely modeled on the enlargement

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:40.910

never really the membership offer on the

never really the membership offer on the
 

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.750
never really the membership offer on the

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.280

that was similar to the one in

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:06.290
that was similar to the one in
 

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.180
that was similar to the one in
enlargement but so it was offered in

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:10.190
enlargement but so it was offered in
 

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.780

might not probably be the most
 

00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:50.139
might not probably be the most
beneficial in the long term but they

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:50.149
beneficial in the long term but they

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440
region and this brings me to the
 

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.930
region and this brings me to the
question of the confrontation in the

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:55.940
question of the confrontation in the
 

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.060
question of the confrontation in the
neighborhood which is increasingly the

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:58.070
neighborhood which is increasingly the
 

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:02.320
neighborhood which is increasingly the
name of the game and we can see probably

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:02.330
name of the game and we can see probably
 

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.710
name of the game and we can see probably
a bit less in the US but this is

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720
a bit less in the US but this is
 

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.510
a bit less in the US but this is
extremely important in Europe that the

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520
extremely important in Europe that the
 

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.970
extremely important in Europe that the
current crisis is increasingly being

current crisis is increasingly being

the implications of this new threat but

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:35.570
the implications of this new threat but
 

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.300
the implications of this new threat but
it's what's important is that we're

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:37.310
it's what's important is that we're
 

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.000
it's what's important is that we're
really the debate is increasingly moving

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.010
really the debate is increasingly moving
 

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.540
really the debate is increasingly moving
towards this new discussion of Russia as

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:43.550
towards this new discussion of Russia as
 

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.330
towards this new discussion of Russia as
a security threat clearly Russia has

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:46.340
a security threat clearly Russia has
 

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.320
a security threat clearly Russia has
done a lot to to actually promote those

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.330
done a lot to to actually promote those
 

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.560
done a lot to to actually promote those
kinds of that kind of debate and those

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.570
kinds of that kind of debate and those
 

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.870
kinds of that kind of debate and those
kinds of discussions with his DS but I

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880
kinds of discussions with his DS but I
 

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.310
kinds of discussions with his DS but I
would argue also a lot with its

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:57.320
would argue also a lot with its
 

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.260
would argue also a lot with its
particular positioning with this

00:36:59.260 --> 00:36:59.270
particular positioning with this
 

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.930
particular positioning with this

particular rhetoric on the international
 

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.210
particular rhetoric on the international
arena we have to give credit to the

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.220
arena we have to give credit to the
 

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.390
arena we have to give credit to the
transatlantic community that tried to

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400
transatlantic community that tried to
 

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.290
transatlantic community that tried to
smoothen the terms of the debate

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:08.300
smoothen the terms of the debate
 

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.740

um settlements at least in the beginning
 

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.340
um settlements at least in the beginning
before it got really too difficult to to

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:17.350
before it got really too difficult to to
 

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.850
before it got really too difficult to to
be trying to seek a compromise but what

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:20.860
be trying to seek a compromise but what
 

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.350
be trying to seek a compromise but what
I would like to highlight here are the

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:22.360
I would like to highlight here are the
 

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.670
I would like to highlight here are the
implications of the fact that the

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680
implications of the fact that the
 

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.330
implications of the fact that the
discussion got so securitized and I

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:27.340
discussion got so securitized and I
 

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.970
discussion got so securitized and I
think the first one is that the more we

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:29.980
think the first one is that the more we
 

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.060
think the first one is that the more we
discuss the modern securitize the

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.070
discuss the modern securitize the
 

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.530
discuss the modern securitize the
discussion is the more it actually

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:34.540
discussion is the more it actually
 

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.530
discussion is the more it actually

benefits the status quo in the Eastern

Easter neighborhood at the moment what

Easter neighborhood at the moment what
 

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.040
Easter neighborhood at the moment what
we mean is limited sovereignty

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.050
we mean is limited sovereignty
 

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.050
we mean is limited sovereignty

states throughout the region Ukraine is
clearly a new horrifying example but we

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.150
clearly a new horrifying example but we
 

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.520
clearly a new horrifying example but we
actually have a whole pattern throughout

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:53.530
actually have a whole pattern throughout

the region we have Moldova with its
 

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:59.190
the region we have Moldova with its
frozen conflict zone we have the

00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200
frozen conflict zone we have the
 

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.750
frozen conflict zone we have the
situation in georgia with South Ossetia

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760
situation in georgia with South Ossetia
 

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.390

we have the escalation of conflict

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400
we have the escalation of conflict
 

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.730
we have the escalation of conflict

Asia that might just as well erupt as we

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:13.780
Asia that might just as well erupt as we
 

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.410
Asia that might just as well erupt as we
are speaking and what that means is

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:16.420
are speaking and what that means is
 

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.900
are speaking and what that means is
basically that as the security stakes go

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:18.910
basically that as the security stakes go
 

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.170
basically that as the security stakes go
up for for the region and by implication

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:22.180
up for for the region and by implication
 

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.240
up for for the region and by implication
also for the neighbors for the European

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.250
also for the neighbors for the European
 

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:27.870

Union the focus of engagement individual

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880
Union the focus of engagement individual
 

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.360
Union the focus of engagement individual
shifts towards containment the

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:30.370
shifts towards containment the
 

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:33.660
shifts towards containment the
escalation quick as possible settlements

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:33.670
escalation quick as possible settlements

escalation quick as possible settlements
of really tense situations and

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880
of really tense situations and
 

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.800
of really tense situations and
inevitably it moves away from addressing

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:40.810
inevitably it moves away from addressing
 

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.240
inevitably it moves away from addressing
the structural causes of these problems

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.250
the structural causes of these problems
 

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:48.000
the structural causes of these problems
and of the crisis itself and so I think

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.010
and of the crisis itself and so I think
 

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.320
and of the crisis itself and so I think
this is something that's being

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:49.330
this is something that's being
 

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.850
this is something that's being
overlooked really in this discussion is

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:50.860
overlooked really in this discussion is
 

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.870
overlooked really in this discussion is
that although the crisis may have been

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880
that although the crisis may have been
 

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.930
that although the crisis may have been
triggered by this new geopolitical

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940
triggered by this new geopolitical
 

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.990
triggered by this new geopolitical
rivalry if we look at the domestic

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000
rivalry if we look at the domestic
 

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.510
rivalry if we look at the domestic
stakeholders in the conflict in Ukraine

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520
stakeholders in the conflict in Ukraine
 

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.060
stakeholders in the conflict in Ukraine
in Russia throughout the region if we

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:06.070
in Russia throughout the region if we
 

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.910
in Russia throughout the region if we
look at the kind of really possible ways

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920
look at the kind of really possible ways
 

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.650
look at the kind of really possible ways
of addressing this issue really in the

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:10.660
of addressing this issue really in the
 

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.360
of addressing this issue really in the
longer term as opposed to just sort of

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.370
longer term as opposed to just sort of
 

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.980
longer term as opposed to just sort of
making sure there's a ceasefire that

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:13.990
making sure there's a ceasefire that
 

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.680
making sure there's a ceasefire that
holds all of that is obviously

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:16.690
holds all of that is obviously
 

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.480
holds all of that is obviously
completely off the table now because of

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.490
completely off the table now because of
 

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.130
completely off the table now because of
the securitisation of the whole problem

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:21.140
the securitisation of the whole problem
 

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.839
the securitisation of the whole problem
and that clearly benefits the model of

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:22.849
and that clearly benefits the model of
 

00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:25.809
and that clearly benefits the model of
Russian regional governance and it also

00:39:25.809 --> 00:39:25.819
Russian regional governance and it also
 

00:39:25.819 --> 00:39:27.759
Russian regional governance and it also
fits with its own model of development I

00:39:27.759 --> 00:39:27.769
fits with its own model of development I
 

00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:30.940
fits with its own model of development I
mean Russia itself is a corrupt and and

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:30.950
mean Russia itself is a corrupt and and
 

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.039
mean Russia itself is a corrupt and and
in many ways this dysfunctional state

00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:33.049
in many ways this dysfunctional state
 

00:39:33.049 --> 00:39:35.769
in many ways this dysfunctional state
and so you know sort of fits with its

00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:35.779
and so you know sort of fits with its
 

00:39:35.779 --> 00:39:40.299
and so you know sort of fits with its
preferred governance pattern and it so

00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:40.309
preferred governance pattern and it so
 

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:42.370
preferred governance pattern and it so
what has happened I would argue is that

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:42.380
what has happened I would argue is that
 

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.150
what has happened I would argue is that
the the crisis in Ukraine reframed the

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160
the the crisis in Ukraine reframed the
 

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.730
the the crisis in Ukraine reframed the
broader policy in the region from one of

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:47.740
broader policy in the region from one of
 

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.259
broader policy in the region from one of
cooperation to to the one of throws

00:39:50.259 --> 00:39:50.269
cooperation to to the one of throws
 

00:39:50.269 --> 00:39:53.349
cooperation to to the one of throws
threat containment and so what does that

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359
threat containment and so what does that
 

00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:56.109
threat containment and so what does that
mean really to just to tie quickly the

00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119
mean really to just to tie quickly the
 

00:39:56.119 --> 00:39:59.079
mean really to just to tie quickly the
discussion to the questions of you know

00:39:59.079 --> 00:39:59.089
discussion to the questions of you know
 

00:39:59.089 --> 00:40:00.910

which was much more normatively charged

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:37.910
which was much more normatively charged
 

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.279
which was much more normatively charged
much more proactive and much more

00:40:39.279 --> 00:40:39.289
much more proactive and much more
 

00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:40.630
much more proactive and much more
interventionist even if you like a

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640

certain model of governance and the

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:48.980

structural changes that go with it and
so I think the bigger question that we

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:52.670
so I think the bigger question that we
 

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.170
so I think the bigger question that we
really have to be thinking about as we

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:56.180
really have to be thinking about as we
 

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.519

neighborhood is really will the new

00:41:00.549 --> 00:41:00.559

neighbourhood policy be about the former

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:02.329
neighbourhood policy be about the former
 

00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:04.059
neighbourhood policy be about the former
or the latter isn't really about

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:04.069
or the latter isn't really about
 

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:05.920
or the latter isn't really about
pragmatic threat containment or is it

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:05.930
pragmatic threat containment or is it
 

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:10.690
pragmatic threat containment or is it
still about a more more different kind

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:10.700
still about a more more different kind
 

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.150
still about a more more different kind
of engagement and if a different kind of

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160
of engagement and if a different kind of
 

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.519
of engagement and if a different kind of
engagement is still on the table how

00:41:15.519 --> 00:41:15.529
engagement is still on the table how
 

00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:18.220

then can we pursue it in a credible and

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.230
then can we pursue it in a credible and
 

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.740
then can we pursue it in a credible and
effective manner given the recent

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:20.750
effective manner given the recent
 

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:34.900

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:11.170
ice thinking that over your back you
 

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.509
ice thinking that over your back you
know and I was referring really to the

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:12.519
know and I was referring really to the
 

01:05:12.519 --> 01:05:14.160

I think these two things have to be
brought together on the table for us to

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:32.930
brought together on the table for us to
 

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:36.010
brought together on the table for us to

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:46.730
jacket and Cynthia and but I wonder
 

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.599
jacket and Cynthia and but I wonder
whether the division of the world into

01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:49.609
whether the division of the world into
 

01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:51.579
whether the division of the world into
countries which are liberal on the one

01:05:51.579 --> 01:05:51.589
countries which are liberal on the one
 

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:53.800
countries which are liberal on the one
side and a liberal on the other you know

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:53.810
side and a liberal on the other you know
 

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.170
side and a liberal on the other you know
is the end of the story you know their

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:56.180
is the end of the story you know their
 

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.819
is the end of the story you know their
countries where we know that rotten

apples constitute half of the country
 

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.660
apples constitute half of the country
and these countries are basically

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:01.670
and these countries are basically
 

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:04.569
and these countries are basically
irredeemable and therefore who are we

01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:04.579
irredeemable and therefore who are we
 

01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:06.670
irredeemable and therefore who are we
trying to kid in believing that we can

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.640
trying to kid in believing that we can
in some way extend aspects of a more
