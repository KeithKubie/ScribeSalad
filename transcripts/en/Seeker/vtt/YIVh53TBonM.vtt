00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.430
This week NASA held a live event to reveal
it’s latest findings about Enceladus, one

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.980
of Saturn’s moons.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.360
Scientists announced that the Cassini space
probe has detected hydrogen gas coming from

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.089
cracks in the icy crust, indicating that the
moon’s subsurface oceans might be able to,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.960
dramatic pause… support life as we know
it.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.040
Finding hydrogen is a big deal because, it’s
a chemical we think is essential for life

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.190
to form, the other’s being carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.250
We have now detected all of those on Enceladus
except phosphorus and sulfur, but we suspect

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.129
those elements are present in its rocky core
as well.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.470
To detect the hydrogen, Cassini passed through
a plume of mostly water vapor coming out of

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.899
the cracks - or “tiger stripes”- in Enceladus’s
ice crust.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.589
Enceladus is too small to keep hydrogen in
its atmosphere, so the hydrogen must have

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.940
come from the ocean inside the crust.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.109
The plumes of vapor spring up above hot spots,
indicating that hydrothermal activity exists

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.600
on Enceladus’s seafloor.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.149
Again, this is kind of a big deal because
of what we know of our own planet.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.829
Hydrothermal activity occurs on Earth where
water seeps into the seafloor and is heated

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.120
by magma.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.550
The heated and mineral-rich water bursts back
through the seafloor and amazingly, ecosystems

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.740
tend spring up.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.240
Instead of using the sun’s light to sustain
them, the organisms around these vents rely

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.790
on the heat and chemicals for their energy.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.630
NASA’s scientists speculated that something
similar could be going on around Enceladus’s

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.630
hydrothermal vents.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.110
Using a process called “methanogenesis,”
potential life forms could combine the hydrogen,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.980
we now know is on Enceladus, with carbon dioxide
to produce energy, with methane as a byproduct.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.970
Methanogenesis is at the root of our tree
of life, and may have even been critical for

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.730
life on Earth to get its start.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.250
One NASA scientist was quick to point out
though that Enceladus might be too young to

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.570
have given life enough time to form.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.170
The conditions could be right, but nobody’s
home yet.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.770
If there is life down there, Cassini won’t
be going to find out.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.670
Partly because it was never equipped to detect
life in the first place, frankly NASA didn’t

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.570
expect to find so many indicators that Enceladus
could support it.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.040
The plan is to intentionally crush and vaporize
Cassini using Saturn’s atmosphere to ensure

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.750
it doesn’t crash into Enceladus or Titan
and contaminate any life forms that might

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.750
be living there.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.950
Cassini’s Grand Finale is scheduled for
September of this year, one month shy of 20

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.060
years in space.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.370
NASA’s next mission to an ice world will
be be the Europa Clipper in the 2020s.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.770
The Clipper mission will study Jupiter’s
moon Europa, another ice word with plumes

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.170
of vapor rising above it.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.660
At over 4 billion years old, Europa is much
older than Enceladus, and some at NASA believe

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.030
that extra time makes it a more likely candidate
for supporting life.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.283
We’re just going to have to go there and
find out.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.283
