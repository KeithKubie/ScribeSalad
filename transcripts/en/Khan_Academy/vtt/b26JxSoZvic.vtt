00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.865
- Lets think about what three divided

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.032
by one fourth is equal to.

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.253
Pause this video and see if you can

00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:09.962
figure it out on your own.

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.721
And I'll give you a
hint, take three wholes

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.401
and divide it into pieces
or sections that are each

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.522
one fourth of a whole and then think

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:21.609
about how many sections you have.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.511
Alright now lets work
through this together.

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.681
Now let me draw three wholes.

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.840
And so lets say this is...

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.879
I'm gonna hand draw it, so
its not gonna be perfect.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.603
But lets say that is one
whole right over there.

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.603
This is two wholes right over there.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:42.045
And then I have my third
whole just like that.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.395
And now I'm going to divide it into pieces

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:48.295
or sections that are each
one fourth of a whole.

00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:51.128
So this first whole is four pieces

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:56.345
that are each one fourth
each, of four fourths.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:00.495
And then I have another four
fourths right over here.

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:04.355
And then I have another four
fourths right over here.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.655
Another way to think about
it, I took the three wholes,

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:08.682
and I divided it into fourths.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.345
So if you divide it into fourths how

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.630
many pieces am I going to have?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.244
Well this is pretty straight
forward, you have one

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:19.411
two three four five six seven
eight nine ten 11 12 pieces.

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:26.659
And I didn't even have to count that,

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.982
each whole is gonna be four fourths.

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:33.071
So three wholes is going to
be three times four fourths,

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:35.404
or 12 pieces or 12 sections.

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.632
So that is going to be equal to 12.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.589
Another way to think about
it is if you take three

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:46.058
and you divide it into equal
sections that are each a fourth

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:49.391
you are going to have 12 equal sections.
