00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.839
There's a lot of things that we can tell

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.040
you that we can't do anything about. For example, we

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.360
can tell you, you have a susceptibility for breast

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.470
cancer. But, can't tell you if you're going to get it.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.180
We could tell you, per chance, that you have

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.820
a genetic predisposition for Huntington's Disease. And can't really do

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.740
much about that either. Would you want to know if

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.172
you had a genetic disorder that is incurable or would

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:28.527
you rather not know. The 23andMe website to find

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.827
out certain information you have to opt in, you have

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:36.252
to do like a double opt in and they kind of go, are you sure want to know eh

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:39.252
where do you guys follow on these categories and

00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:42.356
Ginny, I'll start with you. I mean you sort of

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:45.646
mentioned the hazards previously, I mean, do you want

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:48.827
to know if you have an incurable disease or disorder.

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:50.207
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of cancer

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:54.761
in my family and because of that I, I assume that there's a greater chance

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:58.890
of me having cancer. And I guess, guess I would want to know if it were

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.150
a lethal situation. I would want to know,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.690
not only to advocate and, and, and prepare

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.850
but to also prepare for death, and my

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.360
children. And, and everything that comes with that.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.160
&gt;&gt; I think that if

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.110
I could take an action, I'd want to know. But I wouldn't

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.300
want to know that when I left the house. Today, that I was,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.890
a car was going to cross the median line and hit me head

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.990
on and maybe I wouldn't leave the house, maybe that's something I could

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.060
[LAUGH].

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270
&gt;&gt; It's one of those, sort of, paradoxes.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
&gt;&gt; Right, for my genetic situation, I can do something

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.620
with that. So I do, I was happy to know.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.200
&gt;&gt; And in your case what, what did you do?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.220
&gt;&gt; Well for me finding out that I had

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.400
the BRCA2 mutation I immediately contacted the breast oncologist

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.259
to refer me to a genetic counselor.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.020
The test was from 23andMe, and they

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.880
verified the test with another lab, just to be sure. And it was confirmed.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.500
And the recommendation was to have an Oophorectomy.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.230
&gt;&gt; That's when they remove your ovaries, right?

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.088
&gt;&gt; That's when they remove your ovaries.

00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:32.190
And there's not that great a risk for ovarian cancer but it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.470
significant, and I did that. And the other recommendation is to,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.290
see the breast oncologist twice a year for breast exam and to also have a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.890
breast MRI and a mammogram. Once a year, and so, I'm taking that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.630
action, and I'm hoping that at my age

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.990
of 70, that I can beat it.
