00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.200
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: So, I'm so glad
to be here today on this rainy day

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.510
to celebrate a spectacular voice
in teen literature, Sabaa Tahir.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.780
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.030 position:56%
This is actually great because after
every sentence everybody applauds.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.930
[Laughs] Sabaa is also a
former Washington Post editor.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.180
And in her job at the post
she says she learned much

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.510
about the high stakes
politics around the world

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.160 position:56%
that surfaces in her fantasy novels.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.380
Sabaa grew up in the Mojave Desert.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.000
And her parents are both
immigrants from Pakistan.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.020
This has also led her to be
an advocate for diverse voices

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.860
in young people's literature.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.170
And we thank her for her advocacy.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.270
Sabaa's first novel, "An Ember

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.720
in the Ashes" was an
immediate bestselling success.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.010
The novel's setting
inspired by ancient Rome,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.910
an intricate plot grabbed
readers around the world.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.100
We closed that book wondering what
would happen to the slave girl,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.340
Laia, and the young soldier, Elias?

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.890
The next book in the Ember
series came out last year.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.090 position:56%
Critics praised "A Torch Against the
Night" as compelling and complex.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.260 position:56%
Sabaa's many readers can hardly wait

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.160
for the third book "A
Reaper at the Gates."

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.130
It comes out this spring.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.100
We are lucky to have Sabaa Tahir

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.250
as both an author and
an advocate today.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.610
She'll be signing her
books from noon to 1 p.m.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.510
And please join me
in welcoming Sabaa.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:17.470
[ Applause ]

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.770
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Wow, I was nervous.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.070
But I'm not nervous any more.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.750
You guys are awesome.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.110
Thank you for being here today.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.620
I'm really happy to .

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.530
. . hold on.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.680
Clicker. I'm really happy to be
in D.C. and talk about myself

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740
for the next 20 minutes or so.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.620
No, I'll talk about my books, too.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.230
And also my childhood.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.230
I'm not that selfish.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.330
So, I'm going to.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.630
. . Sorry.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.930
Okay, yes.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.730
So, I'm going to talk
about something very near

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.660
and dear to my heart today.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.240
It's been one of my constant
companions since I was a young Ba,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.870
who first entered school long ago.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.550
I'm going to talk about
my old friend, failure.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.220
So, I started failing young.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.930
I still remember my very
first instance of failure.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.410
This is me.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.710
And speaking of failure.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.170
And this is a little off topic.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.110
But let's talk about the haircut.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.480
I feel like every South Asian mom

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.470 position:56%
in the world has given their
daughter this haircut at some point.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.970
And I think they all
get together in a room.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.430
And they're drinking Chia.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.120
And they're like what
can we do to make sure

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.200
that our daughters
have no self-esteem.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.220
So, they never talk to a boy.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.030
Ever. I know.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.000
Let's give them like 16th
century pageboy haircut.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.440
When they're five or six.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.740
That'll do it.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.040
It worked by the way.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.340
Thanks, Mom.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.580
Anyway, I was in first grade and
I got a D on a spelling test.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.450
My parents lost it.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.760
Pandemonium.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.360
Like a child of my father's
getting a D. It did not matter

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.910
that I was six.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.350
This was like the shame
of the household.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.890
I was busted.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.220
And I got this big
speech from my parents.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.520
About how I had to
work twice as hard.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.390
I mean, everything, I
got put on lockdown.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.400
Right? No Barbies.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.700
No playdates.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.700
No super soakers with my
bro in the hot desert sun.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.490
It was like spelling
morning, noon, and night.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.790
No roller skates.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.100
They were like, no, you
can't do any of that.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.360
So, it was spelling morning, noon,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.750
and night until I was
a master at it.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.360
I remember sulking in the room that
I shared with my Mom and my Dad.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.670
And wondering what is the big deal?

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.080
Even as a six-year-old, I
knew I was a six years old.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.320
And I was like this is not
the end of the world, guys.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.420
My parents didn't see it that way.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.780
That didn't want the taint
of failure in the house.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.720
So, very young I learned, not just
to hate failure, but to fear it.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.600
Fearing it sadly did not
stop it from happening.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.100
Sometimes, I think, the more
afraid that you are of something,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.730
the more likely it is to
come knocking at your door.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.920
It's sort of like of when I was
allergic to my brother's cat,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.220
it would always come and sit on me.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.520
Like it knew.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.590
It hated everyone else but
it knew I was allergic to it.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.950 position:56%
So, it would come and sit on my lap.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.020
I failed at many more
spelling tests.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.500
And math. God, math.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.940
This is me and math.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.830
And that's not an exaggeration.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.410
Just out of curiosity.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.140
How many of you guys
like enjoy math?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.440
How many of you are math people?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.740
I don't understand you.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.220
I'm sorry.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.550
I just, never going to get it.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.090
Anyway. As I got older,
I started fearing failure

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.780
as much as my parents did.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.140
Because the cost was higher.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.430
If I failed a test in high
school it affected my grades.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.200
And that affected my chance
of getting into college.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.930
And I lived in this
really small town

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.720
and I wanted nothing
more than to leave.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.020
So, I got to the point where
one failure, at one thing,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.410
would sort of send me
into a spiral of doubt.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.290
If I failed at a test.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.920
If I, you know, let a friend down.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.220
If I screwed something up.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.520
If I was late to something.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.360
I would kind of get
worked into a frenzy.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.700
And at this point, I wasn't
learning from my failures.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.310
I just wanted to avoid them.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.420
And I never examined my failures.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.780
I didn't forgive myself for them.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.890
I just got really,
really, angry at myself.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.810
And I hated myself.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.650
And my self-esteem just tanked.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.920 position:56%
Some of these by the way, like don't
relate to what to what I'm saying.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.220
I just thought they were funny.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.520
So, this is one of them.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.360
Oh, it's Calvin and
Hobbs, I'll put that up.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.680
That'll be great.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.500
So, I personified failure
in my head.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.270
It became a capital F.
And I could hear her.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.570
She was like a person.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.870
I could her murmuring in my ear.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.900
And she was telling
me how much I sucked.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.050
And how bad I was at everything.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.950
I'm going to explain
this in just a second.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.480
So, this whole thing
continued until college.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.740
And through my very, very
first summer internship,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.040
which was at the Washington Post.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.170
I was 21 years old.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.480
And I went into it
like really excited.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.590
And I failed so much that summer.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.780
It was spectacular.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.590
I was a copy editor.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.310 position:56%
So, I was supposed to write
headlines on the international desk.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.220
And I screwed them up all the time.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.860
I insulted reporters, accidentally.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.740
I flouted like Washington
Post grammar style.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.640 position:56%
I remember one time there was a
report who was like a real big shot.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.010
And he was calling from Iraq.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.040
And he was filing from the back
of a truck and I hung up on him.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.340
On accident.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.390
And he couldn't get back on
the sat phone to call us.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.140
And I was like, Blah.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.780
And I think my finest moment was
actually when I spelled Colombia,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.150
the country, as Columbia
the University.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.680
And it was in headline
on the front page.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.000
But thank God there was
a proofer who saved me

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.340
from that particular humiliation.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.090
And I didn't have like
one of those really,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.630 position:56%
like fluffy, like sweet nice bosses.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.200
Who was like let me guide you
through your first internship.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.620
No, no, no.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.940
No. He was like a hard ass.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.480
And he was going to make sure
that I, but also everyone

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.390
in the immediate vicinity,
knew when I had failed.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.950
He had a very penetrating voice.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.720
So, failure like usual
started talking to me again.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.500
And telling me how terrible I was.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.150
And, again, my self-esteem
took this real hit.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.250
I would call my Mom
every day that summer.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.970
And I would wail to her
about how I didn't belong

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.480
at the Washington Post.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.070
And she would listen to me
and she would like pet me,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.370
you know, over the phone.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.670
And be like, it's going to be okay.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.970
It's going to be okay.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.270
Pull it together.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.890
Right? So, I started realizing,
really quickly, that if I wanted

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.020
to continue to work at the finest
news organization in the world,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.680
I did not have time to listen
to that voice inside of my head.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.140
Telling me that I was the worst.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.770
I did not have time to give it any
attention because I didn't want

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.670
to be thrown out onto the street
outside the Washington Post.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.600
I couldn't sit there and wallow
in how much I sucked, frankly.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.870
So, I was going to have
to learn from my failure.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.380
But not just learn from it.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.570
I was going to have to get
very comfortable with failure.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.780
Because I would be failing
again, and again, and again.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.030
And I could not let
that voice cripple me

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.630
and leave me in a spiral of doubt.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.630 position:56%
I couldn't let that voice take over.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:17.750
So, I started the very, very, very
uncomfortable process of starting

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.660
to think about why I had failed.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.350
It was the only way to survive.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.350
So, when I messed up a
headline, I started writing

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.650
down what was wrong with it.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.490
And when I took on too much and
got yelled for not turning it

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.490
in on time, I started writing
down, don't take on too much.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.340
And slowly, failure became
not an enemy but a teacher.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.450
And it was one of the
longest summers of my life.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.230
When I got to the end,
I was pretty sure

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.140
that my boss would either
completely ignore me

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.250
and be like, please, leave.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.250
Or that he would just walk
over and say, you know,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.330
it was interesting having
you here and good luck

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.020
in your career as something else.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.970
But instead, something
very strange happened.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.270
I sat in the newsroom.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.860
I was kind of in the
center of the newsroom.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.180
And there were all these
reporters and editors around.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.720
And some of them were
these huge names.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.020
And they had won Pulitzer Prizes

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.180
and they had movies
based off their books.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.690
A few of them started coming over.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.610
And they were like, hey, you
know, you did a really good job.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.440
And I was like .

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.740
. . were you .

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.040
. . are you talking
about the same person?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.970
Do I have a twin in the room
who knows what she's doing?

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.270
But they were like, no, no, no.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.950
We heard. We saw.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.250
But you learned.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.550
And you got better.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.940
And then low, my boss comes over.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.320
And tells me that he
would love for me to apply

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.770
for another internship
the next year.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.240
Because he wanted me to come back.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.070 position:56%
So, that he could work with me again
and hopefully, hire me one day.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.300 position:56%
And that was the first time, in my
life, that I had failed so miserably

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.260
and I did not hate myself for it.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.560
Which was good.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.370
Because a few years later I
would fail spectacularly, again,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.730
and I would need to
remember that lesson.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.280
So, fast forward to 2007.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.330
Through the very, very
cunning use of the dark arts,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.050
I procured a job at
the Washington Post.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.350
No, I'm kidding.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.760
I didn't use dark arts, I just
bribed them with chocolate.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.410
Lots of it.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.650
But I had been working this
night job as a copy editor.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.570
And I'd been reading
all sorts of stories

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.300
about child soldiers and genocide.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.720
And terrible things
happening in the world.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.090
And I read this one.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.700 position:56%
And this is a story by Emily Wax,
who is still a reporter at the Post.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.250 position:56%
And it is about women in Kashmir and
how their families, their brothers,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.670
fathers, sons were taken

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.010
by the local military
and thrown into prison.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.080
And sometimes they were
given no reason why.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.400
They couldn't get their
family members out.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.900
And they were kind of stuck living

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.500
in this half world while
that was happening.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.690
And I remember this
story haunted me.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.990
Because I have brothers.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.120
And I was like, what if
that happened to them.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.970
This is not out of the
realm of possibility.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.270
What if I lived in that place.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.790
And I couldn't get this
story out of my head.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.250 position:56%
So, I kind of put together all these
news pieces that I had been reading.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.870
And I started getting an
idea for a fiction book.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:00.680
And all I had of this was
this girl and her brother.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.640
And a Jin who is bent on revenge.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.120
And I got the Jin idea from
the stories my mom told me

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.300
as a little girl, scare
the daylights out of me.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.220
And I started working on it.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.210
Not because I think anything
is going to come of it.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.640
But because it's like
a bee in bonnet.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.030
I just can't get it out of my head.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.830
So, this is one of those
ones that's not related.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.920
But I just put it up there.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.350
So, for months I would work on this
story at night, during the day.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.250
I would work on it when I
was supposed to be sleeping.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.770
I would work on it when I
was supposed to be cleaning.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.230
When I was supposed to be
hanging out with family.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.150
It was my obsession.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.490
And as I poured out
words, I wrote one draft.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.890
And it was like really bad.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.950
And then after two, I
decided to quit my job.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.250
I'd had a child.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.100
I was going to stay home with
him and I was going to write

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.580
in whatever time that I could get.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.040
So, I did that.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.900
And by 2010, I had been working
on the book for about 3 1/2 years.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.240
And I had a draft that I
was really excited about.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.920
So, at the time, I had
like three readers.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.950
Two of them, I sent it to them.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.830
And they read and they
gave me some notes.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.130
And they generally liked it.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.430
And I was this is great.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.730
I can go and see if
I can find an agent.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.030
This is going to be wonderful.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.540
Then I gave it to my third reader.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.710
And I was really nervous
about his comments.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.060
And he came back and his
comments were extensive.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.530
And something about it annoyed me.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.050 position:56%
Because I did not have a thick skin.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.350
And I felt like he didn't get it.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.650
I was like, you don't get the book.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.960
You don't understand.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.260
And we argued about this.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.330 position:56%
Because he has strong feelings, too.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.560
And he said that I was
dismissing his advice.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.460 position:56%
And I was like, no, you're an idiot.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.210
And at the end of this
argument he said,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.110
your book is an unmitigated
disaster.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.410
Yes, right?

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.880
That was not a good feeling.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.470
This is not me.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.820
But it is very close to what
I looked like after that.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.750
So, I did not know how to respond.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.050
Because he really believed it.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.400
And the thing is, I
really believed him.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.860
I really respected his opinion.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.250
He was an extensive reader.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.550
He was a great writer.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.850
And I was totally crushed.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.150
So, I had failed.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.450
I had like really failed.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.820
I had spent three years
on something.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.740
I had poured my soul into it.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.720
And it had just failed so badly.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.180
And I didn't know what to do.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.950
I thought, you know, I
need to shelve this book.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.250
I need to put it away.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.360
I can't work on it anymore.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.680
So, I went through what
my dear friend, Liz,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.320
calls "a dark knight
of the creative soul."

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.510
I was pretty certain I was done.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.810
I didn't want to write again.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.110
I didn't want to write
anything else.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.410
This was the story.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.710
And if I couldn't do
it, I wasn't interested.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.500
I got really down, guys.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.800
I'll be real.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.020
I was watching, like, reruns of
the "Shawshank Redemption" on TNT.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.920
And I was eating Ben and Jerry's
straight out of the carton.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.220
It was bad.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.330
But I started looking at the notes.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.780
Eventually, my stubbornness
rose to the surface.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.670
And I started looking at the
notes that this guy had given me.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.690
And I started trying
to figure out, why,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.470
why is it an unmitigated disaster?

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.140
And there was a pattern.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.900
There was sort of a method
to what seemed like chaos

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.750
within what he was saying.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.860
I was like, oh, I think
he had a point.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.010
No, I'll have to sorry or worse.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.320
So, it turns out, though, that
in those three years of writing

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.880
and rewriting, and rewriting.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.930
I had actually learned something.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.580
And I'd realized that I had
failed in character arcs.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.150
And I had failed in world building.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.960
And there were a lot of mistakes.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.740
But my old friend, failure, she
was murmuring in my ear again.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.740
But this time, she was
telling me what to fix.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.510
She was telling me how to fix it.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.570
She was saying, you have done this
before and you can do this again.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.830
So, that was not the
last time I failed.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.410
That draft was better.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.870
But it wasn't the final.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.090
The final took 2 1/2 more
years before it was even ready

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.300
for me to send it to an agent.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.520
And another year after
that it was pretty ready.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.100
So, from the day I thought
of the idea to the day it was

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.790
on the shelf was seven
years and ten months.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.570
And it felt like 84 years.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.200
It felt like forever.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.560
And it just felt like an eternity.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.740
So, life is full of failure.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.190
If you're a writer, a student, a
doctor, a truck driver, a parent,

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.850
a child, it doesn't
matter what you do.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.730
You are going to fail.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.260
It's this uncomfortable
feeling at its best.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.660
And it is miserable at its worst.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.240
But I started to realize that
failure is not just something

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.850
that I have to get past or
something I have to survive.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.250
It is something that I
have to see as essential.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.130
If sometimes an unpleasant
part of my life.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.980
It's sort of like exercising.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.640
Or like having Thanksgiving dinner

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.940
with relatives, who
you are like, no.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.620
Let's not talk about politics.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.650
So, I think .

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.950
. . no. Okay.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.250
Well, it's supposed to go back
to the beginning but it didn't.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.550
No worries.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.580
I'm going to talk about
my most recent experience

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.090
with failure to sort
of wrap this up.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.860
And it was very recent.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.160
It was this year.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.340
I failed at writing my third book.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.840
I failed at it for months.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.820
And months, and months.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.120
And months.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.850
I was too distracted by the
political situation going on.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.480
I couldn't get into the story.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.780
I wrote a full draft.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.900
It was a nightmare.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.770
Like, if any of you guys
saw it, you'd be like.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.070
. . It was so bad.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.840
And then I rewrote
it, and rewrote it.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.970
And actually, two nights ago, at
11:59 p.m. on the day it was due,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.770
I turned in my third book.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.160
[ Applause ]

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.480
But every moment until the moment
that my husband, who was standing

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.780 position:56%
across from me, was like oh, my God.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.570
It's 11:59, turn it in.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.870
Like send.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.170
Send it now.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.100
Every moment felt like a failure.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.400
Failure is your teacher.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.700
It is your tool.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.000
It is your fuel.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.300
And it is your friend.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.920
It does not teach you
what you've done wrong.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.750
It teaches you what
you've done right.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.260
Failure will remind
you of your weaknesses?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.560
Absolutely.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.060
But it will also remind
of your strengths.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.270
And I think most importantly it
reminds you about who you are.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.900
About what your made of.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.150
And about how far you have come.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.680
So, if you have questions,
particularly about failure,

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.980
please come and ask them.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.780
That's it.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:18.920
[ Applause ]

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.220
Any questions?

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.520
No questions?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.820
No one? Oh, I see questions.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.190
Okay. Please come to the mic.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.050
&gt;&gt; Hi. First of all, I would
just like to thank you so much

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.330
for being here and I
love your book so much.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.990
And I love that you're
a Pakistani writer.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.290
And that you .

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.160
. . it just means so much
to me because I've wanted

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.690
to be a writer for so long.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:44.490
And just, I haven't seen
myself in that space.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.130
I'm part of so many writing
spaces and bring diversity

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.710
to writing spaces is a cause
near and dear to my heart.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.100
I just wanted to thank so much.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.400
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Oh,
thank you very much.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.200
I appreciate that.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.830
[Applause]

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.980
&gt;&gt; My question is could
you talk a little bit

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.990
about someone's challenges you
faced when, in world building.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.000
Because when it comes
to my writing I like,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.990
fantasy is one of my
favorite things.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.720
But one of the challenges
I come across is trying

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.870
to know how much information
needs to be relayed to the reader.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.710
Like, how much I need to know
how much needs to be related

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.370
to the reader when it
comes to world building?

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.910
So, how do you balance
that and just what are some

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.480
of the challenges you faced?

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.850
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: So, I don't
think there is like a hard .

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.150
. . It's a great question.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.910
I don't think there is
a hard and fast rule.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.060
But I sort of followed this
thing called The Iceberg Rule,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.620
which is like, I don't
actually know any numbers.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.130
So, if I get this wrong, apologies.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.990
But it's like 70% of the iceberg

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.560
in under the water or
something like that.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.260
So, it's sort of like
that with world building.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.470
Where 70% of my world
building is just in my head.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.270
And then 30% is what
I show on the page.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.450 position:56%
And then in terms of how to world
build, I would say, I generally tend

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.730
to start with my characters
and build out from there.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.550
The other thing is,
I write in iteration.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.460
So, I don't try to have my
world perfect the first time.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.870
I build the world as I edit.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:04.230
And I add in different ideas and,
you know, whether it's architecture

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.560
or art, or you know, the
military and how it's designed.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.150
Whatever that it, it goes
through in iterations.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.730
And then once you've,
if you're doing fantasy,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.290
you might be doing a series.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.840
Once you've sort of
start your series,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.850
you will see that it gets
easier as you go along

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.730
because you've built
the world already.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.440
The rest of the writing
still sucks, by the way.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.710
By the world building
is a little bit easier.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:30.110
So, I would say, try not to
put quite as much up front.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.890
And let it kind of emerge
as you write the book.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.990
You can always add world
building if someone is

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.410
like I don't understand this.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.050
But it's a little harder
to kind of take it

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.350
out once you've already put it in.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.950
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.770
Why don't we go to this side?

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.400
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I was wondering if you
had any insights about, I think,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.310
usually failure is thought of
as being something external.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.520
You know, that you're disappointing
other people's expectations.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.010
How have you found a
way to get past failure

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.380
in your mind before
it even happened?

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.150
For me, I was a writer,
what's always been hardest,

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.710
either as somebody who's studied a
lot of literature, I think, oh God,

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.010
this isn't Jane Austen's.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.310
What's the point of even doing it?

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.910
Or, you know, if you were a real
writer then you would be writing

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.950 position:56%
every spare minute you possibly had.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.250
And you're not doing that.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.700
So, clearly you're not
cut out for this world.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.540
Just find a grownup job.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.900
Have you had anything like that?

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.200
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: I have.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.500
Yes. I have.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.040
I think that that I
experienced it very .

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.830
. . I mean, still experience it.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.140
One of my friends, her
name is Leigh Bardugo.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.750
She said something sort
of funny the other night.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.840
She said, every time an author
opens a book, they look at the page

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.270
and they go, wait, wait,
how do I book again?

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.570
Like how do I do this?

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.870
And it's very true.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.410
So, first of all, know
that you're not alone.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.240 position:56%
But I would say be kind to yourself.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.630
It is okay if you're writer and
you can't write all the time.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.750
Particularly if you're
not published yet.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.650
It is very, very difficult to .

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.520
. . I know very few people
who are able to write fulltime

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.820
if they're not published.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.410
Because they need a
job to pay the bills.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.970
So, I used to write
in elbows of time,

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.500
15 minutes here, 20 minutes there.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.800
Whatever I could do.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.530
And that really helped me.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.070
But in terms of sort of facing
the failure in your own mind,

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.240
really take it a day at a time.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.540
And when you do have
successes, whatever they are,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.570
if you finish a paragraph
and you like it.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.700
If you finish a chapter
and you like it.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.000
Celebrate that.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.420
And remind yourself of it.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.980
And if it's something you've
done that you're really proud of,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.370
stick it on your wall so that
every time you hit that place

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.900
where you're like,
why am I doing this?

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.560
You can look up and you can see
it, and you can remind yourself

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.990
of why you're putting
yourself through it.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.290
So, I hope that helps.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.590
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.890
Thank you, so much.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.190
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.490
On this side.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.760
&gt;&gt; Hi. What character both ones
you write and you don't write,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.060
can you relate to the most?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.700
And which characters
sort of inspire you.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.780
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: I'm really
inspired by the Commandant.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.850
No, I'm joking.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.150
She's evil.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.450
In case any of you were wondering.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:09.250
I am inspired by, I love Hermione.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.010 position:56%
She's one of my favorite characters.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.210
I think Hermione has a wonderful
sort of questing imagination.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.590
And I would really love
it if she became real

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.900
and could be my best friend.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:25.360
And I'm trying to think
of other characters.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.350
In my own books, it's
a little bit easier.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.640
Because I kind of draw
most of them from me.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.490
But I probably relate the most
to the main character of Elias.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:39.490
He is sort of this angsty,
like morally tortured person

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.520
who feels like he doesn't fit in.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.820
And you know, always feels like
he's kind of doing stuff wrong.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.190
You know, I can't relate to
like the soldier side of him.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.190
Like he can fight and
beat people up and stuff.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.200
And I'm not, that's not
something I'm skilled at.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.910
Though I sometimes wish it was.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.220 position:56%
But I definitely really [inaudible].

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.120
In a sense I relate
to all my characters.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.150
They are little pieces of me.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.330
I think that you have
to whether it's a hero

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.960 position:56%
or villain, or something in between.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.840
You kind of have to really
understand your characters

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.010
from their soul outward.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:15.490
Otherwise, they become
caricatures and cut outs.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.030
So, even my villains, I
definitely to some degree,

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.330
I absolutely relate to them.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.400
Because in their minds,
they're not villains.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.030
They're just doing their thing.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.760
And if other people are
getting in their way .

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.390
. . You know.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.250
So, I think that in
terms of who I relate

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.050
to all of them to some degree.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.100
But Hermione is definitely
my favorite character.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.240
And Professor McGonagall, actually.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.150
I always find a way to bring
Harry Potter into my talks.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.650
I don't think I've had a
single one in two years

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.010
where Harry Potter hasn't shown up.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.010
So, thank you for giving
me that opportunity.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.740
I appreciate it.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.500
&gt;&gt; First, I want to thank you

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.980 position:56%
because I think you're a really
good role model for aspiring writers

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.520
because you're so transparent.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.550
Especially on your Instagram.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.850
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Yes.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.150
Thank you.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.320
Someone from my publishing
house was like, are you okay?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.900
Are you going to finish the book?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.200
Are you going to have a breakdown?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.360
I was like, I don't
know, not sure, yet.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.660
Sorry. Go on.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, leading off of that, I was
wondering, you've spoken in the past

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.020
about expanding the
world and writing

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.920 position:56%
about other characters' experiences.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.590
And is that still something
that you're thinking you'll do?

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.230
Maybe after you taken
a bit of a break.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.530
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Yes.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.350
[Laughs] That's all I can say.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.950
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is aside from
failure were there any other factors

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.610
that motivated you to write?

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.910
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: There were.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.430
Yes. Failure was the main one.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:48.810
But my kids are probably one
of my biggest motivations.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.510
They are two little brown boys.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.080
And I want them to see
themselves in books.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.370 position:56%
I want them to pick up a book and
think that they can be heroes of it.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.360
And that people who look like
them can be the heroes of it.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.130
That's why these new covers
were so important to me.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:09.770
[Applause] Thank you.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.200
Having a brown girl
on the front of a book

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.670
and a Middle-Eastern coated
guy on the front of the .

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.050
. . but you can't really see
him as well in this cover.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.800
But particularly in the
first cover you can kind

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.840 position:56%
of see his face a little bit better.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.140
It was very important to me.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.260
So, that's absolutely
a motivating factor.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.580
And then, actually, my
stubbornness was very motivating.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.250
When I was a kid, my
parents hated it.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.190
So, I want to tell any small
children in the audience

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.670
if you are stubborn and
your parents give you grief.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.970
Don't worry.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.160
It can be very helpful
later in life.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.240
So, yes, I was like I
have to write this story.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.390
And by God, I am going to do it.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.990
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.160
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I guess my question
is what was your favorite book

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.460
growing up?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.760
And what's your favorite book now?

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.210
Or have they changed and has
that influenced you at all?

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.650
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: That is
an excellent question.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.180
It has influence my writing.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:04.380
My favorite book growing up was
"Seven Daughters and Seven Sons."

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.470
It was about this Iraqi girl
who is the youngest child

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.800
in her family, or, sorry.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.440
The middle child in
her family and kind

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.740
of goes off to try to save them.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.570
And it was the first time
that I had seen a book

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.670
with a person who looked me.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.180
And she was not, you know,
either a villain or a character

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.370
who didn't have any rights or a
character who was sort of put down.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.670
She was her own person.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.970
She was fully formed.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.270
And she a badass.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.870
So, that was my favorite
book as a kid.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.850
As an adult, this is a
really, really generic answer.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.710
But The Harry Potter books.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.620 position:56%
No one in audience who knows me
should be at all shocked about this.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.180
I think that those
books changed my life.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.770
And I was 18 when I
started reading them.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.410
And they're really
what helped me believe

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.520
that I could become
a young adult author.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.630
Thanks Jo Rowling.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.590
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering
how you juggle writing

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.170
from multiple viewpoints.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.630
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Okay.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.340
So, there is a few
different things that I do.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.450
One thing is when I do the
first draft I don't try

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.750
to make them sound different.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.490
I just write in one voice.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.570
I put their voices as an edit.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.870
I call it a tonal edit.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:25.180
And so, usually what I do is I
go find music that inspires me

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.760
and makes me think of
each of these characters.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.880
I watch movies that like, you
know, if I'm writing Elias,

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.790
I'm going to go watch
"Apocalypse Now" right?

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.040
And like, war movies and stuff.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.040
And movies about angsty boys.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.550
And if I'm thinking about
Laia, I'm going to listen

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.160
to very specific kinds of music.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.620
And that's sort of going
to get me into her head.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.840
The other thing that I did to help
me understand my characters better,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.270
is I try to find people in the
real world who mirrored them.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.700
No, I have not found an Elias.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.000
Sorry, guys.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.300
But I did find a West
Point Cadet who I talked

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.720 position:56%
to about being in a military school.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.470
I interviewed him about that.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.930
I talked to a police sergeant about
what it was like to be a warrior.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.900
Basically, to have
the soul of a warrior.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:14.270
I talked to a woman who was
an FBI agent and she worked

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.700
on a special task force
for gangs In San Jose.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.470
And she was really fascinating.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.910
Because when I met her it was like
meeting an older version of Helene.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.210
She had like .

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.510 position:56%
. . and I had already written Helene

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.260
but she had blonde
hair, ice-blue eyes.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.630
And she was a totally badass.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.360
And I would never,
ever mess with her.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.200
But it was really fascinating
to talk to her because, she,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.500
in particular helped me
understand this sort of balance

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.450
between when you have the soul of
a warrior but you have a family.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.510
And how it can tear it apart.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:48.200
And how you end up having to
put one or the other first.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.970
And it's just a really
difficult balance.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.860
So, for me research, like
primary sources, trying to figure

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.540
out who these people
are at their very core.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:02.140
And writing from there
as opposed to writing it

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.250
and then sort of adding it in.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.910
That's how I approached getting
the different viewpoints,

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.520
you know, right, I guess.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.120
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.420
Yes. Hello.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.720
Hello small one.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.730
&gt;&gt; My question is how do
you write with children?

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.220
I'm at home and finding
that time, that balance,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.000
and then keeping your
mind on your book.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.440
Keeping your mind sane
with your children.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.740
How did you survive?

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.250
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: That's
an excellent question.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.470
The thing is it's that
it's a constant struggle.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.190
It's not something that
I fully worked out yet.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.460
And I'm just going to
be honest with you.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.140
I do, like I said before,
and I'll talk

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.590
about it a little bit more I write
in elbows of time a lot of time.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.180
Where if I have 10 minutes,
if I have 5 minutes,

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.960
I will write whatever I can.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.620
I'll try to keep my
computer with me.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.920 position:56%
I'll try to keep a notebook with me.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.270
And I'll just write.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:31:00.270
I can edit a page in 15
minutes or 20 minutes.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.970
And somebody once gave me
this interesting number.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.420
She said, and I'm sure some famous
white dude author has said this

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.720
as well.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.540
But, one of my friends said,
if you write three pages a day,

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.680
you have a book in a year.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.340
And I think, that's really true.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.730
So, it's just about finding
whatever time you can.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.030
That's what it was about for me.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.490
Finding whatever time I could
to get in whatever I could.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.700
And then the biggest thing
is that I had family support.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.370
So, my husband was
incredibly supportive.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.920
I could not have written the
first book without him, you know,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.490
helping me, helping me find time.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.330
And even now, the last two
weeks, I was finishing my draft.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.560
Was failing at my draft.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.760
And I worked every
night until one or two,

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.070
or sometimes three in the morning.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.830
So, who's taking the
school at 7 a.m?

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.420
Who is getting them ready?

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.910
It's not me.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.790 position:56%
So, just having your family support.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.210
And asking for help, too.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.030
I would say is another thing
that I really recommend.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.640
When I was living in D.C. I
asked my in-laws for support.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.940
They were very supportive.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.940
Now I'm out in California and I
ask my family and friends for help

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.340
out there when I need it.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.640
There is no shame in that.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.810
You just got to let them
you're following your dream.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.440
That's a good cause, guys.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.740
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.980
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: You're welcome.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.310
&gt;&gt; So, hi.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.610
I found your books really
inspiring for everyone

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.240
and especially young writers.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.180
And if you could say something to
them right now, what would you say?

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.660
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: I would tell
young writers the pieces

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.360
of advice I usually share.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.970
The first one is read.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.610
A ton. And not just
what you want to write.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.910
Read outside that.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.210
Read poetry.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.510
Read the newspaper.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.530
Read the Washington Post.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.920
[Laughs] Read nonfiction.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.790
Read, if you really love
mysteries, read romance novels.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.950
If you really love romance
novels, read thrillers.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.140
Just read outside what
you normally read.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.510
Because that is going to be
thing that helps you the most.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.880
The second thing is don't give up.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.010
It took me, like I said, seven
years and ten months to see my book

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.530
on shelves after the idea
first germinated in my head.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.040
That is a long time.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.780 position:56%
That's a long time to be like, I
can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.230
It sometimes takes forever.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.000
So, definitely don't give up.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.450
Have faith in yourself.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.960
And the last bit of advice
is a little bit meaner.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.130
And that advice is don't
make excuses for yourself.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.820
I made a lot of excuses for
myself as a young writer.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.120
I was too busy.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.420
I had children.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.720
I had a life.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.040
I had an ill relative.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.340
You know, whatever it was.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.640
I wanted to see my friends.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.810
I had all these excuses that
I had built up for myself.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.410
But in the end, that's
all they were.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.860
Writers write.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.160
They find a way.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.920
Whether you're ill,
well, or old, or young,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.040 position:56%
or you know in school, or in prison.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.680
People find a way to do it.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.650
And I always come back to
Paul Kalanithi who wrote

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.950
"When Breath Becomes Air"

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.480
when he had stage IV lung
cancer and was dying.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.880
Like if he can do that,
you all can write a book.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.180
That's it.

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.780
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.080
Yes. Hello.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.590
&gt;&gt; One of the things that
impressed me the most

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:19.470 position:56%
about your story was even though you
developed an early fear of failure,

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.900
you didn't take the easy way out.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.680
And just not try.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.630
But you kept on being
persistent in spite of that.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.270
You didn't let the fear of
failure stop you from trying.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:29.590
How is it that you developed that?

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:35.060
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: I have to give
a lot of credit to my parents.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.720
I had a tiger dad.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.700
He was very much like, you will
be awesome or you will be nothing.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.560
I think that my parents
were a huge part of it.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.560
They really, really helped me
understand that if I wanted

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.710
to be anybody, I could not give up.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.440
And then I do think that part of it
was really a natural stubbornness.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.200
I'm the youngest of three kids.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.940 position:56%
You know you have two older brothers
who were typical older brothers.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.760
And who definitely didn't let
me get away with anything.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.280
And I think that also
had a big part of it.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.710
And also, there is this
thing called self-talk.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.480
Apparently Navy Seals do it.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.780
Just saying.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.600
But what you basically do
is you keep telling yourself

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.070
that you can do something.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.370
Whatever it is.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.450
And you keep reminding yourself
of that in any way you can.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.980
And I found that really helpful.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.310
And we have about two minutes,
so maybe two more questions.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.430
Let's go to this side.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:34.440
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wanted to know if it was
hard to keep a story line going

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.190
with different books and not
let it be repetitive, I guess?

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.490
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: It can be.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.430 position:56%
Yes. But generally, I have this sort
of story of the characters plotted

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.990
out in my head, like
all the way until death.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:53.740 position:56%
And so, it's not as hard as I think
it could have been had I not planned

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.920
out the books ahead of time.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.760
That doesn't make them
easier to write by the way.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.450
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Hello.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.450
&gt;&gt; Would you ever consider
writing a superhero novel?

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.440
I know they're a big trend in
[inaudible] literature lately?

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.740
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: I would.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.040
Yes. I would.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.340
&gt;&gt; What superhero would
you want to .

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.640
. .

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.940
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Ms. Marble.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.760
[Laughs] I haven't
thought about this at all.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.370
Not once. Yes.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.660
&gt;&gt; Hi. First, I just want to say
that I really love your new covers

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.820
because it's one of the first
times that I've seen myself

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.770
on a cover as a brown girl.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.070
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Yes.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.370
Thank you.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.590
I'm so glad you like them.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.590
&gt;&gt; I was wondering
how do you work to get

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.950
over writer's block
when you have it?

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.250
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: Oh,
I love this question.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:41.680
Because I didn't used
to have an answer.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.290
And then one of my
friends provided an answer.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.670
And I have since stole it from her.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.950
So, Alison Goodman who
wrote the "Eon" books

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.270
and the "Dark Days Club" books says

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.090
that she doesn't believe
in writer's block.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.330
She believes in writer's pause.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.050
And that's what I've been sort
of thinking about recently.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.450
It's not that I'm blocked.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.550
It's that something has gone
wrong in the past whatever,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.070
however many pages I've written.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.570
That has made me not
know what to do next.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:10.140
So, what I do is I go
back to the last place

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.750
that the story has worked.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.050
And I start from there.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.350
And I try to start looking at it.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.980
Okay, this is where
the story was flowing.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.930
What happened afterward
that isn't working.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.480
Generally, it's something like my
characters' motivations are right.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.980
Or the conflict doesn't quite fit.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.960
There is something off.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.880
So, if you're struggling
with writer's pause,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.260
go back to the last place that
felt good and start from there.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.800
And start sort of going through.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.000
And one more question
and then we'll be done.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.160
&gt;&gt; thank you for coming
and joining us today.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.310
And my question is where do
you get your inspiration from?

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.470
&gt;&gt; Sabaa Tahir: So, I get my
inspiration almost primarily

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.690
from news stories that I read.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:55.170
And more recently reading about
the refugee crisis in Europe

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:57.080
and the Middle East has
been a huge inspiration

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.470
for the stuff I've written.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.060
It has found its way into
Torch, in particular,

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.610
and it will be finding
its way into Reaper.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.760
So, yes. that's why I said
read the Washington Post.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.060
And with that.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.860
Thank you, guys very
much for coming.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:14.140
[ Applause ]

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.000
