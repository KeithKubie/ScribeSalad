Speaker 2:          00:07          falls couple of years ago, I was Raven about that John Fabro movie. I'm a chef. You haven't seen the movie. It's, it's phenomenal. It's just such a great, great movie. And uh, and just don't be hungry when you watch it because you will, you will consume like 12,000 calories after watching it because some of the food, basically, all of the food that they make looks unbelievable. So long story short, you know, like whenever they have like end credit stuff on like a movie, um, you know, it's usually like outtakes or something from the actress screwing up or, or, or whatever. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:46          okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47          John had to learn how to basically, I guess, you know, they had data, you had to take cooking classes and stuff. So he looked like he was an actual chef. So though the movie movies character would ring true, you know, all that actory stuff. So there was a guy showing them how to make a grilled cheese sandwich. This guy, a chef, Roy Choi, who, uh, had the Koji trucks started the whole food truck movement out here in la and everything. And

Speaker 4:          01:09          it all started with the Kogi Barbecue Taco truck. There's nothing else in life they could have brought me this far to feed so many people yet there's so many people I haven't fed yet and as his restaurant empire continues to grow, Choy is determined to feed people in underserved communities with nutritious fast food at his restaurant chain called local and Roy Choi isn't amused by critics who he says want him to fail.

Speaker 2:          01:36          He was showing them how to do it and John just decided to film it when he, when he, when he was making this cheeseburger and it was like so fucking intense when the guy was doing like all crunched down looking at it and he was moving the grilled cheese grilled cheese sandwich. You just thinking like this is something like a fucking 12 year old can make, but watching this guy do it and the level of intensity, the game seven fucking intensity that this guy had when he made it, I was just like, what? They'd like blew me away. It was like, I've never been that into fucking cook consulting ever. You know?

Speaker 1:          02:13          Ah, it doesn't make sense with my brains and your speed. We should be destined for greatness, right? We need to think big little Amigo. I'm talking commercials. Talk shows, Connie fairs. Got It. We can have our very own Telanovela
