00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.970
The second law of thermodynamics
states that the entropy, or disorder,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.330
of a closed system is always increasing.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.890
One way of thinking about entropy
is a measure of disorder or chaos in the universe.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.250
The more entropy we generate, the less
energy is left over to do useful work.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.789
If you think about entropy statistically,
you could think about it in terms of a puzzle

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.859
where you have to figure out
how many combinations there are

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.910
of putting three balls into three boxes.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.780
Well, there's 10.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.609
In three cases you'll have
three balls in one of the boxes.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.960
There's one where
there's a ball in every box.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.739
And the other six will have them
all spread out to a different degree.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.609
That's straightforward enough
but when you scale it up,

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.570
even by a factor of 10,
things get much more complicated.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.300
Counting the permutations
becomes impossible.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.679
Now if you imagine that there
were trillions upon trillions of atoms

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.280
and trillions upon trillions of boxes,
then statistically you could see

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.140
that it's much more likely that the atoms
would be disordered rather than ordered.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.070
Perhaps the most significant conclusion
from the second law of thermodynamics

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.229
is the concept of the arrow of time which
tells you which direction time is travelling

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.229
in.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.170
For example if a process generates entropy,
it will happen spontaneously

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.570
and will be irreversible
unless you input more energy.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.759
When I pour cream on my coffee,
I wouldn't be surprised to see

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.560
the two liquids mixing and becoming
more disordered over time.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.130
I would, however be surprised
if the cream and coffee separated again

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.119
after I had stirred them.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.630
An ice cube in coffee will melt
and become a more disordered liquid.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.609
But under those conditions it
cannot spontaneously reform itself

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.880
back into an ice cube.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.329
You might be tempted to think
that if this is true

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.320
and if entropy can never be decreased,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.829
then how can human beings or more
complex living organisms even exist?

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.000
Well, the key here is that
humans are not a closed system.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.539
We are always exchanging heat
with our surroundings

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.870
and we're decreasing local entropy at the
expense of the entropy of our environments.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.989
So if I take an egg and I drop it,

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.690
then the second law says that this egg
will never spontaneously unbreak itself.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.510
But even the initial laying of the
egg doesn't violate the second law,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.230
because the hen took a lot
of food and broke it down,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.930
so creating a lot of molecular
disorder or entropy,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.849
in order to make this egg
that I've just broken.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.890
The second law states that a
spontaneous process generates entropy

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.580
and involves heat moving
from a hotter body to a colder body.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.900
Now a refrigerator doesn't violate
the second law of thermodynamics

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.879
because it's not a
closed, isolated system.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.560
We're continually inputting energy
in the form of electricity

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.340
to try and keep the inside
of the refrigerator cold

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.730
but at the expense of
the surrounding environment.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.959
If we turned off the electricity then
eventually the air inside the refrigerator

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.730
would come into thermal equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.079
The concept of thermal equilibration
leads to the idea of the universe's heat death.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.209
Now this is an idea where heat flowing
from a hotter body to a colder body

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.329
will eventually lead to a situation
where all of the atoms in the universe

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.560
are at thermal equilibrium and there won't
be any drivers for spontaneous processes

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500
and things will just stop.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.200
But the good news is that this isn't
going to happen for a very long time.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.670
It's been predicted to happen in
10 to the power of 26 years.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.269
That's 10 with 26 zeroes behind it.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.310
So we can take comfort in the fact
that we can continue to create things

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.920
and draw local order from the chaos
for a long time to come.
