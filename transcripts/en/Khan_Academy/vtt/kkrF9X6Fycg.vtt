00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.150
- [Voiceover] So we have
negative 30x to the fifth

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.090
is equal to negative 10x
to the third, times F.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.020
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.250
and see if you can figure
out what F is going to be.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.650
Well, the way that we can tackle it,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.587
we could just isolate the F
on the right-hand side here

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:19.490
if we divide by negative 10x to the third.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.150
So we might say, well, we want to divide

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.590
this side by negative 10x to the third,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.390
but if we want the equality to be true,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.720
if we want the left side
to stay being the same

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.800
as the right side,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.782
whatever we do with the right side

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:32.550
we have to do to the left side as well.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.750
So we have to divide the left side

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.520
by negative 10x to the third.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.120
And then what does that leave us with?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.150
Well, on the right-hand side, up top

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.050
we're multiplying by
negative 10x to the third,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.520
and then we're dividing by
negative 10x to the third,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.790
well, multiplying by something

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.150
and then dividing by that same thing

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.250
is the same thing as
just multiplying by one,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.550
or one way to think about
it, they just cancel out.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.210
So we are just going to be left with an F.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.520
We're going to be left an
F on the right-hand side.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.650
And there's the whole point,
we wanted to solve for F.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.360
And on the left-hand side,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.050
we can first look at the coefficients.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.590
We could say negative 30 divided by,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.430
negative 30 divided by negative 10

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.020
is positive three.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.820
So that's going to be three.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.320
And then x to the fifth power

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490
divided by x to the third power,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
well that's going to be x-squared,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.020
x-squared.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.820
You could either think of
it in terms of our exponent

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.190
properties, we would
subtract these two exponents,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.820
x to the five minus
three, which is x-squared

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550
or you could say up on top that's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
x times x times x times x times x.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.320
Did I say that right? Five x's.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.820
You could do it as x,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.890
let me do to that, on top,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.400
you have x to the fifth which is this.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.910
I also like to remind myself

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.850
why the exponent properties even work.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.650
And then on the denominator,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.930
on the denominator you have

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.420
x times x times x

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420
and these three x's are going to cancel

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.182
and you're just going to
be left with x times x

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:09.282
which is just x-squared.

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:11.720
So you get F is equal to three x-squared

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.120
so you could write,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.490
we could write that
negative 30x to the fifth

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.750
is equal to,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.060
is equal to the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.050
negative 10x to the third

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.620
times F and now we know that F

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.790
is three x-squared.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.150
Three x-squared.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.520
And so another way to
describe what's going on

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.230
in this equation, we could say that

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.350
negative 30x to the fifth
is divisible by either one

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.320
of these factors.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.720
That negative 30x to the
fifth is divisible by

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.520
negative 10x to the third

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.790
or we could say negative 30x to the fifth

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.882
is divisible by three x-squared

00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:52.650
or we could say that three x-squared

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.850
is a factor of negative 30x to the fifth.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.790
And the way that we can
make these claims about

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.030
factor and divisibility
is we're dealing with

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.150
non-fractional coefficients
right over here

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.290
and we're also dealing with
non-fractional exponents

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.320
right over here

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.180
so that's why we're saying,
hey, these are factors,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.483
this yellow thing and this magenta thing,

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.020
factors of this blue thing

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.840
or this blue thing is divisible
by either one of these.
