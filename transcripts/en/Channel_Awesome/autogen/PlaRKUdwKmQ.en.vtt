00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.140
to see how he kind of deals with this
sort of second failure the second chance

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150
sort of second failure the second chance
 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.200
sort of second failure the second chance
that was botched and he clearly he's in

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210
that was botched and he clearly he's in
 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.939
that was botched and he clearly he's in
a state of denial come on let's go

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949
a state of denial come on let's go
 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.909

seems like that pain has really hit so
close to home that's like it can't even

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840
close to home that's like it can't even
 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.510
close to home that's like it can't even
comprehend it so he sort of puts it out

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520
comprehend it so he sort of puts it out
 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.939
comprehend it so he sort of puts it out
of his mind for a bit and hey let's go

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949
of his mind for a bit and hey let's go
 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.070

play we're gonna have fun I would have
liked of those dealt with a little bit

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669
liked of those dealt with a little bit
 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.430
liked of those dealt with a little bit
more but again this is sore as you go

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440
more but again this is sore as you go
 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.210
more but again this is sore as you go
story and I understand that it's I'm

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220
story and I understand that it's I'm
 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.320
story and I understand that it's I'm
curious if they're gonna go into that

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330
curious if they're gonna go into that
 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.520
curious if they're gonna go into that
more I would like them to but we'll see

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
more I would like them to but we'll see
 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.020
more I would like them to but we'll see
what happens I mean again that's a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030
what happens I mean again that's a
 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.670
what happens I mean again that's a
second failure and it you could even

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680
second failure and it you could even
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.779
second failure and it you could even
argue that's harder than the first

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789
argue that's harder than the first
 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.670
argue that's harder than the first
failure so I'd like to see a little bit

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
failure so I'd like to see a little bit
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.070
failure so I'd like to see a little bit
more a little bit more diving into that

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080
more a little bit more diving into that
 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.040
more a little bit more diving into that
but uh you know again we'll see where

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050
but uh you know again we'll see where
 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.520
but uh you know again we'll see where
that goes

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530
that goes
 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.029
that goes
um so yeah not too much else I also like

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039
um so yeah not too much else I also like
 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.890
um so yeah not too much else I also like
that again keeping in continuity that

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900
that again keeping in continuity that
 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.320
that again keeping in continuity that
Appa remembers they set him free and so

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330
Appa remembers they set him free and so
 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.059
Appa remembers they set him free and so

he treats them very kindly and licks him
 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.499
he treats them very kindly and licks him
and stab yeah I think that was a very

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509
and stab yeah I think that was a very
 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.779
and stab yeah I think that was a very
and that was also a clever way of sort

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789
and that was also a clever way of sort
 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.870
and that was also a clever way of sort
segue into hey maybe we should have him

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880
segue into hey maybe we should have him
 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.409
segue into hey maybe we should have him
around me maybe this makes sense uh so

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419
around me maybe this makes sense uh so
 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.659
around me maybe this makes sense uh so
yeah it can't think of too much else for

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669
yeah it can't think of too much else for
 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.719
yeah it can't think of too much else for
this episode just a another great Zuko

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729
this episode just a another great Zuko
 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.339

this group I I love the way this has
really come full circle that they

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210
really come full circle that they
 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.580
really come full circle that they
started off you know so very similar

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590
started off you know so very similar
 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.950
started off you know so very similar
than they sort of split apart now

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
than they sort of split apart now
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.570
than they sort of split apart now
they're coming back together again I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580

just I love the way that works out
I think it's obvious at some point Zuko

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440
I think it's obvious at some point Zuko
 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.670
I think it's obvious at some point Zuko
is gonna win katara over but it might be

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680
is gonna win katara over but it might be
 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.089
is gonna win katara over but it might be
a while and again I like that it's not

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099
a while and again I like that it's not
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.300
a while and again I like that it's not
so easy it's that was as he put it that

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310
so easy it's that was as he put it that
 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.909
so easy it's that was as he put it that
was a betrayal that he as she said you

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919
was a betrayal that he as she said you
 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.070
was a betrayal that he as she said you
he made his choice and he has to live

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
he made his choice and he has to live
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.920
he made his choice and he has to live
with it and they're more doing it out of

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930
with it and they're more doing it out of
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.230
with it and they're more doing it out of
the fact that they have no choice in

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240
the fact that they have no choice in
 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760
the fact that they have no choice in
this and they need Aang to learn

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770
this and they need Aang to learn
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.100
this and they need Aang to learn
firebending and here's someone that not

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110
firebending and here's someone that not
 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.200
firebending and here's someone that not
only understands the craft but he

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210
only understands the craft but he
 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.180
only understands the craft but he
understands the responsibilities of it

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190
understands the responsibilities of it
 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.379
