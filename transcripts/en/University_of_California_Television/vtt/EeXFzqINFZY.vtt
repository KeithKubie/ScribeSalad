We are the paradoxical ape; bipedal,
naked, large brain. Long the master of

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.260
fire, tools and language, but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.560
is inevitable, yet filled with optimism.
We grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:57.060
We empathize and deceive. We shape the
future from our shared understanding of

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.220
the past. CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines to exchange

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.580
insights on who we are, and how we got
here. An exploration made possible by the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.280
generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.260
- [Ajit] And so we humans ask ourselves,
who are we? What are we doing here? Where

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.850
did we come from? How did we get here? And
where are we going? Two of these questions

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.880
fall within the realm of anthropogeny;
explaining the origin of humans. And this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.700
is a remit of CARTA, which is run by
myself, Rusty Gage, Margaret Schoeninger,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.260
Pascal Gagneux with help from Linda,
Ingrid, Kate, Jessie and John. Pursuing

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.320
anthroprogeny involves many academic
disciplines crossing every part of this

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.050
mesa and every part of the world. And so
our mission statement is to use all

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.190
rational and ethical approaches to seek
all verifiable facts from all relevant

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.880
disciplines to explain the origins of the
human phenomenon. And while we do that, we

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.570
try to minimize complex organizational
structures and hierarchies and unnecessary

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.650
paperwork and bureaucracy.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.360
But in the process we also now are
beginning to try to raise awareness in

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.930
understanding the study of human origins
within the academic community, and the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.610
public at large. So special thanks to our
major sponsors; The Mathers Foundation New

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.720
York, Jim Handelman, the director, could
not be here but in his stead, the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.640
associate director Beverly Cheikin is
here. And of course Rita Atkinson who I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.530
see has not arrived yet, but they are two
major sponsors. And special thanks to all

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.710
our individual supporters, who are listed
here. Many of you are in the audience and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.140
we really appreciate your support.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.990
The closed captioning for the video
recordings of the symposium are supported

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:19.070
by Elizabeth Lancaster and Eli Shefter.
Special thanks to UCSD-TV; Rich, Matt,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.260
Marci, John, Jacob; and of course the Salk
Media services, Kent and Jon. Now before I

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:36.510
close, I want to make one comment. Most of
the time CARTA focuses on where we came

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.990
from and how we got here. So in the
timeline of interest, we tend to go back

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.460
millions of years and end our interest a
few tens of thousands of years ago when

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.520
humans just began to do their thing.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.660
But in this particular symposium, although
we were focused on understanding the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.220
origin of humans in the context of
climate. We felt it would be immoral and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.460
foolhardy, really, to ignore what's
happening right now. And so, if you zoom

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.560
in on this little corner of our poster,
you can see the last couple of ten

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.430
thousand years and what's been happening
to the climate in terms of temperature,

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.300
average temperature. And we're here. And
today we're not only going to talk about

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:38.700
where we came from and how we got here,
but also look at where we are and where we

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:46.636
are going. And with that I'll hand over to
Charlie Kennel the chair of our session.
