[Chinese accent]

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello. Good afternoon, my friends. My name
is Ming. I'm the jolly good fellow who at

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.809
Google. And I'm jolly today because our honored
guest, Rich Hanson, brought this book, right?

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.040
This book is about happiness, love and wisdom
and it's about a new science of happiness,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.320
love and wisdom and is called Buddha's Brain.
It's like, it's all my favorite topics in

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.820
one convenient value sized packet.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.220
And so what-what's there not to like about
this book, right? That's why I'm happy today.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.489
Dr. Rick Hanson, he's a neuropsychologist,
author and teacher at the intersection of

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.020
psychology, neurology and contemplative practice.
He co-founded the Wellspring Institute for

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.969
Neuroscience and Contemplative Wisdom and
he's the author of the book called Mother

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.870
Nurture, which is one of very few books that
I-I am aware of, maybe the only book, that

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.379
is about taking care of, about taking care
of mothers. And he's also an-an authority

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.660
on how the arrival of children affect moms,
fathers and marriages.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.660
And Rick enjoys rock climbing, good conversations
and good books and in his free time he tries

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.661
to save the world.

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:15.661
[laughter]

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.661
So with that let's welcome my friend, Dr.
Rich Hanson.

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.130
&gt;&gt;Rick Hanson:
Okay.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.350
[applause]

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.682
&gt;&gt;Rick Hanson:
Thank you, Ming, thank you.

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:26.110
Well, with Ming here, I'm in good company.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.200
Can you hear me okay?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
How's this sound?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880
It's okay, alright, great. And if it gets
bad, please let me know.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.900
I wanted to say first of all that I've never
been to Google before. I use your products

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.350
many times a day of course, but one of the
great things about being able to be here is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.530
that gives me a little thing I can use to
impress my kids. And that's very important

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.970
when you're a parent.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.860
As you probably know or will discover, they
are 22 and 19 and so this is one of the very

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.300
few things that actually made them pay attention
to anything I had to say.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.881
So, my intent here is to go through a number
of topics, four in particular and to do it

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.300
fairly quickly.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.971
So, my son to put be me at ease said, "Don't
worry Dad, you're gonna be talking to some

00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:10.521
of the smartest people on the planet."

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:11.521
[laughter]

00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:15.690
And thanks Forrest. I'll, but in a way that's
kind good because I do tend to zip along at

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.980
a fairly breakneck pace. And so my plan is
to go through these topics kinda in four sections,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.080
pause for breath at the end of each one, do
some few questions or comments, and then keep

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.560
going, alright?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.980
I'm gonna be working a lot within one of these
three circles: Buddhism or really contemplative

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.330
practice generally, the one I'm trained the
most in is Buddhism.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.260
I'm not here to push Buddhism or any ism,
but it's a source of great insight into actually

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.890
how the mind works, as well as psychology
and neurology.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.459
That said, I think it's humbling and appropriate
to appreciate the fact that there's really,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.470
literally, so little we actually know about
the mind and the brain these days. It's a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.700
nice quote here from Ani Tenzin Palmo here.
Now, no one really still knows yet what a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.350
thought actually is even though we're goin'
to be talking about them a fair amount.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.560
Okay, so prelims out of the way, let's get
into your amazing brain.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.209
First, some basic specs. It's kind of mind
boggling for me endlessly to appreciate really

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.590
how complicated the brain is.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.590
[laughter]

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.000
In particular, I wanna focus as an overarching
theme on the fundamental idea of using the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.940
mind to change the brain for the better, so
that it benefits the mind and in widening

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.800
ripples, all beings.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.680
So, to do that we wanna get, I wanna get first
at some basic information about the brain

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.761
and about what I call self-directed neuroplasticity.
The fundamental idea that mental activity

00:03:43.761 --> 00:03:49.010
sculpts neural structure, which gives us opportunities
increasingly to intervene actually inside

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.110
the black box of the brain.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.150
That's important because there's a fundamental
problem in that the brain through biological

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.660
evolution is highly inclined toward noting
and responding to negative experiences, and

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.680
in particular has a kind of deeply engrained
threat reactivity that's then increased by

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.040
personal history as well cultural and political
factors that leads to what I call "Paper Tiger

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.180
Paranoia."

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.780
And so then last I'm gonna talk about what
to do about that, with self-directed neuroplasticity

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.770
in terms of coming back to the natural state
of the brain which is really the optimal brain.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.120
So I thought, "This is my opportunity at Google,
I'm gonna take a big swing and hopefully hit

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.340
the ball."

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.680
So, let's dive in.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.750
And one way to think about this is purely
abstractly, fine. But a more powerful way

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.120
to think about it is that what we're talking
about is happening right here, right now,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
right between your ears.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.940
Okay. So here we go.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.440
Back to where we were, the technical specs
of the brain.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.570
Kinda remarkable to realize that in roughly
three pounds, about five cups worth of tissue,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.729
are about one point one trillion cells, 100
billion neurons, a trillion support cells.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.500
They're connected with each other in a variety
of ways. A typical neuron connects with about

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.400
5,000 other neurons making about 500 trillion
synapses.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.490
Lots of information moves through the brain
and the nervous system. The brain moves information

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.880
around like a heart moves blood around in
effect.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.070
A fair amount of, of the interaction between
neurons is just noise. Noisy networks as you

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.180
all probably know are very, are the, are optimized
for signal transmission, but that said, out

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.230
of all the noise there are so many signals
going on in the brain that in the time it

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.830
takes roughly to take a single breath, roughly
a quadrillion messages moved around inside

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.280
your head.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.380
The brain is literally the most complex object
yet known to science; more complex than an

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.780
exploding star; more complex even than the
American economy.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.780
[laughter]

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.820
So, here's a schematic neuron. You can see
the receiving end at the le-at the left as

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.680
you face the screen. The output end is at
the right hand s-side. It is like a little

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.330
on-off switch. Neurons are continually firing.
A neuron that's not firing is a dead neuron.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.570
And basically the summation moment to moment
of roughly 5,000 inputs every few milliseconds

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.720
determines whether the neuron will fire.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
[pause]

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
Okay? Great.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
[pause]

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.250
So, I wanna talk now about two critical words
that are really easy t-to lose. This is probably

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.169
the most intellectually danced slide I've
got. I wanna talk about the mind and the brain.

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.389
I define the mind as the flows of information
through the nervous system. The nervous system

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.760
has its headquarters in the brain. Information
is represented by the nervous system much

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.530
like a computer hard drive represents information,
or sound waves right now are representing

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.449
information; radio waves represent information.
It's the classic and familiar distinction

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.729
between hardware and software.

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:05.389
In essence, therefore, apart from hypothetical
transcendental factors, the mind is what the

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.139
brain does. No brain, no mind.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.410
Now, I say the brain is the necessary condition
for the mind; it's also a proximally sufficient

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.960
condition. It's only proximally sufficient
because the brain is embedded in our nervous

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.200
system, embedded in a body, embedded, whoops,
and embedded in culture and both here and

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.710
now and across time.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.310
So, to talk about the brain as the, the brain
as the local, the locally, it's the necessary

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.340
condition and it's the locally sufficient
condition for the mind. And as we'll see,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.160
the brain also depends on the mind.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.930
Now the way to understand the brain is really
in a context of biological evolution. The

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.830
nervous system is about 600 million years
old. As you know life came on the planet about

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.430
three and half billion years ago. Multi-celled
creatures arose around 650 million years ago

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.580
and they were complicated enough to need some
method of communication between their sensing

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.360
organs and their motor systems around 600
million years ago, thus the beginning of the

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.569
brain.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.510
In terms of vertebrates it essentially evolved
more or less in the way you see. This is kind

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.759
of a schematic picture. The inner reptile
brain and there's the squirrel monkey brain

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:21.520
and there's the early stone tool making hominid
brain, the cave man brain and the modern brain.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.330
The modern brain is essentially identical
with the cave man brain.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.759
How many of you by the way have blue eyes
or green eyes? Okay. You are mutants. In other

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:36.830
words, until about 5,000 years ago nobody
had blue eyes. I mean biological evolution

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.950
is continuing. The first blue eyed person
was identified probably about 5,000 years

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.500
ago; probably around Denmark and then blue
eyes have proliferated around the world for

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.500
various reasons.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.200
But evolution is continuing.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.360
So, in terms of that evolution the brain developed
three fundamental goal-directed systems. You

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.130
could say they're motivational systems; this
why we do stuff.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:06.529
The first system was the avoid system: withdraw
from threats; freeze; back up; get away. On

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:12.700
top of that then with roughly invertebrates,
crustaceans, lizards and so forth, and fish

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.630
in the sea, a more sophisticated approaching
system developed to pursue opportunities.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.630
And then with birds and mammals and then primates
and particularly humans, the attach system

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.810
developed. That's the social system in the
brain that forms connections and bonds with

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.399
us and seeks proximity, closeness, intimacy,
love, and belonging.

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:39.910
Although the vagus nerve as it evolved loosely
matched to these three systems, they're anatomically

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:44.440
blurred in their distinctions in the brain
and they intertwine with each other and any

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.100
single system can use two others for its ends.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.740
This typology by the way: approach, avoid,
attach or avoid, approach, attach is one we'll

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.560
be returning to again and again. And it's
a really useful way to think about how people

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.540
are motivated and also think about how suffering
and dysfunction and harm arise in terms of

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.930
each one of those three systems.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:09.899
And also, on the other hand, how happiness,
benevolence, and helpfulness arise in a different

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:15.550
mode of action in each one of those three
systems.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.130
So, love and the brain. It's interesting to
realize and this is what's called the social

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.880
brain theory, that probably the primary driver
of evolution of the brain in the last hundred

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.830
million years has been social capabilities
or love broadly defined.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.630
For example, reptiles and fish approach and
avoid, they don't attach, right? They have

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.510
their babies, they swim away, if the babies
are still there a few hours later they'll

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:43.500
eat them, mos, in most species. Whereas birds
and mammals do raise their young and often

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.339
form para-bonds at least temporarily.

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:50.750
It's interesting that the brain developed
in three major stages driven really by the

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:56.500
reproductive advantages, which is the engine
of biological evolution of social skills,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.089
if you will.

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:02.010
The first stage was with birds and mammals.
They've got bigger brains per body weight

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.470
than reptiles and fish do because the quote
unquote "computational requirements" of raising

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.769
young and picking a partner require a bigger
brain.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:14.550
Similarly, at the next stage of development,
there is a correlation between the size and

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:20.510
complexity of the social group of a primate
species and the size of the cerebral cortex

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.019
in proportion to body weight.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:26.529
In other words, the grooming, the hierarchies,
who's up, who's down, who's alpha, who's beta,

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:31.700
how can I still get some if I'm beta, the
coalitions and all the rest of that. Right?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.240
You've gotta have a pretty big brain.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.410
And then last, since the first hominids began
making stone tools around two and a half million

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.760
years ago, the brain has tripled in size.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.650
They were smart enough to make stone tools.
How many here can make a stone tool? I can't

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.240
make a stone tool. I don't know, but they
could do. Ah, you maybe could? That's good.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.790
Most people don't raise their hand when I
ask them that question. That's a good one.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.620
Yet the build out of the brain has been primarily
devoted to social capacities: language, cooperative

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:09.089
planning, empa-empathy, the presentation of
self, both authentically and with artful deception

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:14.170
and all the rest of that has been much of
what the volume of the brain, that's as I

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.970
said tripled, the other two-thirds is devoted
to.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:23.860
Interestingly, for babies or humans to have
a bigger brain there's a kinda physical limit

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:30.270
on how big the brain can be in a newborn and
still enable its mother to walk upright. And

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.760
so you start hitting a limit there.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.810
Most species, primate species, there's basically
a two-to-one ratio between the volume of the

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.410
brain at birth and how big it eventually gets.
The human brain it's probably about a four-fold

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.910
maybe even a five-fold increase; to do that
we needed a longer childhood.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:52.420
To have a longer childhood with a very vulnerable
infant you needed to develop bonds between

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.130
mothers and infants and also bring fathers
into the mix. And also the band itself because

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.649
it quote unquote "takes a village to raise
a child."

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:05.490
And those requirements helped drive the evolution
of the social capabilities and inclinations

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:11.520
that would enable that to occur, which then
enabled bigger brains. And the advantages

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:18.890
of those bigger brains drove them increasing
social capacities and here we are today.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:24.779
So, three facts about the brain in terms of
self-directed neuroplasticity.

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:31.180
So, first fact about the brain: as the brain
changes, the mind changes; in good ways and

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:39.170
bad. The left is a good slide hopefully, caffeine,
sugar, pleasure; right slide, a concussion.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.889
The second fact about the brain is that as
the mind changes, the brain changes. This

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:48.930
is a critically important fact. In other words,
immaterial mental activity, the movement of

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:54.670
information through this hardware substrate
maps to material neural activity that produces

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.480
temporary changes as well as lasting ones.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.980
Temporary changes include alterations in brain
waves, increased consumption of supplies like

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:09.470
oxygen and glucose, ebbs and flows of neurochemicals
like serotonin, dopamine, other neurotransmitters

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.470
and so forth.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:16.519
And I'm gonna show you some slides of temporary,
fleeting changes in the structures of the

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:20.820
brain or brain activity that mapped to mental
activity.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:28.320
This is a slide of someone who's head's been
kinda cut this way and that's the caudate

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.350
nucleus lit up because it's consuming more
oxygen. It's a part of the brain that's involved

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:37.130
in the rewards center and it activates in
this particular study when college sophomores

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:42.160
who are absolutely in love are shown a picture
of their sweetheart. Male and female they

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.150
both get a major light up in the caudate nucleus.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.470
I'm gonna go through by the way a number of
examples here. It's fascinating to get into

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.240
some of the detail, but I'm gonna keep us
moving along.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.440
Here's another slide that looks at envy and
schadenfreude. This is a study done in Japan

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:06.060
with college students who were told about
someone very much like them who was spectacularly

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.970
more successful.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:14.070
And in the scanner what arose inside them
were activations in the physical pain network,

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:18.640
in other words, emotional pain much as evolution.
Evolution's a big pludge, essentially. It

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.280
just uses lower systems and adapts them to
higher purposes. So, social pain uses physical

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:32.850
pain as a fundamental basis. Similarly, social
pleasure uses physical pleasure systems.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.160
So, in phase one, they told these students
that there is this spectacularly wonderful

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.240
person who made them really look horrible;
envy, physical pain.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.010
And then in phase two of the study they were
told that this person encountered a humiliating

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:53.000
downfall, schadenfreude, pleasure at the suffering
of others and the pleasure network was activated.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.980
As you can see an example in this study.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.980
Here we go.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.180
Here's another one. This is self in the brain.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.380
We were talking about this at lunch. These,
in this study basically it's kinda hard to

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.050
see maybe, but maybe not. The squares, the-the
diamonds, and the crosses have to do with

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.010
different activations of self-related activity
in the brain.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:19.190
For example, recognizing yourself in a photograph
distinct from others or naming a personal

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.110
memory like what I did last summer, or making
a difficult choice.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.110
What's interesting -

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.320
[pause]

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.860
[coughing]

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:34.790
in this picture is to see how widely distributed
self-related activations are throughout the

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:40.110
brain. There's no part of the brain that's
special for I, for me, for ego, for mine.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.769
It's widely distributive which has some pretty
profound implications.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:50.949
How 'bout consciousness? The big magilla,
right? Well again, when a person is conscious

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:56.410
or is entering different kinds of consciousness,
different parts of the brain are activated.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.970
And if you mess with those parts of the brain
like intersect at the linkages between the

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.519
thalamus which is the central relay station
in the brain and the cerebral cortex, you

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:08.610
anesthetize somebody.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.759
On the other hand, as consciousness changes
or activates it uses different parts of the

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:19.499
brain. Something as ineffable as awareness
alters or engages neural activity.

00:17:19.499 --> 00:17:25.059
Now, let's talk about meditation. This is
a slide, this is this, in this shot the head

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:31.059
is cut this way, if you will. Of a Buddhist
mediator doing compassion meditation, and

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:35.499
the part of the brain that is activated there
is called the anterior which means frontal

00:17:35.499 --> 00:17:40.249
cingulate cortex which is a part of the brain
that's involved in the executive control of

00:17:40.249 --> 00:17:48.580
attention; staying concentrated and attentive.
It also is an area where the thinking and

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.619
feeling are brought together as well.

00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:54.809
So, it's interesting to realize that when
this person is in the scanner doing a kind

00:17:54.809 --> 00:18:00.520
of spacious, infinite, boundless compassion
meditation, that this part of the brain is

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.520
activated.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.850
Interestingly, this is a slide of Christian
nuns in prayer who are doing a very different

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:12.299
kind of spiritual activity which activates
some of the same region, ACC in the upper

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.919
left hand slide, left ACC, anterior cingulate
cortex.

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:20.859
It lights up 'cause they're focusing their
attention, but also interestingly they got

00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:25.769
activation in the insula, which is a part
of the brain that tracks the interior sensations

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:30.679
of the body, which suggests that for these
nuns who are women, of course, doing that

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:37.690
particular practice it had a very embodied
quality, which kinda makes sense intuitively.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.700
And also they got an activation in the caudate
nucleus. Again, it was very emotionally rewarding

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:48.159
to bring to mind their most profound spiritual
experience.

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:49.159
[pause]

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:50.159
Okay.

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:53.350
In essence, now I wanna talk about lasting
changes in the brain 'cause those were all

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.169
temporary, fleeting changes, mostly having
to do with which part of the brain uses metabolic

00:18:58.169 --> 00:18:59.169
supplies.

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:02.970
[pause]

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.590
Mental activity shapes neural structure. It
leaves lasting residues behind. This is the

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.970
essence of what's called neuroplasticity.
It does it in a variety of ways, I lis-I listed

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:20.210
some of the mechanisms of action. Busy regions
get more blood flow over time. Existing synapses

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.729
get strengthened. You also get interestingly
altered gene expression. That's epigenetics.

00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:33.909
In other words, ineffable mental activity
can alter the expression of strips of atoms

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:40.380
inside this long chain of DNA. Right, for
example people who routinely activate relaxation

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:48.629
training get improved gene expression of the
portions of DNA that down regulate the stress

00:19:48.629 --> 00:19:50.259
response.

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:53.669
Isn't that kind of amazing? To think that
doing this long, deep breathing or going to

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:58.379
one of Ming's classes is actually gonna alter
the expression of this strip of atoms inside

00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:02.200
some molecules somewhere. That just is pretty
far out.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.019
Classically there a line from the Canadian
psychologist, Donald Hebb, "Neurons that fire

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:11.889
together, wire together." In other words when
neural circuits or even individual neurons

00:20:11.889 --> 00:20:20.510
start associating with each other the connections
between them are strengthened. Okay, great.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.970
So, this has a number of implications and
I wanna show you a slide here of some of the

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.519
effects of this.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:31.370
This was a study that was done on Buddhists
meditators taking a look at people in terms

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:36.460
of years of practice and looking at changes
in neural structure.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:43.149
In this particular study they found that people
who had significant long term practice, which

00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:49.159
has probably amounted to 20 to 40 minutes
most days, in the real world of-of Western

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:54.710
practitioners, they actually had thicker cortical
tissues in two key regions.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:00.220
One is the insula, that's number one, where
they're tuning into their body and their deep

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.429
emotions and self awareness in general.

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:07.009
And also area number two is the executive
portions of the prefrontal cortex that have

00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:09.389
to do with controlling attention.

00:21:09.389 --> 00:21:13.970
The third region is the sensory motor strip
where they were tracking their body sensations.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.639
The interesting other finding is in, is seen
in the lower right hand graph where the blue

00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:24.570
circles were compared to the red squares.
Red squares are the control group. They experienced

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.450
what's called cortical thinning with aging,
normal cortical thinning.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:34.799
People lose probably by the time they're 80
about three to five percent of cortical mass.

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:40.929
But the people who routinely used those regions,
those are the blue circles, did not lose cortical

00:21:40.929 --> 00:21:46.549
tissue in those regions as a function of using
it and not losing it.

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:51.379
There are other examples. Some of them are
quite down to earth. I don't know if you've

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:55.220
ever been to London. It's a spaghetti snarl
of streets. Taxi cab drivers who have to memorize

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.749
the streets of London have a thicker hippocampus
at the end of their training than they did

00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:04.309
at the beginning. The hippocampus is a part
of the brain that's involved in visual, spatial

00:22:04.309 --> 00:22:05.309
memory.

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:10.919
Pianists who work routinely with certain kinds
of movements have thicker, mo-motor cortices

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:14.259
in the parts that control fine motor regions.

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:18.669
In one study I read it's very interesting.
They took two groups of skilled pianists and

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:26.099
they had them practice a certain kind of song
or piece that involved certain specific motor

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:29.879
movements. And then they divided the group
and they had one group do it like 10 minutes

00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:34.950
every day and the other group just imagine
doing it 10 minutes every day. And each group

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:40.519
had roughly equivalent build out of neural
structure. Wow. Okay.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:42.070
So, some perspectives here.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:49.009
Marvin Minski, one of my favorites, probably
well know here, probably of godfather of cognitive

00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:54.320
science, Society of Mind, a great book. Anyway
you can see here he's saying a principal activities

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.789
of brains are making changes in themselves.

00:22:56.789 --> 00:23:02.380
I wanna offer a bit of perspective on this
which is that neuroplasticity is not breaking

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:07.099
news. It gets talked about a lot as if it's
some new finding. No, it's been understood

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:12.019
for a hundred years or more that obviously
mental activity had to change brain structure.

00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:14.919
What else is learning? The news is in the
details.

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:19.979
Most neuroplasticity is not dramatic; it's
very, very incremental. Like do, can you remember

00:23:19.979 --> 00:23:24.880
what you had for breakfast or didn't have
for breakfast this morning? That's neuroplasticity.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.039
Now what's the capital of Nebraska? Right?
That's neuroplasticity. It's pretty hum-drum.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:35.529
It's interesting though that even though neurons
that fire together are wired together throughout

00:23:35.529 --> 00:23:41.259
the nervous system; the ones that really wire
together do so in the field of awareness.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:47.499
That means that residues of conscious experience
are continually sifting into neural structure.

00:23:47.499 --> 00:23:53.009
Implicit memory is mainly where they do this.
This is not memory for specific events, that's

00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:59.539
explicit memory for recollections. This is
the internal felt sense of what it feels like

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:06.149
to be me, action, dispositions, biases, emotional
residues, and all the rest.

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:10.200
The point of all this really the take away,
for me there are half a dozen key take aways

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.479
and this is one of them, is to really be a
lot more thoughtful about what I experience

00:24:15.479 --> 00:24:19.980
moment to moment. Because whatever those neurons
are doing, for better or worse, they're wiring

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.980
together.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:27.059
Dwell in one's experience on themes of stress
or tension or frustration or imminent failure

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:31.849
or self doubt and all the rest of that, guess
what, we're building neural structures of

00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:38.129
pessimism, depression, anxiety, lack of confidence,
insecurity, and inadequacy, self-criticism,

00:24:38.129 --> 00:24:39.129
etc.

00:24:39.129 --> 00:24:44.980
On the other hand, rest experience and cultivate
experiences that have a certain ease to them,

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:51.120
a certain relaxation; never be more than 100
feet away from food, things like that. That's

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:57.529
gonna cultivate neural structures that promote
optimism, resilience, a positive mood, confidence,

00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:00.559
a willingness to reach high and take big risks.

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:06.169
Our experience really, really matters. Much
of it is in the back [inaudible]. People don't

00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:11.289
really know what they're experiencing. That's
why mindful, self-awareness is so critical

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:13.779
or as Ming says, "Searching inside yourself."

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:17.169
I'm really happy I was able to get that line
in here.

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:18.549
Alright. So, that's right.

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:19.549
[laughter]

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:23.649
As I was saying earlier, most people are not
very good a mindful attention. Attention is

00:25:23.649 --> 00:25:28.350
the preeminent way to build neural structure.
It's like a combination spotlight and vacuum

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.940
cleaner. It illuminates what it rests upon
and then shloop sucks it into the brain.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.750
But for most people that spot light and vacuum
cleaner is very skittery. They can't rest

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.409
it and keep it at some place where they wanna
keep it or they can't move it very readily

00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:44.639
if they're getting sucked into obsessive ruminating,
right? Just kinda goin' over and over and

00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:49.090
over again about some technical problem or
some personally upsetting experience.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.229
That's why as William James said, the father
really of American psychology, "The education

00:25:53.229 --> 00:25:57.149
of attention would be an education par excellence."

00:25:57.149 --> 00:26:03.029
So now what are we gonna do with this mindful
self awareness, with the idea of self directed

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:09.190
neuroplasticity? It's the fundamental idea
that we can use the mind to change the brain

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.580
to change the mind for the better.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.070
It was always understood that if people did
mental activity A they would get mental result

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:19.559
C and then it was increasingly understood
during the last hundred years that somehow

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:23.849
mental activity A produced mental result C
via the black box B of the brain.

00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:29.649
But nobody knew how the black box worked.
Increasingly though with these modern technologies

00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:35.580
that can peer inside the living, active brain
non-invasively we are now getting clearer

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:40.669
and clearer about the circuitry, about the
levers, the dials, the buttons, the dynamics

00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:45.690
inside the black box so that it's increasingly
possible to do reverse engineering.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:51.249
In other words, to identify what is the neural
substrate in the black box of optimal states

00:26:51.249 --> 00:26:57.679
of functioning, happiness, relationship, stress
res-relief, and all the rest of that and then

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:04.059
use mental activity alone. Not medication,
not electroshock treatment, but mental activity

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:10.249
alone to target those neural substrates and
build them out in increasingly skillful ways.

00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:14.479
That's the opportunity. And by the way, it's
a historically unprecedented one.

00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:18.879
The knowledge about the brain has essentially
doubled in the last 20 years. I mean, we live

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:22.749
in an historically extraordinary time for
many reasons, this is certainly one of them.

00:27:22.749 --> 00:27:26.799
And it's also historically unprecedented in
the coming together of those three circles

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:32.700
that I talked about previously: psychology,
neurology, and contemplative practice; the

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.649
contemplatives being the Olympic athletes
of mental training for millennia.

00:27:37.649 --> 00:27:41.669
And so I'm really excited about this. We're
just at the beginning of it all. I think modern

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:46.580
neuroscience is roughly where biology and
medicine was about 100 years after the invention

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.669
of the tele, of the microscope, which is to
say about 1720.

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:54.399
Where is it gonna be 300 years? Okay.

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:58.349
So, let's talk about some of the challenges
now. What are we gonna do with this self-directed

00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:02.210
neuroplasticity? We've gotta deal with the
negativity bias.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:06.859
This is a really, really, critically important
slide. In order words, in our evolutionary

00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:11.929
history we had to track carrots and sticks,
right? Approach carrots, avoid sticks. That's

00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:19.899
really important. But for survival purposes
in very harsh frequently lethal environments,

00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:21.559
sticks are more salient than carrots.

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:25.519
In other words, if you miss a carrot today
you'll probably get a chance at one tomorrow.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:27.519
But if you fail to avoid a stick today --

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.799
[claps hands together]

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.970
whap. No more carrots forever.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:36.179
So, the brain responded because Mother Nature
is a harsh teacher. Whatever confers reproductive

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:40.129
advantages, that's what gets built out in
the brain. So there are number of ways this

00:28:40.129 --> 00:28:41.969
is done. I've listed just a few.

00:28:41.969 --> 00:28:46.789
For example, the amygdala which is the alarm
center of the brain is primed to flag negative

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:51.929
events. Probably about two-thirds or more
of its cells are dedicated processors if you

00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:55.769
will for negative information or potentially
negative information.

00:28:55.769 --> 00:29:00.269
And the amygdala and hippocampus are very
close to each other. The hippocampus does

00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:05.749
visual spatial memory but more broadly it
does memory for context, rapidly flag anything

00:29:05.749 --> 00:29:11.470
that's remotely negative, store it, and retrieve
it on a fast track. The bottom line is that

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:16.369
the brain is like Velcro for negative experiences,
but Teflon for positive ones, unless it's

00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:17.889
a million dollar moment.

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:24.539
So, in effect all those three systems: avoid,
approach, attach; the avoid system is very

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:29.879
fast in that reptilian brain if you will,
and it routinely hijacks the approach and

00:29:29.879 --> 00:29:36.150
attach systems and puts them to its bidding.
And therefore, as a result, in the title of

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.679
a very famous paper, Bad Is Stronger Than
Good.

00:29:38.679 --> 00:29:44.879
By the way, I'm gonna post these slides on
my Website and you'll be able to access them

00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:49.129
if want and at the end of them are a bunch
of excellent books as well as a number of

00:29:49.129 --> 00:29:52.960
papers and a ref-and the references for this
presentation.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960
Okay.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.779
So, what are some examples of bad being stronger
than good? In relationships on the average

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:03.869
it takes about five positive interactions
to even out a single negative one. Alright,

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:08.629
what's the history of the last three days
in your intimate relationships, with family

00:30:08.629 --> 00:30:13.509
members, lovers, or children? It-it's quite
cautionary to think about that.

00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:19.589
Or ultimately people will do much more to
avoid losing a loss than getting an equivalent

00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:23.849
gain. In order words, people will work harder
or they'll put up with more electrical shock

00:30:23.849 --> 00:30:28.080
to avoid losing a hundred bucks you gave 'em
in an experiment than they'll work hard to

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.149
get a hundred bucks you put on the table that
they gotta fight for.

00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:37.940
Or last, it's really easy to make people feel
helpless. In dog studies, for example, who

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.869
have a limbic system and emotional system
very much like our own, you can train a dog

00:30:41.869 --> 00:30:47.730
in helplessness in about five tries. Five
cycles where bad things happen that they have

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:52.330
zero control over, roughly you can train 'em
in helplessness and then it takes dozens even

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:57.589
a hundred or more trials to untrain them.
And the parallels for human beings are much

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:58.589
the same.

00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:02.769
That's why I think it's really important to
pay a lot of attention to feeling helpless

00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:09.049
and a sense of futility and to work really
hard to not feel that way. And if nothing

00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:15.450
else redefine the game into one you can actually
win at, where you actually do have efficacy.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:19.539
Now on the, this next question naturally arises
here: yeah, but isn't there some good with

00:31:19.539 --> 00:31:22.779
negative experiences? Well sure, okay.

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:28.810
Remorse keeps us kinda on the path of virtue;
sorrow opens the heart; negative experiences

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:30.611
can increase resilience and all the rest.

00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:37.529
But walk down downtown or walk around this
campus which is a pretty rarefied environment,

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:40.099
look at faces, look at my face. You can see
the suffering in faces.

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:44.700
Is there any shortage of negative experiences
in the world? Is anyone here; would you like

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.179
more negative experiences? We could give you
some of ours.

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:48.179
[laughter]

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:53.450
Any volunteers? I've never had a volunteer
yet who'd like more negative experiences.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.849
So what are we gonna do about this?

00:31:55.849 --> 00:32:00.459
Now, negative experiences it's important to
realize have significant mental and physical

00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:01.459
health consequences.

00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:05.080
I'll just zip through this slide, I won't
get into the detail of it, but chronic stress

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.099
is one of the main results. Because when we're
upset our stress response systems are activated.

00:32:11.099 --> 00:32:16.769
Getting angry, even just irritated, getting
nervous about something, feeling depressed,

00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:22.759
feeling ashamed or inadequate or alarmed in
any way, shape, or form triggers the fight/flight

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:29.909
response systems through the sympathetic nervous
system and HPAA stands for hypothalamic pituitary

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:34.059
adrenal axis; the endocrine system in other
words, because the nervous system and the

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:38.169
endocrine system work together in terms of
stress response. It's pernicious.

00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:42.759
Chronic stress is the enemy particularly for
people who are interested in living past 35.

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:47.459
In order words, unlike our great, great grandparents
in the cave man days, most of us wanna live

00:32:47.459 --> 00:32:48.830
past 35.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.109
What kind of life are we gonna have the slowly
accumulating impacts of chronic stress were

00:32:54.109 --> 00:32:58.709
pretty irrelevant on the Serengeti, three,
five, one millions years ago, but they're

00:32:58.709 --> 00:33:03.320
very relevant today in modern times. Okay.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.259
So, how would you like to do something experiential
for a minute or two, get out of this head

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:09.259
stuff for a second?

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:12.777
So, now that I gave you the bad news and I'm
gonna give you more bad news in a minute,

00:33:12.777 --> 00:33:14.769
I wanna talk about self-compassion for a moment.

00:33:14.769 --> 00:33:19.399
This is a hot area of research. A lot of the
benefits of self-esteem actually boil down

00:33:19.399 --> 00:33:24.399
to self-compassion. Arguably self-compassion's
more powerful, partly 'cause it's so emotional.

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:31.399
Self-compassion is not self-pity, it's not
wallowing, it's taking a moment and it's usually

00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:38.759
typically less than 10 seconds to just have
a sense of, "Ow, that hurts. This sucks. That

00:33:38.759 --> 00:33:47.279
doesn't feel good. I wish it was better. Eh,
shoo, pause then suck it up and move on, right?

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.429
But first do that self-compassion phase.

00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:54.509
And people just suck it up and move on without
having done self-compassion first they haven't

00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:56.210
fueled themselves in a deep way.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.899
Now self-compassion's actually quite hard
for many people. So, as a little example of

00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:05.570
this reverse engineering idea I talked about
earlier, I've thought through what are things

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:11.240
that activate the neural substrates of compassion
so that people can do self-compassion who

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.260
may find it difficult. And that's in those
three bullets right there.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.649
So, I'll do it right now. This is private.
You don't have to do it. You can think about

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:23.310
anything else. You could really even get involved
in self-criticism and self-loathing, but that's

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.710
really up to you.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:30.460
Okay, so first step bring to mind a sense
of being cared about by somebody.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.540
[pause]

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:37.960
Could be a pet, a grandparent, someone in
your life today, a spirit entity, a group

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:45.440
of people, just the felt sense. What's it
feel like to feel cared about?

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.540
[pause]

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.919
Second and you can go at your own pace or
not do this at all.

00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:55.909
Bring to mind also someone that you naturally
feel compassion for. In order words you naturally

00:34:55.909 --> 00:35:03.599
wish that they not suffer. And you have an
attitude of tender concern. Maybe a child,

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:10.900
a dear friend, relative, a group of people,
starving refugees somewhere, whatever.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.900
[pause]

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:19.510
Third step, this is a mindfulness practice
now, sink into the experience of compassion

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.019
in your body. What's it feel like?

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.230
[pause]

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:28.470
Stay present with it.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.880
[pause]

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.380
And then come from that embodied felt sense
of compassion to yourself. With the sense

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:43.150
of the ways in which life is hard, it's not
perfect, you might combine it with some verbal

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.789
inner language like, "You know may I feel
better, may I feel better about this thing,

00:35:47.789 --> 00:35:56.230
may it go better for me with that man or woman
in my life, may I not suffer."

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.839
[pause]

00:35:58.839 --> 00:35:59.839
Okay, great.

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:05.450
I guarantee you if you did it, you let out
neural circuits of self-compassion and every

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:10.180
time you do this it doesn't build much structure
but it builds a little bit of structure. And

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:15.161
if you do it routinely over time those neurons
fire together, therefore they wire together

00:36:15.161 --> 00:36:19.839
and you're building the neural substrates
of self-compassion. Alright.

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:22.190
So, now let's get into some more bad news.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:27.060
I wanna talk here about threat reactivity
and Paper Tiger Paranoia.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.880
If you think about it there're two major mistakes
we can make in life. We, on the one hand we

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.190
can think there is a tiger in the bushes when
there isn't one. Okay?

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.020
On the other hand, we can think there's no
tiger in bushes and its all fine, but there

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.369
really is one about to pounce.

00:36:42.369 --> 00:36:47.900
Now, we evolved to make the first mistake
a hundred times, ten thousand times to avoid

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:53.970
making the second mistake even once 'cause
that's how you stop having gene copies, alright?

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:59.650
This evolutionary tendency which is deeply
ingrained in people to be threat reactive

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:05.000
is then intensified by temperament; some people
are more anxious than others. Then life happens,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.880
personal history. Then you have culture and
then you have political manipulation.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:15.260
It's a classic story obviously throughout
human history to build up a sense of external

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.490
threat or even internal threat and on the
basis of that get more compliance from the

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:25.599
populace. I mean that story's been told a
thousand times or more in human history.

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:30.480
This threat reactivity happens at the individual
level, happens inside me, happens inside you,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.400
it happens between people like in a relationship,
within a family; happens at the level of organizations.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.140
It's interesting to think about how that may
or may not be happening at Google and how

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.539
you've taken wise steps here to stop it from
happening.

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:48.660
And it obviously happens at the national level
and the international level; the level between

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.809
nations in the world all together.

00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:53.940
This has a lot of implications, really, if
you think about the current moment in world

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.940
history.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.140
What are some of the results of this threat
reactivity, both at the individual, organizational,

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.420
and national level?

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.950
First, initial appraisals are mistaken. There's
a tendency to overestimate threats, underestimate

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:12.000
opportunities and underestimate resources
either for coping with threats or for capturing

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.400
opportunities.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.099
We tend to update these appraisals with information
that selectively confirms them and we tend

00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:25.089
to through the mechanisms of what's called
cognitive dissonance, we tend to ignore, devalue,

00:38:25.089 --> 00:38:28.099
or alter information that doesn't fit these
pictures.

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:33.400
Thus we end up with views of ourselves, other
people, and the world, and the future and

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.980
the past that are ignorant, selective, and
distorted.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.230
Any comments or questions so far?

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.230
[pause]

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:49.010
That's the bad news. Now, the good news.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.069
Actually there's more bad news, I apologize.

00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:52.069
[laughter]

00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:54.900
I turned the page too quickly, my mistake.
I was eager to get on.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:01.000
So I thought to myself, "What's a short list
in one slide of the major costs of threat

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.650
reactivity." You could probably add a few
items to this list with a little thought.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.510
For one, feeling threatened feels bad. As
soon as we feel threatened activates the stress

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:15.309
response system. We start getting stress hormones.
We start focusing around the threat and with

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.140
all the consequences I talked about before.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.150
Feeling over threatened makes people over
invest in threat protection and not invest

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:29.040
in things like raising kids or schooling or
building infrastructure or taking long, making

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.230
long term plans.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.950
Then you've got the story of the boy who cried
"Tiger." In other words, if people feel flooded

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:40.530
with threats that are actually not real or,
or are overstated or are easily managed by

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:45.609
one thing or another, it's easy to miss the
needle in the haystack of the actual threat.

00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:46.951
That's really important to think about.

00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:50.640
I think that's one of the things that's happened
with things like global warming, people are

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.820
so caught up in this endless list of murders
on the evening news and a sense of global

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.460
threat all-all around us, and that they miss
long term things that are actually gonna very

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.529
consequential.

00:40:02.529 --> 00:40:07.579
If we act when we're threatened we tend to
overreact; that creates cycles in which other

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:12.049
people feel threatened and confirm our worst
fears. The approach system gets inhibited

00:40:12.049 --> 00:40:16.839
when people feel threatened, when the avoid
system activates so we tend to not pursue

00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:20.269
opportunities or we play small, lose our nerve,
or give up too quickly.

00:40:20.269 --> 00:40:24.000
And then the approach system is, pardon me,
the attach system is put in the service of

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.250
threats; people tend to really bond with us;
they increase their sense of fear and anger

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:37.170
toward them; and they put up with more mistreatment
within us to "protect me, protect me." Strong

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:47.329
father figure if you will, from them out there
about to get me.

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:49.329
[pause]

00:40:49.329 --> 00:40:57.050
Obviously threat reactivity, and you can think
of it on the global scale or even inside this

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:03.289
country, red state, blue state, or even more
locally in terms of different groups of us's

00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:04.859
and thems.

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:09.200
Threat reactivity is a major source of prejudice,
oppression, and war. And if we wanna make

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.880
this world a better place helping people see
through Paper Tiger Paranoia is a fundamentally

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.869
profound and powerful way to do that.

00:41:18.869 --> 00:41:25.029
And my little hope is that Google will in
some ways help that happen.

00:41:25.029 --> 00:41:28.930
So, now let's talk about the optimal brain.
Let's talk about how to deal with this kind

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:34.049
of Paper Tiger Paranoia. And these, by the
way, are practices and tools you can use in

00:41:34.049 --> 00:41:36.829
your own personal life and I'm gonna talk
about them.

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:40.710
So, think about reverse engineering. What's
the state of the brain in peak performance

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:46.349
modes, peek productivity? Or in a state, of
let's say self actualization? Or enlightenment

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:48.269
or close to it?

00:41:48.269 --> 00:41:51.450
Clearly there've been many people throughout
human history that have been in these states.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:56.800
Many of us in this room, probably everybody
in this room has gotten into that zone at

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.309
one time or another.

00:41:58.309 --> 00:42:03.430
What in the world could be happening in the
brain when a person is in that zone?

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:11.890
Well the home base of the human brain which
alas we are so, so easily driven from is characterized

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:17.180
by I call 'em the four C's: calm, contented,
caring, and creative.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.759
And you can see how calm, contented, and caring
map to the three systems, right? Avoid, approach,

00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:28.660
and attach, and creative, generative. People
are generative. Obviously, it's extraordinarily

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.670
generative here.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:35.970
People are generative in particular when they
go into the zone of calm, contented, and caring.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:41.540
This is the brain in its natural; let's call
it a responsive mode. It's not offline; it's

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:48.150
not anesthetized; it's engaged in the world,
it's embodied and it's enactive. It's continually

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:53.319
leaning forward into the future, but it does
so in a particular mode of operation.

00:42:53.319 --> 00:42:58.339
To look at it in a schematic you can see this
triangle here in which the three systems,

00:42:58.339 --> 00:43:02.470
and by the way, this graphic comes from a
little earlier form of this material in which

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.230
I called the attach system "affiliation system."

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:11.009
It can see the way in which the brain operates;
your brain, my brain operates, our brains

00:43:11.009 --> 00:43:14.150
operate when we're in this natural state.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:19.839
The problem though is that to survive we leave
home. In other words, on a hair trigger Mother

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:25.230
Nature has given us the capability of activating
any one of these three systems or all three

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:31.109
of them in concert in a different kind of
mode. Call it a reactive mode that then drives

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:34.059
us from home. It's a kind of inner homelessness.

00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:38.380
In other words, when people feel threatened
or harm they're in the reactive mode. When

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.430
they can't attain important goals, they're
frustrated or disappointed, reactive mode.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:47.710
When they feel isolated, abandoned, devalued,
they're not getting the healthy normal narcissistic

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:53.730
supplies they need, when they feel left out,
dissed, shunned, and so forth that also triggers

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.779
this reactive mode.

00:43:54.779 --> 00:44:01.970
And it too has a number of consequences. So
here's a little slide that summarizes that.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.800
So those are the choices really, reactive
mode which is the ordinary experience. Look

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.900
at the front page, it's all reactive mode.
Watch the evening news, mostly reactive mode.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.890
A lot of life. Think about dealing with some
issue with an intimate, a friend, a partner,

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:15.890
a family member.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:20.430
As they say in the spiritual biz, "Think you're
enlightened? Go visit your parents for the

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:25.760
holidays." What's it like in the real world?
What's it like in traffic when someone flips

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:31.660
you off? What's it like when you, the person
you like least as a political figure is yappin'

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.710
away on the evening news? What happens then?
We easily get triggered into this reactive

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:37.710
mode.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:43.900
So now, what to do about it; how to come home.
How to recover the fundamental natural responsive

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.510
mode of the brain right in the middle of the
trenches; not in a cave in Tibet; not in a

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:53.990
monastery, but in daily life one step at a
time, one breath at a time.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.359
As the Tibetans say, "If you take care of
the minutes, the years will take care of themselves."

00:44:58.359 --> 00:45:02.710
So how can each one of us take care of the
minutes in our own life or help others take

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.259
care of the minutes in their lives so that
year, so that the years will get better and

00:45:06.259 --> 00:45:08.359
better for this planet?

00:45:08.359 --> 00:45:13.720
Well, first I wanna talk about three fundamental
pillars of practice that show up in contemplative

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:20.030
traditions as well as in Western psychology:
mindfulness, virtue, and wisdom.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:25.130
And by different terms you see these again
and again and again and I think that's because

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:30.539
they map to three central functions arguably
the three central functions of the nervous

00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:37.660
system which is to say receiving and learning;
regulating and prioritizing which map very

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:43.910
closely to mindfulness, virtue and wisdom.
And which also map to the three fundamental

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:51.310
phases of any kind of personal growth or emotional
healing which is to say, "Open up to it. Experience

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.819
it. Be with it. Be mindful of it."

00:45:53.819 --> 00:46:00.299
Second phase at the just right moment, help
it move along, release that negative stuff.

00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:05.970
And then third phase when there's a space
there replace it with something better. Or

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.910
in six words, "Let be, let go, let in."

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:15.299
And the reason I think that these fundamental
pillars of practice are found again and again,

00:46:15.299 --> 00:46:20.150
including in traditions that were certainly
pre-technical, is because they map so closely

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.019
to the universal human nervous system.

00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:27.609
As a take away point at the bottom, mindfulness
is viable but it's not enough. Mindfulness

00:46:27.609 --> 00:46:33.349
needs to be matched with virtue, with values,
and with wisdom. Some fundamental understanding;

00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:37.380
somebody who wants to find wisdom always asks,
giving up a lesser pleasure for a greater

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.380
one.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.339
I mean it's that clarity about what is the
greater good here that I'm gonna sacrifice

00:46:42.339 --> 00:46:46.150
this lesser pleasure for. I mean that's-that's
wisdom.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:51.839
Additionally, I wanna talk, there's some general
factors for the responsive mode that I just

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.150
wanna call to your attention here.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:59.630
If you wanna drop your brain into its natural
state of calm, contented, caring, and creative,

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:06.039
self-compassion, getting on your own side.
So many people are not on their own side.

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:07.519
In other words they're not for themselves.

00:47:07.519 --> 00:47:12.720
It's so interesting to think about it. That's
a critical mo-moment to actually say, "No.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:18.509
How it feels to be me matters. My brain matters
over time. I'm gonna be for myself. I'm gonna

00:47:18.509 --> 00:47:24.079
try to do little things everyday that will
build a better brain or other aspects of my

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:26.009
life gradually over time."

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.980
Mindful self-awareness I've talked about.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.420
Seeing the world clearly. I think Google has
helped enormously here and it can continue

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:39.130
to help in the future particularly by appreciating
the depth of threat reactivity; the depth

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.970
of the paranoid trance and the insidiousness
of it.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:47.359
Taking life less personally; appreciating
increasingly that it's not really about me

00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:51.930
and one particular practice which is the chapter
in my book, Buddhist Brain, and will probably

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:57.670
be very central to the book I write after
the one I'm writing now, is taking in the

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.670
good.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.390
And so if we could I'd like to do a little
practice here with you about taking in the

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:07.200
good, 'cause if you think about it continually
the brain is taking in the bad, 'member? It's

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.700
like Velcro for negative experiences; Teflon
for positive ones. It has dedicated --

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.700
[snapping fingers]
snap, snap, snap

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.940
systems that just suck any kind of negative
information into the brain.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.700
Think about a hundred things happen in the
course of the day, right? Seventy are pretty

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:25.563
good, 28 are neutral, 2 are kinda sucky. What
are the ones you think about as you fall asleep?

00:48:25.563 --> 00:48:30.230
Usually it's the stuff that was a drag, right?
And that's the brain. It just wants to grab

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.349
hold of that.

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:36.599
That's why using mindful awareness for about
20, 30 seconds in a row can actually build

00:48:36.599 --> 00:48:39.549
out neural structure in a much more positive
way.

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:42.029
So if you like, let's do it together. And
you don't have to do it, but let's give it

00:48:42.029 --> 00:48:43.029
a crack.

00:48:43.029 --> 00:48:48.240
So first off, first step, pick a positive
fact. It could be I-I particularly like picking

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.039
a positive fact about a good quality inside
yourself. Where ever you go, there you are,

00:48:53.039 --> 00:48:57.380
right? Or you could think about a good condition
in the world or a good event recently; someone

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.249
was nice to you, some good thing happened.

00:48:59.249 --> 00:49:03.599
And then let yourself really feel it. All
kinds of good facts occur, but we don't register

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:08.160
them. They don't move the needle, but in this
case we're helping ourselves 'cause we're

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.930
on our own side to let our self feel good.
It's a private act; no one needs to know you're

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:13.930
doing it.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:17.890
There are lots of taboos about feeling good,
feeling happy, you can hide it behind your

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:22.799
face, but let yourself feel good and then
in particular in the second step savor it

00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:33.099
for 15, 20, 30 seconds in a row. Stay with
feeling good for a quarter of a minute.

00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:34.740
[pause]

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:44.349
And as you do it, sense and intend that this
good experience is gradually sifting down

00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:52.470
into you. It's sinking in and even perhaps
filling a hole in your heart. Gradually soothing,

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:55.769
even replacing perhaps old places of pain.

00:49:55.769 --> 00:49:57.950
[pause]

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:01.999
Or at a minimum simply being a moment of good
experience.

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:07.400
[pause]

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.700
And that's it.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.660
Now, any single time you do this won't make
much difference, half a dozen times a day,

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:18.230
continually looking for opportunities to take
in the good to make your brain like Velcro

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:22.749
for positive experiences will make it like
Teflon for negative ones.

00:50:22.749 --> 00:50:26.710
And over time, everyone I've ever worked with
whose done this within a week or two people

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.319
start feeling different, within a few weeks
and certainly a few months quite radically

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:31.319
different.

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:35.509
This is also a fantastic method for children,
particularly kids that either the spirited

00:50:35.509 --> 00:50:40.829
or anxious, rigid ends of the temperamental
spectrum. Jack rabbits and turtles, right?

00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:45.220
They're all normal. There's no disorder there
in jack rabbititis; it's a normal temperamental

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:49.450
variation, but it's tough to be a jack rabbit
in a turtle culture in some ways, certainly

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:50.980
in turtle schools.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.249
So, anyway taking in the good for a few moments
just before bed is a great way to fill the

00:50:55.249 --> 00:50:58.809
heart of kids. And I'll use metaphors with
them like putting a jewel in their heart and

00:50:58.809 --> 00:50:59.809
so forth.

00:50:59.809 --> 00:51:04.999
It naturally comes up of course, why do this?
Which inter, is an interesting question, like

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:08.130
what a taboo right there on feeling good.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.970
Benefits of positive emotions are kind of
a proxy for the benefits of taking in the

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.640
good. There's a lot of research on positive
emotions. I'll just leave that slide there

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.970
for a moment. But positive emotions, wow,
have fantastic benefits. Happiness really

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.680
is skillful means.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.720
If you take a look at my Website, wisebrain.org
you'll see the slide sets for a number of

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.500
talks and one of the nice things about positive
emotions is they steady the mind 'cause they

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.440
do it in various ways having to do with dopamine
and working memory, but it's a great way to

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.700
support concentration and productivity to
encourage positive emotion.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:47.549
Also it comes up whether it's selfish to feel
happy. And I think Bertrand Russell had a

00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:52.299
fantastic line here. He pointed out that as
he conceived of it right, "The good life is

00:51:52.299 --> 00:51:55.630
a happy one because happy people are good
people."

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:59.930
And there's a lot of research that shows that,
with some significant exceptions, people who

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.460
have basic well being, who already have a
sense of overflowingness inside themselves,

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.900
are more inclined to offer benefit to other
people.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.809
So, from the standpoint obviously of productivity
and reducing turnover and anything like that,

00:52:12.809 --> 00:52:18.380
whether it's at Google or any company in the
world, helping people feel happy at work is

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.579
a great way to promote productivity and generosity
and teamwork and team building with other

00:52:23.579 --> 00:52:26.390
people.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.170
Moving to an end here and then hoping to have
a few more minutes for questions and discussion

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.170
at the end.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:36.589
I also took a look at specific factors that
are, may not be so obvious for activating

00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:41.039
the responsive mode of the brain for each
one of these three fundamental systems.

00:52:41.039 --> 00:52:47.529
In the approach system for example, focusing
on gladness and gratitude; fantastic.

00:52:47.529 --> 00:52:50.619
People do things like the three blessings
exercise at the end of the day. They just

00:52:50.619 --> 00:52:54.559
list three things to be grateful for; take
half a minute to focus on them. That has had

00:52:54.559 --> 00:52:56.990
amazing results for such a simple intervention.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:03.410
And giving one's self over to one's best purposes
is another way to activate the approach system

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.519
in a context of prior contentment and wisdom.

00:53:07.519 --> 00:53:11.269
The affiliating system, one I wanna call out
there is the last one the idea of acting with

00:53:11.269 --> 00:53:16.910
unilateral virtue. In other words, living
by your own code of integrity and good conduct

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:20.309
regardless of what the other person does.
In other words, not getting involved in this

00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:22.170
kind of Mexican standoff.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:26.230
I do couples counseling as well as other things
where people basically say, "I'll treat you

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:30.299
well if you treat me well. You go first."
And we know where that really gets us.

00:53:30.299 --> 00:53:34.349
On the other hand, if you act with unilateral
virtue, it makes you feel good right off the

00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:39.440
top; it also gives you a sense of initiative;
and it puts you on the high moral ground so

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.220
that after a few days or weeks even you can
then say very rightfully to the other person,

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.410
"I stopped being a jerk. I'm givin' you what
you want. I'm lining off your reasonable complaints.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.000
Alright, how 'bout me?" Okay?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.460
And then last with regard to the avoid system,
calming the body in general. As soon as we

00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:01.499
get activated in the stress response system
we're primed to go negative 'cause those systems

00:54:01.499 --> 00:54:05.549
are disposed and lean toward negative responsiveness.

00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:11.299
So, activating a calming, soothing response
whenever we feel stressed or upset is a good

00:54:11.299 --> 00:54:12.829
basic default.

00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:17.720
And then I would say last, tolerate risking
a dreaded experience. We live small. We live

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:22.680
in a way to avoid experiences we dread, and
then that becomes the new normal and after

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.259
awhile we start to forget about it.

00:54:24.259 --> 00:54:28.829
It's a little bit like these tigers that are
in cages, speaking of tigers. They remove

00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:33.249
the cage because they've built a park around
them, but the tiger will not cross the line

00:54:33.249 --> 00:54:37.210
that's written, that's painted there on the
cement because they still live within that

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.920
box. They still presume that limitation.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:45.589
The trick is to risk the dreaded experience
instead of avoiding it. In other words, put

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:51.430
one's neck out in a meeting; tell someone
you love them; open up to some feelings and

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:55.630
see that it goes well which it usually does.
Okay?

00:54:55.630 --> 00:55:00.839
In effect, this is in the traditional phrase,
"taking a fruit as the path." In other words,

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:06.869
taking the end as the means. Taking the end
of calm, contentment, and caring are here

00:55:06.869 --> 00:55:12.801
in this, and I reordered it, gladness, love
and peace, taking that as the method as well

00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:13.849
as the destination.

00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:17.920
In, for example, literally I found myself
increasing; I just named these three words

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.530
to myself. I did before I came down here to
give this talk which was making me nervous

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:29.799
I said, "Rick, gladness, love, peace, okay,
good. In the zone. Okay. Good place."

00:55:29.799 --> 00:55:33.230
Whatever works for you to get in your zone,
different things work for different people.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:38.279
All the great teachers have offered huge tool
boxes with a diversity of tools. Neurological

00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:42.849
diversity is the most critically important
and fundamental and substantive kind of diversity

00:55:42.849 --> 00:55:43.920
there really is.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.099
And so, that's why I think is really important
to find one's own way.

00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:54.220
That gives us a fundamental choice, right?
Reactive mode which is the ordinary lot, characterized

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.579
tries by suffering, ignorance and harm. Or
the responsive mode; the natural state of

00:55:58.579 --> 00:56:04.769
the brain which can see through Paper Tiger
Paranoia and can be gradually cultivated with

00:56:04.769 --> 00:56:06.290
self-directed neuroplasticity.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:11.859
And that's the opportunity for us all today.
It's historically unprecedented; it's grounded

00:56:11.859 --> 00:56:17.160
in science; papers are coming out everyday
basically with new opportunities to figure

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:21.769
out how to reverse engineer the brain and
each one of us can do this in our own lives

00:56:21.769 --> 00:56:24.739
with benefits that ripple throughout the entire
planet.

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:29.900
So, I thank you for your attention. It's a
great privilege to be here.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:30.900
[applause]

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.930
Thank you, very much.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:37.239
Question or comment for the last minute?

00:56:37.239 --> 00:56:38.789
One or, one? Yes, no?

00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:43.249
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1:
I have a question about I-I-I've heard that

00:56:43.249 --> 00:56:49.390
a number of traditions anyway say that if
you're trying to make a change in your consciousness

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:54.299
when a point comes, the point comes when you
can actually make a shift, there will be an

00:56:54.299 --> 00:57:00.049
opposite, there will be a-a resistance, there'll
be like a, a pull from where you came from

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:02.830
that will try to keep the status quo.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:10.160
How does that, is-is that know as an actual
something that happens in the brain that tries

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.569
to keep us in our, in our previously more
contractive consciousness?

00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:18.160
&gt;&gt;Rick Hanson:
I think that's true in two ways and wonderfully

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.349
untrue in a third, alright?

00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:25.170
First, the brain is a giant association network.
Everything's connected to everything else.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:29.539
So if we have a breakthrough over here we
still have that old learning over there. People

00:57:29.539 --> 00:57:33.880
say to me sometimes, "I feel guilty that I'm
still upset about my childhood." Right? Well

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.460
of course you are. The brain learned. It's
designed to learn and that learning persists

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.309
until it gradually is replaced or overcome,
first.

00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:46.819
Second, it's very interesting how the brain
is organized. It's very much basically yin

00:57:46.819 --> 00:57:52.829
and yang, in effect, on stop and go. Inhibitor
fire, that's the way the brain are organized.

00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:58.170
And I think a lot of knowledge structures
in the brain are organized around figuring

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:03.210
ground or something in its thesis antithesis
in effect.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:07.900
So, when you break through in one area or
you think about something very often the opposite

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.900
comes up.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:13.480
For example, think about something that makes
you feel proud of yourself; pause. Very often

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:17.839
something will come up that's associated with
self-doubt. So-so what you're saying I think

00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:19.039
is natural.

00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:23.420
That said, very often people will have a breakthrough
and they get a release, they're done with

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.239
it. They saw through it; they changed; they
got it.

00:58:27.239 --> 00:58:33.780
I love the line from practice, "Gradual cultivation,
sudden awakening, gradual cultivation, sudden

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.800
awakening, gradual cultivation, sudden awakening."

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.430
So very often what we have, is we have awakenings;
we have insights; we realize something. Then

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:44.670
we've got to cultivate around it; we've got
to back fill; we've gotta build an infrastructure

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:48.980
which then enables the next awakening; the
next insight; the next breakthrough; the next

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.089
release to be even deeper.

00:58:51.089 --> 00:58:55.920
But something I've really come to see, honestly,
I've been a therapist a long time; it's made

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.839
me more compassionate, but it's made me tough
as nails in this sense that most people will

00:59:00.839 --> 00:59:07.160
not do the work. But if you do the work, the
sky's the limit in the changes you can make

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.230
in your mind, your brain, and your life, and
in this world.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:12.230
Okay, thank you.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:13.230
[applause]

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.231
Thanks.
