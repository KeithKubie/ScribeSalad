00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.120
 Have you ever felt that the rich are more arrogant and selfish? 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.940
 Well, we have decided that the time has come to see if the rich, really, are more likely to become villains. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.760
 Did it happen that you were taken while driving? Most likely this was by Mercedes driven by a 20-year-old man. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.380
 Multiple studies have found that the higher the cost of a car the more likely it is not just to skip other cars 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.240
 But also driving through the footpaths when pedestrians are waiting to cross. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.080
 One study showed that those with the most expensive cars were walking 42% of the time. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.040
 Now, imagine that you waited in line for 10 minutes to buy coffee and cakes at Starbucks 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.460
 But when I became a few blocks away, I realized that the employee gave you $ 20 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 Instead of the $ 10 you provided him. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.240
 Do you: a) Enjoy your coffee and keep $ 10 extra 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.180
 Or b) return your drawer and return the money? 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.940
 The richest people seem to answer that they will keep money. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 Also, how much money you own affects how you look at others. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.480
 In a study, using Google glasses to track eye movements of people walking in a neighborhood 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.020
 Rich people spend much less time exchanging social views. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.400
 In other words they are more likely to ignore others. 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.920
 But the rich are certainly more generous with the poor, right? 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 Although the rich may get a bigger check 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.480
 In the United States, survey data at the national level show that the wealthy contribute less to their family income. 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.120
 For example, for a US family whose income is less than $ 25,000, they donate about 4.2% of their income. 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.780
 While households with incomes of $ 100,000 or more contributed only 2.7%. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 As well as the arbitrary baptism or arbitrary granting of power to persons, 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.480
 Making them more selfish. 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.900
 Imagine that you put in a group of 3 people to make some important policy recommendations, 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.240
 You were told that you are in charge of the group. 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.480
 Place in front of you a dish with 5 delicious cakes. Of course everyone takes one. Do you take another? 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.700
 It turns out in studies that the person in charge has a greater likelihood of taking the fourth cookies 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.960
 While everyone leaves the last one in the dish to be more polite. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.020
 So do the more rude people become more inclined to become rich? 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.700
 Or is riches making you worse? 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.420
 Contrary to what we believe, people are more likely to get power in a group 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.540
 They are, in fact, emotionally intelligent, who focus on others, be generous, and do not bully. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.780
 Studies found that university students at the top of the social pyramid 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 Tend to be socially positive, sensitive, and not ananine. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 This is due to our roots in hunting and assembly, as individuals who share food and resources rise in ranks. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.660
 But this leads to a paradox of power. 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.480
 For power, you need empathy. 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.640
 But once you feel strong, you become more self-centered. 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.740
 You can even see it in the brain when using MRI. 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.540
 Areas such as the prefrontal cortex that are active when understanding mental states or taking into account the thoughts of others 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.360
 Less activity appears in people with higher social status. 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.600
 The poor also have a greater ability to assess the emotional state of others 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 They have higher interactions between people 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.340
 They are more connected to the eye, gesture, and laughter. 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.500
 Compared to the wealthiest people, who are more interested in improving their appearance, meditation, or drawing. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.840
 One possible explanation for this is that people with fewer substances 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.820
 Depend more resources and privileges on others to meet their needs, 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.700
 This creates pressure on them to be more emotionally intelligent. 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.820
 And of course not all the wealthy are the villains. 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.040
 But in general, the more your wealth is, the less sympathy you have. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.940
 Making statistically rich people more likely to be bullies. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.400
 In today's video 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.200
 We have cooperated with 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.180
 Audible, which shows everyone who watches this video an opportunity to try it for free for 30 days 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.240
 Listening is the best way to end the content you love while doing the things you love. 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.340
 The Audible has the largest collection of audio books on this planet here. 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.380
 Such as our recommendation for this day, which is the influential book of mind by Tali Sharot. 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.340
 He discusses how data is not always the best way to change someone's mind 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.000
 Instead, it examines the mechanism of our minds when we are opinions or try to make audible arguments. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.420
 Audible allows you to switch seamlessly between devices whether your car, tablet, or phone. 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.460
