00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.663
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.170
&gt;&gt; In 1995 after a 30-year
career in 6 countries,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.150
he retired to that leisurely
life of full time writing,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.273
which we all know is so easy.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.483
He writes a regular column on
Sunday for the Times of India,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.010
and he's also a frequent contributor
to the Wall Street Journal,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.983
the Financial Times,
and Time Magazine.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.296
He's here today to talk
about his most recent book

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.423
which is called The Difficulty
of Being Good: On the Subtle Art

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.196
of Dharma which asks the
question, why be good?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.943
This is also a sort of
homecoming for Mr. Das

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.116
who attended our Roosevelt
High School in Washington,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.876
D.C. So, Mr. Das, welcome home.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.310
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.430
&gt;&gt; Das: You do me honor by
coming here to listen to me.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.510
Someone just called me a management
guru, and I didn't get a chance

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.536
to tell him that my idea of such
a guru is somebody who's good

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.636
at understanding, "gu,"
but relatively useless.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.013
[Laughter] In my last
book, India Unbound,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.416
I predicted the economic rise
of India, and if I was that sort

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.286
of person, I would tell you
today that I told you so.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.190


00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.870
[Laughter] So prosperity is
spreading in India as it is

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.666
in China, but happiness is not.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.270
India will turn into a middle class
country like the west or like some

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800
of the countries in the Far East,
but what is troubling is the fact

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.290
that we have the most
appalling governance.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.006
You've been reading about the
Commonwealth games fiasco.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.063
That's just one example,
and I'm not thinking

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.080
of a minister who's
got with a bride.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.690
That happens everywhere.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.090
I'm thinking of how
governance hurts the poor.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.290
One out of four schoolteachers
in a government primary school

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320
in India does not show
up, and one out of four

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.733
who shows up is not teaching.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500


00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.936
Governance failure, and I could
give you many examples like this.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.416
Governance failure
has two dimensions.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.950
One is the economic dimension
or the institutional dimension.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.893
In other words, if you could
punish an absent schoolteacher,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.530
all the schoolteachers would show up
the next day, and schoolteachers now

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.083
in India earn 22,000 rupees a month

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.823
which is seven times per
capita income of India.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.986
So it's a good salary.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.386
Most countries the per capita
income relationship is one is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.336
to two instead of one is to
seven, and that is why I say

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.030
that if there's a race between
India and China, if there is a race,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.233
it will be decided by the fact if
India fixes its governance first

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.180
or China fixes its politics first

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.613
because both countries are
going to become prosperous.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.013
They're going to rise economically.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.130
But there's a moral dimension.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.960
If the schoolteacher shows up,
would that schoolteacher teach

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.603
with inspiration saying that I'm
preparing the next generation?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.336
And so to examine the
moral dimension,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.573
in this book The Difficulty of
Being Good, I go to the epic,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.233
the 2,500-year-old epic, the
Mahabharata [assumed spelling].

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.950
Now why this bizarre undertaking?

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.903
Well, the first thing is the
Mahabharata is unique and engaging

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.356
in the world of politics.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.233
Second, the Mahabharata
is obsessed with dharma.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.140
Now many of you know in this country
karma, but you don't know dharma.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.326
Dharma can mean many things.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.413
It can mean law, it can mean
duty, it can mean virtue,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.006
but essentially it means doing
the right thing, and so, you know,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.870
in a Greek epic like the Iliad,
if Achilles does something wrong

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.690
to Hector, well he
just gets on with it.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.280
In the Mahabharata, the action
stops, and everybody weighs in as

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.156
to what went wrong and the
argumentative Indian takes over.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.830


00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.276
The third reason is
that dharma, nobody asks

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.796
and the Mahabharata says, "Let
us ask God for what is dharma."

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.413
In your tradition, in
Christianity, for example,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.963
you have the Ten Commandments,
and so you have to wrestle

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.476
with it yourself, and I believe

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.513
that good moral reasoning
is behind good moral action.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.296
And finally, the notion of
dharma is a pragmatic notion.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.696
It does not seek moral perfection.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.406
Hence it is more suited for policy
makers and for political leaders.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.176
So my book is one man's search for
dharma in our contemporary world,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.713
and dharma understood
both as private virtue,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.243
but also public or civic virtue.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.026
So how do I go about what's my
strategy to connect bad governance

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.190
with the Mahabharata, with
dharma, and try to learn something

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.186
about the moral dimension
of our life?

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.683
Most of the story of Mahabharata
is very straightforward.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.646
It's a, it's a rivalry between
two sets of cousins, two children,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.986
sets of children of two brothers,
and it's a rivalry for the throne,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.023
and to contain that rivalry,
the kingdom is divided

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.326
and the better half
goes to the bad guys,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.176
and the worst half
goes to the good guys.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.173
The good guys are called the
Pandavas [assumed spelling],

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.843
and the bad guys are called the
Kauravas [assumed spelling],

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.836
but the good guys are diligent,
hard working, and talented people

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.243
like all of you here, and
they clear the forest.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.783
They build themselves
a beautiful capital.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.203
They are, they have a great
warrior, Arjuna [assumed spelling],

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.350
on their side, so they
expand their dominions.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.706
They have diplomatic skills,
and so they make alliances,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.453
and suddenly they become the
most powerful kingdom in India,

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:39.663
and so the eldest brother,
Udistir [assumed spelling],

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:46.636
is told that now you must
have a [inaudible] ceremony

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.986
of consecrating you as emperor.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.073
So all the kings and nobles
of the surrounding areas come

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.196
to this great ceremony bringing
lots of tribute and wealth.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.823
Also invited is the eldest brother
on the other side, their neighbor,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.553
[inaudible], and when he sees
the success of his cousins,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.516
he grows envious, and his
uncle who has accompanied him,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.486
Shakuni [assumed spelling], he says,
"My lord, you go, you grow pale

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.640
and sick," and he listened to what
Duryodhana [assumed spelling] says.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.576
He says, "What man
of metal will stand

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.300
to see his rivals prosper
and himself decline?

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.750
What man of metal will
see his neighbor prosper?"

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.756
And in this he has captured
the awful nature of envy,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.920
something that afflicts
us all as human beings

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.676
and something we never
admit and never forgive.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.036
You can understand jealousy.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.376
Jealously is that I'm afraid my
friend may run away with my wife,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.503
and you will sympathize
with me, but envy,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.430
just because my friend
is doing well,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.836
that I should feel
bad and diminished.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880
Oh, I pretend.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.813
I go and congratulate him,
but inside I don't like it,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.680
and envy strikes us
when we are very young.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.170
I remember when I was 5 years
old there was another boy

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.983
in our neighborhood who had a red
toy engine, and I hated him for it,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.750
and when he was not
looking, I broke it.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.150


00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.913
[Laughter] Terrible.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.593
They did a study at
Harvard University,

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.436
and asked the graduating class,

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.540
"Would you like to earn
hundred thousand dollars a year

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.356
or fifty thousand dollars a year?"

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.220
Of course everybody wanted
to earn hundred thousand,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.993
but then they put a condition

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.853
that if you earn hundred
thousand dollars,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.706
your friends will be
earning two hundred thousand,

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.846
and if you earn fifty thousand,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.790
then your friends will be
earning twenty-five thousand.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.283
Do you know that 83% of the
people switched their answer,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.726
and that's why CEO's know
that compensation is relative.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.730


00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.140
Anyway, when I grew up, I ran this
company Procter &amp; Gamble in Bombay,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.673
and our factory was next
door to the Phillips factory,

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.743
you know the Dutch
electronics company,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.800
and the Phillips factory had
been on strike for a whole year,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.933
and we were worried what
was going to happen to us,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.090
and one day I heard the union
leader of the Phillips factory say

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.593
that I don't care if we ever
open this factory again as long

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.493
as the Dutch factory
manager goes down.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.510
[ Pause ]

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.793
This is why I think they're right
when they say that if the sin

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.166
of capitalism is greed, the
sin of socialism is envy,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.093
and envy affects our
lives, our public lives,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.396
private lives in terrible ways.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.813
You know, I never understood how

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.823
in the 1930's decent middle
class Germans allowed themselves

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.890
to be swayed by Hitler
in this terrible way

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.633
and the way what they did to the
Jews until I read that more than 50%

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.460
of the professionals of
Berlin and Vienna were Jews.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.806
Sixty-four percent of the
physicians of Vienna were Jews

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.200
when the total population
of Jews was less than 10%.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.690
So those societies were
seething with envy.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.610
Anyway, let's come back
to the Mahabharata.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.040
So the uncle says, "Look these
Pandavas have grown too powerful,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.310


00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.656
and so we can't take them on in a
straight contest," and so he says,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.196
"We will have to use strategy."

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.906
Now what does he mean by strategy?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.033
He says, "I'm the best
dice player in the world,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.136
and Yudhishtira [assumed spelling],
the eldest, the king, the good guy,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.353
is the worst, but he's
addicted to gambling."

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.273
Plus he says, "You can't lose

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.873
because I cheat, and
nobody knows how."

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.030
And sure enough there is a gambling
match set up, and all the kings

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.770
and nobles come to this, and
Yudhishtira loses everything.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.546
He loses his horses, his armies,
his kingdom, and he loses,

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.840
then he loses his brothers.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.626
Then he stakes himself and he
loses himself and finally his wife.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.356
And so to humiliate the good guys,
the Pandavas, who've been trapped

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.316
in this game of dice, the
bad guys drag in the queen,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.033
Draupadi [assumed spelling], who's
a beautiful woman off the Pandavas

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.286
to humiliate the Pandavas
in a patriarchical society,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.093
but they don't count on this woman.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.473
She's no weeping lady who's going
to stand up there to be humiliated.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.326
So she asks the question,
"Did my husband lose me first,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.850
or did he lose himself first?"

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.680
And immediately the
Kaurava sense a trap

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.926
because he had lost himself
first, and, of course,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.040
if he had lost himself first,
then he was no longer competent

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.430
to gamble her because only a free
person-he was already a slave-only a

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.013
free person can gamble anything.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.890


00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.796
Anyway, the bad guys are not going
to be deterred by this, so they say,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.610
"Strip her," and the younger brother
gets up and starts pulling her sari,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.016
and as he pulls her sari, the
sari keeps expanding infinitely,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.860
and after half an hour, he
sits down tired and humiliated,

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.056
and at this point, Draupadi,
the queen, gets very angry,

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.053
and she looks at this
assembly, and she says,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.583
"How did you let this happen?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.350
You are kings and tell me what
is the dharma of the king?"

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.743
And there is silence, and
particularly she looks

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:43.500
at the elder statesman,
the grandfather,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.206
Bhishma [assumed spelling],
but nobody says a word

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.423
at which point they are told
that when a crime occurs,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.276
one-half the punishment goes to
the person who commits the crime,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.160
a quarter of the punishment goes
to the ally, but a quarter goes

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.973
to those who remained silent.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.120


00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.926
Now we have a very important
piece of legislation right now

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.756
in the Indian parliament which is
called the Whistle-Blower Bill,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.383
which is to encourage people not
to remain silent to protect them,

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.050


00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.490
[background noise] and let me
return back to the Mahabharata.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.510


00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.050
People want to know
what actually happened.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.616
Why did the miracle take place?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.420
And there's a lot of
discussion, and one person says

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.216
that well, it was dharma.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:14.203
Dharma also means cosmic justice,
that she was a good woman,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.490
and therefore, the miracle
of the expanding sari.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.546
Now the Mahabharata is a
very popular story in India,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.453
and we had recently in the 90's,
a very pop, hugely popular,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.503
the largest ratings on
television, serial over 104 weeks,

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.610
of the Mahabharata, and when
the Draupadi episode came,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.346
a clever [inaudible] company
marketed a Draupadi collection

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.563
of saris, but those saris
unfortunately did not expand

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.400
infinitely, so the company did
not gain much market share.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000


00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.130
Anyway, now the Pandavas
are in the forest.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.336
They have been exiled
for losing their kingdom,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.683
and Draupadi sees her husband
sleeping on the hard earth,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.083
and she says, "My heart weeps for
you who have always slept on sheets

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.863
of silk and pillows of down."

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.283
They had goose down
pillows in those days.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.426
And you with thousand
retainers," and she says,

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.716
"What kind of world is this that are
the good people destined to suffer

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.913
and the bad people who stole
our kingdom in a rigged game

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.686
of dice destined to live in
palaces" or mansions in Georgetown

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.463
or wherever the rich live?

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.730


00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.506
And there's a, so she tells her
husband, "Look, let's get an army

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.190
and let's go and win our
kingdom back, and your dharma,

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.430
you're a warrior [inaudible] and
your dharma is to wage a just war,

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.793
and our kingdom was stolen from us.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.396
That's a just war."

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:42.000
And he says, "No, my dharma is that
I've given my word that we will go

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.646
into exile for 13 years."

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.333
So you see there's a
clash in the Mahabharata

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.633
of two different meanings of dharma,
dharma as a warrior whose virtue

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.273
to fight or dharma as having
a more personal virtue

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.923
as having given my
word, and this clash

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.466
of dharma is what drives
the narrative forward.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.876
Anyway, they have a long
discussion at this point,

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.333
and the royal counselor,
Vitura [assumed spelling],

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.153
who visits them says,
"Dharma is very easy to know.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.253
All you have to do is
look at the consequences."

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:27.613
He's a public figure, so he
looks at the consequences,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.653
and if an act helps the
people, then its dharma.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.296
If it does not, then it's not
dharma and so, but Yudhishtira says

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.450
that I act because I must meaning
that he looks at his own motivations

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.156
when he acts, and there
was, when I was working

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.336
on this chapter there was a report
in the newspaper about a child

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:08.583
who was drowning in the coast of
Goa, and a young man jumped in

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.640
and saved this child, and
the reporter from Times

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.660
of India said, "You're a hero.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.926
Why did you do it?"

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.453
And he said, "Well, we are a
college party, and I was trying

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.753
to impress a girl in our
party," [laughter] and she says,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.733
"But then you're not a hero,"

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.416
but Vitura would have said the child
was saved, the dharma was done,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:41.916
but you see Yudhishtira
would have jumped

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.250
in even if nobody was looking.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.410
So you see how the
Mahabharata helps you

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.583
to improve your moral
reasoning skills.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.103
Now, I could go on and on,

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.843
and the fact is constantly
the Mahabharata makes you look

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.766
in the mirror, look at the absentee
schoolteachers in the mirror,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.360
shows them the mirror,
and raises questions

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.663
of governance and moral failure.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.270
It's a dark story.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.596
It's a dark story because it
leads, there's a, the Kaurava,

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.316
Pandavas come back, the Kauravas
don't give them back their kingdom.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.070
There's a war, and on the first
day of the war the general

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:43.450
of the Pandavas, Arjuna
[assumed spelling],

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.676
he looks at all the armies arrayed
before him, and he sees his cousins,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:58.083
he sees people he played ball with,
sees his uncles and his grandfather,

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.963
and he says, "I don't
want to kill these people.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.430
I'm not going to fight."

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.386
And he tells his charioteer,
and his charioteer is the god,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.740
Krishna [assumed spelling].

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.740
So the god Krishna has to spend
the next 700 verses trying

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.133
to persuade him to fight,
but this is a question

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.606
that Indians keep asking.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.443
Who is right, Krishna or Arjuna?

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.863
Should he fight or not?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.106
Now the difference here is that he's
not just a general who's not going

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.450
to fight.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.620
You can't just say, "Well
we invested in sending him

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.103
to West Point and all that
and made him a general."

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.523
He's also a political leader,

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:45.813
and I think what the
Mahabharata is saying is

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.106
that when our political
leaders take us to war,

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.386
we want them to consider
the moral dimension also.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.480
Now recently your country
went to war in Iraq,

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.416
and there must have been a meeting
of the, of the Cabinet, War Cabinet,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.706
and there must have been Mr.
Chaney and Mr. Rumsfeld there,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.266
and they must have discussed that
night the economic consequences

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.463
and the political consequences,
but I bet you nobody said

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.570
in that meeting that
tomorrow we're going to war.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.480
We're going to kill a lot of people.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.273
Some of the people we're
going to kill are going

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.740
to die, are our own people.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:30.800
Now they may still go to war, but we
want our leaders before they take us

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.693
to war to consider
the moral dimension.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.510
[ Applause ]

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.163
Anyway, I'm coming to the end, and
the Mahabharata is a dark story

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.903
in which everybody dies, and there's
a war, and the winners have to rule

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.340
over an empty kingdom, but at the
end Yudhishtira's going to heaven

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.600
and accompanying him is a dog,
and when he reaches heaven,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.423
the king of heaven comes out and
welcomes him but instead of going

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.216
into heaven, he says,
"What about this dog?"

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.596
And the god, Indra [assumed
spelling], the heaven keeper says,

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.516
"But he's not even your dog.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.936
He's dirty street dog, but
besides this is heaven.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.343
No dogs allowed."

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.676
[Laughter] And then Yudishtira says,
"What kind of a place is heaven

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.460
which does not even
understand the abc of dharma,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.803
that if somebody asks you for
refuge, you help them out,"

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.560
and I bet you nobody in this room
would have done this, but everybody,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.773
every child in every culture will
understand the meaning of dharma

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.450
from this story, and what the
Mahabharata is really saying is

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.096
that in this darkness an
act of goodness is one

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.940
of the very few things
of value we have.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080
Thank you.
