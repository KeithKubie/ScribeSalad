00:00:00.697 --> 00:00:02.516
- [Instructor] I'm going
to construct a sequence.

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:04.275
We're going to start with some number.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.993
Let's say I start with the number, a.

00:00:05.993 --> 00:00:08.297
And then each successive
term of the sequence,

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm going to multiply the,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.874
to get each successive
term of the sequence,

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:13.664
I'm going to muliply the previous term

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:16.243
by some fixed non-zero number,

00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:17.525
and I'm going to call that r.

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:19.760
So the next term is going to be a,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.561
is going to be a times r.

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.265
And then the term after that,

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:27.154
I'm going to multipy this thing times r.

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:28.740
So it's going to be a,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.931
if you multiply ar times r,

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.431
that's going to be ar-squared.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:38.022
And then if you were going to
multiply this term times r,

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:41.605
you would get a times
r to the third power.

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:46.514
And you could keep going
on and on and on and on.

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.282
And this type of sequence
or this type of progression

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.240
is called a geometric.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.073
Geometric Sequence or Progression.

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:57.448
Geometric Sequence.

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:00.769
You start with some first value.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.163
Let me circle that in a different color,

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:03.510
since I already used the green.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.822
So you start with some first value,

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:08.508
and then to get each successive term,

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:10.910
you multiply by this fixed number.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.305
In this case, this fixed number is r.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.722
And so we call r, our common ratio.

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:18.139
Our common ratio.

00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:21.246
Why is it called a common ratio?

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.542
Well take any two successive terms.

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.274
Take this term and this term,

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:28.780
and divide this term by
this term right over here,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.738
ar to the third, divided by ar-squared.

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.534
So if you find the ratio
between these two things.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:36.814
Let me rewrite this in the same colors.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:40.524
So if you took ar to the third power,

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:43.239
and were to divide it
by the term before it.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:47.545
So if you were to divide it by ar-squared,

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:49.373
what are you going to be left with?

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:51.528
Well a divided by a is one,

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:55.749
r to the third divided by
r-squared is just going to be r.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.624
And this is true if you divide any term

00:01:57.624 --> 00:01:59.189
by the term before it.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.056
Or if you find the ratio between any term

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:02.994
and the term before it,

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:04.528
it's going to be r.

00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:07.017
And so that's why it's
called a common ratio.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:11.245
And so let's look at some
examples of geometric sequences.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.803
So if I start with the number,

00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:17.932
if I start with the number
five, so my a is five

00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:20.249
and then each time I'm going to multiply,

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.341
I'm going to multiply by, I don't know.

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.517
Let's say I multiply by 1/7.

00:02:25.517 --> 00:02:29.684
So then the next term is
going to be five over seven.

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:34.026
What's the next term going to be?

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:37.006
Well, I'm going to multiply
this thing times 1/7.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.237
So that's going to be
5/7 times 1/7 is 5/49.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:45.404
So it's going to be five
over seven-squared or 49.

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:49.982
If I were to multiply this times 1/7,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:51.511
what am I going to get?

00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:52.536
I'll just change the notation.

00:02:52.536 --> 00:02:54.203
I'll get five times,

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.279
I don't actually know in my head

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.786
what seven to the third power is,

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:01.286
I guess I could calculate it, 280 plus 63,

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:04.266
let's see, so that would be

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.552
let's see seven times 40 is 280,

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.469
seven times nine is 63,

00:03:09.478 --> 00:03:13.667
so you're going to get to 343, I believe.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.281
Let me see, did I do that right?

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:17.255
Seven times 280,

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:18.505
plus 63 is 343,

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:22.271
and you can just keep going.

00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.521
So this right over here is an example

00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.771
of a geometric,

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:28.764
of a geometric sequence.

00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:30.272
Started with some first value

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:33.274
and each successive value,
I multiplied by 1/7.

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:36.018
1/7 is the common ratio here.

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:38.417
Let me give you another one.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.129
Let's say I have this,

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.099
let's say I have three and
then let's say I have six,

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.099
and let's say I have 12.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:49.722
Then I have 24,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.770
then I have 48.

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.537
Is this a geometric series?

00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:59.511
And if it is, what is
the common ratio here?

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.761
Well you could figure out the common ratio

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:04.767
by just taking any two
successive terms and dividing.

00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:07.782
Well first, you could
try it with two terms.

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:10.262
A 12 divided by six is two.

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:12.047
So we have to multiply by two.

00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:15.489
To go from 12 to 24, you multipled by two.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.003
To go from 24 to 48, you
have to multiply by two.

00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.517
To go from three to six,
we have to multiply by two.

00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:22.742
So you get a fixed common ratio.

00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:25.257
For any of these terms,
if we multiplied by two

00:04:25.257 --> 00:04:27.249
and say multiplied by three,

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.516
and so we didn't multiply
by the same thing,

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:33.599
then it wouldn't be a
geometric sequence anymore.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.277
So this clearly is a geometric sequence,

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:38.008
I forgot to mention that.
