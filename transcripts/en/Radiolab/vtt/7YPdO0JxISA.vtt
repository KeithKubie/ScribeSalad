You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.910
from w n y. S e

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.450
n n p. R. A logo. This is Jim Dickson speaking. Hello Dr. Dickson.

4
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.410
My name is Soren. I'm your, I'm the producer for today.

5
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:21.870
You'll actually be talking to our host Jad.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.210
He's on his way over to the studios right now, so that's good. All right,

7
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:29.170
so let's just start the story here. This is a bit of tape we've had for awhile.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.220
Uh, it's just kind of fun. It'll lead into the story in a second. Hello,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.070
Dr. Dickson.

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.890
<v 1>Hello judge. Hi, how are you? I'm very well, thank you.</v>

11
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:40.891
I'm always pleased to talk about my delightful obsession of hard for more than

12
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:44.920
10 years. Um, related to my mileage to a French lady.

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.570
I'm not joking. How does the marriage to the French lady, uh, factor in? Ah,

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.350
well you, we, we met on email. Huh?

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.330
A bit like you've got mail and you know the, the Hollywood film.

16
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.780
Well, I mean, my wife was, uh,

17
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.990
my wife is sitting beside me and she's making signals.

18
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.110
What does it you'll see in India? Can I, can I ask,

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.090
is there any chance we could talk to your wife if she says yes,

20
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.590
he wants to talk to you. Do you come on. Hello.

21
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.603
Hi.

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.090
I am French and my English is not very x. No,

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.190
you're fantastic.

24
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.880
You mentioned that let's was what brought you together. Yes, it's true.

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.660
I was a teacher, a high school teacher.

26
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.720
She emailed me some questions about yes and I answered them to the best of my

27
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:44.870
ability and shortly after we were married, no kings.

28
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.700
So C is my benefactor, my friend.

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.480
<v 0>Okay. So we'll, we should introduce ourselves real fast. I'm Jad. I am Robert.</v>

30
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.180
This is radio lab, the podcast. And so, uh, that Guy Jim Dixon,

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.560
Lee's a botanist, call him four years ago to talk about this fellow. Let's see.

32
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.960
We're going to tell it what's his story and completely in just a second.

33
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:06.020
But there's something in the whole interaction between him and his wife there

34
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.890
that just kind of captures how everybody gets when they get into Etsy. They guy,

35
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:11.300
they get married, their, they get obsessed,

36
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.360
but it wasn't until very recently are producing any mills.

37
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.180
And I happened to talk to this graphic artist named Aaron Berg,

38
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.270
who is also totally obsessed with this guy. Yes.

39
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.660
I think there's this hunger on the part of the reason that's when we really

40
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.780
understood what this story is all about. Yeah. I mean, at least for me,

41
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:29.330
that's where it all started it since Andy's been reporting this piece,

42
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:33.410
why don't, and you just, you just take the ball from here. Okay. Do it Andy.

43
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.770
So story starts 1991 way up in the alley.

44
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.220
<v 1>3,210 meters above sea level.</v>

45
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:43.140
I know you Americans don't think in meters.

46
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.330
That's roughly 10 and a half thousand feet.

47
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.770
This is a frozen glacial spot and up there walking around,

48
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.920
we're two hill walkers, two hill walkers, hikers, height curves.

49
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.530
I was a German couple. I'm an NYU.

50
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.980
It was early in the afternoon and at

51
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.970
<v 2>some point they take a notion to head off trail. I know we're</v>

52
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.700
only a hundred yards off the beaten track and after just a few minutes,

53
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.850
they round a little rock and that's when they were

54
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.000
stopped dead in their tracks. By what? By a corpse.

55
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.970
Scopes sticking out of the ice.

56
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.450
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

57
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 0>he was lying on his stomach face down in the ice.</v>

58
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.430
He was kind of draped over a big boulder.

59
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.340
His legs are buried under the ice,

60
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:36.970
up to his hips and his top half is just sticking out.

61
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.530
Left arm is kind of under his forehead, almost like a,

62
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.880
a schoolboy falling asleep in class on his arm.

63
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.840
So these two hikers, they see this and they run off

64
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.670
<v 2>for help.</v>

65
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.080
The hot footie tip to the nearby mountain hut thinking it was not meant to

66
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:56.730
needing accident. A recent one, they called the police. He said, hey, somebody,

67
00:03:56.731 --> 00:03:59.610
a tourist or a climber had some sort of accident.

68
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.260
And so the cops showed up with drills and ice picks and started to chip away at

69
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:08.580
the ice trying to get the body out, but then

70
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.850
<v 0>started noticing some things like this guy had</v>

71
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.560
<v 2>all these tattoos on his back and the behind his knees.</v>

72
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.530
Then they start noticing all this stuff buried with him.

73
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.870
He's got some kind of Moccasin,

74
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.400
looks like ox skin behind her bare skin cop. Unusual stuff.

75
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.560
He had a copper headed, you have to X. Oh, what?

76
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.810
A small pouch filled with medicinal tree fungus quiver full of arrows.

77
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.690
A long bull. He had grass socks. Ras Sucks,

78
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.640
woven grass. A dagger that has been chipped out of stone.

79
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.310
And so these cops realize that this is not a 20th century tourist who,

80
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.780
who wandered off trail. This was something extraordinary. This is old.

81
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.723
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

82
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.910
<v 2>Like renaissance or old. Middle Ages are old,</v>

83
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.270
but wouldn't we like to know? And what did the police do? Well,

84
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600
the police are reported to the forensic authorities in the University of Ns

85
00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:14.000
group.

86
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.240
Basically they took it to a team of local scientists who sent samples out to a

87
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:20.660
bunch of labs and eventually confirmed that, yeah, this is old,

88
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.470
but not just old. This was really old.

89
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.260
<v 4>This body is 5,300 years old.</v>

90
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.570
<v 2>Wow.</v>

91
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.090
<v 0>Yes. That's way before Jesus.</v>

92
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.130
Way before most of you are to use as a historic mark point. Let's say the,

93
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.940
the Pyramids of Egypt. Uh,

94
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
this would be 700 years prior to the construction of the pyramid at Giza.

95
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.350
It was beyond archeologist, wildest dreams.

96
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.610
<v 2>5,200 year old, perfectly preserved.</v>

97
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:56.840
Cops were talking about a man with all his skin, with his eyeballs, his teeth,

98
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:58.460
his, his groin,

99
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.860
<v 0>his organs, his guts. Everything's in there.</v>

100
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.870
Everything is almost perfectly freeze dried. There the is.

101
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.140
So what does it look like? Oh, well,

102
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.680
<v 1>uh, he was [inaudible] he's 45 years old, which I think for, for, uh,</v>

103
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.210
3000 BC is pretty darn old. Huh. And he was a small guy.

104
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:23.650
He was only about five foot two and height. But his calf muscles,

105
00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:26.530
his thigh muscles are incredibly developed. Yeah.

106
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.660
So this would suggest that he's a hunter or a shepherd of some kind who walks

107
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.494
these mountains.

108
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.270
His physique is compatible to the modern Olympian wrestler.

109
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.260
<v 3>Mm.</v>

110
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.240
<v 1>He was Eddie, obviously a human being.</v>

111
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.310
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

112
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.730
<v 1>very, very obviously. And he would have all the hopes and fears of you and I,</v>

113
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.170
<v 0>they even gave them a name, Bootsy, Etsy, Etsy, Guzzi.</v>

114
00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:56.350
Even though some of us can't really pronounce that name. Let's see.

115
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.970
<v 1>Spell it. Oh,</v>

116
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.520
<v 2>two dots on task scientists call him Bootsy. There's all kinds of drama.</v>

117
00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:05.790
There's, there's Austria competing with Italy. He's our mommy. No,

118
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:09.350
he's our mommy. He's on the border whose money is eventually the Italians

119
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.130
<v 1>because he said to be 92 meters inside Italy,</v>

120
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.300
<v 2>a whole museum is built around him.</v>

121
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.500
An entire facility is built to freeze him. There's teams of researchers,

122
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:23.230
there's competing universities. You have documentaries,

123
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:26.620
you have books and articles about this incredible mummy who was walking in the

124
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.550
icy fell. Isn't that fascinating? You know Brad bit, yeah,

125
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.120
he got a tattoo Bootsy on his arm,

126
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.840
but what everyone really wanted to know was this prehistoric person who was this

127
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:41.020
guy? Where did he come from? Was he a scout? Was he a traveler?

128
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.620
Where was he going? How did he fall? How he died?

129
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.090
Was it a storm that took him on? What was he doing so high in the mountains?

130
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.913
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.480
<v 0>When we found them there really,</v>

132
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.150
there really wasn't any way to answer these kinds of questions.

133
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.670
All you got was wild speculation,

134
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:05.140
but this is where it becomes more than a story about an ancient dead guy over

135
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.750
the past, what, 22 years since he's been found.

136
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:13.000
All these researchers keep coming back to [inaudible] and they've gathered just

137
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.630
enough little pieces of evidence that when you put it all together

138
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.030
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

139
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.540
<v 0>what you get is this surprisingly intimate.</v>

140
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.180
Look at this one real person.

141
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.740
Like there's one real dude who lived 5,300 years ago,

142
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.390
and for our purposes,

143
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.340
the first piece of that puzzle falls into place on a summer's Day in 2001 when a

144
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:40.190
radiologist named Dr. Paul Gossner. Yeah. Is staring at a CT scan,

145
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.850
basically a 3d x ray votes. These chest maybe for the umpteenth time.

146
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:47.500
For the thousandth time when suddenly, yeah.

147
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.580
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

148
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:49.590
<v 1>oh,</v>

149
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.590
this is something unusual right up by [inaudible] shoulder blade in the left

150
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.830
<v 2>scapula. What does he notice? He finds an Arrowhead</v>

151
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:04.500
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

152
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.910
<v 2>lodged in the shoulder blade and I think it was hard to see because it's stone,</v>

153
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.580
not metal. If it was metal, they would have picked it up right away.

154
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.970
So why does this mean that this is like a possible murder? That's right.

155
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.700
The whole thing blows up to a full scale murder mystery.

156
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.670
From that moment on,

157
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.540
we knew that he was shocked with an Arrow and then it all started the research

158
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.280
about, that's Albert Zinc.

159
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.310
He's actually the top scientists in charge of Odssey these days.

160
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.800
What we do is like doing a crime scene investigation.

161
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:35.690
We tried to put together not too long after Gossner spotted that arrowhead zinc

162
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.240
and his team, they take out, see if they actually put them into an ambulance,

163
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.190
rushed them as fast as they can to a hospital,

164
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.760
trying to make sure that he doesn't talk and they put them into a higher

165
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:45.511
resolution.

166
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:50.400
Full body CT scan and the plot thickens.

167
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.234
Further.

168
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.410
We find severe abdominal wounds and rib fractures,

169
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:59.430
things that before it may have come across as 5,000 year old wear and tear.

170
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.350
There's an orbital fracture of the cranium.

171
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.740
Now it's like we're seeing them with new eyes. His head is busted

172
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.900
<v 0>and not only that, right palm is very badly cut.</v>

173
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.550
It's very deep. How deep it's so deep that there's cuts in the underlying bones.

174
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.350
Oh, some pathologist. See it's a defensive. We wouldn't want,

175
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.380
it comes from a fight.

176
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.590
He held his right hand up and he got slashed on his right palm and in trying to

177
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.820
piece together what happened,

178
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.750
one of the questions that scientists like Albert zinc asked was like this cut on

179
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:35.200
his hand. Was it a fresh wound or this was already a healing wound?

180
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.220
Like how much time had passed between when he got the cut and when he died?

181
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.720
Well, we took a little a tissue piece out of the wound. They rehydrated it,

182
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.940
they slice it up with lasers.

183
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.930
We met little slices and we have a look at them and microscope and they could

184
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:51.820
see evidence that when he died,

185
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.450
the blood from this wound was just starting to clot,

186
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.390
but that it had not yet formed a scab when he died,

187
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.280
which told them that this attack,

188
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.910
this must be a warranted happened already three or four days before he died.

189
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:05.720
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

190
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.310
<v 0>which added another question to the list.</v>

191
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.810
Like what happened in those last three or four days between the time it got cut

192
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.760
and the time he died. I mean,

193
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.260
I think this is the most fascinating thing of all about news. Jim told us.

194
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.010
Luckily for scientists, his intestines are wrong there.

195
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.470
And to the trained eye, your intestines,

196
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.200
it's like a mop and a diary. A diary. Yeah. Diarrhea.

197
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:32.570
In what way? If there's any food in your stomach,

198
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.770
it's less than photo. It was owned, which would probably be your last meal.

199
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.820
And this stuff in an intermediate position, like the Kulon is

200
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.950
between a few hours old and a few days or your last few meals.

201
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.540
So if you can get samples from all the years and look at the content,

202
00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:54.090
you can produce all sorts of things. Um,

203
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.830
but one small problem, if you've got a 5,000 year old mummy on your hands,

204
00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:02.370
you can't exactly just cut them open. So Jim and his team,

205
00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:07.371
what they did is they snaked some fancy equipment up his butt and started

206
00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:12.270
rooting around. I mean, I didn't do that. You appreciate, I'm a botanist.

207
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:15.330
I'm not. I met someone else from his team, did that. In any case,

208
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.660
they got up in there and first of all they couldn't find the stomach,

209
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.790
but they did pull out samples from the rest of his guts and they found calling

210
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.260
pollen pollen. Actually two kinds of pollen. One from,

211
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.750
from the fresh flowers of the hop horn being yes,

212
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.170
a tree that blooms down in the valley and Connor for pollen,

213
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.290
a second kind of pollen from high altitude, evergreen trees.

214
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:40.890
So you've got the high mountain, the furs and the,

215
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.940
the deciduous trees of the valley, of the low places. You've got the horn beam.

216
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.790
Both of these kinds of pollen were found in oats.

217
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.150
He's got probably because he drank some water, which contained the pollen.

218
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:53.670
But here's the key, the pollen from the valley,

219
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.120
it's sandwiched in between these two layers of mountain pollen and that implies

220
00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:04.260
an order outsi must have first ingested the pine pollen,

221
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.580
then the horns beam and then the pine pollen again. And that suggests

222
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.810
<v 1>about two days or so before he died, he was high up in the hill,</v>

223
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.950
<v 0>drinking pollinated water high above either they're the,</v>

224
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:21.130
he was with Annie a little and below the tree line, drinking pollen,

225
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.800
laded water down below

226
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.450
<v 1>and then he came back up again to meet his hand.</v>

227
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.310
<v 0>And so taking all of that and a couple other pieces of research here is what we</v>

228
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:36.000
think happened to OTC in his last days.

229
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.220
We know that it would have been summertime,

230
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.820
probably June because that horn's been pollen in his gut.

231
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.740
Only blooms in the early summertime, in June for whatever beach.

232
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.710
Maybe he's hunting, maybe he's looking for copper, we don't know.

233
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.780
But we do know he's Hio. Alright, well above the tree line.

234
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.680
And then he goes by Tony's village,

235
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.310
which we believe was south of the mountain because certain chemicals in the

236
00:14:03.311 --> 00:14:08.290
local water were also found in [inaudible] teeth and bones. Anyway,

237
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.730
it was not a short walk home. It's a long way diamond. It's five, 6,000 feet.

238
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.470
We're talking about then we know that within the span of about 24 hours,

239
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.120
something happens in his village. Something violent.

240
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.780
Maybe his people were fighting with other people where he got the details are a

241
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:28.360
little blurry, but it is clear that he was attacked,

242
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:31.570
that he put his right hand up to defend himself and that he gets that cut.

243
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.990
<v 1>It's very deep and very bloody is very painful.</v>

244
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.510
I shortly after that event,

245
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.140
he bends down and picks up a clump of bog moss.

246
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.380
<v 0>Jim Actually found that bug mohs on OTC and he says that it's mildly antiseptic.</v>

247
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.370
Anyway. Oh, see he heads back at the mountain. He back up again,

248
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.760
<v 2>perhaps pursued by some body or people Pluto.</v>

249
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.080
We think that maybe he was in a hurry because of the 14 hours that he was

250
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:08.081
carrying only 200 Flint tips on failures and the other 12 were useless,

251
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.090
which suggests a frantic state. I mean,

252
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:15.350
you've got a guy who's running bleeding and he's busily carving his arrows,

253
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.760
carving as he runs in for about a day or maybe a day and a half.

254
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.000
He's running a lot like he, we know that he runs over 12 miles,

255
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:28.250
that he gets up above 10,000 feet above sea level managing to evade whoever it

256
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:31.070
is that's coming after him. But then

257
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.730
the fatal Otto shot,

258
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.920
<v 1>this is the official report from the South Tyrol Museum of Archeology.</v>

259
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.670
We can see that the point of the Arrow tore a hole in the artery beneath his

260
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:48.380
left collarbone, which led to a massive hematomas, bled into the thorax cavity,

261
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.470
which in turn caused cardiac arrest and sudden death.

262
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.490
<v 2>He bled to death. He would have died in less than half an hour. Really?</v>

263
00:15:57.491 --> 00:15:59.470
He would have died in 20 minutes perhaps.

264
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.670
And according to a lot of researchers,

265
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.270
whoever killed Bootsie came over,

266
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.840
pulled the Arrow shaft out of ocs back,

267
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.320
picked up a big stone and bashed his head in

268
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.600
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

269
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.440
<v 2>And then within about an hour, maybe two,</v>

270
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.710
his body would have been completely covered in snow.

271
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.400
Then within a month or so that snow would have become ice,

272
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.160
and then when the next summer came around,

273
00:16:30.161 --> 00:16:34.090
that ice would have thought out just enough to allow a little sunlight to come

274
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:34.924
through.

275
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:36.810
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

276
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.920
<v 0>the next winter he would have froze again following summer,</v>

277
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.550
thought a little bit and then froze again

278
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.963
<v 8>and then thought,</v>

279
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.740
<v 0>and here's why that's important. Bodies that are completely frozen deteriorate.</v>

280
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.340
Those periods of thought kept him from deteriorating.

281
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.060
So you had this perfect mixture throughout all these years.

282
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.720
A season of snow, a season of ice,

283
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.280
and then a thought and then the snow and then the nice and then a thought.

284
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.550
I mean, just think about it,

285
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.760
year in and year out in the snow and ice throughout the building of the

286
00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:21.390
pyramids, the rise and fall of Rome, the enlightenment,

287
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:25.650
the industrial revolution. All of this time,

288
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.150
let's see,

289
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:32.040
was there and that spot just a few feet away from where he was murdered

290
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:39.050
until 1991 when a couple of German hikers decided to head off trail

291
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.990
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

292
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.190
<v 2>We have forensic proof of his suffering. We have forensic proof of his hunger.</v>

293
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.080
We have forensic evidence that he was cold. I mean,

294
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.880
we have all of this undeniable,

295
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:04.881
irrefutable forensic evidence that this man was a living human being who was

296
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:10.140
tormented and was enduring with incredible tenacity.

297
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.160
And in the last few years, scientists have still been at it.

298
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.690
They've still been poking it out, see, trying to figure out who was this guy,

299
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.020
not just who mighty have been, but who was he really.

300
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.990
I think there's a hope that something will be found which will say yes,

301
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:27.810
he was a hero. Yes, he was a king. Yes, he was a fodder.

302
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.440
I think there's this hunger on the part of the researchers to find,

303
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.210
to find something. Yeah.

304
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.660
<v 0>Beyond the biology, beyond the molecular chemistry, to find some sense of the,</v>

305
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.620
of the humanity. And in the year since we spoke with Jim Dixon,

306
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:46.621
scientists did find something which for Aaron at least does give him that sense.

307
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.270
In 2010 they found his stomach, which Jim and his team,

308
00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:57.160
they couldn't find because it was tucked deep up under his rib cage,

309
00:18:57.161 --> 00:18:58.420
pressed up against his heart.

310
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:03.421
They find the stomach and inside one and a half pounds of undigested goat meat

311
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.860
and bread in his belly. His last meal,

312
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.730
<v 3>Oh,</v>

313
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.460
<v 2>this was eaten on the day of his death, maybe just an hour before he died.</v>

314
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.620
It was a huge feast.

315
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.730
And for Aaron imagining old sees sitting at that fire right before he died.

316
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.720
That's what did it. Oh, I can see it. He's eating. He cooked his food.

317
00:19:26.721 --> 00:19:30.980
We have proof. He, he cooked the meat and he sat down and it must've taken time.

318
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:34.240
It took at least an hour or two. Like I can feel it. I'm in the cave.

319
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.100
I'm on by the fire. That's what brought him back.

320
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.630
<v 9>So you're saying then that some hours before he had somehow the time to build a</v>

321
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:48.691
fire catch or acquire or carry a fairly substantial meal and sit and eat it

322
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.240
somewhat at rest. So he, he must not have known what was coming was, can we?

323
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.850
<v 2>Well, he might, maybe he knew it.</v>

324
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.130
Maybe he had found some kind of resolution around it.

325
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.140
But we have forensic proof that for this brief moment in time,

326
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.500
the Alpine ice man felt safe enough to [inaudible] to stew his meat and his

327
00:20:09.571 --> 00:20:12.780
bread and sit by the fire and eat his dinner.

328
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:16.690
[inaudible].
