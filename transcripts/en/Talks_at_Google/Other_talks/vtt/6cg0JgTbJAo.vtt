GREG AVOLA: Hi everybody.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.363
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.363 --> 00:00:06.070
Thanks for having me today.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.340
We're going to talk about
something that's very dear to

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.240
my heart, and it looks like
it is for you too.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.780
And that is the love of beer.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.860
So let's get started
with Untappd.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.800
So first of all, who am I?

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.490
My name is Greg Avola.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.540
I'm the co-founder and
CTO of Untappd.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.240
We're based out of New
York and Los Angeles.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.320
We're actually doing this
in a part time basis.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.920
I'm a New York City resident,
but I'm a die

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.040
hard Red Sox fan.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.720
So I apologize if anyone
is offended by that.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.860
We sucked last year.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.540
You guys made the playoffs.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.730
At least give me some break.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.950
I specialize in PHP and
JavaScript and MySQL, which is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.770
the technology stack from some
part of it for Untappd.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.636
My claim to fame is I
was on Man Versus

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.320
Food for nine seconds.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.060
I had a great cameo.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.810
I'm going to show it to you
right now, because this is

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.880
amazing stuff.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.294
OK?

00:00:55.294 --> 00:00:56.544
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:02.992
That's it.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.360
Thank you.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.540
It was an Oscar winning
performance.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.280
I still get text messages from
day from friends like at 2:00

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.290
in the morning when
this re-airs.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.010
It's pretty funny,
but that's all.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.390
So first off--

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.160
next slide here--

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.170
so what is Untappd?

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.450
Untappd is a social discovery
tool for your iPhone, Android,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.330
and pretty much any device.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.750
It allows you to do a
lot of cool things--

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.170
track your beers, see what your
friends are having, rate,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.510
and most important discover,
which is what we're all about.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.190
More important parts of Untappd
is being able to

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.070
encourage your realm of beer
to a different state.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.920
So you would normally drink one
beer over and over again,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.310
but you're a little bit afraid
of branching out.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.780
What Untappd helps to do is make
the drinking experience

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.820
more social into
a web presence.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.640
So there's a Twitter and
Facebook for certain

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.550
activities, but we focus on
beer, which is a very social

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.400
activity but never really
in a web presence.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.290
One of the key features
of ONTAP Untappd

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.920
is the sharing ability.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.970
When you check in on Untappd,
we use Foursquare for all of

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.780
our locations.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.420
So basically, a user can check
in a beer and attach the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.380
location that they're actually
using and then

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.320
share that with friends.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.770
You can push that to Twitter,
Facebook, and back to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.990
Foursquare as well so you don't
have to open up too many

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.740
apps at once.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.660
Because we all know that the
most important thing when

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.820
drinking a beer is drinking
the beer.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.320
So that's really what
it's all about.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.650
Discovery is a big important
part, like I mentioned before.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.620
One of the things that we
introduced in our newest app

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.150
that came out last year, is the
ability to discover new

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.100
places and beers for you.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.990
This goes along the lines of
if you went to a bar and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.710
you're not exactly sure what
they have there, the app can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.055
recommend beers based on what
your friend is drinking, what

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:44.490
has been checked into that
location in the last 30 days--

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.410
that's the average state of a
beer from a keg perspective--

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.270
and also based on the ecosystem
of the app.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.300
So if a beer is very popular
over the last 30 days, it'll

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.650
push it to the top.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.760
As you can see in these
screenshots here, these are

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.940
from Oregon, where we were
at a conference recently.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.700
And you can see some of the
top venues that are going.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700
This is really cool if you go
to a new city for the first

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.410
time and you want to see where
the happening spots are around

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.590
the block that serve
beer that you like.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.970
It can sort of filter
to your methodology.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.760
We also have maps to show you
where your friends are.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.200
Don't abuse this feature.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.540
It's a friendly feature.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.090
If they're completely wasted,
it's not a very good thing to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.365
look for them, try
to find them, and

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:25.930
play around with them.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.850
But the key part is that you
find your friends and make it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.670
more social, because what
Untappd means to do is making

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.590
drinking a much more
social activity.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.790
A little about us from a
community prospective from

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.500
stats, we have around 400,000
users that are registered in

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.420
our service in about
two years.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.210
And we have 21 million
check-ins.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.450
So as you can see, not a huge
user base but a very dedicated

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.750
user base that likes
to drink a lot of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.810
different types of beer.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.010
It's really cool.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.510
We average around 3,000
check-ins per hour.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.010
We have around 20,000 social
shares per day.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.440
So that's sharing to Facebook,
or Twitter, or Foursquare.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.750
When someone shares to Twitter
or Facebook, we track their

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.200
follower count so that we can
see what the total reach is.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.220
So we reach around 7.3 million
people per day.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.210
And we also a feature in our
app that allows you to take

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.980
pictures of the beer
that you're having.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.250
And on average, weekly total
over 35,000 photos uploaded of

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.940
beer related photos.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.970
I must stress that.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.520
So that's really cool for
a small start-up like

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.140
ourselves--

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.060
only two people and
self funded.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.580
It's pretty cool.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.530
So this is really cool.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.610
Apps are awesome.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.070
But what are you trying
to solve here?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.370
What is the business
proposition?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.240
Was is Untappd really
aiming to do?

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.170
So we have a couple of things,
and I'll break them into three

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.170
different points where we think
we can help a lot of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.970
people with the consumer side
and also the business side.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360
The first and foremost, this is
a picture of Russian River

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.850
out in California.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.910
I labeled it as WTF, because
if I'm a new user are not

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.060
really know about beer, I look
at this list and I'm like,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.020
what am I supposed to have?

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.230
I have no clue which beer I'm
going to like based on my

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.820
previous style of taste.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.090
I don't know my friend
is drinking.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.500
I'm totally confused.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.370
All these beers are phenomenal
by the way, if you haven't had

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.510
a chance to try them.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.900
But from a new user prospective,
Untappd aims to

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.980
help you make a decision.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.090
And when you're at the bar,
it is, what should I have?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.510
What are my friends having?

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.740
What will I like before
I buy it?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.480
Because you don't want to have
to return the beer afterwords,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.990
because it never really works.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.650
On the business side, we want
to give breweries an

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.580
opportunity to expose
their product.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.880
Now, this is a typical picture
of a package store or a liquor

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.650
store where you see this big
mounds of the big beer, the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.450
big macrobreweries out there.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.430
You see some microbreweries in
the corner and the back, but

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.120
at the same time, they don't
have the placement.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.690
They don't have the money.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.230
They don't have the advertising
to push their

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.400
product to the front.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.800
And what Untappd helps to do
is, by people sharing and

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.210
checking into their beer,
they're marketing for them.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.320
So it's an opportunity for them
to get a level playing

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.200
field in the social front.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.490
Also, location is a really big
thing when it comes to beer.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.420
Because beer isn't distributed
everywhere in the United

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.290
States and even in the world,
trying to find a particular

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.760
beer that you really like
is very, very difficult.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.000
Your friends can tell you
where they are and what

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.780
they're drinking.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.780
And that can give you a diary
or a log of where beer is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.940
around the city.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.530
Every check-in is attached to
a geo-located point, so by

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.560
nature of doing some algorithms
and some math, you

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.110
can figure out really where the
beer is, who had it, and

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.190
how long ago it was had.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.350
So you can get a good idea
of where the beer is.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.410
And that can help you with
recommendations too.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.820
By building out your
recommendation engine, you can

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.130
basically figure out what beers
are available in your

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.760
particular area as opposed to
more global recommendation,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.980
but you can't get that beer.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.920
So some of things that we offer
breweries in the form of

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.400
tools, are brewery accounts,
where are the breweries can

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.040
actually manage their page,
their inventory and see a

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.910
little bit of what we call
analytics on the stats of

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.370
their beers.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.230
Now, it's this is kind of
revolutionary, to use a the

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.620
term that's really
overused a lot.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.180
But breweries sell to
distributors in the US.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.890
And distributors sell to bars.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.250
So they don't really have an
insight on who their users

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.430
are, or what they're drinking,
or where, or what time.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.360
All they know is the distributor
says, I need

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.160
another two cases of beer.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.820
I sold two cases last week.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.120
So we're given them a real
time look into their

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.560
statistics on a check-in, which
represents a revenue

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.730
booster for them so they can
see it in real time.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.360
Also, to give them a list of
what their top beers are, but

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.850
also give them places, and
styles, and what have you.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.510
Also, managing your online
profile for a beer company is

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.210
very tedious.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.280
There are a lot of sites out
there that don't offer a lot

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.250
of good tools to help you kind
of manage your [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.330
file correctly--

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.800
add the correct IBU, the ABV,
all these acronyms that they

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.880
need to fix to make sure that
everything is accurate.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.390
We give them really cool tools
to help them do that.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.320
We also give them an
important feature,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.440
which I like the most.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.760
It's the ability to toast and
comment on people's check-ins.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.350
Now, toast is our version of
like, for Facebook, or a +1.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.820
Is basically allows
the breweries to

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.750
say, hey, good job.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.200
We like you checking
into our beer.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.150
We can also comment and say,
how did you like it?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.400
Did you have it with
some food?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.290
These are really important
features for breweries because

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.500
they can never really
communicate with the customer

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.130
or the user on a
regular basis.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.156
When you're at a bar and I have
a beer or a Bronx Pale

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.570
Ale or something like that,
Bronx Brewery can comment

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.710
directly to me and say,
how did you like it?

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.050
And that's a really
good communication

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.300
tool between the two.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.210
So here are some examples of
some breweries that have done

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.720
this both in the US and
outside the US.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.340
On the right hand side, we have
Sixpoint, which is really

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.900
active on our service.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.080
They communicate a lot.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.309
You get a lot of interaction
with individuals.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.730
You can get some insights.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.250
We had one brewery that released
a batch of beer, and

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.799
a lot of negative comments
on Untappd.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.659
They figured out that it was
because the bar wasn't

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.039
cleaning their tap line.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.000
So through that information,
they can go back to the bar

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.900
and say, hey, last seven
check-ins has given us a

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.190
really bad rating, but they said
it was really good in the

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.150
previous times they had it.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.240
What's going on?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.400
So we can use these tools
to better serve the

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.880
customers and whatnot.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.920
And the best thing about our
service is just like

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.950
Foursquare, we have badges for
achieving awesomeness when it

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.010
comes to beer.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.380
So we offer these badges
both as a [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.770
for Untappd users to unlock,
such as drinking 1,000 unique

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.310
beers, which has been
done multiple times.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.790
And doing certain activities,
like having a beer at a music

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.280
venue or at a bowling alley.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.050
Gamification comes to the
beer world in a fun way.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.380
But also for the breweries, it
gives them an opportunity to

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.360
promote their own products
as well.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.590
Here are some examples of some
badges we've done for

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.780
breweries and for beer weeks.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.140
On the top left, that's Karl
Strauss celebrating their

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.180
anniversary.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.140
Users can check-in Karl Strauss
beer during their

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.010
anniversary time period.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.320
They would unlock this badge.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.310
We did one for Bridgeport, which
is out of Oregon, and LA

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.710
Beer Week, and the other
ones as well.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.810
So it's a great opportunity
to incentivize the brewery

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.910
industry to think outside the
typical advertising realm.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.260
You put an ad on a page or in a
newspaper, it's very static.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.450
With Untappd, it's more
action based.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.570
You have to go out and check-in
or try the beer.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.010
And we're finding people will
drive state to state looking

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.410
for a beer to unlock a badge.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.550
I had a friend of mine from
California trade four beers

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.080
and a Nintendo Game Boy
mint condition for a

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.925
beer to get a batch.

00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:18.430
That's crazy, but it happens.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.640
And these are a cool for people
to encourage to try

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.730
different things.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.640
And once you try something as
we all know, we become a fan

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.110
of it and learn more about it.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.340
So it's a good way to do that.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.120
So with this, we have over
2,000 breweries that have

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.100
already claimed their
profile on Untappd.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.500
Here are some big ones
to be named--

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.990
New Belgium, Dogfish
Head, Deschutes--

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.850
all interacting with customers
today on Untappd and also

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.070
interacting with other breweries
as well to see how

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.230
they're doing across
the board.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.150
So it's a really cool thing
for them to try out.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.625
But with every service, you got
to have apps, because apps

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:51.700
is the only cool thing.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.060
Because if you don't
have an app, you're

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.960
not really a service.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.110
So I want to shift the
discussion a little bit to

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.980
tour what our apps are like and
how we got there with our

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.390
small development team.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.960
So first thing starting out, we
built the product back in

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.670
October of 2010, so about two
years and a couple months.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.100
We started out with
a basic principle.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.280
We thought maybe it would be
cool to actually check in our

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.600
beer, share with friends.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.910
And we wanted to make that
on a mobile platform.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.360
To be honest, my co-founder
came up

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.600
with the idea of Untappd.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.800
I told him, I don't think anyone
is going to do this.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.110
It's probably a waste of time.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.820
I was completely wrong
with that.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.580
So we started out with the
only thing we knew.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.610
We're two web developers.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.690
We said HTML5.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.270
Let's do it.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.050
Let's try it.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.300
Let's get a prototype out there,
and let's really work

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.400
on trying to get this
in that direction.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.600
So we started with HTML5 app.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.350
The cool thing was, that worked
on day one on a lot of

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.380
platforms--

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.220
iOS, BlackBerry, WebOS, Android,
everybody really on

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.620
day one from the browser.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.300
That was great because there
are a lot of apps out there

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.520
that had similar things, but
they are only on one platform.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.370
There wasn't really any
on Android at all.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.000
There are a lot on iOS
but nothing really

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.730
on the Android front.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.970
So it was great to explore
the multiple platforms.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.180
When we first built it,
there was something

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.180
called jQuery Mobile.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.960
There was Seneca Touch.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.660
But they weren't really in
the stable environment.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.670
So we actually built our own
custom framework to support

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.600
these different pages
in this web app.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.830
And then we had social
integration on day one--

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.240
the ability to share, to
Twitter, Facebook, which is

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.660
pretty standard nowadays but
back then those helped us

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.410
really grow the ecosystem of
the users and to get them

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.720
excited about earning badges.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.500
A little piece of trivia when
we first did Untappd, every

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.150
single badge unlocked
with one check-in.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.095
So we had a the top of the
morning badge, which was drink

00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:39.850
before 12:00 PM--

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:40.560
one check-in.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.770
So we launched the service
in the morning.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.990
People would try it out and
get like 15 badges.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.440
And they'd be like, oh wow.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.710
This is great.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.610
So we had to scale that down a
little bit as we learned a

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.080
little bit through the system.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.200
So as Untappd grew,
it was awesome.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.830
We were seeing all this organic

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.290
growth of our user accounts.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.120
It was amazing.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.340
That little dip right there is a
Mashable post at 2:00 in the

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.250
morning eastern time.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.560
That was not good for servers.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.330
So that was interesting.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.410
We're slowly growing and
everything is fantastic, but

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.030
we have a problem.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.860
The problem is, that apps--

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.960
everyone wants native apps.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.820
They want to be able
to download things.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.300
They want to be able to have
it on their phone on their

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:18.920
home screen.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.760
You can do that really easily
with a web app.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.660
The common knowledge
isn't right there.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.120
The basic problem, people
couldn't find us.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.940
They couldn't find us at all.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.880
I'd go to a bar to try to
encourage people to use it.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.380
And the first question
they'd ask you is,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.950
how do I get Untappd?

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.400
And we said, open
up your browser.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.760
And they'd go, what?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.620
Open up your browser.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620
I don't have a browser.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.060
I have app store.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.470
I have Google Play.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.990
No, go to your Safari, your
Chrome, or whatever.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.040
And you lost them.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.980
They couldn't find you.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.790
So we had this big
problem about web

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.660
apps and native apps.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.720
We tried to bridge that gap.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.240
The second thing is, native
development is very, very hard

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.170
for us, for web developers that
don't really know the

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.000
language that well.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.060
We have to learn
something new.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.210
And that's something that we
just didn't have the resources

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.540
and time to do.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.590
And finally, we're
self funded.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:06.480
Money is awesome.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.940
It's the biggest superpower
in the world.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.790
The problem is, we
didn't have any.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.890
We're just paying our rent.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.910
It's pretty hard to do anyways
in New York City.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.500
So we thought to ourself,
what we do here?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.430
We have these pros and cons
for native and mobile.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.890
How are we going to bridge the
gap and be able to provide a

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.550
good experience by using native
functionality, such as

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.560
the camera and other features,
but still be able to develop

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.420
apps to be able to
support them?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.420
So on the pro side, it was
really cool to be able to push

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.460
out new updates right off
the bat with HTML5.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.800
But we lack features like
discoverability and camera,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.080
which are now available in some
versions of OSs, but back

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.900
when we started, they
weren't there.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.060
So our solution was PhoneGap.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.880
And PhoneGap allows us to do
everything we just talked

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.270
about and access native
functionality and still make

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.490
the app move really fast.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.200
So there are a lot of
solutions out there.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.580
And this is the version of our
app running on Android--

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.400
actually a new version that's
going to be coming out

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.850
probably in the next week.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.580
And why do we choose PhoneGap
over the other ones?

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.670
It was quite simple.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.530
PhoneGap allows us to develop an
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.750
and then put all that in a
wrapper, and then build

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.430
plug-ins on top of that to
support native features.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.090
There's other stuff that are
similar to this out there.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.915
But they require you to use your
own object types, your

00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:23.970
own data types.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.750
This was the simplest
for us to do.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.210
And it produced the best
results that we had.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.420
So we basically took our
mobile web app, and we

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.470
converted over to a PhoneGap
app probably in two hours.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.540
And it was fantastic.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.660
It was running in all
of our phones.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.190
We were really, really
excited.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.910
The problem is, that we need to
make it customizable to the

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.250
level of UI patterns for
each individual phone.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.910
So as you can see in the Android
version, we keep a

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.560
very similar style to what you
guys have of more of an action

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.600
bar on the top.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.360
On our iOS version, we flip it
over to have more of a bottom

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.510
bar navigation.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.260
So those are the things we learn
throughout the entire

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.330
process to really build your
UI around what the app

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.790
actually is.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.130
One of the cool things is the
plug-in feature of PhoneGap.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.360
You can actually access native
things like for example, in

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.830
iOS, you can access the action
sheet, which is the piece that

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.830
brings up bottom bar.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.315
You touch on those things as
well and still not write an

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:17.490
ounce of native code.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.630
So it was a really good
opportunity for us.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.820
Well, how did it work?

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.660
Did it work well for us?

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.620
Well, you see these
jumps here.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.130
And the day we released
our PhoneGap app

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.110
version two, huge spike.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.280
It was ridiculous.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.220
It was pretty awesome.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.870
We were really excited
about that.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.420
And then as you go see later on,
we did another version, a

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.910
version update on the
right hand side.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.210
And it still went up again.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.270
So as you continue to build your
product and build your

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.410
design, we found out things we
could do to tweak it and make

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.360
it more interesting.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.570
And PhoneGap for us
really helped

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.670
us bridge that platform.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.350
So some of the cool things is
that on the first month that

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.850
we did it, we ranged 25,000
users on the first month we

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.870
released our native app.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.370
We were averaging around 4,000
users a month previous to

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.820
that, so it was a huge jump.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.060
We increased check-ins
by 300%, which was

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.819
crazy for us to see.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:14.020
And then my wife told me that
we are on the top 50 apps in

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.170
the app store in iOS.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.900
I don't believe her, I think
she's lying to me to make me

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.329
feel better, but she says it was
true so I'm going to put

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.930
it in the slide deck.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.700
But yeah, we really love
PhoneGap, the ability to

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.490
connect with these multiple
interfaces.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.170
We've been really big on
HTML5 and web apps.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.280
We think that's the future
of apps out there.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.020
I think that a lot of browsers
out there help us get to that

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.370
realm, and this was the
best vehicle to get

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.870
there from that avenue.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.710
So I want to shift a little
bit to fun stats about

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.170
Untappd, because as we all know,
if you're a data junkie,

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.470
you love beer, a lot of
interesting stuff can come out

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.300
of data that we're generating.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.390
It shows interesting trends on
what we're doing, and what the

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.840
industry is doing, what the
consumer base is doing.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.020
First, I want to go on the
technology stack around

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.850
Untappd and what we're
actually all about.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.380
So first, we're a traditional
LAMP stack--

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.320
Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.190
We use CodeIgniter for all
of our app framework.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.480
So that powers our API,
which we'll talk about

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.260
a little bit later.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.040
And also, our mobile apps are
all written in HTML5, but

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.810
they're all powered
by the API itself.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.410
We use Redis in memcache, which
has been a lifesaver,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.650
specifically for accounts.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.110
So every beer on Untappd, every
time it gets checked in,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.640
the account gets increased
by one.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.040
So we store it to Redis for a
fast memory database reads.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.240
Amazon S3 we use for all of
our static files-- so

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.900
JavaScript, mainly our
assets, but more

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.040
importantly, our photos.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.440
Every time a photo gets uploaded
to Untappd from the

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.440
actual app, we store four
versions of that file.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.050
We store large, small,
medium, thumbnail.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.120
And all that good stuff
gets stored in S3.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.750
We use Rackspace cloud for
all of our hosting needs.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.830
We got an email yesterday from
them saying that we are now

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.750
one of their--

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.270
we have like two dedicated
account reps for us.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.240
And I don't know how
that's possible.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.350
We must be paying a lot of
money for them somehow.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.390
And then we use Amazon Cloud
Search, which is a pretty new

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.140
technology for us for all
of our searching needs.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.360
Beer and brewery search can be
very difficult, because you go

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.600
down to local bar, they're going
to call Brooklyn Ale,

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.330
which does not exist
as a beer.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.120
It's Brooklyn Lager.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.770
But people have the
wrong names.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.680
So you really need a fundamental
way of trying

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.060
adding aliases to beers so it
could be searchable so that no

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.950
more duplicates are
in the system.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.400
It's actually funny that we
did that because we have a

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.140
team of super users, around 40
volunteers, that go through

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.710
the database and they
merge duplicates.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.730
We have a free opening editing
system for beers, so you can

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.140
add whatever you like.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.920
So people have taken whatever
they want to do and made

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.830
beers out of it.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.570
My favorite one is water
by the brewery, Earth.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.140
That was a good one.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.540
We have Dr. Pepper in there
and interesting stuff

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:56.970
all over the place.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.540
So we rely a lot on our
moderators to help us merge

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.950
and consolidate that.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.100
A lot of beer sites keep this
close minded view of like,

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.320
we'll approve the beers.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.380
And you guys don't
know anything.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.995
But it's really open.

00:20:06.995 --> 00:20:11.620
It allows people to add a
lot of stuff in there.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.620
So we're not as big as Google,
so these numbers shouldn't

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.860
shock you, but for me, they
shocked me when I saw them.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.940
But in every given month, we're
transferring about 2.8

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.130
terabytes of data just to
our database alone.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.950
That's all of our queries, all
of our media, all of our

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.320
assets, everything
back and forth.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.650
So this is all beer-related
terabytes of data.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.610
That's pretty crazy.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.080
Two million beer-related, as
I stress, photos have been

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.990
uploaded to Untappd
in about a year.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.720
So we're averaging on the
weekends around 16,000 to

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.020
17,000 photos uploaded.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.790
When we first implemented this
feature, I thought to myself,

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.980
maybe I'll take a picture of a
beer because it's kind of fun.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.400
And I won't do it very often.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.800
And now I'm taking it
all the time, and I

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.090
can't understand why.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.000
I think everyone wants to take
pictures of what they're

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.890
drinking to brag.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.750
It's just like food.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.280
People take pictures of food,
it's like better than yours.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.560
But beer is in a glass.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.200
And it's usually the same color
than your friends'.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.330
How are they going to know
what the picture is of?

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.010
Hey, people do want
they want to do.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.260
So that's the way it is.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.840
People usually don't actually
share the beer

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.320
they drink the most.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.530
So the top graph shows what the
people share the most--

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:26.340
the Lagunitas, Guinness, Winter
Lager, Yuengling, and

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.690
Bell's Hopslam, which is
a really double IPA.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.420
But then the one on the bottom
is what they usually have.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.570
So we have Guinness and
Lagunitas, which match.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.940
Then we have Bud Lite, Winter
Lager, and Miller Lite.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.260
So basically, you're not sharing
what you're actually

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.140
drinking, because you're ashamed
of it most likely.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.280
So that's probably what
it comes down to.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.900
But it's a cool little stat that
I actually love to show

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.940
people, because people share the
stuff they want people to

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.400
be jealous of but not the fact
that they're the top 10

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.650
drinker of Miller Lite on tap.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.170
Saint Patrick's Day is a
great, great day for

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.620
everything.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.360
And this dog represents
everything there is about

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.460
Saint Patrick's Day.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.200
Last year we wanted to really
push Guinness out there, but

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.560
we didn't have a really
good search engine.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.790
We implemented this
after this.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.820
So we found out doing an
algorithm that Guinness was

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.050
misspelled 2,500 times in our
database on the day of Saint

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.250
Patrick's Day.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.230
There are iterations in there
that I cannot understand why

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.130
somebody would do this.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.010
There's no G.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.585
There's no U. What were
you spelling?

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:27.260
Were you just punching a
keyboard or something?

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:27.920
I'm not sure.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.070
But it's a fun stat,
I have to say.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.970
Since then, we've added almost
every iteration as an alias.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.100
So now it comes up.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.820
So this year we probably won't
have the same problem.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.660
But there will be a lot of
people creating beers that

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.800
they don't even know what
existed because Saint

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.350
Patrick's Day.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.170
So the average user on
Untappd drinks about

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.790
19 beers per month.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.750
So you're averaging a little
under a beer a day.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:51.620
That's pretty crazy.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.820
I didn't realize that when
I was doing to that.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.720
Nothing wrong with that--
keep checking in and

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.220
keep drinking beer.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.690
But 19 beers a month.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.410
That's a lot--

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.710
kind of like this fridge
over here.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.520
So that's pretty crazy.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.320
So when we first built our
database of beer, we used an

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.480
open source beer database with
around 5,000 entries.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.730
And now today we're at 200,000
beers being entered

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.930
in about two years.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.870
And actually more of those
have been entered--

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.020
around 250,000 total.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.180
We do a lot of merges
and whatnot.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.340
And this is crazy, because
we're averaging about 100

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.160
beers being created per day.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.360
Now you have to understand there
are some home brews that

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.590
people enter in as well.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.310
So there's not commercialized
beer, but we'd

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.600
still support them.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.220
But 100 beers per day is pretty
crazy that you can

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.380
still get that kind of realm of
new beers being discovered

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.590
all the time, which is amazing,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.505
because beer is fantastic.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.730
So one of the things that I'm
really big on is open source

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.090
and allowing data to being
shared to everyone.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:55.320
So if you have an idea for a
quick project, or if you want

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.350
to see some cool things,
or develop something.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.520
We had some guy build a calorie
counter, which I don't

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.160
want to see ever when
it comes to beer.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.210
I believe that data really
belongs to the world, so we

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.340
had an API since the day
one that we came

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.860
out, back in 2010.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.710
So we have a full API that is
fully RESTful and all JSON.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.110
So if you're interested in
hacking around one weekend,

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.560
you should check it out.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.260
So with that, I recommend
to try Untappd if you

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.780
haven't done that.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.050
It's available obviously
on the iPhone, Android.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.460
We just released a product
for BlackBerry.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.970
But with PhoneGap, like I said,
we're able to basically

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.820
put it on platforms
whenever we like.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.410
So I advise you to start
drinking socially, because

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.750
drinking socially is the
best thing you can do.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.073
And if you're at home drinking
alone, with Untappd you'll

00:24:46.073 --> 00:24:47.160
never be alone again--

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.010
very simple.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.890
So I guess at this point, I'll
open up for any questions.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.764
And thank you very much.

00:24:54.764 --> 00:25:00.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:01.831
There's beer over there.

00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:02.958
AUDIENCE: What are
your highest and

00:25:02.958 --> 00:25:04.537
lowest rated beers?

00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:07.750
GREG AVOLA: The highest rated
beer on our service is

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.670
actually the Goose Island
Bourbon County Stout.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.570
It has a 4.7 out of 5.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.360
We do an algorithm for ratings
similar to IMDB, so it's like

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.620
a weighted average.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.120
But the lowest rated beer is,
I believe, commercially

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.360
related it's Miller Lite.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.500
They have a 1.2 rating
on Untappd.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.910
People hate that stuff.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.260
I don't know why.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.830
It's a--

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.120
An important thing too, Untappd
is all about craft and

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.870
whatnot but we're also
about everyone else.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:43.010
So the four highest checked in
beers ever is Miller Lite, Bud

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.070
Light, Coors Lite, and Coors.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.030
So those are the top
ever of all time.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.470
So you can see that people are
still checking those in, but

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.880
after a while they're seeing
what their friends are

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.620
drinking, and they're changing
their habits.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.980
And then a new user comes in
the very next day, and it

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.040
wipes it all clean again.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.820
So you have to start over.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.880
So people are still using the
service both on the craft side

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.126
and also on the macro side.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:04.285
AUDIENCE: In relation to that,
do you see any evidence of

00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:06.970
peoples' taste getting more
exciting as they use the app?

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.910
GREG AVOLA: Yes, absolutely.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.420
One of my best friends from
college and also another

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.860
friend of mine from a previous
job, he was the fourth highest

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.920
drinker of Bud Lite
on the service.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.940
I think he had over 400 or 500
check-ins to Bud Light.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.190
He's going to kill me
for this story.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:29.060
And one day, I saw him check-in
to a beer that I'd

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.960
had that I'd told them about.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.390
And since then, he's not had
a single Bud Light ever.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.090
And that was about three
or four months ago.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.860
And I'm not up here because
I made fun of him so much.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.330
Or maybe because he
actually found the

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.120
path to history there.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.430
So it's really cool feature to
see that shift in paradigm

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.810
when it comes to styles of beer,
because after you check

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.560
in, the app recommends three
similar styles of beer.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.350
So we're hoping that those
kind of take people on a

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.530
different path and try
to discover new beer.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.890
Now, there's nothing wrong with
Bud Lite, or Miller Lite,

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.360
or any of those phenomenal beers
at all, but there are

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.810
other avenues out there
to explore.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.738
And we hope that we
get that in there.

00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:06.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.990
is this ever going
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.290
something like wine?

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.800
GREG AVOLA: Yeah, actually
that's a question we get asked

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.660
a lot, is where is the fill
in the blank for Untappd.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.010
We've got some crazy ideas--

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.180
cigars for Untappd.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.350
Bike riding--

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.450
I don't know what that is all
about, but we've got that.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.810
Wine is the next step that we
want to eventually go down.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.150
We want to nail down the beer
piece first and get

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.360
that kind of set.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.100
We've learned a lot
from that path.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.910
I think that it doesn't really
belong with Untappd.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.110
It belongs in a separate
ecosystem.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.470
But altogether, it would
be one unique

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.670
flow, a different app.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.200
But it's definitely something
that my wife wants to use.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.230
She doesn't even like
beer that much.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.330
She's like, where is Uncorkd
man, where is it?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.500
It's actually a wine magazine,
so they already own the domain

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.450
and everything.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.927
Is definitely something that
we're interested in doing.

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:59.693
AUDIENCE: I know you write
your files in HTML5.

00:27:59.693 --> 00:28:03.589
[INAUDIBLE] moved away from
doing HTML5 in a web-based

00:28:03.589 --> 00:28:04.563
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:04.563 --> 00:28:06.511
Do you think you'll reach
that point at some

00:28:06.511 --> 00:28:06.998
point in the scale?

00:28:06.998 --> 00:28:09.710
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.770
GREG AVOLA: I think the whole
debate on HTML5, if you've

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.170
actually inspected some of their
code, they're actually

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.560
hitting m.facebook.com inside
their app and pulling in all

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.900
of the raw HTML and JavaScript
and then re-rendering it in

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.750
the browser.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.740
That's pretty slow.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.230
You're going to see a lot of
performance hit there.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:28.870
We did the same thing when
we first launched.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.050
And we found out that that
wasn't the ideal solution.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.970
So now what we do is we do all
the templating rendering on

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.500
the client side as opposed to
rendering on the server and

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.860
then passing it back to you.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.110
I think there will be a point
eventually that we might want

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.810
to go native.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.130
But HTML5 is working
pretty well for us

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.750
considering what we have.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.340
And we're excited about
the features.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.520
The main thing is, what's
great about the Android

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.540
browser when doing these things
is that you're allowed

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.270
to have the same level of
JavaScript rendering that you

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.085
do on your standard browser.

00:28:56.085 --> 00:28:58.330
But on iOS side, because they
limit the developer

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.220
interaction on the web view,
you really don't have that

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.730
same level of rendering.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.570
So hopefully they get
their act together.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.820
We'll be happy people.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.390
for your mobile website
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.340
GREG AVOLA: Yes.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.040
Basically what we do is,
PhoneGap will preach that you

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.550
can use one code base across
multiple platforms.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.880
That works, and you could
definitely do that.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.790
For us, we separated it out.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.960
And basically we build
a feature.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.060
And then we apply it to
one template library.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.790
We use handelbar.js for all
of our template engine.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.910
And we'll fix it on one
of those repos.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.860
And then we'll just replicate
it across the board.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.580
And then we'll push those
and build them together.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.280
So it's really quick
development.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.490
It's not like I say I want to
build a feature into iOS and

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.985
then say, oh, well then two
months later I'm going to have

00:29:45.985 --> 00:29:46.830
to build a feature
into Android.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.720
I can do it all at once at the
same time, which helps us.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.160
We actually really only release
updates to both

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.690
platforms on the same day.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.290
So if there is an iOS release,
then we'll release Android.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.750
I always hated when people
were like, Android gets

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.130
everything first, iPhone
gets everything--

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:02.970
We don't do that stuff.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.010
We just say, everything out
on the same day and phone

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.482
[INAUDIBLE] to help us
get to that level.

00:30:08.482 --> 00:30:11.828
AUDIENCE: So what's the
motivation strategy to you to

00:30:11.828 --> 00:30:14.220
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.470
GREG AVOLA: Right now, the
analytics are free.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.530
We do some advertising with the
badges, which is a form of

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.430
advertisement.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.710
I think what we want to do
eventually if we want to be

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.660
able to help breweries connect
better with their customers.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.080
As I said earlier, they don't
have the demographics on what

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.290
their actually age breakdown,
state breakdown, location

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.650
breakdown, of where their
beer is being sold.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.230
A lot of craft and even big
micro or macro breweries spend

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.410
millions and millions
of dollars

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.690
on these focus groups--

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.610
people telling them, OK, how
is the beer tasting?

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.110
Where we have a service that
does it for you freeingly

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.060
without them having to
pay the focus groups.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.030
And we fire that back to
you in analytics forms.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.690
So I guess once we get the
amount of data that I think is

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.750
relevant for them to make a
decision, I think this could

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.230
used for marketing decisions
and a lot of

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.700
other stuff as well.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.540
And it doesn't really stop
at just breweries too.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.770
Venues and bars could also use
this data as well to better

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:02.020
serve their clients.

00:31:04.602 --> 00:31:06.586
AUDIENCE: We're going to ask
about a little bit about the

00:31:06.586 --> 00:31:09.562
search function, because it's
probably [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:09.562 --> 00:31:11.050
in using it.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:15.420
I'm just curious why-- and I'm
not an engineer so there might

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.610
be an obvious answer here-- but
why doesn't it return a

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.860
suggestion when you misspell?

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.920
Anything would be helpful
in some cases.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.830
GREG AVOLA: Yeah, we're working
on that for another

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.290
release for our app.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:33.940
When we first moved off of a
basic regular search, our

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.112
cloud search from Amazon doesn't
provide "did you

00:31:36.112 --> 00:31:38.450
mean?" Which doesn't
really help us

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.210
when that comes together.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:42.410
So we tried to avoid that by
adding a lot of aliases for

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.550
common misspelled words.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.360
So we have a job that runs on a
monthly basis and basically

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.550
checks to see, versus the
queries, versus what was

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.000
returned, to see if
there's a match.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.620
So we can figure out what those
are, and we add them in.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.240
So that when you spell Sixpoint
with a space in

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.910
between or especially without
a space, it gets it right.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.270
But we definitely want
to add that in there.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.560
It's a highly requested
feature.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.589
AUDIENCE: Some of the breweries,
obviously, their

00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:05.640
names are not that
search friendly.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.120
GREG AVOLA: Right.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.160
Another thing people talk about
is barcode scanners for

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.940
actually picking up the bottles,
which is great.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.570
But I have this suspicion that
most people are drinking in

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.210
draft beers.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.220
And that you can't
do, not even with

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.000
technology to see the beer.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.010
It's not going to be able
to tell you what it is.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.590
Searching is definitely
something that we want to work

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.830
on and get better.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.510
We're very early in
the development.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.600
But you should have seen it
when we first started.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.090
It was horrible--

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.880
so bad.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.710
You could type in Coors, and it
would come up with nothing.

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:42.380
AUDIENCE: What is your
favorite badge?

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.390
GREG AVOLA: Favorite badge is,
I got married this past year

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.070
in September, and my co-founder
put in a surprise

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.770
badge for the wedding.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.600
And I was thrilled.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.870
I was actually flipping out when
I saw it, because I do

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.280
all development on my side.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.230
I don't know how the hell he
went to the database to put in

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.220
without unlocking to the
entire community.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.450
So that was pretty cool.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.880
But when I saw it, I
was really excited.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.370
That's probably the
best badge ever.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.606
But besides that, I have to say
the Take It Easy badge for

00:33:10.606 --> 00:33:13.630
taking in, I think it's
12 beers in 24 hours.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.300
I'm not encouraging binge
drinking whatsoever at all.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.660
OK?

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.410
But if you're at a festival or
a sampler, these are the

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.395
things that you get
those badges.

00:33:22.395 --> 00:33:24.890
And it's pretty cool.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.400
Someone told us we should to do
a cab badge, so when that

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.500
unlocks, it automatically calls
the yellow cab and gets

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.740
you a cab there.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.990
That would be funny.

00:33:36.908 --> 00:33:38.372
Anything else?

00:33:38.372 --> 00:33:40.324
AUDIENCE: So you were saying
you do this part time?

00:33:40.324 --> 00:33:40.812
GREG AVOLA: Yes.

00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:42.926
AUDIENCE: Do you hope that this
will eventually become a

00:33:42.926 --> 00:33:43.252
full-time gig?

00:33:43.252 --> 00:33:44.440
Or are you happy with this
as a part-time job?

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.460
GREG AVOLA: I hope to God it
becomes a full-time thing,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.520
because I don't sleep anymore.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.390
And it's just ridiculous.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.780
I really hope that one day we'll
be able to take this

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.190
full time and go down
that route.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.980
I think that we have a solid
business plan and a solid

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.850
group of customers and users.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.270
And one day maybe that will
turn into a full-time gig.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.120
We're just chugging along
now, hopefully.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.090
AUDIENCE: Do you have a list
of beers over there

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.580
so I can check in?

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.429
GREG AVOLA: Yes, they're
actually on the top--

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.159
just like searching.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.110
They're horrible, you can't
really read them.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.929
We do have a list.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.290
I think we can provide it.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.120
I believe it's the Lagunitas
Pilsner.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.100
It's the Peak Organic
Winter Session.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.930
There is a chocolate beer,
I believe, over there.

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:29.380
AUDIENCE: Racer 5.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.130
GREG AVOLA: Racer 5, which
I highly recommend if you

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.429
haven't had that one,
which is an IPA.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:37.889
Double White from Southampton,
which is a wheat beer.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:38.980
They're all in Untappd.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.090
And if you spell it right,
you'll be golden.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.739
You guys need to offer
an API, autosuggest.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:46.730
That's what you guys
need to do.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.980
And I'll be fine.

00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:54.190
AUDIENCE: There used
to be a 15 minute--

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.760
don't ask me how I know--

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.719
GREG AVOLA: You're
an early adopter.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.118
That's why you know.

00:34:59.118 --> 00:35:04.750
AUDIENCE: Was that there
for a liability issue?

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.690
GREG AVOLA: At first, we didn't
really know what this

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.360
would play out.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.150
The first time we released it
with a 30 minute interval

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.780
between check-ins.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.570
And we're like, yeah, no one
is going to do that.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.400
It'll be fine.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.740
And it was like, what
is wrong with you?

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.390
30 minutes?

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.720
I down a beer in five minutes.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.750
What's wrong with you?

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.452
So we had to change it to 15.

00:35:19.452 --> 00:35:20.430
It went 15 to 10.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:21.510
And we said, screw it.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.880
We just removed it altogether.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.040
It was more of a legal thing.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.040
We didn't know if someone would
check in too much, and

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.330
then it would be liable.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.100
But we crossed that bridge.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.800
And we're all with that.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.490
But yeah, it really was to
try to slow down abuse.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.030
We do have, just like
Foursquare, we do have people

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.520
that go out and they'll check-in
a million beers just

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.630
to get badges--

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.200
jumpers, as they call
them in Foursquare.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.270
And we have the same ones
on our service as well.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.500
So we didn't want anyone to
abuse the service and just

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.750
check in over and over again.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.460
So we have that restriction.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.850
Now, we've made it a
little bit better.

00:35:59.196 --> 00:36:01.383
AUDIENCE: Since you're here at
Google, is there anything you

00:36:01.383 --> 00:36:03.246
wish that Google would do with
the Android or anything to

00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:05.050
make you life easier?

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:06.300
GREG AVOLA: It's funny
that you ask that.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.000
I'm going to be completely
frank.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.530
It's what I do.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.840
Android, there are so many
different variants of Android

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.480
operating system and so many
different browsers that it

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.340
makes it hard to debug.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.030
I'll give you a classic example,
the HTC Resound.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.220
It's the phone with
Dr. Dre headsets.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.530
Verizon pushed an update
for Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.855
And in the standard browser, it
will not open the keyboard

00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:37.020
if you tap any text area.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.380
And I went out and bought my
own one and tested it out.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.830
And the version that Verizon is
pushing is different than

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.010
the one that you guys have.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.501
And it works fine on the
one I have but not on

00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:46.660
the one they do.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.820
And those kind of things
are so weird.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.180
And then the customer, the user
will be like, well, it

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.680
works in Chrome fine.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.420
But I have four browsers
on my phone right now.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.480
I have the regular browser.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.370
I have Chrome.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.590
I have something else.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.390
So there's a lot of differences
between the two.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.940
So making that standard browser,
either making it

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.830
Chrome, or getting rid of it, or
improving it to make it the

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.520
same level of Chrome would
be very helpful.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.620
In all honesty, though, Android
is easy to develop

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.370
for, because I don't jump
through all these hoops to

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.710
push my app out there.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.270
When I'm done with it, it's
there and it's on the store.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.580
As opposed to waiting weeks,
and weeks, and weeks to get

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.690
things to go into the store.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.777
I love Google, though.

00:37:25.777 --> 00:37:27.027
Nothing is wrong with it.

00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:36.500
AUDIENCE: Does PhoneGap help
with that situation at all?

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.620
GREG AVOLA: I find myself fixing
bugs with PhoneGap

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.710
because of these situations.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.900
So I'm able to pass information
back to them.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.670
PhoneGap is now owned by Adobe,
so they have a lot more

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.730
resources now to help us
solve these problems.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.580
But we're mainly telling
them that our

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.590
users have these problems.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.610
And they're trying to fix
them on their end.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.340
And then we're helping together
to help fix those.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.430
But for the most part, we're
dealing with a web view.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.360
So the web view controls the

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.240
interaction between our elements.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.370
So if you can't do it in a
standard website, then it will

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.750
not work in PhoneGap.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.600
In the example I gave, if you
open up the browser and you go

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.650
to Facebook and you type in
something in the text area,

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.080
your keyboard won't come up.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.710
But if you use Chrome,
it will be fine.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.830
So that's the difference between
the two browsers.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.320
So we just report that stuff to
them, and we help work with

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.170
them to fix the native
side of the code.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.640
One of the other things we
encounter a lot is typically

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.030
in Android when there's not a
lot of memory, you close the

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.510
processes that's running.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.840
So we shift over
to the camera.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.810
It's not a lot of memory will
kill our app, and then it will

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.700
come back and it will
basically be gone.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.940
So we work with them to fix
some of the problems

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.970
with that as well.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:50.090
AUDIENCE: I'm using Untappd for
the first time right now.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:50.595
GREG AVOLA: Are you
going to give me a

00:38:50.595 --> 00:38:51.965
bug report or something?

00:38:51.965 --> 00:38:54.890
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious to
know when you connect with

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.065
Facebook why you guys ask for
permission to read items in

00:38:57.065 --> 00:38:58.220
our Newsfeed.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.290
GREG AVOLA: Read in
your Newsfeed?

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.550
GREG AVOLA: I don't know.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.920
That's a good question.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.550
We should probably
get rid of that.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.730
But mainly what we should be
looking for is, we need your

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.400
email address, your birthday,
because we validate everyone

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.680
over the age of 21
in the country.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.580
And we post to your actual--

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:16.344 --> 00:39:18.110
what information that is
posted to Newsfeed.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:18.930
GREG AVOLA: Yeah, we
don't read it.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:19.860
I guarantee that.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.870
But I could remove that.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.120
I'll do it tonight.

00:39:24.235 --> 00:39:25.205
Sorry about that.

00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:26.175
Yes?

00:39:26.175 --> 00:39:27.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.520
GREG AVOLA: I can't
comment on that.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.570
No, we haven't had anything
like that.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.770
Hopefully, none of that
in the future.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.040
What we try to encourage with
all of our users is drinking

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.810
responsibly.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.055
It's actually printed on the
app when you load it up for

00:39:46.055 --> 00:39:47.850
the first time on the
splash screen.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.520
And we're all about drinking
socially and very responsibly.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.390
So we try to promote that
as much as we can.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.790
So you won't see any badges
like, double take it easy in

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.980
the future or something
like that.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.500
It's not really what
we're all about.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.924
AUDIENCE: Do you notice rating
drift throughout a session?

00:40:08.924 --> 00:40:12.790
There's a bar uptown where we
used to rate your beers and

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.406
everything, and I always noticed
that my numbers would

00:40:15.406 --> 00:40:16.350
drift up throughout the night.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.870
GREG AVOLA: I actually pulled
a stat on that yesterday.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.260
And I thought that
be the case.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.280
I thought earlier, you'd
probably rate higher.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.220
And lower, you don't know what
you're doing anymore.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.690
So you just hit the buttons
and it works.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.470
But actually it's consistent
across the board.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.310
There's no deviation.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:34.460
One thing I do recognize is that
on Untappd, Monday is the

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.910
worst day for Untappd of all,
which is pretty obvious,

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.300
because it's after
a long weekend.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.280
If it's a holiday, Monday
is popping.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.060
It's awesome.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.030
It's thrilling.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.250
But on Monday, usually you see
people either checking in

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.810
beers they've had previously
over the weekend or checking

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.300
in a beer saying, man,
I'm so hungover.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.160
This is ridiculous.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:53.950
Hair of the dog.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.716
Hopefully it worked.

00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:58.460
Yeah, that's usually
how it works.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.560
Like other websites, we don't
have a period on weekends and

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.430
nights where we can take it
down for maintenance.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.500
So we're at work all during
the day at other jobs.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.300
So the only time we
can take it down--

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.410
we did some stats on this-- is
Tuesday morning at four.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.160
And the only people that
actually get pissed off is

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.650
people in Australia.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.565
And they're just like,
I'm sorry.

00:41:17.565 --> 00:41:19.070
You're like a day ahead of us.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:19.680
Give us a break.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.370
Come on.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:23.310
So that's the only time we can
really take it down without

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.560
affecting entire people.

00:41:28.847 --> 00:41:30.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.060
GREG AVOLA: Well, thank
you very much.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:32.160
I really appreciate it.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.720
Thanks for the questions.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.970
And have some beer.
