00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:01.872
- [Instructor] In
previous videos, we talked

00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:04.495
about the dramatic turnaround
in the fourth century

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:06.829
in terms of how Christianity was treated

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:08.259
in the Roman Empire.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.137
As you enter into the fourth
century, it's persecuted

00:00:11.137 --> 00:00:15.323
by Diocletian, but then
Constantine takes power.

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:17.061
He's sympathetic to the Christians.

00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:20.074
He even convenes them in
order to unify the Christians,

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.564
to have a more unified
sense of what it means to be

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.763
Christian, in order to
settle things like the Arian

00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:29.114
Controversy, and he converts
himself to Christianity.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.211
And as we exit the fourth century,

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.673
you have Theodosius,
who makes Christianity

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:36.656
the official religion of the Roman Empire

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:40.659
and then begins to
persecute other religions.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.611
Now, what we're going to do in this video

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:45.729
is continue the narrative,
and in particular,

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.609
we're going to see how
there's an evolution between

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.348
the church in the west and
the church in the east.

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:54.408
In previous videos, we already talk about

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.093
how the Roman Empire itself
is initially administered

00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:02.091
between west and east, and
then that administration

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.758
becomes more and more formal.

00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:07.968
Theodosius is the last emperor
to truly rule both halves.

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.951
They start getting ruled separately.

00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:12.990
And as you get into the latter
half of the fifth century,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.157
the western empire itself
falls to Germanic conquerors.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:23.497
Now, in previous videos, we
talk about how the emperors

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:26.814
who rule from Constantinople
consider themselves

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:29.355
to continue the Roman Empire.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.932
They didn't call themselves
the Byzantine Empire,

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:33.158
as we now call them.

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.168
They call themselves the Roman Empire.

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:37.923
They considered themselves Roman emperors.

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:40.321
The west falls, as I just mentioned,

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.154
into a bunch of Germanic kingdoms.

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:48.492
Justinian is able to
reclaim a lot of the land

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:51.992
formerly lost in the western Roman Empire.

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:55.010
Now, there's some other interesting actors

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.643
we see emerging on this map,

00:01:57.643 --> 00:02:01.073
and once again, we're
now in the sixth century.

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:04.134
You have these Germanic
tribes, the Visigothic kingdoms

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:07.907
here in modern-day Spain, and
here in modern-day France,

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:09.647
you have the Franks.

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:11.565
And the word France really is referring

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.993
to land of the Franks,
another Germanic tribe.

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:20.690
Now, they are able to factor
much, much more relevantly.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.974
And when I say about,
I'm saying over the next

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:26.233
several hundred years in
this eventual division,

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.387
culturally and religiously,
between east and west.

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:32.943
As I mentioned in previous videos,

00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:37.067
the division, yes, it will
center on notions of language.

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:40.300
In the west, especially in
the church, Latin is used.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.374
In the east, in the church, Greek is used.

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:45.592
There are spiritual debates
that we will touch on

00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:48.534
in a few minutes, but there's
also a power struggle.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:52.935
You have the Byzantine Emperor
seated in Constantinople.

00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:57.691
You have the Bishop of
Rome, now known as the Pope,

00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.756
the Pope of Rome, who considers
themselves more and more

00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:03.404
the leader of all of Christianity,

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:06.414
and their argument there
is look, this is the church

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:09.584
that, according to tradition,
was founded by Peter,

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:11.729
first amongst the apostles.

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.424
You have the patriarch of Constantinople

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:18.198
and patriarchs of other
significant centers of Christianity

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.482
that say wait, hold on a second.

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:24.805
Yes, Bishop of Rome,
you are very important.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:28.094
But we consider you to
be first amongst equals.

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:31.389
You don't have jurisdiction
over all of Christendom.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.119
Together we have jurisdiction.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.223
And this was, to some degree,
the case under Justinian,

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.556
and it was very clear at
this time that the Byzantine

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:43.700
emperor was very powerful, not
just over the temporal realm,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.155
really referring to the
day-to-day material realm,

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:49.111
but also a lot of influence
on the spiritual realm,

00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:50.510
which was really supposed to be the domain

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.864
of the bishops or the
popes or the patriarchs.

00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:57.159
This notion of the pentarchy
was codified in the Justinian

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.343
law, this idea that these
five centers of Christianity

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:03.141
really have extra weight and collectively

00:04:03.141 --> 00:04:06.259
are really leading Christendom.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.425
Now, as I mentioned,
things get interesting

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:11.342
as we fast forward about 250 years.

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:15.246
So let's go to the year 800.

00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:20.135
So, one thing you might notice
is that group in yellow,

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.576
the Franks, have now conquered a lot more,

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:24.234
and they're conquering
it under the leadership

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:25.926
of Charlemagne.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:30.358
At the same time, you
see this green over here.

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:34.826
Islam has dramatically
spread from its founding

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:38.638
in the early seventh
century, all the way now

00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:41.698
as we're exiting the eighth century,

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.969
to cover most of the Middle East, Persia,

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.927
bordering on modern-day Pakistan, India,

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:51.877
north Africa, and even
going into modern-day Spain.

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:54.925
At the same time,
especially because of these

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:57.802
Islamic conquests, the Byzantine Empire

00:04:57.802 --> 00:05:02.028
and the Byzantine emperor
is significantly weaker.

00:05:02.028 --> 00:05:05.083
So you can imagine the
pope in Rome here saying,

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:06.741
well, who's going to protect me,

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:09.464
especially from my political enemies?

00:05:09.464 --> 00:05:12.420
Now, Charlemagne considers
himself something of a protector

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.143
of Christianity, and Pope Leo III

00:05:15.143 --> 00:05:16.925
goes to him for protection,

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:20.687
and Charlemagne is able
to actually provide it.

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:24.515
And in exchange, or
perhaps in thanks for that,

00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:28.682
the pope crowns Charlemagne
as Holy Roman Emperor.

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:31.496
Now, what's significant about this

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:35.901
is it really introduces
a fourth actor here,

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.485
because the title Holy Roman Emperor

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:40.725
was intentionally given to say, look,

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.215
now you, Charlemagne, you are the heir

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:45.188
to the grandeur of Rome.

00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:47.231
You are the heir to the Roman emperors.

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.554
Now, you might be saying,
wait, isn't that what

00:05:49.554 --> 00:05:51.359
the Byzantine emperors thought they were?

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:53.812
Didn't they think this
was the Roman Empire?

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.817
And at that time, their
emperor was an empress.

00:05:56.817 --> 00:05:59.981
It was Empress Irene of Athens.

00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:03.240
And so once again, this is
creating further tension.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.821
They're using different languages,

00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.404
Latin versus Greek.

00:06:07.296 --> 00:06:10.904
You now have the western
pope recognizing a different,

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:14.430
I guess you could say, Roman
emperor in Charlemagne.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.510
The nature of the west is
becoming more Germanic,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.183
and using the language Latin,
while the nature of the east

00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:24.016
is continuing in Greek traditions.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.254
On top of that, what you
have in the year 800,

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:32.295
you're actually in this
period where you've had

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:36.452
several conflicts over
this notion of iconoclasm.

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:38.972
This iconoclasm movement, you could say,

00:06:38.972 --> 00:06:42.767
started in 726 when the
Byzantine emperor said,

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:46.510
enough of these images of
Jesus and the Virgin Mary

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.016
and other figures of
Christianity in our churches,

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.559
citing references in the Old
Testament saying that hey,

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.706
we shouldn't have these images.

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:57.233
And so this iconoclasm or
these destroying of icons

00:06:57.233 --> 00:06:58.980
starts to begin.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.459
Well, the pope in the west, they say,

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:04.816
hey, we don't think we
have to listen to you.

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.197
I am the Bishop of Rome.

00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:08.367
I have universal jurisdiction.

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:11.642
And then to add insult
to injury, now, in 800,

00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:15.860
you have Charlemagne being
crowned Holy Roman Emperor.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.802
Now, a thread further running through this

00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:20.045
is something we've talked
about in a previous video,

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:23.212
this notion of filioque, where in 381,

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:28.164
the Council of Constantinople,
they augment the Nicene Creed

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:30.462
where they say, and we believe
in the Holy Spirit, the Lord

00:07:30.462 --> 00:07:34.113
and Giver of Life who
proceeds from the Father.

00:07:34.113 --> 00:07:37.484
Well, in the west, they add
the Latin term filioque,

00:07:37.484 --> 00:07:39.062
which means and the Son.

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:41.248
This is touching on some of
these notions in the Arian

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:44.350
Heresy where, where does the
Holy Spirit proceed from,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.026
if the Father and Son
are really co-divine,

00:07:47.026 --> 00:07:50.456
co-equal, of the same substance,
shouldn't the Holy Spirit

00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:53.022
proceed from both rather than just one?

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:54.340
Well, those in the east said, hey,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.597
this isn't what we agreed to,
while those in the west say,

00:07:56.597 --> 00:07:58.404
hey, we don't think it's
so important that you agree

00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:01.498
to things, because we
have the seat at Rome,

00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:04.748
the seat that was established by Peter.
