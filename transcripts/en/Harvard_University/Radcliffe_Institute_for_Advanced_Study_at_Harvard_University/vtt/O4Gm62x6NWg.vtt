00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.130
- Thank you very much, Judy
for the kind introduction,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.670
and thank you and
also Dean Cohen

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.016
for allowing me to be here.

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:15.390
It's a great honor
and privilege,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.250
and maybe more
importantly a great prince

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.070
pleasure to be among the
Fellows of this year.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.980
It's an experience that
broadens one's horizons,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.592
and I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.050
So I've been working
on these fish,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
and I hope I will make your
next hour worth your while.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.000
It's not about humans,
but I'll show you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.910
why fish even are much more
interesting than humans.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.520
I think they're also easier to
understand, at least for me.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.910
So I've worked on these
fish for over 30 years,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360
and have worked at different
levels of biological complexity

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.170
and organization.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.240
I've worked in the field.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.740
I've been studying
them in Nicaragua

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.560
since the mid 1980s,
an exciting time

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.472
when Ronald Reagan was
supporting the Contras.

00:00:57.472 --> 00:00:59.930
There was a civil war raging
when I was catching fish there

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.440
in 1984 and '85 and '87.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.000
Lots of people
were there to help

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.501
the people pick coffee or
dig trenches and wells,

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:10.750
and I was there catching fish.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.130
It was a very strange time.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.950
And I've been working on these
fish in Africa since 1990.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.200
So for the last 30
years almost, I've

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.077
been studying them in East
Africa, mostly Lake Victoria

00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:21.910
and Lake Tanganyika.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.750
I'll show you in a
moment where they are.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.940
And like I said, in Nicaragua,
we did some research.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.140
At the end of the
talk, I'll talk

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.556
about a little bit
of the research

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:30.170
we've done in Nicaragua.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.100
And for the first
or five, six or so,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.710
I will talk about
cichlids in Africa.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.080
Now, I had very
tolerant parents.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.660
It allowed me to
collect beetles,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.060
and I had a collection of
skulls and skeletons of mice

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.340
that I got out of pellets
that owls and birds of prey

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.570
regurgitate.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.180
I had a tame magpie.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
I also still have a tame
pair of ravens right now.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.830
They miss me and
I miss them too.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.390
And I was keeping fish--

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.394
catching fish with
my uncle, but also

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:06.560
keeping fish in an aquarium.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.930
And I was observing
fish, breeding fish.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.530
And so fish really are something
I'm passionately in love with,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.084
but they're also a good--

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.000
there are good academic
reasons to study them,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.980
which I hope I will
convince you of today.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.790
Now today, I'll be talking
about cichlid fishes mostly.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.230
I'll briefly talk about the
coelacanth and seahorses,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.140
but we've worked on many
different groups of fish,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.810
as you can see here.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.670
They're incredibly diverse
in coloration, body shapes,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
life history, social
systems, and so on.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.340
And they're also very
successful evolutionarily.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.500
More than half of all
living vertebrates--

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.550
so those are fish, amphibians,
reptiles, birds and mammal--

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.250
more than half of
those species are fish.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.100
So fish do something right,
maybe better than amphibians

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.960
or birds and mammals.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.320
And so in terms of evolutionary
success, one family of fish

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.950
is particularly successful
and those are the cichlid.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.400
There are probably 3,000
or more species of cichlid,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.010
so one in every 10
fish is a cichlid.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.650
So there are many good
reasons to study them.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.510
And when I was a
student here, I worked

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.210
with Kaleem who was a world
expert on the function

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.176
morphology of these
fish, how they feed.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.550
Now, because I'm not sure that
I'll get through the talk,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.133
I want to make sure
that I acknowledge

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.950
the people whose work I'm
actually presenting right now.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.530
I have quite a large lab
right now with over 25 people.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.740
The people whose research I
will mostly be presenting today

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.200
is Andy Kautt who will
be moving, as a postdoc

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.370
to Harvard in January,
Gonzala Machado

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.010
who is Argentinian
postdoc in my lab,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.880
and Claud Kratochwil
a German postdoc.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.530
I'll talk about their
research mostly,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.930
but other people's
research as well.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.790
Now, we have looked at
the genomes, as Judy said.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.620
So this, over the years, became
easier and cheaper and faster.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520
But initially, we looked
at genomes of fish,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.270
and we noticed that the
family the size of genes

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.770
is larger in fish, or tends to
be larger in fish, than in us.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.290
And so we actually discovered
that there was a so-called fish

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.451
specific genome duplication that
occurred here evolutionarily

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:12.950
speaking.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.670
So all modern fish, almost
every fish that you think of--

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.170
I don't know what you think of
when you think of fish, maybe

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.660
salmon or a guppy,
or I don't know

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.660
what fish you're thinking
of, I can think of many--

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.580
they all had, at
least initially,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.250
twice as many
genes as you and I.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.310
And maybe this is part of the
evolutionary reason for why

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.910
there's so many fish, because
they had twice as many genes

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.890
to play with evolutionarily.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.560
And then duplicating
genes as one mechanism

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.870
by which one can invent
new functions of genes.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.530
Because one copy of
the gene can continue

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.960
to use the old function,
do the old trick,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.600
and then the second copy is
free to accumulate mutations

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.680
and change its function.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.860
So having many genes
is possibly one way

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.620
by which you can make certainly
new functions of genes,

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940
and maybe bring
about more species.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.850
There are only a handful of
species, about 44 species,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.220
alive today of
primitive fish that

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.460
branch off before this
genome duplication occurred.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.800
And like I said, here's
a typical land vertebrate

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.780
as an example.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.230
Half as many genes as
fish, at least initially.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.060
Now over the years,
I've been interested--

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.809
and before I start
talking about cichlids,

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:25.874
let me tell you what the
question is that we are after.

00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:27.290
What we're trying
to understand is

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.990
what we can read from the
genome from all of the genes

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.400
that an animal has,
what it might look like,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.849
how it functions.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.390
And it's been a long dream of
mine to work on the coelacanth.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.575
Some of you may know this fish.

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:41.746
It's a living fossil.

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:43.120
Belongs to a
lineage of fish that

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.580
was supposed to have
gone extinct 75,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.230
80 million years ago.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.144
And it was a big sensation, this
is what the beast looks like.

00:05:51.144 --> 00:05:52.810
There was a big
sensation when this fish

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.170
was discovered in 1939.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.400
It was discovered by one
of my scientific heroes,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.580
Miss Latimer, and
that's why the fish is

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.500
called Latimeria chalumnae.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.300
And Miss Latimer,
she was a curator

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.350
at the Natural History Museum
in East London in South Africa.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.230
And completely by
coincidence and surprise,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.200
she discovered this
fish on the fish market

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.890
just before Christmas 1939, and
informed a famous ichthyologist

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.750
in South Africa that here's
this fish that had not been seen

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.030
alive for 80 million years.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.050
They're very, very rare.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.770
They live very
deep in the water.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.570
And it was a really sort of
a scientific criminal story

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.730
to find the next fish.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.750
It took until 1953 until the
fish was found on the Comoros

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.020
Islands, and it involved
a diplomatic incident

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.850
because GLB Smith, the famous
South African ichthyologist who

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.270
was after this fish, asked
the South African Air

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.080
Force to fly to
the Comoros Islands

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.290
and sort of could kidnap this
fish that they had found there.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.890
This led to huge
diplomatic problems.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.350
And for the next 20
years, only French--

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.100
the Comoros Islands were a
French colony at that time--

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.600
only French scientists
were allowed

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.600
to work on this fish
for the next 20 years.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.700
Now this fish is
not really a fish.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.220
If you know how to read
a evolutionary tree,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.710
you can see that
this fish actually

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.520
is closer related to us and
mammals and reptiles and birds

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.120
and so on than to other
things that we call fish.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.090
And in the Devonian, 420
or so a million years ago,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.090
a lineage of fish-- sort
of like the coelacanth,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.960
actually we now know it's the
lungfish-- that crawl on land

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.380
and give rise to amphibians,
birds, reptiles and mammals.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.810
And so it was
interesting to ask what

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.420
in the genome sort of
predestined these fish

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.810
to become our closest
relative among the fish.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.772
Now so we've looked at this with
a bunch of other colleagues.

00:07:56.772 --> 00:07:58.730
This genome was actually
sequenced at the Broad

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.230
Institute here in MIT.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.485
And we scoured the genome
for things that sort of are

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.410
not fish-like, but
rather are more tetrapod

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.000
land vertebrate like.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.590
And one of the
things we found is

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.110
that there's a certain
regulatory element,

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.920
a certain gene switch, in the
genome of the coelacanth that

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.980
is already like the
switch in a mouse.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.920
And you can actually replace
the switches-- take this fish

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.550
switch from the coelacanth and
put it into a mouse embryo,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.340
and the mouse embryo will
develop a normal limb and not

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.005
a fin.

00:08:31.005 --> 00:08:32.380
And this is, of
course, something

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.409
that must happen during
evolution that you change

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.907
from having fins to having limbs
so that you can walk on land.

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:40.990
And so these kinds of
things are things that we're

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.610
looking for in the genome.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.280
Of course also,
living on land implies

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.230
that you have to have a
different form of breathing.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.140
You have to protect
yourself from desiccation

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.370
and so on and so on.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.050
And we've found certain hints
in the genome of these fish that

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.180
explain why this lineage, or
the closely related lungfishes,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.840
were able to colonize land.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.710
Now we've done similar
things in the seahorse.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.520
And the seahorse, of course
beautiful and strange fish,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.860
they don't really look like
a fish, as you can see.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.380
They lost the caudal fin,
they don't have a tail fin.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.660
The males become pregnant.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.000
Not really, the
females lay the eggs,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.830
and the females lay
the eggs into the brood

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.490
pouch of the male.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.180
And there's actually a sex role
reversal where the females are

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.330
competing for the access to
the pouch space in the male,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.450
and the males are coy
and are evaluating

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.374
whose eggs they should except
into their brood pouch.

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:36.790
So there are many
different things

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.810
that are very unusual
about seahorses

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.490
that we also explored
in the genome,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.050
so get at the essence of
what makes a seahorse.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.410
Now one thing that they're also
lacking are the pelvic fins.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.840
These are the fins at the belly
that usually, in our case,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.750
would be the hind limbs.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.510
One thing that we noticed is
that these fish were lacking

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.000
a particular gene
called TBX4 and this

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.900
is a gene that is
switched on in any embryo,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.690
like a mouse or
zebrafish, any vertebrate,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.370
to tell the embryo
this is where you

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.720
will develop your hind legs.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.660
Remember, the seahorse
lacks the pelvic fins,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.290
so it lacks this gene.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.500
And we did a CRISPR/Cas
analysis in a zebrafish

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.620
where we took out
it's TBX4 gene.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.680
And lo and behold, it
lost its pelvic fin.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.380
So this is the kind of
approach that one can take now

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.920
to test the function of genes,
and to functionally essay

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.850
whether these
ideas one has about

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.890
what is coded in the
genome about the phenotype

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.870
of an organism or the life
history of an organism.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.720
Now let me switch
to the cichlids.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.030
As I said, they are
extremely diverse.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.430
These are all cichlids from Lake
Tanganyika, very, very diverse.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.210
There are about 250 species
of cichlid fish that

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.650
only live in Lake Tanganyika.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.750
It's the oldest African lake.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.390
It's about 10 to 12
million years old or so.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.490
And 250 species of
this one family, this

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.330
is as much biodiversity
of all families of fish

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.490
that we have in Europe
east of the Ural Mountains.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.990
So the cichlid fishes are really
very diverse, and much more

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.390
diverse than any other
family or fish that

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.380
also lives in these lakes.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.890
I'll come back to
this in a moment.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.870
As Judy already said,
this is the distribution

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.786
of the cichlid fishes.

00:11:24.786 --> 00:11:26.630
They live in tropical waters.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.110
And I will first talk
about the cichlid and the

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.070
their of biodiversity,
the East African region.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.190
But as I said, we've
also studied them

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.960
in Central America,
mostly in Nicaragua.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.520
There are certain reasons
for why that's a good site

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.430
to study cichlids, which I'll
explain to you in a moment.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.220
In East Africa, there are
three very, very large lakes--

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.550
Lake Victoria, Lake
Tanganyika, and Lake Malawi.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.700
And each of these three lakes
has so-called species flocks,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.760
or adaptive radiations of
hundreds of species of cichlids

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.670
that only live in
these particular lakes.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.160
We now know-- and this was
not known 30 years ago when we

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.380
started to sequence
DNA of these fish--

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.470
how they are related.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.320
And we also know how
old the lakes are.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.520
And it turns out
that, for example

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.840
for the case of Lake Victoria,
it's pretty well established

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.490
at Lake Victoria is
only 14,000 years old,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.270
yet there are 500
species of cichlids that

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.040
only live in Lake Victoria.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.600
So this is the world
record for rates

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.490
of speciation of the
origin of new species

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.190
where you can have 500 or 600
species living in this one

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.880
lake.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.080
It's a huge lake.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.544
It's one of the largest
lakes in the world.

00:12:36.544 --> 00:12:39.210
And when I say that 500 species,
I don't mean that there are 500

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.540
species throughout the lake,
but rather speciation--

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.610
as I'll come back to
the end of the talk--

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.150
is a local phenomenon, and
the biodiversity is summed up

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.580
over the entire lake.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.970
Now one of the reasons why the
cichlids are so spectacular,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.830
and why they're such
an interesting model

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.250
system for many evolutionary
phenomenon is their diversity.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.380
And as Judy already
mentioned, if you

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.230
have 500 species
co-existing in one lake,

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.510
they have to go out of each
other's way ecologically,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.890
otherwise they would be
out competing each other.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.410
So each species has to
have its own well defined

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.920
species specific niche to
go out of each other's way.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.410
And if you have 500 species
co-existing-- or even,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.452
in the case of Lake Malawi,
800 to 1,000 species

00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:22.910
co-existing in one
leg-- that means

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.690
that they have to have
incredible specialization

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.480
and incredible adaptations
to a very specific lifestyle.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.310
So here we have so-called
ecological guilds that are

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.270
specialized to scraping algae,
or some of them are specialized

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.440
to feed on the babies
of other cichlids--

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.052
pedophages, they're called--
and they suck out babies or eggs

00:13:46.052 --> 00:13:46.760
out of the mouth.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.176
As Judy was mentioning, I'll
show you a video in a second,

00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:50.270
they're mouth brooding.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.020
So if they are trying to protect
their eggs or babies from being

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.030
eaten, but there's
several species

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.030
that try to suck out the
babies, or ram the mouth,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.400
so that the mother will
spit out the babies.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.310
There are even eye
eaters and scale eaters

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.610
that I'll talk
about in a moment.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.100
Now let's compare this to
boring adaptive radiations,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.890
like Darwin's finches.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.250
There are only 14 species.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.730
Of course, they are
famous, and if they

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.480
weren't called Darwin's
finches maybe they

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.630
wouldn't be quite as famous.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.760
And their adaptations are also
reflected in the size and shape

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.450
of these builds.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.110
Also the Darwin's finches have
very specialized ecological

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.790
niches that allow them to
feed particularly efficiently

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.670
on, let's say, hard seeds, or
getting small insect larvae

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.790
or of the bark of
trees, and so on.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.460
And they're of course,
a beautiful model

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.800
system where one--

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.220
the grants at Princeton have
shown that natural selection

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.220
can act, and El Nino
is very strongly

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.360
changing the typical big shape
of finches from one generation

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.680
to the next.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.520
Now the beaks of the cichlid
fishes, as Judy was mentioning,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.180
are pharyngeal jaws,
a second set of jaws.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.270
So the way this happens
is developmentally

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.030
and evolutionarily, the gill
arches that hold the gills--

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.580
this is sort of the last thing
the prey sees when it goes

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.340
into the mouth of a fish--

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.260
the gills hang here
on the gill arches.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.130
And the fifth gill arch is
modified into its second jaw.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.930
In this x-ray here,
you can sort of see,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.740
this white area here are
very strong pharyngeal jaws.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.170
And you can see the gut
here because this fish is

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.360
specialized to
feeding on snails,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.350
and it has very strong teeth
and very strong jaws and muscles

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.700
to crush snails.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.730
And what you see
here in this x-ray

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.550
are the snail shells in the
white contrast in this x-ray.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.700
And so this last book
that was written,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.160
sort of the cichlid Bible,
by Fryer and Iles in 1972,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.460
shows the diversity
of pharyngeal jaws

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.560
in the oral jaws of these fish.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.960
And we now know much
more about the genetics

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.930
of how you make these jaws
and how you make tooth shape

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.030
differences in these fish.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.060
But this is the part of the
explanation for why cichlids

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.190
are so evolutionarily
successful,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.770
because they can do things
with their jaws that other fish

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.450
cannot do, like for example
crack very hard snails.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.020
There's actually an
evolutionary arms

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.804
race going on where the snail
shells are getting harder

00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:19.720
and harder and harder,
and the pharyngeal jaws

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.636
are getting stronger and
stronger and stronger

00:16:21.636 --> 00:16:23.020
to crack them.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.227
So we've been interested in
looking at cichlid fishes

00:16:28.227 --> 00:16:29.560
from many different standpoints.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.110
One is to look at the
evolution of the coloration.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.570
And as you can see
here, they're incredibly

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.140
diverse in body shape,
and coloration, and almost

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.280
every feature.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.890
And I'll talk about social
systems and mating systems

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.670
in a moment.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.450
Yet evolution has repeated
itself in the cichlids.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.500
Convergent evolution
is quite common,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.100
and this is something that was
only becoming clear once we

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.540
were able to sequence DNA.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.450
Because only based
on DNA trees were

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.320
we able to tell which
species are related to which,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.780
and thereby discover that
what we're dealing with

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.510
is a rampant convergent
evolution that

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:08.680
happens in these species
flocks and the cross.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.569
So based on DNA
sequences, we now

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.109
know that all of these
fish here on your right

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.270
are descended from
one, if you will,

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.579
cichlid Eve that
colonized Lake Malawi.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.880
And all of these fish are more
closely related to each other

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.736
than they are to those fish.

00:17:23.736 --> 00:17:25.569
Actually, all of those
fish from Lake Malawi

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.119
are derived from a fish that
sort of looked like this.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.570
It's a haplochromine cichlid,
a particularly successful group

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.140
of cichlids.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.970
They're sort of the
cichlids of cichlids.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.600
This fish left Lake Tanganyika,
the older lake, colonized Lake

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.290
Malawi, and then 800 new
species arose, and some of them

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.930
look very, very similar
to these other cichlids

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.100
in Lake Tanganyika.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.720
That's, of course, great.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.810
I mean, evolution
being predictable,

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:54.130
evolution repeating itself,
who would have thought this?

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.520
And this, of course, raises
a lot of questions to ask.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.960
Well, if evolution
repeats itself,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.150
what are the ecological
forces that shape

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.330
these ecological communities?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.070
And what are the
underlying genomic

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.660
and developmental
mechanisms that

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.660
bring about these
similarities in body shape,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.220
tooth shape,
coloration, and so on.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.220
And this is what we've
been trying to understand

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.720
for the last 30 years.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.190
I'll talk to you about lips.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.440
You can see these very
pronounced hypertrophied,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.020
big lips, and they
evolved several times

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.640
over in the cichlids.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.700
Also I will talk about how
you make these stripes.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.790
Most cichlids have
bars, vertical bars,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.840
but some of them--

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.120
about a third of
the species-- have

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.230
these stripes
horizontal stripes.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.130
Now this is an age old question,
and here at Harvard Stephen Jay

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.600
Gould famous paleontologist
has thought about this

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.990
and written in his book
Wonderful Life almost 30

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.884
years ago, what would happen--

00:18:52.884 --> 00:18:54.300
he did a thought
experiment-- what

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.819
would happen if you rewind
the tape of evolution?

00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.860
And if you tell your
students rewinding the tape,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.110
they have no clue what you're
talking about of course,

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.150
because they don't know
what tape is, that you

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.260
used to record data on tapes.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.290
Or I always ask myself, why does
the symbol is a floppy disk?

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.220
I mean, students don't know
what a floppy disk looks like.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.910
And then event, if you were
able to redo evolution,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.280
Gould predicted that evolution
would not repeat itself.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.600
He would say that there's too
much contingency and too much

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.760
unpredictability in the
evolutionary process.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.210
He thought that we would
not get the same outcome.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.310
Simon Conway Morris,
also a paleontologist,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.920
at Cambridge University, has
a very different opinion.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.790
He thinks that if we
went to other planets,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.280
if we were to discover
life on other planets,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.620
he would predict it would
be bilaterally symmetrical

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.150
on the left and the right.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.670
That those organisms would
likely have camera eyes,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.010
and maybe even look human like.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:58.190
Conway Morris has a bit of
a religious bent to him,

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.832
but in any event,
this is a question

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:02.290
that evolutionary biologists
and paleontologists have asked

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.270
themselves for a long time.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.960
And these are the things, as I
said, I will be talking about--

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.010
these hypertrophied lips.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.230
They have evolved independently
in Victoria, Malawi,

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.730
Tanganyika, but also in
the New World in Nicaragua,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:18.100
and these stride patterns
that have occurred.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.840
A good friend of
mine, Jonathan Losos,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.630
we were both grad students
in Berkeley together,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.450
just recently published a book
called Improbable Destinies,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.870
where he sort of revisits
this issue of determination

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.630
and contingency on evolution.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.270
And in very modest
ways, the I Gazette

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.970
that wrote about this
to sort of say, well

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:43.510
this is how evolution might
happen, or what is the answer?

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.720
Jonathan's book really
does not particularly

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.770
side with Gould
or Conway Morris.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.712
He says, well it's
sometimes like this

00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:53.920
and it's sometimes like that.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.050
And I'll like to offer our
data for this discussion.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.550
Now of course, convergence is
not only found in cichlid fish,

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.930
but it's a universal
phenomenon also in mammals.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.130
So those of you
who've been to Europe,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.340
you must know a
hedgehog, or this thing

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.390
looks like a shrew, or
this vole type thing,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.520
and he's sort of
a punky hedgehog.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.300
And this is actually a
very strange hedgehog.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.190
This is a tenrec.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.480
Tenrec's live-- it's a
particular lineage of mammals.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.030
A former student of mine who
was a professor in Braunschweig

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.530
made this tree of
mammals, and could

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.140
show that the
tenrecs of Madagascar

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.370
actually are closely
related to elephants.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.990
They're closely related
to African mammals,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.940
and have nothing to
do phylogenetically,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.460
evolutionarily with these forms.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.430
My lab is actually, right now,
involved in several vole genome

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.940
projects, mole genome project.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.770
And the question is,
how can this happen?

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.070
How can evolution repeat itself?

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.320
And another former student
of mine, Misha Milinkevich,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.460
is now professor in Geneva.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.550
He's actually looking
at exactly this question

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.190
of the similarity between
tenrecs and hedgehogs,

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.390
and shrews and tenrecs from
an even deeper perspective.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.160
To ask, how do you
make these spines?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.500
Is it the same genes,
or did evolution

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.520
find a different developmental
mechanism to make spines?

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.810
So these are all unsolved and
very interesting questions.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.460
Now let me give you
an outline of what

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.260
I wanted to say after
this long introduction.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.051
I'm going to talk about
handedness in fish,

00:22:28.051 --> 00:22:29.350
about egg spots--

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.210
I'll tell you in a
second what this is--

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.349
evolution of color
patterns as I already said.

00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:34.390
I'll talk about the lips.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.360
And the last thing is to
talk about how we actually

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.920
make new species.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.830
One of the most
incredible examples

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.630
for adaptation
and specialization

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.510
are the scale eating
cichlids of lake Tanganyika.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.690
These are fish that
have asymmetric heads.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.835
Half the fish have heads
turned to the right.

00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:53.860
Other half of the
population of fish

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.820
that have fish to the left.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.280
And this results in them
feeding on the left side

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.940
or the right side
of their victims.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.860
And if you look in
these populations,

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.120
it's fantastic how, over
the years, when you collect

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.090
these fish, about
50-50 of the population

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.610
will be left or right headed.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.920
The explanation for this
is negative frequency

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.210
dependent selection.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.690
That is, if one of the mouths
becomes more abundant--

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.260
let's say that the fish that
have heads turned to the left

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.510
that attack their
victim from the right--

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.100
theirs victims
survive this attack,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.990
but they will
smarten up know I'm

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.570
going to be attacked more
often from this side.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.360
This will reduce the
chances of these fish

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.540
to be successful
in feeding scales.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.500
And when you open up
the stomachs of these,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.740
it looks like a book.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.770
There are these
individual scales

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.790
that they have in
their stomachs.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.750
So if these are disadvantaged,
they're less often successful,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.610
then these will be more
successful the next generation.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.739
And so this leads to this stable
polymorphism at around 50%.

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:55.780
And we've confirmed this.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.450
This is data from Japanese
colleagues from the '90s,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:02.670
but we've done this now in
southern Lake Tanganyika

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.830
before.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:09.640
Now trigger warning, this is how
the scale eating cichlids feed.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.670
On this innocent-- this is,
of course, in the aquarium.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.880
They would not normally
feed on a goldfish,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.350
and the goldfish is
way too small a prey.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.580
But the point is to show
you how the fish actually

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.310
gets the scales from
the side of the fish.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.980
And they almost always
will attack the offense

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.540
from a particular side.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.270
So a right headed fish will,
80% or 90% of the time,

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.490
attack the fish from the
right side and so on.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.640
And we were interested
in trying to understand

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.270
what is the genetic
basis of this,

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:43.540
or do the fish learn to
become a specialist in feeding

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.440
on the left side
or the right side.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.740
These are fantastically
interesting fish,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.470
because both the father and the
mother take care of the babies

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.770
both.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.390
The mother and the father
will take the babies

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.070
into their mouth
and protect them.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.825
But they're actually
are not so careful,

00:24:55.825 --> 00:24:57.699
or we don't quite
understand what's going on,

00:24:57.699 --> 00:24:59.740
but we have done
paternity analyzes.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.280
We've been in the field in
Lake Tanganyika, collected

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.180
these fish.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.150
And it turns out there are
many foster babies in the mouth

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.770
of the mother or the father.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:09.970
It's not quite clear why.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.710
There's some
theoretical arguments

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.439
for why this might
be a good thing.

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:15.980
But in any event, we've looked
at this now for several years,

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.640
and we understand a little
bit more about this fish.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.440
We know that
behavior comes first.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.520
So the little baby fish-- we
can breed them in the lab--

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.680
the baby fish
specialize on attacking

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.100
from the left or the right
side before the mouth become

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.150
asymmetric.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.370
So maybe behavior drives this.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.940
We also think there's quite a
large environmental component

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.584
to this.

00:25:37.584 --> 00:25:39.500
And the other thing we've
just done recently--

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.500
and I'm excited about
this study because we just

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.570
got it accepted
yesterday-- what we've done

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.940
is to test fish
that always attack

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.110
from this side or that side, and
quickly sacrifice these fish.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.390
And then we take the brain--
we take the left side

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.120
and the right side of the
brain, different regions--

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.070
and then ask which
genes are switched

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.620
on the left side or
the right side to see

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.150
are there genes
that tell the fish

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.580
you should attack from the
left side or the right side.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.960
Now first of all, we find
pronounced differences

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.417
in which genes are switched on
and which region of the brain.

00:26:11.417 --> 00:26:13.250
And I don't have time
to go into the details

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.210
of how we do these analysis
or what the brain regions do.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.500
And then we can actually
test more interestingly,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.710
are their genes
equally expressed

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.260
on the right side of the brain
or the left side of the brain.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.690
A good part of the brain
is bilaterally symmetrical

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:29.530
obviously.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.440
And so we looked at this, and
we find very large differences

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.380
that help us explain
how in the visual cortex

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.280
and also in the motor cortex
the different genes might

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.980
be contributing to this
laterality in the behavior.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.400
So there's so much to
be studied in this fish

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.080
from the social
system of these fish,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.150
the ecology of these
fish, how they feed,

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.229
down to the neurobiology.

00:26:51.229 --> 00:26:53.770
Let me tell you about the next
thing, which is the egg spots.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.820
What are egg spots.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:01.630
Egg spots are these little
spots on the anal fin of males,

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.690
of actually, as it
turns out, about 2,000

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.340
species of cichlids.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.030
All of the haplochromine
cichlids have these egg spots,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.040
the males have these egg spots.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.300
And all of these fish are
maternal mouth brooder,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.890
and the thing that
Judy already mentioned.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.760
Now this spawning behavior
in this social system

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.650
has large consequences
for these fish.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.220
Because it limits
the number of eggs

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.200
the female can
spawn by the space

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.060
she has available
in her mouth, which

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.780
is not very much, maybe
20 eggs to 30 eggs

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.250
she can take up her mouth.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.230
This has population
genetic consequences.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.185
These fish are also
very philopatric,

00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:41.560
they don't move
very much around,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.480
and they come back to
where they were born.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.050
Now this is based on
the evolutionary tree

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.210
that we made for
all of these fish.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:54.130
We can reconstruct when did egg
spots evolve evolutionarily,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.110
and when did maternal
mouth brooding evolve?

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.330
And both happened
here at the root

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.120
of all the modern
haplochromine cichlids.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.550
Now what are these
egg spots used for?

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.710
So this is one fish.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.250
This is actually work
that was done in the 1960s

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.260
by Wolfgang Wickler
in the Max Planck

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.510
Institute for animal behavior
where Connor Lorenz also

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.010
worked.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.720
See, here's the male, beautiful
male, with the egg spots.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.820
The male digs a nest.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.800
He takes away those stones.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.050
And he is trying to attract
the females to spawn with him.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.340
For that, he will want to have
a very nice spawning area,

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.090
and he will want to look nice
and probably also smell nice.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.280
There's probably chemical
communication going on.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.960
And you can sort
of see here, he's

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.420
quivering, showing the
female his egg spots,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.970
trying to entice her
to lay eggs with him.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.780
There's the female.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.977
She's interested.

00:28:43.977 --> 00:28:46.310
And here's the male trying
to get her to spawn with him.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.340
What happens then is
she will lay the eggs.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.080
They're not fertilized then yet.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.800
And the male will fertilize
these eggs externally

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.430
in the water.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.080
So here's the female.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.490
She's laying the eggs.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.570
And here's the male.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.390
He's nibbling at her anal fin.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.210
There's the eggs.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.650
She takes them up in her mouth.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.480
They're not fertilized yet.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.420
What happens next is that
the male will show her

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.700
his egg spots and the anal fin.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.060
The egg spots have the same
size and color as the eggs,

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.116
and she thinks that she
has to pick up more eggs.

00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:18.740
And so what she does,
you can see here,

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.070
she's nibbling at the anal fin
trying to pick up more eggs.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.860
And the male releases
sperm into the water.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.840
She sucks up the
sperm, and the eggs

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.950
get fertilized
inside of her mouth.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.010
You think the fish are boring.

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.550
So this is how she
takes care of the eggs.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.330
She protects them in her
mouth so hopefully no predator

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:42.870
can get to them.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.850
So again, this spawning
behavior and the egg spots

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:51.110
evolved here at the base
of all of this diversity.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.720
And we were able to
find the genes that

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.225
are expressed in these
spots that make these spots,

00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:58.100
because we were interested
to see, how do you

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:58.808
make these spots.

00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:02.670
Because clearly, these
so-called key innovation,

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.450
they might be part of the reason
for the evolutionary success

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.620
of these fish.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.270
We ended up finding
a particular gene.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.880
The details are not important.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.180
And there's a way to show
where a gene is switched on.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.430
These blue spots here,
the so-called in-situ

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.434
hybridization, where
you can visualize

00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:19.600
where a gene is switched on.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.950
And we did this in many
different species of fish.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.283
And the interesting thing
is-- or one of the interesting

00:30:24.283 --> 00:30:24.840
things is--

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.680
they are sort of egg spots
already in different fins.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.390
They're part of the
coloration pattern

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.370
of many species of fish.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.770
And we think that this
developmental way,

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.950
the genetics of making these
egg spots, was co-opted.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.500
And this is something that
Stephen Jay Gould invented,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.980
because he recognized-- also
Francois Jacob recognized--

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.990
that evolution is
not an engineer.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:46.730
Evolution is a tinkerer.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.290
Evolution has the
problem that it

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.180
has to work in every
generation, right?

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.770
So the fish have to feed, have
to survive, have to spawn.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.382
And you cannot be radically
changing everything.

00:30:57.382 --> 00:30:59.840
You cannot be like an engineer
and start with a white piece

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.740
of paper.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.770
But rather these fish have
continue it every generation.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.520
And the consequences, or
one of the consequences,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.590
is you take an existing
way of making egg spots

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.840
and move them to the anal
fin from the dorsal fin.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.260
And we think that this is part
of the explanation for how

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.140
this worked in this case.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.380
Now more than 10
years ago, my lab

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.407
was part of a large
group of researchers

00:31:23.407 --> 00:31:25.490
that wrote a so-called
white paper to the National

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.323
Institute of Health to
get money to sequence

00:31:27.323 --> 00:31:29.060
genomes of cichlids,
and this was

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.700
done with old technology saying
our sequencing-- this was

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.990
done at the Broad Institute.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.595
And finally 2014,
we published this.

00:31:35.595 --> 00:31:38.450
We published the
complete genomes, or more

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.950
or less complete genomes,
of five species of cichlids

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.940
from Lake Victorian,
Lake Tanganyika, Malawi,

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.880
and some other cichlids that
are not evolutionary quite so

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.057
interesting-- tilapia.

00:31:48.057 --> 00:31:50.390
I'm sure you've eaten them
all-- tilapia is an important

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.890
cichlid--

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.095
that's the most
commonly used species

00:31:54.095 --> 00:31:56.160
in aquaculture in the tropics.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.190
So if you've eaten tilapia,
you've eaten a cichlid.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.730
Now when we sequenced
the genomes,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.220
we had, maybe in
hindsight, the naive idea

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.130
that we would find the
answer to why there are so

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.200
many cichlids in the genome.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.427
Because as I said, this
cichlids are singularly

00:32:13.427 --> 00:32:14.510
evolutionarily successful.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.724
The other families of fish
that live in these lake,

00:32:16.724 --> 00:32:17.640
there are not so many.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.540
So we thought, well,
what can you read on

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.200
of the genome of these fish.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.740
And I summarized this in a
Scientific American article

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.330
a year or so ago--

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.574
these watercolors
were made by an artist

00:32:28.574 --> 00:32:30.740
who, unfortunately, passed
away after this paper was

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.530
published--

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.240
summarizing what we had
found in the genome.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.610
We find that the
mutation rate in cichlid

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.380
is higher than in
most other fishes.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.650
So that's sort of a smoking gun.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.870
We also found that
there is a higher

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.130
rate of gene duplication.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.687
Remember that I said,
if you duplicate a gene,

00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:51.020
you have two copies-- they're
usually right next to each

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.900
other--

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.830
the second copy is free
to accumulate mutation

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.410
because the first
copy will continued

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.670
to keep the animal
alive, continue

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.260
to do the original
function of the gene.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.140
So we do find that, on the
evolutionary branches leading

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.450
to the most diverse cichlids,
that there was a higher

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.060
rate of gene duplication.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.090
We also find an increased
rate of jumping genes--

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.300
of genes jumping around in
the genome that, more often

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.470
than not, tend to have
disruptive negative function.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.330
There are some diseases that
are associated with them,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.090
but they also can lead to the
evolution of new function.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.627
If those jumping genes move
into the region of genes

00:33:29.627 --> 00:33:31.710
that are switches for the
functioning of the gene,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.470
it can actually bring
about new function.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.432
So these are so-called
regulatory changes.

00:33:36.432 --> 00:33:37.890
I'll come back to
this in a moment.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.630
A gene is not only a thing that
codes for protein, but also

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.640
sort of switches in there to
tell the gene when and where

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.460
it's supposed to be switched
on, and which tissue,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.710
and what stage of development.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.000
So we find that, and we also
find a faster or higher number

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.830
of novel microRNAs.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.810
MicroRNAs are interesting.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.600
It's been know for 10 or so
years, and an interesting way

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.610
to regulate the switching
on and off of genes.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.100
We find more of this.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.680
So we find five or
six hints at why

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.639
cichlids may be so
evolutionarily successful,

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.100
but no real smoking gun.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.980
But the genome seems to
be particularly viable.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.380
Let me talk about the repeated
evolution of these color

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:18.879
patterns.

00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:21.560
Remember what I just said
about the gene switches.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.320
Color is very
important for cichlids.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.270
In terms of mate
choice, I already

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.889
showed you the egg
spots are probably

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.906
important in decision
making who mates with whom.

00:34:31.906 --> 00:34:33.280
The color patterns
are important.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.710
It's been known that
many species of cichlids

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.860
are polymorphic for
color, so they can

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.730
have blue males or red males.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.800
And females will tend to
prefer a certain color

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.300
over another color, and so on.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.540
So in of sexual
selection in speciation,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.473
color is probably important.

00:34:48.473 --> 00:34:50.889
And as I said, cichlids are
extremely diverse in the color

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:51.219
patterns.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.139
I mean, you can see this
beautiful color here.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.510
By the way, the German name
for the family cichlidae

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.397
is buntbarsch, a colorful
purchase, aptly named.

00:34:58.397 --> 00:34:59.980
And they're very
popular in the hobby,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.140
because they're so
interesting, they're so smart,

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.060
they do so many
interesting things.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.790
Now this diversity
of color patterns

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.310
can be divided, really,
into two major themes--

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.570
bars and stripes, horizontal
stripes or vertical bars.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.390
This is a common pattern
that happens all the time.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:20.590
But the interesting thing
is these horizontal stripes

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.547
can evolve, get
lost, and reevolve.

00:35:23.547 --> 00:35:24.880
That's already an unusual thing.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.030
If we map these
horizontal stripes

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.840
on an evolutionary tree, the
details are not important,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.920
but we see that they come and
go at least 30 or 40 times

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.170
during the evolution
of cichlid fishes,

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.230
both in Lake Victoria,
and Lake Malawi, and also

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.410
Lake Tanganyika.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.020
About two thirds of all
species have these bars,

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.160
and one third or so have
these horizontal stripes.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.640
Now one other very
cool thing things

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.770
about cichlids that we
can hybridize them all.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.080
At least in Lake
Victoria, we can

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.230
take any of those 500
species, by not giving them

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.070
a choice in the aquarium, we
can force the females to mate

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.960
with males of another species.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.030
This allows us to
do genetics, which

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.430
is not possible to do
for many other organisms.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.760
And also this is
probably due to the fact

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.680
that they are so
extremely young.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.590
So in any event, we can
hybridized a barred species

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.630
with a striped species.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:23.170
The F1 generation, the
hybrids, will look barred.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.630
And then the F2 generation,
three quarters will be barred,

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.710
and about one fourth
will be striped.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.810
So this is a Mendelian trade.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.630
And what we end up
finding is that there's

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.310
a single region
in the genome, we

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.780
can map this phenotype
on the genome.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.070
We have genetic maps for this.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.130
We have genetic
markers, and we can

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.260
associate the phenotype
with the genotype,

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.720
and thereby localize the genes.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.020
We can find that the gene
responsible for making

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.750
bars or stripes is on
a particular chromosome

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.920
in a particular place.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.810
We can then test this gene.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.590
So we can sort of zoom
in in trying to find

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.570
the gene responsible for this.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.450
And it turns out to be a gene
that Hopi Hoekstra actually

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.910
has worked on here at Harvard.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.920
It's a group of genes that
are responsible for melanin

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.610
in the skin.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:17.380
So as these black bars are
made by black pigments,

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.410
and this gene is
involved in this pathway.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.750
And it's known to be
differentially expressed

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.390
in the brain between
barred and striped fish.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.270
But only in the skin we
find significant differences

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.860
in the expression
pattern, that means

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.670
in the copy number of
how often this gene is

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.320
switched on in the
skin of a barred fish

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.170
and of a striped fish.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:42.070
So we can do further tricks to
verify that this gene really

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.870
plays the causal role.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.580
So we can do again these
in-situ hybridizations

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.280
where we visualize,
through this blue color,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.280
that this gene is switched
on in the right place

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.050
and at different levels between
these different species.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.120
And we can do transgenics
and switch this gene off,

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.650
and make a different phenotype.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:02.990
Or we can switch it on to
produce another phenotype.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.145
Now interestingly, when
we sequenced this region

00:38:06.145 --> 00:38:08.770
that we think is important, and
we think this is a gene switch,

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.520
we call this enhancer
A. Not very fantasy,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.370
but we call it enhancer A
in this particular gene.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.150
And then we
sequenced this region

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.290
in many different
species of cichlids.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.110
We do find that there's
quite a bit of variation,

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.845
and it's not exactly
the same mutation

00:38:24.845 --> 00:38:26.450
in Lake Victoria
and Lake Malawi,

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.560
and Lake Tanganyika cichlids,
but it's always this region.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.580
Sometimes it's more complicated.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.150
But what we end up
concluding is that this

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:39.340
is a particularly label
genomic region where mutations

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.340
can come and go and result
in these drastic differences,

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.580
and being barred or striped
several times over within very

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.780
short periods of time.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.340
So evolution repeated
itself, and by some measure

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.950
used very similar
or maybe identical

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.860
genetic mechanisms
to reinvent itself,

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.410
which is unusual and
maybe not predicted.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.210
Now let me talk
about the next thing

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.730
that we were
interested in studying,

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.290
these very pronounced lips.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:11.070
These big lips are found
in Lake Victoria cichlids,

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.790
and some species
from Lake Malawi,

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.760
and some from Lake Tanganyika,
but also in the New World

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.710
in the cichlids that
I study in Nicaragua.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.000
And actually there's
a very strange fish

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.470
in South America
in Argentina that

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.380
also has these very big lips.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.520
Now Carl Zimmer caught this
our Angelina Jolie project,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.140
where we're trying
to understand what

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.840
is the genetic basis
for these big lips.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.176
And again, we can
do genetic tests.

00:39:34.176 --> 00:39:35.800
But the first question
is, why on earth

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.966
do they have these big lips?

00:39:36.966 --> 00:39:39.590
What are big lips good for?

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.300
It had been suggested that
having big lips allows

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.600
you to house is a lot
of mechanoreceptors,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.080
because the surface
area is very large.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.710
It has been suggested that a lot
of taste buds could be there.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.500
It has been suggested that,
particular volcanic crater

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.810
lakes, when the fist
bumps into the rocks

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.850
to pick up an
invertebrate or something,

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:03.130
there are these sharp edges
on these volcanic rocks,

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.990
and it might protect the fish.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.560
And the forth suggestion is it
might be acting like a gasket.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.450
When the fish goes
into a crevice

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:14.480
to suck out a prey item,
it sort of seals the area,

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.860
and it can produce suction
and suck out the prey.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.390
Now here's a
beautiful video that

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.270
shows you a particular
cichlid from Lake Malawi.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.510
And you can see, it has very
pointed and narrow heads.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.780
And you can see how it feeds
in the crevices, looking

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.120
for prey here in the lake.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:37.590
So you can see lies on its side,
and goes into these crevices.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.534
Now in the next sequence,
you will see the slow motion,

00:40:40.534 --> 00:40:41.950
you can actually
see what it does.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:46.230
So we think it has a lot
to do with creating a seal.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.580
So it goes into this crevice,
sucks up water and prey,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.170
and it can only do
this efficiently

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.390
by having this seal.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:57.690
So we were interested in asking,
how do you make these lips?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.850
And again, we were
able to cross fish

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.230
from Lake Victoria with big
lips and without lips to produce

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.520
hybrids, and then F2.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.150
The F2 trick is that
you have recombination.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.580
Genes get shuffled around
through recombination when

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.680
you produce eggs and
sperm, and then you

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.500
get segregation of particular
[INAUDIBLE] that might be

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.580
contributing to these things.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.200
The same is true for the
Nicaraguan cichlids, where

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.170
some have big lips,
some have small lips.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.900
We can hybridize them, and we
can map on the genetic maps

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.740
that we have how many
genes contribute to this.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.840
And it turns out that
in the Lake Victoria,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.659
the African cichlids
with big lips,

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.450
there are many genes
throughout the genome.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.140
These are all the different
chromosomes of these fish,

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.420
and these different
color codes mean lips.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.980
And we've also looked
at the behavior

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.010
to see how efficient are
they in sucking up prey.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.990
We give them trials
in the aquarium

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.900
here where we have Plexiglas
where we drive food.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.930
And the fish has to go into
these crevices and so on.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.770
So we can map the genetic
contributions to this behavior

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.210
and to the morphology.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.430
And as you can see, there
are many different loci,

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.350
something like 20 loci in
the genome of Lake Victoria

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.470
cichlids that
contribute to this.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.730
So it's what we call
a polygenic trait.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.300
It's a trait where many genes
have each a small effect

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.160
and contribute to the overall
large lips of these fish.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.280
So [INAUDIBLE] would
probably not like this.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.940
We have a core localization
of the lip phenotype

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.980
and the feeding efficiency.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.090
And we find evidence for natural
selection acting on these lips.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.750
That's the situation in Africa.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.590
The situation is very
different in Nicaragua,

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.790
where we find a single gene but
huge effect on the phenotype.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.280
This single gene, or
these locals here,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.420
behaves like an Mendelian trait.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.200
So you have either super
big lips, small lips,

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.660
or if you have two
alleles of this locus,

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.460
you have intermediate size lips.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:43:00.090
So this one QTL, this one
genomic region, this one locus,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.490
explains about 70%
of the variation.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.610
This genomic region that
we're trying to home in on

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.300
is still a several hundred
thousand base pairs large.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.547
There are several genes
that we have sequenced

00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:12.630
the genomes of these fish.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.090
There are several genes in this
QTL that might play a role.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.362
We had previously done
expression studies

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.070
where we look at which
genes are switched

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.087
on in big lipped and
small lipped fish,

00:43:22.087 --> 00:43:23.670
and we have a good
candidate for this,

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.400
but we haven't causally
confirmed this.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.225
We have done whole
genome sequencing

00:43:28.225 --> 00:43:29.850
where we've, in the
meantime, sequenced

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:33.204
several hundred
genomes of these fish.

00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:35.370
And through a different
statistical genetic approach

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:38.980
called GWAS, we can localize
a region in the genome,

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.820
and it turns out to be the
same region that we identified

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.524
with the QTL approach with
this genetic mapping approach,

00:43:45.524 --> 00:43:47.190
and we think this
might be a region that

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:51.480
has an inversion, which is quite
interesting evolutionarily.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.460
So here we have a situation
where evolution repeats itself.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.970
In Africa and in the New
world, producing these big lips

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.760
that serve the same
purpose, but probably

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.126
by a very different
genomic background

00:44:05.126 --> 00:44:06.750
and a different
developmental mechanism

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.490
to make these big lips.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:13.590
So Stephen Jay Gould might
be more along the lines

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:15.290
of what he thinks.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.920
Now, like I said, lips are
also an important trait

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.744
for sexual selection.

00:44:21.744 --> 00:44:23.910
There's a particular crater
lake in Nicaragua that's

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.209
only about 1,200 years old.

00:44:26.209 --> 00:44:27.750
And in this crater
lake, we find fish

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.180
with big lips of
the same species

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.400
and fish with small lips.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.230
These fish form
monogamous pairs.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.630
They spawn and lay
their eggs together.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.920
They defend their territory
against potential predators.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.010
And this allows us to,
in the crater lake,

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:49.950
swim around or scuba around
and see how many fish have lips

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.660
and how many have no lips.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.240
And if there was
random mating, you

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.200
would expect a certain
proportion of mixed pairs

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.870
or pairs with big lips and big
lips where male and female have

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.840
big lips, and pairs where
both male and female have

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.950
small lips.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.520
When we do that, we find
statistically very strong

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.150
indication that they mate
based on the size of the lips.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.280
So big lipped fish
like big lipped fish.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.020
Small lipped fish like
small lipped fish.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.090
And we can redo this in
the lab by mate choice

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.950
trials in the laboratory.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.990
One interesting
thing is also, we

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:27.960
can inject Botox in
the lips of these fish

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.620
and sort of disassociate the
genotype from the phenotype.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.240
Because presumably
the genotype also

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.710
implies some chemical
communication and so on,

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.180
so we want to sort
of tease apart

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.770
what is the
contribution of seeing

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.990
the big lips versus
maybe other chemical

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.340
communication or
audible communication

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.780
that these fish might be doing.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.910
So we can actually
manipulate this phenotype.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.090
Now let me come to the last
part of the talk, which

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:56.270
is to ask, well how do we
actually make new species?

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.390
What is the mechanism of
speciation generally speaking,

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.110
or why are cichlid fishes
such a great model to us

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.770
I ask this question.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.040
Now you might
think, or you might

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.100
associate Charles Darwin and
his origin of the species,

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:10.730
with this idea.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.610
But it turns out Darwin
actually did not necessarily

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.820
care about what species are.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.250
He was very sloppy in his
definition of species,

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:21.440
and he sort of viewed them as
sort of sports or varieties

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.490
writ large.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:26.150
His thinking about
species largely

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:33.710
came from visiting land shows
of breeds of cattle or sheep

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.810
or pigeons.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.000
So he didn't really
think about species

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.995
as being something
special in evolution.

00:46:39.995 --> 00:46:43.250
He didn't think that they
are the units of evolution.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.250
And also, his book does
not offer us any mechanism

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.292
by which new species can arise.

00:46:49.292 --> 00:46:51.250
His book is very useful
in many other respects,

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.500
obviously, in terms of natural
selection and this and then.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.360
The person who really
affected the thinking

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.670
of several generations
of evolutionary biology

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:06.034
in terms of how you bring about
new species is Ernst Mayr.

00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:08.450
He's of German descent, but
he was a professor at Harvard.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:09.870
He lived to be 100 years old.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.070
When I was a student here, he
sort of took me under his wing

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.770
and had a large influence on me.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.390
His dogma was that you have
the best geographic conditions

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:25.280
to bring about new species if
they are separated by a barrier

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.650
to gene flow, a river or
a mountain or something

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:30.380
prevents individuals
from one population

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.450
to mate with individuals
from another population.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.580
So there would be
no exchange of genes

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.320
that would homogenize
differences

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.430
that might be arising.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.040
He viewed speciation
as something

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.290
that's very important
in a geographic setting,

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.240
and viewed it sort of
as a passive outcome

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.870
of geographic separation
where over many generations

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:50.940
you would have the
accumulations of mutations

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.450
and genetic
differences and maybe

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.860
mate preference differences
on one population and another.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.232
Let's say once the mountain
or the river gets eroded,

00:48:01.232 --> 00:48:03.690
they come together, they don't
recognize each other anymore

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:04.830
as a species.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.870
So his biological
species concept,

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:11.490
the decision of who mates with
who, if you mate with females

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:14.160
that you think belong
to your species,

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.860
then this would
be the definition

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.750
of a biological species concept.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.630
And he argued that his concept
of allopatric speciation,

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:28.710
so two different geographic
areas, plays a large role.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.490
And natural selection played
really a minor or no role

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.380
in the origin of species.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.170
Now, cichlid fishes
also inform on this.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:41.080
And this is where we
moved to Nicaragua.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.950
This is a lineage of cichlids
that lives in Nicaragua.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:48.640
They live in a particular
chain of crater lakes.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.640
Nicaragua's part of the
Pacific ring of fire,

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.700
and you have crater lakes
in Nicaragua, some of which

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.280
are 20,000 years
old and some of them

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.590
are 1,000 or 2,000 years old.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.810
So this is summarized here.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:02.700
All of these fish,
all of these cichlids

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.700
that live in this
chain of crater lakes,

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.820
came originally from the two
large lakes in Nicaragua--

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.040
Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.400
So you have sort of a
generalist ancestral species

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.210
that somehow--

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.550
if you want to ask me later
on how that might happen--

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.830
that somehow colonized
these crater lakes.

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.480
And then you have the origin
of new species in these crater

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.520
lakes.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.320
And each of these crater
lakes in Nicaragua

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.810
has private endemic
species that only

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.719
live in this one crater lake.

00:49:29.719 --> 00:49:31.260
And again, some of
these crater lakes

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.350
are only 2,000 years old,
maybe 1,000 generations

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.400
since the colonization.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.820
We actually have
modeled this, and we

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:41.610
think there actually may be
only a few hundred generations

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:43.080
in these lakes.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.060
Now in these crater
lakes-- and this

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.700
is sort of showing some of the
variation-- there are currently

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.540
13 species described in these
particular crater lakes.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.790
In these crater lakes, you
have no barriers to gene flow.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.540
These crater lakes could be
only a kilometer in diameter.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.210
There's nothing that would
prevent a fish from swimming

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.635
from one shore to the next
shore in a day or two,

00:50:03.635 --> 00:50:05.010
and so there would
be no barriers

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.680
to gene flow in the
[INAUDIBLE] sense.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.599
And so the fact that we find
new species that are private

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:13.890
to particular crater lakes--
and we can show this based

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:17.100
on genetics, and we can
show this based on ecology--

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.520
we know through a whole
bunch of measurements

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.370
that these fish lived at
different places of the lakes,

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.680
but they could swim
anywhere they want.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.440
They feed on different diets.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.100
They have different
pharyngeal jaws

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.500
that resolves in different
composition of their stomach

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.760
contents.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.960
And we know again
that, genetically, they

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.480
are each separate entities.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.910
So in a scenario
like this, where

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:45.240
you have no reason to think that
there's a barrier to gene flow,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.780
these fish have become one
of the few accepted examples

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.210
for so-called
sympatric speciation--

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.420
the origin of new
species due to adaptation

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.330
and natural selection to
particular ecological niches

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.990
where presumably the fish will
be looking for their mates

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.870
in different areas or in
different times of the year

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.090
and so on where they feed.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:09.150
But there's nothing that
would geographically

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:12.900
separate them from each
other as Ernst Mayr would

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.170
have predicted.

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.440
So this is one
example where we think

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.570
that sympatric
speciation is maybe

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.990
the mechanism by which
new species arise.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:25.230
So let me summarize, I think
cichlids are a great model

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:28.560
system to address many
fundamental questions

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.820
in evolutionary biology.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.580
They really are
spectacularly complex

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.990
in their social behavior, in the
ecology, and their morphology.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.880
Now before I want to close--

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.230
- Cichlid babies
are in mom's mouth.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.750
That's why the cichlid are
called mouth brooding fish.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.854
Mom's mouth is both
nest and nursery.

00:51:48.854 --> 00:51:50.520
- So this is the mouth
brooding cichlid.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.580
- This one lets your
babies know to play,

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:58.420
and then provides protection
when it's time to come home.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.420
It seems like a foolproof system
for keeping the young ones

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.380
safe, but it's not.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.362
Let's introduce a predator.

00:52:07.362 --> 00:52:08.945
- I hate to say, but
there's a catfish

00:52:08.945 --> 00:52:10.340
that's smarter than a cichlid.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.269
- --evolutionary process itself.

00:52:12.269 --> 00:52:13.810
- You will see what
these catfish do.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:17.240
- These catfish are
notorious parasites.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.577
- So they are spawning,
and then they come in there

00:52:19.577 --> 00:52:20.910
and eat the eggs of the cichlid.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.950
- --fiercely defend their young.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.820
The catfish you're able
to pick off a few eggs,

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.940
and they also drop a
few of their own eggs

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.760
knowing that the cichlid
mothers will pick them up,

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.350
thinking they're her own.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:36.100
- They're cuckoos.

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.350
- And so the cichlid becomes--

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.400
- They put eggs in the mouth
of the female of the cichlid.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.660
- The catfish take
off, never knowing what

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.121
becomes of their young ones.

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:53.590
Mother does her job, letting
the brood grow in her mouth.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:57.820
Now, as in a bad horror
movie, like catfish eggs

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:03.880
hatch first and a baby catfish
feast on the cichlid babies,

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.390
gobbling down every single one.

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:08.830
- Inside the mother's mouth.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:13.090
- Finally, the cichlid mother
releases not her own children,

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:16.420
but the catfish
cannibal kiddies.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.170
Ironically, the cichlid
brood they destroyed

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:24.190
is the only mother
they'll ever know.

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:28.960
More irony, the cichlid mom
fails to sense the switch.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.790
She treats the catfish
as if they were her own,

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:37.280
scooping them up to protect them
at the first hint of danger.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.680
The catfish have
clearly won this round

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:44.240
in the eternal fight for
evolutionary dominance.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.730
- So we actually
have looked at this,

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:48.410
and it turns out that
the cichlids that

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:52.759
coevolved in the same lakes
with these horrible catfish

00:53:52.759 --> 00:53:55.050
are better in detecting when
they're being parasitized,

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.710
when they're being
manipulated by these catfish,

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.380
and they will reject these
foreign eggs much more

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.110
than a cichlid that
is evolutionarily not

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.890
used to being parasitized
by these catfish.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.000
So there is, if you will,
evolutionary learning.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.540
And the other thing we did
in collaboration with friends

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.110
in the Czech Republic,
we gave cichlids

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.660
experience in the aquarium
with being parasitized,

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.436
and they also learn
during their lifetime.

00:54:19.436 --> 00:54:20.810
So there's
evolutionary learning,

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.840
if you will, and also experience
where they become more

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.910
apt at detecting that
they're being manipulated

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:27.890
by those horrible
catfish, and sort

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.240
of being brood parasitized.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.370
So thank you very much
for your attention,

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.260
and I'll be glad
to take questions.
