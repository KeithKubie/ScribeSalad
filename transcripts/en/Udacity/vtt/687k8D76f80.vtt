00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.493
So, here we have another case of
substitution. We know that money from

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:09.533
funders is equal to $3 million. So
wherever we see money from funders in the

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:14.693
top equation, we can replace that with
$3,000,000. So down here, we can write, 3

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:19.450
million in the first box, and we can do
the same thing with money spent each

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:24.317
month. We see that right here, in the
first equation, and we know that this is

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.280
equal to $100,000, so, we write $100,000
right there. So to summarize this, we can

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:33.913
see that the money that Grant has left
over at any given time is equal to the

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:38.710
initial $3 millions that he got from
venture capitalists minus the $100,000 he

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:42.731
spends each month, times the number of
months he's been in business.
