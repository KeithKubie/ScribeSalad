00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.420
Now that you have a better Idea of what data

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.100
science is, and what data scientist do, let's talk about

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.940
how data science can be applied across a wide spectrum

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
of industries. You might have signed up for this class under

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.740
the notion that if you become a data scientist, you'll

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.460
end up working for a Silicon Valley startup. Well it's true

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.970
that most tech companies do employ data scientists. Data science

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.340
can also be used to solve problems in many different fields.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.170
What are some examples of the types of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
problems being solved using data science? Well for one,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.390
Netflix uses collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend movies

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
to users based on things they've previously watched. Also,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.510
elements of many popular social media websites are

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.200
powered by data science. Things like recommending new connections

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.540
on Linkedin, constructing your Facebook news feed or

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.650
suggesting new people to follow on Twitter. Many other

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.580
online services or apps such as dating websites like

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.910
OKCupid or right sharing services like Uber using the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.190
vast amount of user data available to them, not

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.700
only need to customize and improve the user experience but

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.490
also to publish interesting anthropological findings regarding people's behavior

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.990
in the offline world on their blogs. Okay, so

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.170
I know what you're thinking. So far, all of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.800
these seem like problems data scientists are expected to solve,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.890
but data scientists work in many domains. Data

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030
science concepts are integral in processing and modeling data

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.960
in the field bioinformatics where scientists are working on

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.240
projects like annotating genomes and analyzing data sequences. This

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.680
past summer, data science for social good fellows

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.810
in Chicago worked on a project attempting to solve

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.120
Chicago's bus crowding issues using data. In addition, physicists

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.940
use data science concepts when building a 100 terabyte

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.550
database of astronomical data collected by the Sloan

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.790
digital sky server. This one's cool. Analyzing electronic

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.790
medical records allowed the city of Camden, New

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.130
Jersey to save enormous amounts of money by targeting

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.750
their efforts towards specific buildings accounting for a

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.290
majority of emergency admission. Finally, NBA teams like the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.610
Toronto Raptors are installing a new technology, sports

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.250
view cameras, on the basketball courts. They collect huge

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.600
amounts of data on players movement and playing styles.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.430
This helps teams to better analyze game trends and improve

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.180
coaching decisions. You've probably noticed by now that data science

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.430
is making an impact in areas far and wide. Data

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.780
science isn't simply a trendy new way to think about

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.400
tech problems. It's a tool that can be used to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.950
solve problems in a variety of fields. Data scientists are

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.570
working at Silicon Valley start-ups to enrich our online experiences,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.430
but they're also doing important work in our

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.760
cities, in our laboratories and in our sports stadiums.
