Hi, my name's Maciek Szymanski. I represent
African Alliance Investment Bank. Africa and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:17.110
2010. I think it's definitely going to be
a big challenge to change perceptions about

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.820
Africa as the continent as a whole. What we
see is that Africa is often seen as a place

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.840
where things do not work. There are problems
with communications, technology, and also

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.350
offenders lack of man power. Btu in 2010 this
is great opportunity to South Africa and the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.030
rest of the continent to show that such a
big event can be done on such a big scale.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.280
What we have seen a number of countries actually
working together to making the 2010 world

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.380
cup and economic success. For example, in
Marshes, you have special packages available

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.280
when the fans can stay in the country if you
fly in for the games. We have also seen Botswana,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.590
Zambia, and others hosting teams which will
be participating in the contest. I think that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.420
over all this will be great benefits to the
region and to the continent as a whole. This

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.310
kind of show piece will hopefully change the
perceptions that many people in the world

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.040
have about the continent. Thank you.
