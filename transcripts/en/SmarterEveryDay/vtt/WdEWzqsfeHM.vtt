Hey it's me Destin.
Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.610
So today we're gonna learn about how helicopters work. In fact, we're gonna

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.810
put on our thinking hats, today mine looks like this,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.990
and we're gonna do a whole video series.
There's a lot going on there. We're gonna teach you what it is.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.180
Let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.600
The reason I am in Tennessee to film this, is because Carl,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.790
I'm pretty sure, is a wizard. I'm not even joking.
Is it OK if I wear this helmet the entire video?

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.970
(Carl) Yeah it's awesome.
(Destin) Alright. Carl is gonna operate this helicopter

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.160
in ways that I did not know were possible.
The next several videos are all gonna be

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.210
about how helicopters work. They're way more complicated than you think, but for the time being

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.400
I just want you to see this.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.580
[rotor noise]

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:22.130
  

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.370
(Destin) What kind of sorcery is this?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:35.980
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.720
Can you fly it upside down?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.060
So that's why we're working with Carl today.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.230
Because of that. That's how you mow the yard

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.420
in Tennessee huh?
(Carl) Oh yeah.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:08.480
  

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.070
What you're not feeling is there's like a 10 mile an hour wind and he's.. [laugh]

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.250
he's doing this in all the wind. It's pretty crazy.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:44.590
     

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.290
(Destin) So you realise that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.480
that's some kind of black magic or something right?
(Carl) Oh it defies all physics doesn't it. [laugh]

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.180
So you do the numbers on that one.
(Destin) That was messed up dude.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.860
OK so, if you want to know more about how these helicopters work, stay tuned. The next few videos

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.050
I'm gonna use high speed video, night time flights, open shutter

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.230
photography. Basically a bunch of tricks to show all his tricks.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.420
So, go ahead and subscribe and you'll see these videos

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.510
And, will you fly it some more?
(Carl) Absolutely, yeah.
(Destin) Let's just fly it more. Just because it's awesome.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:27.910
  

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.100
