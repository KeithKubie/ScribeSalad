Speaker 1:          00:00          And I'm I, I believe that to be the case. So your platform restricts speech. Our platform promotes speech unless people violate our rules and in a specific direction, in any direction. But uncle, oh, I don't want to say his name. The guy who calls for death gets a suspension. The guy who insinuates that gets a permanent ban. You're misinterpreting what I'm saying and I feel like you're doing it deliberately. It's not about one particular thing. It's about a pattern in practice of violating our pattern and practice of banding. Only one faction of [inaudible] recently published an article where they looked at 22 high profile bandings from 2015 and found 21 of them were only on one side of the cultural debate, but I don't look at the political spectrum of people when I'm looking at their tweets. You have a volume, you're biased and you are, you're targeting specific individuals because your rules support this perspective.

Speaker 1:          00:47          No, I don't agree with that. Can you be clear though in like what rules support that for specifically? The easiest one is mis-gendering, right, because that's so clearly ideological. If you ask a conservative what is mis-gendering, they'll say if someone is biologically male and you call them, you know, she a biological man and you call them mushy. That's mis-gender. And as a conservative view, the, the, the progressive view is inverted. So now you actually have in your policies a rule against the conservative perspective. I have a rule against the abuse and harassment of trans people on our platform. That's what my role is. We just give context in the background as to why the why that is. And I brought some, some research. So we obviously received a lot of feedback. So we don't make these roles in a vacuum. And just to be clear, we have a bunch of people all around the world to give us contacts and the types of behavior they're seeing, how that translates into real world harm.

Speaker 1:          01:40          And uh, they give us feedback and they tell us like you should consider different types of rules, different types of perspectives, different. Like, for example, when we try to enforce hateful conduct in a are hateful conduct policy and your particular country, we are not going to know all the slur words that are used to target people of a particular race or a particular religion. So we're going to rely on building out a team of experts all around the world who are going to help us enforce our rules. So in the particular case of, um, mis-gendering, I'm just trying to pull up some of the studies that we looked at, but we looked at, um, the American Association of Pediatrics and looked at the number of transgender youths that were committing suicide. It's an astronomical, and I'm sorry I can't find it right now in front of me. It's a really, really high statistic.

Speaker 1:          02:24          That's like 10 times with the normal suicide rate is of normal teenagers. And we looked at the causes of what that was happening and a lot of it was not just violence towards those individuals, but it was bullying behavior and what was, what, why are those bullying behaviors that were contributing to that? And that's why we made this rule because we thought and we believe that those types of behaviors were happening on our platform and we wanted to stop it. Now there are exceptions to this rule. We don't, and this is all, this isn't about like public figures and there's always going to be public figures that you're going to want to talk about and that's, that's fine. But this is about are you doing something with

Speaker 2:          03:00          the intention of abusing and harassing a trans person on the platform and are they viewing it that way and reporting it to us so that we take action. So, so I will just state, I actually agree with the rule on from my point of view, I agree that bullying and harassing Trans People's in higher, entirely wrong. I disagree with it, but I just want to make sure it's clear to everybody who's listening. My point is simply that, you know, Ben Shapiro went on a talk show and absolutely refused and that's his shtick. You know, and he's one of the biggest podcasts in the world. So if you have all of his millions upon millions of followers who are looking at this rule saying, this goes against my view of the world and it's literally 60 plus million in this country, you do have a rule that's ideologically bent and, and it's, it's true.

Speaker 2:          03:41          You, you did the research, you believe this. Well then you have Ben Shapiro who did his recent research and doesn't believe it. Yeah. And I relied on the American Association of Pediatrics and uh, you know, human rights council and other, and I'm sure he has his sources too, for when he gives his statements. The point is a bundle of iots wonder if they have that context. I mean, and that's, and that's where we have also, it's just explaining the why behind a lot of eyeballs. Soon reasons I would agree. And I think it's fine. You did research and you found this to be true, but we can't simply say maybe Ben Shapiro and the other conservatives who feel this way, don't know. We have two W W we can't, you know, the point I'm trying to make is simply whether you believe it, whether you justified or not is not the point. The point is you do, you do have this rule. That rule is at odds with conservative superior. Well, I think, I think that you're, you're generalizing, but I think it is really important. As Jack said to the why behind these things, the why is to protect people from abuse and harassment.

Speaker 3:          04:36          I understand what you essentially created a protected class. If this is the case, because despite these studies and what you know, the studies are showing there's a gigantic suicide rate amongst trans people, period. It's a 40% it's, it's outrageously large. Now, whether that is because of gender dysphoria with us because of the complications from sexual surgery, sexual transition surgery, whether it's because of bullying, whether it's because of this awful feeling of being born in the wrong gender, whether that all that is yet to be determined. The fact that they've shown that there's a large amount of trans people that are committing suicide. I don't necessarily think that that makes, that makes sense in terms of people from someone's perspective, like a Ben Shapiro saying that if you are biologically female, if you are born with a double x chromosome, you will never be x, y if he says that that's, that's a violation of your policy and this is you're creating a protected class,

Speaker 2:          05:43          it'd be to be fair, targeted or, or targeting. So conduct that opinion. So what if he said [inaudible] entitled to express that opinion. If he's doing in a manner that's targeted at an individual repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, and saying, okay, but what

Speaker 3:          05:58          about the intent? What's going on with Martina Navratilova right now? Martina Navratilova Rollover. Why? Why can I say her last name now? But yeah, I don't even have a truck. I don't think I've ever said it. Martina Novotal to lovo is it tall over Trello? Trello's anyway, epic World Class Legend Tennis Player, right? Who happens to be a lesbian is, um, being harassed because she says that she doesn't believe that trans women, meaning someone who was biologically male, who transitions to a female should be able to compete in sports against biological females. This is something that I agree with. This is something I have personally experienced a tremendous amount of harassment because I stood up when there was a woman who was a trans woman who was fighting biological females in mixed martial arts fights and destroying these women. And I was saying, what did you just watch this and tell me this doesn't look crazy to you?

Speaker 3:          06:50          Um, well, I go, go, go ahead. Well, my point is you should be able to express yourself in if you say that you believe someone is biologically male, even though they identify as a female, that's a perspective that should be valid. I mean that this is someone's, someone's, this is, first of all, it's biologically correct. So we have a problem in that. If your standards and your policies are not biologically accurate, then you're dealing with an ideological, I'd, you know, an ideological policy. And just because, I mean, I don't, I don't want to target trans people. I don't want to harass him. I certainly, I'll call anybody whatever they want. I mean, if you want to change your name to a woman's name and identify as a woman, I'm 100% cool with that. But by saying, I don't think that you should be able to compete as a woman, this opens me up for harassment and I never recorded any of it. I just don't pay attention to it. But yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:51          in going into like Megan Murphy for instance, right? You can call that target harassment if Megan Murphy who is a, for those that are, don't, don't know, she's a radical feminist who refuses to use the transgender pronouns. If she's in an argument with a trans person over whether or not they should be allowed in sports or in biologically female spaces and she refuses to use their pronoun because of her ideology, you'll bend them. Again, it depends on the context on the platform. And it's also, I want not banned permanently like you get. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          08:21          well she was banned permanently. But listen, she was warned you about what happened because he explained it to me. What did she actually do?

Speaker 1:          08:30          My understanding, and I don't have the tweet by tweet the way that I did for the others, but my understanding is that she was warned multiple times for um, mis-gendering an individual that she was in an argument with. And this individual is actually bringing a lawsuit against her in Canada as well. So you have an argument between two people. Again, I have a rule that enforces only one side of the ideology and you've banned only one of those people. We have a rule that attempts to address what we

Speaker 3:          08:56          have perceived to be instances of abuse and harassment ideology, right? If she's saying a man is never a woman, if that's what she's saying. And then biologically she's correct. We obviously have a debate here. This is not a clear cut. This is not something like you could say water is wet, you know, this is dry. It's, and this is not like something you can prove. This is something where you have to acknowledge that there's an understanding that if someone has a trans person, we all agree to consider them a woman and to think of them as a woman to talk to them and address them with their preferred name and their preferred pronouns. But biologically this is not accurate. So we have, we have a divide here. We have a divide between the conservative estimation of what's happening and then the definition. That's the liberal definition of it.

Speaker 3:          09:45          I think that's right Joe. And I think what I'm trying to say is that it's not that you can't have those viewpoints, it's that if you're taking those viewpoints and you're targeting at them at a specific person in a way that reflects your intent to abuse and harass them, what if it's in the context of the conversation? What if she's saying that I don't think that trans women should be allowed in these female spaces to make decisions for women. And then this person's arguing and she says, a woman is biologically female. You are never going to be a woman. She responded with men aren't women though. And that was her first in the series of events. That's what got her the suspension and the warning. Um, that was one of many tweets that part of providing context and that was actually the second, second actually strike is my understanding.

Speaker 3:          10:26          But why is that a strike? Yeah, why is that a, strike that. But again, like it's the context of I don't, I don't have all the trees in front of me. They were like 10 or 12 tweets going back and forth and my understanding is that in that context of all of those, she was mis-gendering a particular person. Not that she was holding a was above her statement, wasn't it? I don't know. It was. So you don't, you're having, you're having an individual who was debating a high profile individual in her community and she's expressing her, her ideology of versus hers and you have opted to ban one of those ideologies. It's within the context of this conversation. This is, this is what is being debated. Whether or not someone is in fact a woman when they were born a male. I understand that this is controversial.

Speaker 3:          11:05          I do. I especially to a radical feminists, someone who I understand why, why people would not agree with the rule, but that being said, it is a rule on our platform and once you're warned about the rule to repeatedly post the same content is also going to be a violation of our rules. Right? But the rule, it's, this seems like a good example of an ideologically based rule. If, if you're, if she's saying that a man is never a woman though, that is not in that context harassment. That is a very specific opinion that she has that happens to be biologically accurate. Now, I don't, you know, I don't agree with targeting harassment on anybody and I targeted harassment on trans people or, or straight people or whatever. I don't, I don't agree with it. I don't think you should do it. It's, it's not something I want to do. But in this context, what she saying is not just

Speaker 2:          11:59          her, her expression, but it's accurate. I think an important point is if I tweet it to you, Joe, Joe, you are not a hamster. That's clearly not a violation of the rules. However, there are identify as a hamster. Well, no, it wouldn't be clear cause I know a, I know people who have specifically begun using insults of animals to avoid getting kicked off the platform for breaking the rules. Certain individuals who have been suspended now use certain small woodland creatures in place of slurs, so they're not really insulting you and it's fine, but there are people who considers himself trans species. Now I'm not trying to belittle the trans community by no means. I'm just trying to point out that you have a specific rule for one set of people and they're there. They're so, there are people who have general body dysphoria. You don't have rules on that. There are people who have actually amputated their own arms. You don't have rules on that. You have a very specific rule set. And in more importantly, in the context of a targeted conversation, I can say a whole bunch of things that would never be considered a rural break. But that one is, which is ideologically driven.

Speaker 1:          12:58          Yeah. Thank you for that feedback. I mean we're, we're again always learning and I'm trying to understand different people's perspectives and I'll, all I'll say is that our intent is not to police ideology or intent as to police behaviors that we view as abuse, movement, harassment. And I hear your point of view and it's something that I'll definitely discuss with my team.

Speaker 2:          13:18          And, and even in this case it was, it wasn't just um, a going against this particular rule, but also things that were more ban evasive as well, including taking a screenshot of the original tweet, reposting it, which is against our terms. It sounds like it's more of the accident. It sounded like a protest against your role. I understand you to band them for it,

Speaker 1:          13:39          but people can protest any one of our rules. We can't, we can't like let them do that.

Speaker 2:          13:43          No, no, no. I haven't purchased any of that. Data is great. I understand what you're saying, but I just want to make sure I point out she was clearly doing it as an effort to push back on what she viewed as an ideologically driven role. Well, this is

Speaker 3:          13:52          problem is, this is a real debate in the LGBT community. This is a debate where there is a division and there's a division between people that think that Trans Women are invading biological female spaces and making decisions that don't benefit these biological females, cisgender, whatever you want to call them. This is an actual debate and it's a debate, a debate amongst progressive people amongst left wing people. I mean, it's a debate amongst liberals. This is, I mean, I would imagine the vast majority of people in the LBGT community are in fact on the left. And this is one example of that. So you have a protected class that's having an argument with a woman who feels like there's an ideological bent to this conversation that is not, not only not accurate, but not fair. And she feels like it's not fair for biological women. The same as Martina.

Speaker 2:          14:46          Well, I'll, I'll, uh, take this to its logical conclusion. I got sent a screenshot from somebody and maybe it's faked. I think it was real. They were having an argument with someone on Twitter and responded with, Dude, comma, you don't know, blah, blah blah, and they got a suspension and a lockout have delete the tweet because the individual using a cartoon Avatar with the eight with with the name apparently with Sam reported it and said that I'm transgender and he's calling me dude and the dude and the Twitter user actually got a suspension for it. So I can understand mistakes happen. But when you have a rule that's like that, there's colloquial terms that are like, man, come on. Don't say that

Speaker 3:          15:19          dude is like, we say like, oh, like I asked you guys when you were going to take a photo in front of this thing. I said, guys, but I included, you know, thank you for not being offended. You for it. Thank you. Yeah, it's, it's tricky. But in this case of Megan Murphy, that's her name, right? Yeah. Yeah, I did. That doesn't make any sense to me. That seems like she should be allowed to express herself in this is this is not being, she's not being mean, but I saying a man is never a woman. This is a perspective that that is scientifically accurate and that's, that's part of the problem.

Speaker 2:          15:53          I th I, I, I just don't want it to run into a beating a dead horse. So I think I want to,

Speaker 3:          15:57          let's say it's a really important thing to go over all the nuances of this particular subject because I think that one in particular highlights this idea of where the problems lie and having a protected class. And I think that we should be compassionate. We have a lot of protected classes, gender, race, nationality, like these are the protected class, not for white people. When you say gender or race, it's not all protected categories. So you can't attack someone for their belonging to a particular race or a particular religion. But you can mock white people ad nauseum. It's not a problem. It doesn't get, it doesn't get removed. I'm not talking about mocking, I'm talking about abusing and harassing some, but I mean if you mock a black person in the same way it would be considered targeted racism. Um, again, it's about targeted harassment on the platform, but well, I mean can do what is targeted harassment.

Speaker 3:          16:51          I mean, but when you're okay, look, if you have, what is racism is racism own image. There's this progressive perspective of racism that it's only possible if you're from a more powerful class only punching down. That's the only racism. I don't think that makes any sense. I think racism is looking at someone that is from whatever, whatever race and deciding that they are in fact less or less worthy or less valuable, whatever it is that that takes place across the platform against white people. Now I'm not saying white people need to be protected. I know it's easier being a white person in America. It's a fact, but it's hypocritical to have a policy that only distinguishes, you can make fun of white people all day long. But if you decide to make fun of Asian folks or you know, fill in the blank that is racist, but making fun of white people isn't and it doesn't get removed. There are tons of people like about Sarah John from the New York Times. That's a of, well I can explain that one. Please

Speaker 2:          17:50          do. There's that was uh, my understanding is that you guys started banning people officially under these policies around 2015 and those, all the tweets you made was prior to that. And so you didn't enforce the old

Speaker 1:          17:59          sorry, hateful conduct policy. Joe, just to be clear is, is across the board, meaning like it doesn't just protect women and protects men and women and protects all races. It doesn't matter. And this is how the law is set up in the United States, right? You can't discriminate against white men. You can't discriminate against black men. Like those are the laws, right? Like that's the structure. It is. That doesn't, it doesn't take into consideration. Power one says something about white people in mocks, white people on Twitter. What do you do about that? If it's targeted harassment targeted at a person. So just white people in general. If you say something about why people in general that's on an issue that, well, I mean we focus on targeted harassment, which is behavior that is targeted against an individual who belongs to that class. Okay. Because if you try to police every opinion that people have about different races or religions, like obviously that's a very different story. So this is about if you target that to somebody who belongs to that class and that's reported to us, that is a violation of our rules. And so in this era, Jiang case, a lot, we did see many tweets, uh, of that nature that we're focused on. Uh, people who are white or men and our rules are in this area came into effect in 2015 which was our hateful conduct policy. And a lot of those tweets were from a time period where those rules weren't an, in her defense.

Speaker 2:          19:15          She was actually supposedly responding to people that have, you don't believe that I'll come on over three years and she's tweeting blanket statements about white. Yeah, sure, sure. But so, so I will say too, obviously I've done it. I at one point,

Speaker 1:          19:29          so in that case, there were tweets from before the rules went into effect in tweets from after the rules went into effect. And we did take action on the tweets from after the rules went into.

Speaker 2:          19:37          She's also pretty young, so I want to point, uh, yeah, she's in her 20s. Yeah. So we're talking about something that might've happened eight years ago, right? Right. It's a 20. It was like 2011 to 13. But I do want to point this out. Um, before coming on, I've obviously did at time, I did a decent amount of research. I searched for slurs against white people, black people, Latinos, and I found copious, just, just tons and tons of them. Now they don't go back. Most of what I found in go back too far, because it does seem like you guys are doing your best, but there is a lot and it targets white people, black people, Jewish people. It's everybody, right.
