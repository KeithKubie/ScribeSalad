00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:19.580
This DNews episode is brought to you by Casper.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.300
When you sleep are you on your stomach?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300
Your LEFT side?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.939
Do you wake up on the "wrong" side of the
bed?

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.920
All of these things have been looked at by
science!

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.381
If you sleep on your LEFT SIDE you're probably
more creative, if[a] you sleep on the RIGHT

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:36.790
side of the bed, that's the bad side, and
sleeping on your stomach makes your dreams

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.650
more… sexyyy.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.570
Science says, our sleeping positions matter.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.440
In fact, according to a study conducted back
in April, the distance you sleep from your

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.930
partner while in bed, indicates how happy
you are!

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.620
According to a survey of 1,000 people in Edinburgh,
Scotland, most people, 42-percent, sleep back

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.830
to back, and 31-percent facing the same direction,
only 4 percent sleep face to face.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.340
Extroverts tend to sleep closer, in general,
but 86 percent of those who slept less than

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.840
an inch apart were happy in their relationship;
while people who slept 30 inches apart were

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.729
far less likely to be happy.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.640
Remembering that this is survey data, so prone
to bias, it would seem when humans sleep further

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.310
apart we're less happy.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.380
Which I can tell you I've definitely experienced.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.370
But this ain't the first sleep position study:
back in 2003, Sleep Assessment and Advisory

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.149
Service in the UK broke down the six basic
sleep positions -- and compared to their personality

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.149
types.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.490
The study included 1,000 people from Australia,
Japan, Hong Kong, China, and Singapore, and,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.490
obviously, the UK.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.539
People who sleep in the fetal position, according
to science, are quote "tough on the outside,

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.439
but sensitive at heart," which amounts to
41-percent of the respondents, and twice as

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.780
many women.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.370
But fetal is one of six possible sleeping
positions: fetal, freefall, starfish, soldier,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.389
log, and yearner.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.409
Starfish is the rarest, and after fetus, the
log is the most common.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.249
Sleeping in these positions can indicate a
tendency toward [b]acceptance, or cynicism;

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.909
whether you're suspicious or friendly, or
even whether you're brash or good at taking

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.909
criticism!

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.910
It's pretty cool, though it feels a little
like astrology to me.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.860
Medically speaking, the freefall is good for
digestion, while the starfish and soldier

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.640
often lead to breathing issues, including
snoring.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.330
Yet ANOTHER study of 3,000 adults found there
really is a wrong side of the bed.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.080
It's the right side…

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.270
25 percent of people who tend toward the left,
see a positive outlook on life; while only

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.110
18 percent of right-siders see that.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.990
66 percent of the leftie-sleepers believe
they're calmer in crises, have more confidence

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.500
and are more likely to be in permanent employment
-- on top of all that, 31 percent of them

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.100
love their job; while only 18 percent of rightie-sleepers
do.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.700
In the end, how you sleep affects way more
than just… well, your night's sleep.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.700
Sleeping on your stomach, for instance.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.530
A study in the journal Dreaming found that
people who sleep on their stomachs, report

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.200
dreams about "sex" and "persecution" and "erotomania"
-- or the delusion that a celebrity is in

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
love with them.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.590
It's weird, and science isn't sure why, but
there you have it.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.980
More research is definitely needed.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.520
I'm a freefall sleeper for sure… though
I don't agree with the personality assessment...

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520
What about you?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
How do you sleep?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520
Side?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520
Stomach?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Back?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.910
