00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi folks, thanks
so much for being here today.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.820
Talks at Google is excited
to welcome Hillary, Deuki,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.769
and Matt here today.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.810
I'm just going to do a
quick little intro of them

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.830
and let them do their thing.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.190
Hillary right over here is
Eater.com's Senior Reports

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.670
Editor, where she
writes and edits

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.890
stories that track where the
restaurant industry intersects

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.650
with national trends,
public policy, science

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.370
technology, and pop culture.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.880
She joined Eater in 2013
after working her way up

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.290
through the New York
City restaurant scene.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.190
A New Jersey
native, she recently

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790
relocated to San
Francisco from Brooklyn.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.552
And she's enjoying
the better weather.

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:41.510
Shh, don't ever say
anything about the weather,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.390
you'll spook it.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.990
This is Deuki Hong.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.750
At 15, Hong worked
as a line cook

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.910
under Aaron Sanchez of
Centrico, New York City.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.950
Is that legal, Deuki?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.550
Is that legal?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.966
DEUKI HONG: I don't think so,
we should edit that one out.

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: 15 and
a half, New York City,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.449
before heading to the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.240
After graduating near
the top of his class,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.850
he cooked under David Chang
at Momofuku Noodle Bar

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.720
before two years
in line at Michelin

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.400
three-starred Jean-Georges.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.630
A young-- I'm probably
mispronouncing it--

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.240
rising star chef, Hong is
currently Executive Chef

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.962
of the smash hit, Kang Ho Dong--

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:19.080
DEUKI HONG: Baekjong.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.163
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.570
In Manhattan's Koreatown.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
He's recently been recognized
as an Eater young gun

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.301
and named to the "Zagat"
30 under 30 list.

00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:28.467
MATT RODBARD: That's Google!

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:29.844
DEUKI HONG: Shout out!

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:31.221
MATT RODBARD: Yes it is.

00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:31.680
DEUKI HONG: Thank you Google.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.513
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:01:32.513 --> 00:01:34.360
And this is Matt Rodbard.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.330
For over a decade-- uh
oh, your [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.160
is showing if you do that.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
Rodbard has written
magazine and online features

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.530
about restaurants, shops,
drinks, music, cooking,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.064
and travel.

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:46.730
His writing has appeared in "Bon
Appetit," "Travel and Leisure,"

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.920
"Saveur," "Men's Journal,"

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
And he currently serves
as a Contributing Editor

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.117
at "Food Republic."

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:54.700
MATT RODBARD: Thank
you for having us.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.706
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks
so much for being here.

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:57.380
MATT RODBARD: Well
I appreciate it.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.340
And I want to just tap the
audience right here before we

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.254
get into the conversation.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.920
So how many of you
have that have cooked

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.620
Korean food in the last week.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.990
Anybody?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.239
Anybody?

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.780
Oh and this session
is streaming too,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.755
so raise your hand at your desk.

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:13.796
DEUKI HONG: Is this live?

00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:14.462
This is so cool.

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:16.860
MATT RODBARD: And so
many of you have actually

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.860
have just gone to a
restaurant Korean restaurant

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.215
in the last week?

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:21.840
That's awesome.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.559
So there's definitely
a lot of people

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.600
who have had Korean food.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.496
And I just wanted to see what
kind of crowd we have here.

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:28.490
There you go.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.990
Yeah.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.300
DEUKI HONG: Past stragglers.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.340
HILLARY: So we'll
have time for Q &amp; A,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.060
but if you have any
pressing questions

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.480
as we're having
our conversation,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.010
please feel free to shoot
a hand up and just ask us.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.680
But I just want to dive right
in and ask what is Koreatown.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.450
MATT RODBARD: It's
a good question.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.290
Well first off thank you
for having us Google.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.250
It's a huge honor to be talking
about Korean food to this room

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.540
and to the masses.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240
So really appreciate that.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.019
And thank you Hillary
for moderating.

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.310
DEUKI HONG: Thanks [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.090
MATT RODBARD: I've been a fan
of your writing for a long time.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.160
So thank you for
taking the time.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.860
HILLARY: Vice versa.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.901
MATT RODBARD: Absolutely.

00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.990
But Koreatown is really--
it's a place of course.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.446
There's Koreatowns
in most cities.

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:11.320
But the way you really
think about Koreatown,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.090
it's a mentality.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.640
You put two Korean markets
next to a Korean dry cleaner

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.010
next to a Korean restaurant
and you've got a Koreatown.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.000
That is everywhere.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
DEUKI HONG: At least
that's how we defined it.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.875
It's just very like--

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.310
MATT RODBARD: It's
not like-- you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.810
don't need 50,000 Koreans in
an area for it to be Koreatown.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.100
We found Koreatowns
through our travels

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.660
over the course of the research
of this book, which was

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330
about three and a half years.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.860
We found Koreatowns
in the expected

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.760
places like New
York, where we live,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.850
and Los Angeles, which is the
biggest Koreatown in America.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.270
But we also found in places
like north Philadelphia

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.970
and outside Chicago,
Minneapolis, Houston.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.850
Places that may be
aren't considered

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.950
the Koreatown
epicenter of America.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.300
But really Koreatown
is more of a spirit.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.940
Right?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.350
We talk about that a
lot when we're out.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.227
We talk Korean food.

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:06.060
DEUKI HONG: I mean we
had to define it first

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.851
before we found it.

00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.660
I mean to his credit, it was
Matty that wrote the book--I

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.810
mean not wrote the book, that
came up with the whole concept

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.490
of Koreatown.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.541
I remember asking him,
so what are we doing.

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.540
And we had to define it.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.081
And I think that's
how we defined it.

00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:23.300
Was really the mentality.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.290
You know, like you said, if
you saw two Korean restaurants

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.190
next to each other or we were
just in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.820
an adopted Korean chef has
just a Korean restaurant

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.019
in the middle of
Madison, Wisconsin.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:38.310
That embodies really Koreatown.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.390
MATT RODBARD: That's
Koreatown right there.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.380
And we'll get into
other parts of Koreatown

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.820
through the conversation which
may be a little unexpected too.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.530
HILLARY: Yeah, for sure.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.870
So for people who haven't got it
chance to open their books yet,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.396
one of the really unusual
things about the presentation

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:56.770
and the structure
of this book is

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.820
that there's a pretty typical
cookbook structure, especially

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.390
cookbooks that are tied to
restaurant chefs like Deuki.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.360
Where it's got an intro, and
you have a recipe header where

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.680
it's usually a story about
why this dish is meaningful,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.430
the story of the dish
ended up on the menu.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.480
You have the recipe
and then either

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.770
on the left side
or the right side

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.130
will be a picture of the dish.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.470
And that is not what your
guys' book looks like.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.670
And how does the structure
of the book to you

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.300
reflect that Koreatown spirit.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.980
MATT RODBARD: It's
a really good point.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.980
When we signed our
contract, we really

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.950
didn't know what we were doing.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.330
We aren't cookbook authors.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.390
Are you not a cookbook
chef or a recipe developer.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.177
I knew magazine.

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:40.110
I knew web journalism.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.290
I knew packaging.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.940
And I really wanted
us to do a book that

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.380
brought the energy and
spirit of Koreatown to life.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.880
So to do that we
needed to look outward.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.620
It wasn't just repeating
recipes from your family

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.990
and from our friends.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.825
We had to go out and
actually find them.

00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.700
And you see that in the
structure of the book

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.580
as we were reporting.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.950
We like to think that we
went and talked to people

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.010
and ran the recorder
and ran our iPhones

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.900
and talked for several
hours and went back

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.780
to those conversations and
figured out a story from then.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.330
That's kind of the way we look
at the Koreatown as a book.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.690
As more of cultural
anthropology of sorts.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.710
You know, it's not just
the recipe, head note,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.950
circle plate, circle
plate, circle plate, photo

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.040
that you see in a
lot of cookbooks.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.680
Nothing against circle plates.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.370
DEUKI HONG: We
have circle plates.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.203
MATT RODBARD: We do
have some circle plates.

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:29.980
But if you look
visually at the book,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.120
it has all these
elements of travel.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.070
And we committed the
time and resources

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.180
to travel to answer
the question, what

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.290
is Koreatown both visually
and through the recipes.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.430
It's not the easiest
way to do a cookbook.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.471
DEUKI HONG: I mean we just
don't know what to do.

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.275
We really didn't know
what we were doing.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:52.130
I think it's great that it's
not like Deuki's 101 Recipes

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.440
or Korean Cooking
Like Made Simple.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.219
Like we didn't know
what we were doing.

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:58.010
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.392
DEUKI HONG: And I think
out of that naivete--

00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:02.225
which is a big word.

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:03.433
MATT RODBARD: Good job, Chef.

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:05.110
DEUKI HONG: Thank you.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.260
We just did it like for us.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.290
Our approach was-- he has
a magazine background.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.400
So if you see the layout,
there's like stories in it,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.610
there's a Q&amp;A in there.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.980
So I personally love the layout.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.970
I just think, I
think I love my book.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.062
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.020
DEUKI HONG: But you know
it's just fun to read.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.250
And I like that it's not
like stews, and then barbecue

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.940
and you know.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.060
For me, that's kind
of the biggest draw.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.010
We have a respect section
at the end of the book which

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:41.070
is a lot of really awesome chefs
that just love Korean food,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.100
support Korean food.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.200
That's like my favorite
section of the book.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.640
And like how you guys
would cook food--

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.860
we made the book like that.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.376
We went to H-mart.

00:07:54.376 --> 00:07:56.000
MATT RODBARD: H-Mart,
which is like one

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.470
of the main Korean
markets in the east coast.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.260
DEUKI HONG: H-Mart, went to my
apartment and started cooking.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.940
That's literally how those
recipes have been developed.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.320
MATT RODBARD: It's true.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.403
DEUKI HONG: It's very raw.

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:07.390
HILLARY: So speaking more to
the recipe development process,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.590
I'd love to get into the
nuts and bolts of how

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.861
this book came together.

00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:12.610
You guys have spoken
a lot about this sort

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.580
of like going in blind.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.350
How did the book
deal come about?

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.640
And how did you
start dividing up

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.850
the labor between yourselves?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.430
MATT RODBARD: Good question.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.830
Well we met actually
working on a separate book.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.610
A smaller guidebook to Korean
restaurants in New York.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.289
We went to 75
Korean restaurants.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.809
Yeah you were like, whoa.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.544
And you know, what most
of them are not very good.

00:08:37.544 --> 00:08:38.710
DEUKI HONG: That's not nice.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.054
MATT RODBARD: I
know it's not nice.

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.179
All right, some of them
were not very good.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.695
We were tasked with going
to a lot of different styles

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:46.320
of restaurants.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.840
And it wasn't just
the greatest hits.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.840
There was definitely some
out-of-the-way places.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.600
And we met through
that project where

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.010
we had to really define
these restaurants.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.810
We rated them, as if we
were in the Michelin Guide.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.460
We had to go in like
check off a bunch of boxes

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.600
and rate these restaurants.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.920
And really we met
through that process.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.410
And we came to the
conclusion that there is not

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.850
a book written from the
point of view of Koreatown.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.810
I bought every book I
could when I was writing

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.268
that small guidebook
and I saw they

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:18.450
were written from the point of
a food professor from Korea.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.800
Or from a YouTube star.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.300
Maangchi.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.800
She's great.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.670
And we love Maangchi.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.860
I've watched hundreds
hours of Maangchi

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.930
while researching Korean food.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.210
But we aren't Maangchi.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.900
We are more, as we said
before, journalists and chef.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.420
So we realized there
wasn't this book written.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.870
So what do you do.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.870
Well, you kind of have
to write a book proposal.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.670
And that's really what we did.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.270
And we found, through our
great agent Angela Miller,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.830
a home at Clarkson Potter.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.620
Clarkson Potter is
a place that has

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.330
done a lot of big name celebrity
chefs and some smaller titles

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.210
as well.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.270
But it was fortunate
that our book proposal

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.782
landed on the desk of Francis
Lam, who Is out editor.

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:02.240
And it was the
first book he signed

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.830
when he joined Clarkson Potter.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.130
And he really he shepherded
it through from the proposal

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.610
phase all the way to the end.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.610
And you know I think
Francis was a big part of--

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.818
DEUKI HONG: Yeah, FL's great.

00:10:12.818 --> 00:10:15.900
I mean he's great just
because he's Francis.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:22.225
And the fact that we
were his first-- we're

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:23.760
like the proverbial nobodies.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.710
And for him, he could
have gotten a deal

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.920
from-- he can choose whatever
chef he wants to work with.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.600
Whatever writer or
whatever personality

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.270
he wants to work with.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.000
And he really believed
in the project.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.252
And I think because he
believed in it-- like we always

00:10:35.252 --> 00:10:37.460
believed in it because we
can just toot our own horns

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.990
because we're so awesome.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.304
And when you get somebody like
Francis, like this is awesome.

00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:43.720
Then you start
really believing it

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.040
and then I think
that becomes passion.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.910
That becomes, OK, we
can go to that city.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.160
And that kind of gets me going.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.290
Like, FL is kind of like
my like spirit animal.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.980
It's like, hey,
he believes in us.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.094
HILLARY: And that's what
an editor does, right?

00:10:59.094 --> 00:11:00.010
MATT RODBARD: He does.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.801
He sees it through.

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:03.790
And he shows that he's
committed to our idea.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.090
And I'll say, we didn't
have a million offers.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.141
We had multiple offers.

00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:09.640
But we didn't have
a million offers.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.740
DEUKI HONG: And
we had two offers.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.930
MATT RODBARD: Yeah
we had a few offers.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:12.596
DEUKI HONG: Two.

00:11:12.596 --> 00:11:15.770
MATT RODBARD: And you know
it was honestly something

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:21.290
that we give credit to Francis
for seeing Korean food's

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.240
rise maybe two or
three years ago,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.370
when he signed the contracts.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.512
HILLARY: So I want to go back
to some cookbook contacts.

00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:33.220
When you look at the
cover of a cookbook,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.845
including the Koreatown cookbook
that you have in front of you,

00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:38.420
the way that the
authorship is built

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.310
is very coded with meaning.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.870
So this book could
have been Deuki Hong

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.890
with Matt Rodbard-- could
have been the way it ended up.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.740
It could have just
said Deuki Hong

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.340
and then maybe somewhere
inside the book

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.910
it would have explained
that Matt existed.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.020
Sometimes chef-driven
cookbooks don't

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.520
have a writer listed anywhere.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.230
And it's an industry secret,
you know who worked on it.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.246
And your guys'
cookbook-- flat out you

00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:06.370
guys are on the same level.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.066
It says Deuki Hong
and Matt Rodbard.

00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:09.690
Can you explain a
little bit about what

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.420
that means, both symbolically
and like practically speaking?

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.980
MATT RODBARD: We are a team.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.440
It really means that.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.890
We could not write this
book without each other.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.800
It's truly the best
kind of partnership.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.900
I'm not a hired gun
to write cookbooks.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.610
And as you said, Deuki is
not like a celebrity TV chef.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.410
So we both needed each other.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.064
I need you.

00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:33.730
I needed to ask you
a million questions.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.710
DEUKI HONG: I wasn't
your first choice.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.484
I'm just saying.

00:12:36.484 --> 00:12:37.900
Just wanted to
throw it out there.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.246
MATT RODBARD: Any ways.

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:41.700
Whatever.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.390
DEUKI HONG: And
just to go on that.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.890
I think a lot of
people get confused

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.640
because it is a Korean book.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.120
Or Koreatown book.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.180
They think the Korean guy on the
project kind of spearheaded it.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.737
This is all his brainchild.

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:54.570
And I just kind of
hopped on and I was like,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.360
oh yeah dude, that's awesome.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.340
What do you need from me.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.890
You know, he's not Korean
if you didn't realize.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.200
He is pretty much Korean.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.840
But for us-- and we said in
the earlier conversation--

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.960
we're friends also.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.780
MATT RODBARD: Yeah it's true.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.196
DEUKI HONG: We're not like,
we don't clock in and be like,

00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.800
all right, let's do this event.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.670
We talk.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.630
We talk outside stuff.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.990
And we've developed
a friendship.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.230
We traveled for
two years together.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.180
Even if you hate
each other, it's just

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.810
out of like that relationship.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.495
And I think that genuine
friendship kind of gives it

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:33.660
a better product.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.521
I didn't want to disappoint him.

00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:37.270
Hopefully he didn't
want to disappoint me.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:37.480
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.680
DEUKI HONG: There was
that mutual respect.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.290
MATT RODBARD: We didn't want
to disappoint our publisher.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.850
And we didn't want
to disappoint--

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.450
DEUKI HONG: It was
just a lot of that.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.741
MATT RODBARD: Korean-Americans.

00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:46.140
Koreans who-- and we'll
talk about the food.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.280
The food is so important
and we didn't really--

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.710
we needed to make sure we got
the right recipes in there.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.210
We wanted to make sure we got
the right head notes in there.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.520
And that each of these recipes
had the story it really exists.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.790
DEUKI HONG: This book
wasn't about Deuki or Matt.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.780
So it didn't matter what name.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.940
Obviously nobody in this
room knows-- except my friend

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.260
over there-- which is great.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:06.860
Which is fine.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.390
Which is awesome because
it's really about the story.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.820
It's really about
what we want to tell

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.110
or the story we want to tell.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.270
And we always kind
of went back to that.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.320
You won't see our faces
except in our intro.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.892
You won't see our faces
like plastered on this book.

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:23.600
Nor should it be.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.391
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.970
DEUKI HONG: So it's our baby.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.965
You can approach it.

00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:31.090
MATT RODBARD: Any questions
at all in the audience?

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:31.789
There you go.

00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:33.580
DEUKI HONG: It's like
a little study group.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.832
Don't even-- get
a little intimate.

00:14:35.832 --> 00:14:38.102
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
hear a little more about--

00:14:38.102 --> 00:14:39.560
MATT RODBARD: So
the first question

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.980
was, how did we come
together for that 75 project.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.090
And I'm reflecting on my answer
and I was a little harsh.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.996
I did not go to mostly
bad restaurants,

00:14:47.996 --> 00:14:49.620
I think that came
out very incorrectly.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.450
We went to a lot of
very good restaurants.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.520
We've been in
California for so long

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.350
that the food in
California is so good.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.990
The Korean food here is amazing.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.690
So that's why I've got
a little hate towards.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.800
But I do love New York.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.029
So anyone in New York,
there are restaurants there

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:03.820
that are very good.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.820
So we met on the project.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.660
It was funded by the
Korean government

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.130
by the Korean Food Foundation.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.040
And they had that kind of vision
to create this guidebook, which

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.470
was naming 35, 40 of the
best Korean restaurants.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.610
We met each other
through just dialog.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.280
Through talking
about our results.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.530
We had this big meeting where
we went over the results

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.500
and picked our top
30 restaurants.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.506
So that's how we met.

00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:25.880
And then we
discontinued talking.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.370
And I think we want to go
out and eat Korean food.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.578
Pretty much I was, hey, you
wanna grab some galbijjim

00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:30.270
and we went.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.380
And the other
question was about--

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.130
HILLARY: It was
about your influences

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.150
and your personal story and
the influences that really

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.390
comes through in your cooking.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.850
DEUKI HONG: I started
cooking pretty young.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.200
Overall, my whole life,
I'm really blessed

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.920
with a lot of-- I have a lot of
really cool people in my life.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.750
A lot of good people.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.502
That turned into really
cool opportunities.

00:15:52.502 --> 00:15:53.710
I played baseball growing up.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.480
My baseball coach was
partners with Drew Nieporent,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.820
who is the guy who is head
of Myriad Restaurant Group.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.956
Who'd started Nobu and that
whole-- they're like icons.

00:16:06.956 --> 00:16:08.330
And obviously, I
don't know that.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.280
He was like, if you like
restaurants, come on in.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.780
So I did.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.130
I literally just, every day,
starting from that point,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.410
I worked for Chef Aaron
Sanchez, he's on TV now

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.150
and does his thing.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.620
But yeah, after that, every
day after high school,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.810
class would end, bus,
subway, into the restaurant.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.570
So it was great.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.170
And there was just more like,
I just love the restaurant.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.830
Like I'm not one of those
guys that's like, oh

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.490
my gosh, like cucumbers.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.680
Hey Chef.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.096
MATT RODBARD: Chef
just walked in.

00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:41.120
DEUKI HONG: Japchae
was on tonight.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.980
MATT RODBARD: Yeah, the japchae
in the cafeteria was so good.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.929
The chef just walked
in from Google.

00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:46.970
DEUKI HONG: He's awesome.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.790
Thank you so much.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.930
Yeah That was kind of it.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.262
Chef was like, you
need formal training.

00:16:54.262 --> 00:16:55.780
I was like, I disagree.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.610
I'll just stick with
you for my life.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.150
And I went to culinary school.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.090
I met Chef David Chang.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.463
We both worked for DC.

00:17:03.463 --> 00:17:08.894
Hopefully he never sees
this because I fear him.

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.310
I love him at the
same exact time.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.268
MATT RODBARD: Love and
fear your older brother.

00:17:12.268 --> 00:17:15.130
DEUKI HONG: But yeah, that
was my Momofuku experience.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.790
And then I did the whole fine
dining route with Jean-Georges.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.490
I just have so many like-- if
I had control of where I was

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.770
or what people to
meet, I don't think I

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.680
would have planned it that way.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.840
But yeah, all my experiences
were really unique.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.006
I'm influenced by all the
people that I worked with.

00:17:32.006 --> 00:17:34.690
Forget if you're David
Chang's or the Jean-Georges

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.690
of the world.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.070
Or if you're-- you know I
have 21 guys underneath me

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.650
in my kitchen and they
inspire me just as much.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.140
It's all about people for me.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.291
I don't go crazy over a cucumber
or like heirloom tomatoes.

00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:47.790
They're great and
they're delicious,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:53.760
but it's got to bigger
than that, I feel like.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.300
HILLARY: So one of the things
you talk about in the book,

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.630
in the intro, is about this
idea that a lot of Korean food

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.270
happens in the home.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.020
That it's very much a
home-oriented cuisine.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.107
And I remember like
Matt, in your intro,

00:18:09.107 --> 00:18:11.190
you'd go to restaurants
and you'd be like texting,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.410
not how [KOREAN] made it.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.024
You know, which is
Korean for grandma.

00:18:14.024 --> 00:18:15.440
MATT RODBARD: That
was the kicker.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.130
HILLARY: Yeah.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.240
And seems like
attention to me, to make

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.080
a cookbook about
Korean food based

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.277
in the restaurant world, when
maybe it's more home-oriented.

00:18:25.277 --> 00:18:26.860
And I'd love to hear
a little bit more

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.230
about how you navigated
that question in terms

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.990
of what recipes to include,
how to create them.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.256
MATT RODBARD: I'll
take the first part,

00:18:35.256 --> 00:18:37.880
which is the difference in home
cooking and restaurant cooking.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.630
And a lot of times-- I
mean I think home cooking

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.480
is the best when it
comes to anything.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.960
Like if you're making
at home, it's fantastic.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.170
You're actually putting
it together yourself.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.350
You're going through
that process,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.802
be it painful or wonderful
or somewhere in between.

00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:55.010
And you're serving your
family and your friends food.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.159
That's a magical thing.

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:58.200
So I think home cooking
is the best to be honest.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.408
Can we get there every night.

00:18:59.408 --> 00:19:00.069
Of course not.

00:19:00.069 --> 00:19:02.110
But for Korean food in
particular, a lot of times

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.600
the restaurants-- you
know they're not doing it

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.160
for the food and only the food.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.960
They're doing it for
a variety of things.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.490
Mostly it's to make money.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.180
You know, Korean
Americans immigrated here

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.580
starting in the '50s and '60s
and a big chunk in the '70s.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.530
And oftentimes
Koreans landed here

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.170
and there wasn't a lot
of job opportunities.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.550
And one of the main jobs was
restaurants that they could do.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.520
And oftentimes they
had to make money

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.870
and it was how they survived.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.590
So are corners cut
in those situations.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.560
In some cases, yes.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.590
Is the food delicious,
yes. sometimes it's

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:43.600
not as good as it would be if
you're buying every component.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.370
Or buying the best
gochujang you could.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.130
Or buying the freshest produce.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.770
So that's the one big
difference between the two.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.680
I think folks need to
understand Korean food has

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.180
many different iterations
in the restaurant scene.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.290
And you cover restaurants
a lot, so we can maybe

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.340
talk about that later.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.420
HILLARY: Yeah, for sure.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.380
MATT RODBARD: But the
other question for you

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.255
is for the actual
development of the recipes.

00:20:02.255 --> 00:20:04.338
HILLARY: Yeah, for the
development of the recipes.

00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:07.080
Whether you thought of it more
in terms of the way things come

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.704
together in a restaurant
versus the way

00:20:08.704 --> 00:20:09.850
they come together at home.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.183
DEUKI HONG:All right, so two
totally different mindsets.

00:20:12.183 --> 00:20:16.846
I think a lot of the recipes
developed in the book-- half

00:20:16.846 --> 00:20:18.220
are like from my
mom and half are

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.615
like-- there's no
standardization

00:20:19.615 --> 00:20:21.060
in Korean cooking.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.750
You ask like a Korean
old guy or like a mom,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.230
they're like a little bit of
that, a little bit of this.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.730
MATT RODBARD: There's
a word for it.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.659
Son-mat, right?

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:30.200
Hand cooking.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.630
DEUKI HONG: Son-mat.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.840
MATT RODBARD: Son-mat.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.670
Yeah, and It's like
hand cooking, right?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.378
DEUKI HONG: Yeah.

00:20:33.378 --> 00:20:36.022
Which is just a lazy way of,
I'm not going to measure it.

00:20:36.022 --> 00:20:37.809
Like, truth.

00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:38.350
I don't know.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.160
And that was hard.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.250
Because even when
we were cooking,

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.690
I would just adopt that.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.222
So literally how we made
this book was, I cooked.

00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:46.930
Matty was right next
to me with a laptop.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.300
Hey, what did you put in there.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.000
How much did you put in?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.470
MATT RODBARD: Yeah

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.090
DEUKI HONG: Did you put that in?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.320
Do I have to put that in?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.770
MATT RODBARD: Yeah, or tell me.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.740
Tell me now.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.320
Like you're just like--

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.280
DEUKI HONG: Like a
recipe that takes me

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.950
fifteen minutes would take
like, literally two hours.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.330
MATT RODBARD: We need numbers.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.080
We're writing a cookbook,
we need numbers.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.746
DEUKI HONG: Yeah,
that's like his thing.

00:21:02.746 --> 00:21:03.690
Like people need this.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.240
I was like, no, just
a little bit of that.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.650
Because for me, you can't
measure salt. Or I don't know.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.746
Like it's just, you
just do it to taste.

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:16.120
MATT RODBARD: Or
gochujang, even.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.957
A major component.

00:21:16.957 --> 00:21:18.540
HILLARY: Can you
explain what that is?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.710
In case anybody--

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.290
MATT RODBARD:
Fermented pepper paste.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.373
DEUKI HONG: Oh yeah, Korean
fermented chili paste.

00:21:23.373 --> 00:21:25.540
So like, Korean
food is pretty much

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.776
based on the fermented
flavors, like jangs, right.

00:21:28.776 --> 00:21:31.810
So doenjang, soybean paste.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.800
Gochujang, which is
Korean chili paste.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.925
It's kind of redundant
to say Korean.

00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:38.020
And then soy sauce,
ganjang, right.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.470
So those are kind of the three.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.880
And then everything else
kind of stems off of that.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.254
MATT RODBARD:
Branches off, yeah.

00:21:42.254 --> 00:21:44.810
HILLARY: So another topic
that you guys bring up pretty

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.893
quickly in the intro to
the book is the importance

00:21:46.893 --> 00:21:48.610
of tradition in Korean cooking.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.910
And I was thinking about like
approaching this conversation

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.690
being at Google where
creativity is paramount.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.280
Innovation is paramount.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.780
And where, when you're working
with these traditional recipes,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.420
was the room to bring
creativity and innovation,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.720
both to the book or to your
work in the restaurant?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.670
MATT RODBARD: Well when we were
working on the actual recipes,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.040
to Deuki's credit,
he was able to cut

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.180
through a lot of the extra
steps needed for some

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.240
of these complicated recipes.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.316
And you learn efficiency
in culinary school

00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:20.440
and in running restaurants.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.079
And we went through the
most efficient route.

00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:24.495
And so that's a
creative approach.

00:22:24.495 --> 00:22:27.650
Not every recipe is a
slow way of doing it.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.220
That's one.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.460
But I think secondly,
we have this section

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.310
in the book called Respect,
which shows how Korean food has

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.830
expanded beyond Koreatown, or
the physical Koreatown that we

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.330
know.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.980
So the last chapter
is called Respect

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.990
and it has all these
guest recipes from chefs

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.310
throughout the country.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.974
And when we went out and
talked to our friends

00:22:46.974 --> 00:22:48.390
about the book
project, we weren't

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.140
looking for 20 versions
of the kimchi taco.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.010
Or kimchi lasagna.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.030
We wanted like real
Korean food done

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.470
in kind of an interesting
way, but from chefs

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.630
who knew Korean food.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.270
So with that we've got like
Danny Bowen is doing this

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.260
really cool, in our
book, has a recipe

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.610
for a traditional Korean bone
broth called seolleongtang.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.950
But what he does is he
gussies it up with some uni,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.230
and he smokes brisket
and he puts it in there.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.750
And smoked pastrami.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.020
That's one example.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.245
Sean Brock for example--

00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:21.010
DEUKI HONG: It's a good recipe.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.676
MATT RODBARD: It's a
really good recipe.

00:23:22.676 --> 00:23:25.000
Sean Brock, who's a great
chef based in Nashville

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.740
and Charleston did a traditional
Korean pancake called pajeon,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:36.140
but he did it with corn meal
and with lowcountry shrimp.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.790
So I thought that was a really
cool way of understanding

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.630
Korean food but then being
creative with the recipe.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.760
There's maybe 15 of those
recipes in the book.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.580
And it just shows
time and again how

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.500
we chefs are thinking
about creating

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.720
flavors but articulating
it in their own way.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.470
HILLARY: I think talking
about the respect

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.380
section of the book, which
again is the recipes contributed

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.560
by chefs who are not
necessarily known for cooking

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.190
Korean food-- with a
capital K and a capital

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.870
C-- I think there's
definitely room to grow,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.470
but it's very fair to
say that there has never

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.450
been more interest in
America in Korean cuisine

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.410
than there is right now.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.290
And I'm wondering why.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.270
Like why Korean cuisine now?

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.429
MATT RODBARD: Oh.

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:20.470
DEUKI HONG: I don't know.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.350
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.712
DEUKI HONG: This is just--
we talked to a lot of chefs.

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:24.420
And we travelled.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.880
The element of this
book-- it kind of

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.160
lends itself well to travel.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.064
And I've been
blessed enough to be

00:24:30.064 --> 00:24:31.480
in some of these
like top kitchens

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.940
and I'd like stay
there for a day

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.500
and like pick the chefs brain.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.840
And we're talking about
like when we're in DC

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.230
and I'm with Eric-Bruner Yang.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.160
These guys are like
the city icons.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.620
Or like in charge of the food
movement in their cities.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.509
And I asked them.

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:49.300
But you realize like
this is what they eat.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.677
Like they're not eating like--

00:24:50.677 --> 00:24:51.760
MATT RODBARD: French food.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.218
DEUKI HONG: Sean
Brock isn't eating

00:24:53.218 --> 00:24:54.380
like chicken and waffles.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.160
Like country whatever.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.950
He's eating Korean food and
he's like fermenting kimchi.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.090
And you just appreciate
like this is going on.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.744
Just nobody-- I don't
want to say nobody

00:25:06.744 --> 00:25:08.910
cared, but like nobody
thought to ask that question.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.160
Like what do you eat outside
of-- you just think like,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.340
oh Eric Ripert, he probably eats
like very fancy French seafood

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.300
of some sort.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.270
Probably cooks himself
the most perfect fish--

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.103
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:18.103 --> 00:25:20.109
DEUKI HONG: But he's
eating Korean food.

00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:22.150
He's eating Korean like,
Buddhist temple cuisine.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.001
And you know you're
just like, oh, this

00:25:24.001 --> 00:25:25.000
is like kind of awesome.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.386
And for me, the respect
chapter, as a kid in the game,

00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:32.652
it's freaking awesome.

00:25:32.652 --> 00:25:34.110
It's like being a
basketball player

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.890
and then having
LeBron and Curry,

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:42.140
because we're in Curryland,
signing your yearbook, right?

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.106
Congrats on y'all, by the way.

00:25:45.106 --> 00:25:45.840
Kobe by the way.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.510
So it's like for me,
I'm just like, what, why

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.290
is he in the book?

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.160
Like not in a bad way.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.360
Like Eric Ripert, Danny
Bowien, all these people

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.500
like we get to call now
because we're like, chef,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.640
can I talk to you
about Korean food?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.285
MATT RODBARD: Stu
Brioza, he's in the book

00:26:00.285 --> 00:26:02.920
and he has a really cool
dish with yuba and house-made

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.763
kimchi.

00:26:03.763 --> 00:26:05.320
DEUKI HONG: Such an incredible
meal yesterday at Statebird's.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.528
MATT RODBARD: Yeah and he's
cooking with kimchi there

00:26:07.528 --> 00:26:11.480
and cooking with
inspiration and adventure.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.780
But I will add too, that
where Korean food is

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.480
right now in the restaurant
world nationally,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.030
there's a lot of
Korean-American chefs like Deuki

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.930
who are cooking the foods
that they grew up on.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.030
Folks like Beverly
Kim in Chicago.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.280
Edward Lee in
Louisville, Kentucky.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.810
And Edward Kim in Mott
Street in Chicago.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.880
These are great examples.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.765
There's many of
them who are cooking

00:26:33.765 --> 00:26:35.060
these traditional flavors.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.900
Chefs who maybe came from more
of a traditional background,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.930
like a French background or
a fancy Italian background,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.310
and they're actually
rediscovering

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:48.270
their own internal
recipe book but then

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:53.420
presenting them to the public
in kind of an uncompromised way.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.730
And that's super exciting to be
seeing these traditional dishes

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.860
come to life.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.530
HILLARY: I want to talk a little
bit about flavor with that too.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.030
Because one of the
things that I've

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.779
been wondering about
as I've been thinking

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:07.004
more about Korean food and
why there's this uptick is

00:27:07.004 --> 00:27:09.170
I definitely think there's
a little bit of a chicken

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.830
and egg.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.470
Where it's like
well, chefs love it.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.011
And they're telling
people, you know.

00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:14.650
And that's why
customers love it.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.439
But I also think that
one of the-- and you

00:27:17.439 --> 00:27:18.980
talk about this so
much in the book--

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.270
a real pillar of
Korean cooking is

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.690
fermentation and the
process of fermentation

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:30.440
and then the flavors that
arise from fermentation

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.870
really carries the food.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.940
And sort of America's
interest in fermented foods

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.720
is really on the rise right.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.959
So for me, that was
sort of a through line

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.750
that I've been seeing
and thinking about it

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.541
as I read the book.

00:27:43.541 --> 00:27:47.880
And as I'm thinking about why
chefs who don't necessarily

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.290
have a Korean background
or even a background

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.173
cooking that kind of
food or maybe dabbling.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.230
Is America's palate expanding?

00:27:59.772 --> 00:28:02.230
MATT RODBARD: I'll say that
just that Asian food in general

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.060
is expanding.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:09.180
And Americans love these Eastern
Asian flavors, soy sauce,

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.000
fermented jangs,
be it Korean jangs

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.830
or Chinese fermented pastes.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:21.050
You know, noodles from
Asia, ramen's kicked it off,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.800
but now lots of pho--
you're seeing these flavors.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.810
These sours, these very
like Asian flavors.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.890
Fish sauce for example.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:30.790
You're seeing fish
sauce everywhere.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.665
You're seeing fish sauce
on brussels sprouts.

00:28:32.665 --> 00:28:34.530
I mean brussels
sprouts aren't part

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.570
of the Asian like
vegetable category.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.690
So I think you're just
seeing the American palate

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.549
is changing.

00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:45.590
I mean, you see it in your
restaurant too, right?

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.970
DEUKI HONG: Yeah, I mean it
started for me in '09 when I

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.335
was working at JG and--

00:28:52.335 --> 00:28:53.460
MATT RODBARD: Jean-Georges.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.700
DEUKI HONG: Jean-Georges, sorry.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.540
And the chef, their corporate
chef there, Chef Greg Brannon--

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.300
his palate is like, it's-- it's
just I've met so many people

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.050
that are like the
masters of like--

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.307
Serpico is like the guy--

00:29:06.307 --> 00:29:08.640
HILLARY: Who's also going to
open a Korean Small Plates.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.160
DEUKI HONG: He is.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:09.885
MATT RODBARD: Oh yeah.

00:29:09.885 --> 00:29:11.070
HILLARY: In Philadelphia,
for his second Philadelphia

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.140
restaurant.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.030
MATT RODBARD: That's
another good one, yeah.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.310
Sorry,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.390
HILLARY: We're talking
about Peter Serpico, who

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.690
is a long-time Lieutenant in
David Chang's Momofuku empire

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.770
and is now a restaurant owner
and operator in Philadelphia.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.090
DEUKI HONG: He's like a fish.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.631
Like, you watch the guy break
down fish and you're just like,

00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:25.970
I could watch this all day.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.934
And I'm working right
next to these guys.

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:30.100
I was with Chef Greg and I
made him some Korean dish

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.207
for family meal.

00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:32.540
And then he said the same thing.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.998
He's like, I don't
understand why--

00:29:33.998 --> 00:29:37.450
and this is seven
years ago-- isn't

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.514
Korean food-- like every
flavor profile of Korean food--

00:29:40.514 --> 00:29:41.680
it hits what Americans like.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.065
Sweet, savory, spicy.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.240
And I said, I was like, chef,
I don't know, I'm just a kid.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.450
I don't know.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.170
But I understand it more
and more now because there's

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.960
nothing crazy about it.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.530
We're not doing anything crazy.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.600
The food existed for a while.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.210
I just go back to that
kind of fermentation flavor

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.480
and I just think it's
that extra layer of umami

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.280
where you can't fabricate it.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.670
You can, I mean in MSG.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.390
But you can't.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.450
It's different.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.470
When you taste a really good
doenjang, and you taste soup

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.129
that comes out of
that doenjang--

00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:16.170
that took months to make.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:16.860
That took time.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.707
It's different than miso, which
is no knock on miso, just--

00:30:24.707 --> 00:30:26.040
MATT RODBARD: They're different.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.440
DEUKI HONG: They're
very different.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.773
MATT RODBARD: Doenjang and miso.

00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:30.720
DEUKI HONG: So don't say
doenjang is Korean miso.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.740
MATT RODBARD: Please
don't say that.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.940
They're very different.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.772
DEUKI HONG: It's very different.

00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:37.480
MATT RODBARD: Maybe
Google can erase that

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.148
from the Google search terms.

00:30:40.148 --> 00:30:41.606
DEUKI HONG: It's
probably possible.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.022
MATT RODBARD: Probably in this
room, somebody can do that.

00:30:44.022 --> 00:30:47.090
But really they're
just not the same.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.137
They're both great
but in their own ways.

00:30:49.137 --> 00:30:50.720
DEUKI HONG: I just
like this actually.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720
I don't know what it is.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.984
It's the food that I eat.

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:54.400
The only reason I
cook Korean food

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.507
is not because I'm like
an ambassador for Korean.

00:30:57.507 --> 00:30:59.590
Sadly, to say it-- I
probably shouldn't say this--

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.230
I don't care about that stuff.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.440
I love eating Korean food.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.380
Like I stopped cooking food
that I don't like eating

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.760
I think after JG.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.195
After Jean-Georges, sorry.

00:31:12.195 --> 00:31:13.570
Just because I
was all right, I'm

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.940
going to cook food that I like.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.070
I generally like
eating Korean food.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.113
MATT RODBARD: Question
in the audience.

00:31:17.113 --> 00:31:18.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.830
DEUKI HONG: Go for it mama.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:19.220
HILLARY: Do it.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:19.500
DEUKI HONG: We're good.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.250
It's like Friends.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.558
DEUKI HONG: Absolutely.

00:31:24.558 --> 00:31:26.751
AUDIENCE: So, it also,
it crossed my mind,

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.272
because Korean food--

00:31:28.272 --> 00:31:29.730
HILLARY: She's
bringing up the idea

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.100
that part of this
why Korean food now

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.320
is that the generation of chefs
coming up, people like Deuki,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.790
have the language skills,
need the cultural savvy

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.660
to navigate things like
marketing, like press, like how

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.040
to word a menu to get
people in the door.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.900
With your restaurant
Deuki, who comes to eat?

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.189
Who's coming to eat your food.

00:31:53.189 --> 00:31:54.230
DEUKI HONG: White people.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.790
Naw, I'm just joking.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.190
No, I mean even going
back onto that, its right.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.510
Our parents' generation
wasn't-- like they don't care

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.750
if a Michelin guy comes in
or you coming in or an editor

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.796
coming in.

00:32:09.796 --> 00:32:11.795
It was really a for us,
by us kind of mentality.

00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:14.550
We made Korean food and we
built Korean restaurants

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.590
because we missed
what he ate at home.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.570
Or my parents missed at home.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.744
They don't care about stars or
they don't care about whatnot.

00:32:21.744 --> 00:32:23.410
For us, I think you're
completely right.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.000
I completely agree.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.160
Like for us now, our
mentality is like, oh dude,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.576
this is really good, let's
tell our white friend about it.

00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:33.780
Let's tell my Hispanic
friend about it.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.210
Because we're able to.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:39.660
MATT RODBARD: We write about
the KBF, the Korean best friend

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.390
that a lot of people have.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.690
They have that one Korean
individual in their life

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.310
who tells them where to go.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.399
And it's wonderful.

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:48.940
DEUKI HONG: You have
one, that Matty.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.660
MATT RODBARD: I have one
here and another one--

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.802
DEUKI HONG: It's not me.

00:32:52.802 --> 00:32:54.280
I didn't see my
name in your intro.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:54.700
I'm just saying.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.658
MATT RODBARD: Yeah, I've
got a very good friend

00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:59.320
who lives in Oakland, who was
my gateway to Korean food.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.720
But I think everyone has
that and it's so beautiful

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.810
to go to a restaurant to have
your Korean best friend show

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.570
you all the dishes.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.720
Not just the barbecue but order
of like kalbijjim or something

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.444
cool like that.

00:33:11.444 --> 00:33:13.360
DEUKI HONG: Sorry, who
comes to my restaurant.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.580
A lot of people come
to the restaurant.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.360
And that's crazy because we
serve a lot of people a day.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.060
And y'all know in the back how
much because they serve Google.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.920
But we do those kind of numbers.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.807
Like I'm not used to it.

00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:30.640
The biggest restaurant
I've worked for was I

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.185
think, it was Momofuku,
it was the noodle bar.

00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:34.560
HILLARY: You mean
by just volume?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.530
DEUKI HONG: Yeah,
it was just lines.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.434
And it's like one of
those good worries.

00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:41.600
Like, why are you complaining
about people lining up

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.391
at your restaurant.

00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:46.790
But it's kind of like, for me
I don't need to fill a quota.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.400
You know if we're
feeding 100 people,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.484
I want it to be a damn
good meal, you know.

00:33:51.484 --> 00:33:52.900
But I think it's
harder to control

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.620
when you get to the 600.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.795
And on the weekends, like 900.

00:33:56.795 --> 00:33:58.170
MATT RODBARD: And
to your credit,

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.378
when you go to Kang Ho Dong
Baekjeong, his restaurant

00:34:00.378 --> 00:34:02.650
in New York, you're having
doenjang jigae, which is

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.510
the fermented bean paste stew.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.280
And it's like the
best in the city.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.540
And he's doing it
for 900 a night.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.010
And it's crazy to do that.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.969
That volume.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.656
I mean it's really,
really impressive.

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:15.989
DEUKI HONG: I mean, it's not
easy and we want to cut it.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.760
Like we were even talking
about like, should be like stop

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.150
accepting reservations.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.790
And stop accepting people
at a certain amount

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.712
just to like quality,
like how ramen shops do.

00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:30.170
But we realized
that we don't care.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.644
We're just like,
just serve everybody.

00:34:31.644 --> 00:34:32.510
HILLARY: Like make it work.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.580
DEUKI HONG: Yeah, make it work.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.280
Exactly.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.510
Like forget that.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.429
Just make it work.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.920
But a lot of
awesome people come.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.770
I mean, we've been
embraced by the industry.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.360
And I think that's
our biggest-- I

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.460
cook for-- like I can't
read-- the last time I clicked

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.580
into Yelp and read our or
any restaurant that I've

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.810
worked at review was a
really long time ago.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.729
I just don't do it.

00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:56.520
I don't know of many
industry people do it.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.690
I cook for the industry people.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.070
And I don't know if
that's right or wrong.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.080
I don't care.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.690
I cook for chefs.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.480
I cook for industry.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.572
I love industry people.

00:35:10.572 --> 00:35:12.280
Not that I don't care
about anybody else.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.870
It's that I focus on them.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:17.930
I use that expensive
cut of meat because I'm

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.390
sure chef is going to come and
he deserves a nice cut of meat.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.590
I'm not going to go use
that cheaper cut to save

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.640
a little bit here because
I feel like there's

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.910
this fraternity and this
camaraderie where I trust you,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.040
you trust me type of deal.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.206
Where I trust you enough
and I go to your restaurant

00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:36.000
and there's that element.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.414
But I feel like I cook for
chefs in New York City.

00:35:39.414 --> 00:35:41.580
HILLARY: So that's really
a question about audience.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.370
And who your audience is and
which part of your audience

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.360
you are focusing on.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.820
How did you guys imagine
the audience for the book?

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.272
And who were you writing for?

00:35:55.272 --> 00:35:56.480
MATT RODBARD: Great question.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.870
So I think we were looking to
capture a few audiences first

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.405
and foremost Korean-Americans.

00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:05.530
I think there's a lot of
Korean-Americans out there

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.400
who know the dishes but
don't know how to make them

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.020
but are dabbling into food.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.930
I think you're seeing
a lot of young folks

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.620
who are you subscribing
to Blue Apron

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.590
or maybe buying a cookbook and
experimenting with cooking.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.630
But a lot of Korean-Americans
have the books

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.590
that tell you how to make it.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.850
So that was one audience.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:31.010
But then the bigger audience
was fans of Asian food.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.050
Like people who line up
for the ramen burger.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.160
Or go down to San Gabriel
Valley in Los Angeles

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.390
or out to San Jose to have the
Vietnamese food or whatever.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.889
You know, those folks,
whoever they may be,

00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:46.680
we're writing that book
for them because we

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.510
want them to see that Korean
food has a lot of personality

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.240
and there's a lot of
intricacies there.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.082
And we did the work.

00:36:54.082 --> 00:36:56.290
We went through all these
dishes and told the stories

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.040
in the head notes.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.480
And so it's for that audience.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.030
And then I don't know, who else?

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.870
DEUKI HONG: I just like
did it to our friends.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.710
We don't reach like--
I shouldn't say that,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.630
I have to-- we're not like
one of these beautiful,

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.380
illustrious--

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.940
MATT RODBARD: Domnique Crenn's
book, which is an amazing.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.390
HILLARY: This is not
a coffee table book.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.140
It's a book that can get dirty.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.230
MATT RODBARD: It's a bit
of a nightstand book,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.740
I'd like to say.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.860
You can actually read it.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.670
HILLARY: It's a good read.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.020
And it's not too precious.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.120
So I feel like you
can spill on it.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.620
DEUKI HONG: I feel
like the language

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.350
we use-- at least audience,
I wasn't like let's target

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.615
like 25 to 35.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.910
The language, to Matt's
credit-- and I love the way

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.270
he writes too.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.874
It's like talking
to your friend.

00:37:42.874 --> 00:37:44.290
You're not going
to see that book.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.380
It's not like some
encyclopedia, like a formal--

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.832
there's a bit of salty
language in there.

00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:52.415
MATT RODBARD: One
reviewer on Amazon--

00:37:52.415 --> 00:37:54.300
DEUKI HONG: So we
got an Amazon review.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.570
She e-mailed us.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:58.709
She was like a mother
in the middle America.

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:01.000
And we're just grateful that
somebody in middle America

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.540
heard about us.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.040
MATT RODBARD: And
I'm from Michigan.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.080
From Middle America too.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.780
DEUKI HONG: But she
has like ten kids.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.700
And she was like,
oh, I love your book.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.570
I love your recipes.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:10.890
But I'm so disappointed
in you Deuki.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.135
You're using salty language.

00:38:12.135 --> 00:38:13.510
And I was like,
what is going on.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.120
MATT RODBARD: What is going on.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.970
DEUKI HONG: Like, Matty
did you swear on my behalf?

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.345
MATT RODBARD: And
Deuki literally

00:38:17.345 --> 00:38:18.740
went through it
every single page

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.810
to see where the
salty language was.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:27.496
But really, what happened was
that's David Chang's quote.

00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:28.870
DEUKI HONG: So
what happened was,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.090
there's literally four
pages in our whole book.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.250
And I can name you those
pages, 87, 163, 164, and 202

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.320
or something like that.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.930
And two of those pages is the
interview with Chef Chang.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.310
And like you can't
filter that guy.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.960
So I think she might have
confused the two Asians.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.740
And like, oh that's
probably him.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.907
So we don't blame you, Abby.

00:38:49.907 --> 00:38:51.281
She bought the
book and you know,

00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:52.932
she was like very
disappointed in us.

00:38:52.932 --> 00:38:54.390
I was really sad
for the whole day.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.650
I was like, oh man.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.020
MATT RODBARD: I know.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.936
DEUKI HONG: There's a
family in middle America

00:38:57.936 --> 00:39:00.020
that thinks I'm really horrible.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.430
MATT RODBARD: Voice is really
important though with writing.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.625
And I think we captured it.

00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:07.000
And thank you for the praise,
but it's really both of us.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.740
It's me interviewing
Deuki and recording it,

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.920
and then transcribing it,
and having that in there.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.380
Or just us being together a lot.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.115
It's almost like osmosis, it
comes between, into my brain

00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:16.940
and into yours.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:22.500
And we express ourselves in the
book truthfully and honestly.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.170
And that's hard to do
in a lot of writing.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.935
And credit to our
editor for not--

00:39:26.935 --> 00:39:28.060
DEUKI HONG: Editing it out.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.660
Not cleaning up anything.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.576
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.200
DEUKI HONG: It's like
if you called us.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.787
We talk as if, just call us.

00:39:33.787 --> 00:39:35.620
And I think even in the
book, we're like yo,

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.320
just reach us out on social.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.497
It's a chill book.

00:39:39.497 --> 00:39:40.330
We're not, I'm not--

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.622
HILLARY: You guys give you
twitter handles in the book?

00:39:42.622 --> 00:39:43.663
MATT RODBARD: Chill book.

00:39:43.663 --> 00:39:45.690
DEUKI HONG: You know,
we're just like chill.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.120
It's great, even
now on Instagram.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.640
People like made something from
the book and they'll tag us

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.556
and then we'll see it.

00:39:50.556 --> 00:39:52.320
It's like still surreal.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.329
Like we had the
japchae today in the--

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:55.620
MATT RODBARD: Google cafeteria.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.214
AUDIENCE: Conscious Cafe.

00:39:57.214 --> 00:39:58.130
DEUKI HONG: What cafe?

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.690
AUDIENCE: Conscious Cafe.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.398
MATT RODBARD: In the
Conscious Cafe while

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.590
we were in San Francisco.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.102
And it was great.

00:40:03.102 --> 00:40:03.810
It was excellent.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:04.370
DEUKI HONG: It's
just so surreal.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.040
It's like oh my gosh.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.810
It's like people are--

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:06.580
MATT RODBARD:
Cooking Korean food.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.690
DEUKI HONG: First of all,
somebody made something

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.530
from this book.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.070
And it's being served to y'all.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.070
MATT RODBARD: It's cool.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.778
DEUKI HONG: It's just
one of those things

00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:14.100
where it will click tomorrow.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.850
MATT RODBARD: Any questions?

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.010
Yeah.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.676
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
if you guys saw

00:40:18.676 --> 00:40:22.070
a reaction from the
Korean culinary industry?

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.880
HILLARY: So the question
must have you guys

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.890
seen a reaction from Korea?

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.040
From the Korean
culinary industry?

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.510
MATT RODBARD: Well I've
been to Korea a few times.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.372
There aren't a lot of
books sold in Korea,

00:40:33.372 --> 00:40:35.080
so that I don't think
the book is quite--

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.570
DEUKI HONG: That is so bad,
like we don't read books.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.710
MATT RODBARD: Well,
no but-- sorry,

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.760
there aren't a lot of cookbooks.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.740
I thought it was clear,
but it wasn't clear.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.890
There aren't a lot of
cookbooks sold in Korea.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.100
It's not a big industry.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.730
So I'm not sure
if people in Korea

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.930
are actually seeing
what we're doing.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.800
But I will say this about
the Korean industry.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.050
It's exciting.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.150
Seoul is a crazy
restaurant town.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.490
And not just the
traditional cooking

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.610
which you'll find anything
and everything in Seoul

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:01.640
and it's amazing.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.594
And I think media is going to
really start to pay attention

00:41:04.594 --> 00:41:06.760
to the way that they've
looked at Tokyo 10 years ago

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.801
when Bourdain went there.

00:41:07.801 --> 00:41:09.860
And everyone
followed pretty much.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.100
Korea is the next
place because Bourdain

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.020
went there and everyone's
going to follow, mark my words.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.570
But on the higher end,
on the higher echelon,

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.080
there's really exciting places.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.470
One's Mingles in Seoul.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.690
That chef is doing
such incredible work.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.670
And I hope that I can write
about him soon and kind of

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.920
bring his story to the masses.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.534
But it's hard to say.

00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:36.950
I'd like to hope that people
in Korea are reading the book

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.980
and they're seeing how
Americans are interpreting

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.980
traditional Korean food.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.910
But I think the
jury is still out.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.630
DEUKI HONG: And I
think or Koreans

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.970
are-- we don't know how
Korea feels about us.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.100
I mean, I think
Koreans are the biggest

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.710
supporters of-- like if
I see anything Korean,

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.610
like I'll just go to
just check it out.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.818
In that same respect, I
think Koreans are the biggest

00:41:58.818 --> 00:42:01.450
haters of Koreans also.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.416
They are so critical.

00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:03.250
Like chill out.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.541
MATT RODBARD: Toughest critics.

00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:05.190
I see you.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.510
DEUKI HONG: I am.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.510
I'm guilty of it too.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:11.179
It's like, no man,
no, this is not good.

00:42:11.179 --> 00:42:12.970
But like it's just like
one of those things

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.441
where they'll support you just
because you're doing something

00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:17.190
for their culture.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.315
And you're doing something.

00:42:18.315 --> 00:42:20.770
And hopefully that
that's how they view it.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.460
For us, we don't say that
this is like just going back

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.290
on authenticity.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.940
And we don't say that this is
some authentic Korean grandma

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.450
cooking.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.296
And God, it's so not.

00:42:30.296 --> 00:42:32.170
And we have a recipe in
there with a crap ton

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.390
of bacon and butter.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.890
Kimchi

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.060
MATT RODBARD: Fried rice.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.602
DEUKI HONG: She'd throw it
out the window right away.

00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:38.060
But we don't know
how Koreans feel.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.320
I hope that they like it.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.090
If they don't, great.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.316
If they do, great.

00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:46.987
AUDIENCE: Koreans are very
difficult to procure and--

00:42:46.987 --> 00:42:49.320
DEUKI HONG: Yeah, that's a
great, that's an incredible--

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.010
HILLARY: So this was a question
about whether you guys have

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.990
done any experimentation
with recipes

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.320
with replacing it
maybe difficult to get

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.470
Korean ingredients with
perhaps more local ingredients.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.610
DEUKI HONG: I mean,
personally for me,

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.300
so just going back
on that authenticity,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.301
like I can't cook
Korean Korean food.

00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:05.300
Because I'm in New York.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.470
The city of New York.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.820
LA Korean food and New York
Korean food taste different.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.500
Imagine how it is in
Korea and New York.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.640
Or LA and Korea.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.300
So I just started
making doenjang, right?

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.004
But I got it from Korea, because
somebody like smuggled it in.

00:43:21.004 --> 00:43:22.920
MATT RODBARD: Block you
off the record, watch.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.906
DEUKI HONG: Totally
shouldn't have said that.

00:43:24.906 --> 00:43:27.280
But it's just like, I just
want to see the process of it.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.310
And then I can see how the
soybean-- I mean who knows.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.270
Like New York has awesome
local product too.

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.728
I mean, you guys
are in California.

00:43:33.728 --> 00:43:35.395
So it's like chefs
are kind of cheating.

00:43:35.395 --> 00:43:36.811
Of course you're
making good food.

00:43:36.811 --> 00:43:39.090
You guys put some salt
and the olive oil on it

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.900
and it tastes delicious.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.730
But for us, I want
to start doing that.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.420
And that's such a great point,
because that's important,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:44.920
right?

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.920
Because I don't want to mimic.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.060
I can't even mimic,
even if I wanted to.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.300
What they do in Korea
in their terroir, right?

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.220
And I feel like you're
going to get distinctively

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.680
Californian Korean food.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.340
Distinctively New
York Korean food.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.260
MATT RODBARD: One big
difference too is beef.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.540
You know beef
barbecue for example

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.330
is different here
than it is in Korea.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.860
I mean beef in Korea is
incredibly expensive.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.260
There isn't a lot of
land to raise cattle

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.200
so it is expensive.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.850
They get beef from
places like China.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:21.740
Pork is less expensive
but it's expensive.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.674
And they get pork
from Argentina.

00:44:24.674 --> 00:44:26.090
They ship it all
the way to Korea.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.380
So in America beef is cheap.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.320
So you're seeing Korean barbecue
restaurants proliferate here

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.590
and not so much in Korea.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.715
Of course, there are barbecue
restaurants in Korea,

00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:37.340
but it's not as prevalent.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.550
Korea is a peninsula.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.880
There is 1,500 miles
of coastline in Korea.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.390
And so with that,
seafood is essential.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:49.000
It's fundamental in the diet.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.550
And that's different here.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.220
Here it's beef, it's pork,
it's barbecue, it's grilling,

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.340
it's bibimbap.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.810
It's a lot more beef
and pork driven.

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.870
So that's a big difference
between the two.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.040
HILLARY: I thought I saw
another hand back there as well.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.814
No I think that's
absolutely right.

00:45:05.814 --> 00:45:07.480
And I don't want to
speak for chefs when

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.100
I have a chef sitting
next to me but you

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.250
know there's only so many
tools that a chef works with.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:17.240
You have temperature, you
have flavor, you have texture.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.810
That's like, that's
what you have, you know?

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:27.610
I think your point that
myriad possibilities that

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.290
exist within Korean cooking is,
I think, a big driver of what's

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.690
attracting American chefs
without Korean cooking

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.450
or heritage backgrounds to it.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:38.590
I think that's 100% true.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.840
That's something you guys
cover in the book, actually.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.810
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.150
But also the health comment
is really interesting to me

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.040
because it is a really big
part of the Korean diet.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.590
Really the East Asian diet.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:53.430
It's low impact and high flavor.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.640
And I mean that's our next
book, Low Impact, High Flavor.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.540
HILLARY: 101 Korean
Recipes for Your Health.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:58.680
MATT RODBARD: Right.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.180
Exactly.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.650
We could sell some books.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.770
But really, it's dairy
free, pretty much,

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.850
except for a few things.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.780
It's gluten free, pretty much,
for except for a few things.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.090
And incredibly delicious.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:14.270
And the fermented element of it
just draws out so much flavor

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.520
and it really makes
protein less important.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.090
Namul, seasoned vegetables too.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.354
Not fermented vegetables,
seasoned vegetables

00:46:21.354 --> 00:46:22.770
are a huge part
of the Korean diet

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.650
and those are
incredibly healthy.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.049
Also you just look at the
Korean population in America

00:46:27.049 --> 00:46:27.590
and in Korea.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:36.510
It's very healthy population,
except for all the drinking.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:40.110
HILLARY: Which is what I
was going to transition to.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.190
Because there's a whole section
in the cookbook about drinking

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.930
food.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.522
And why does that
get it's own section?

00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:49.900
DEUKI HONG: It needs
its own section.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.880
MATT RODBARD: It does
need its own section

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.922
and we give it the space.

00:46:51.922 --> 00:46:52.921
What do you want to say.

00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:54.800
I mean you own a
restaurant in Koreatown

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.851
that is open until literally
6:00 AM on Saturday.

00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:01.100
DEUKI HONG: No, it's not good.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:01.890
MATT RODBARD: There's nothing
good that happens at that time.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.098
DEUKI HONG: I mean it's true.

00:47:03.098 --> 00:47:07.260
It's just there's nothing
right about that in any city.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.090
We drink a lot.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.710
I don't know.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:12.074
It's like not binge-drinking
though, like stupid college

00:47:12.074 --> 00:47:12.740
kids in America.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.906
MATT RODBARD: It's different

00:47:13.906 --> 00:47:18.040
DEUKI HONG: It's like grown
adults in like business attire

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.570
and they complain.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.570
MATT RODBARD: Drinking
like stupid college kids.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.350
DEUKI HONG: Yeah like stupid
college kids in America.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:27.670
But I feel like--
Asians are, as you

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:30.260
can tell I'm very socially
awkward, so they need alcohol

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.810
to break it.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.940
Or I don't really know
the science behind it.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.230
Soju is cheaper
than water there.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.620
It's like, bro.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.710
MATT RODBARD: And soju is
the traditional spirit.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:46.120
It's a distilled rice spirit.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.130
DEUKI HONG: And it was kind
of like, OK, let's drink.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.397
I don't know.

00:47:51.397 --> 00:47:53.480
But it's not like we're
like cocktail mixologists.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.880
We're just very simple--

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.860
HILLARY: Can you tell
me a little bit more

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.500
specifically about the food
and sort of the relationship

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.482
of food and drinking?

00:47:59.482 --> 00:48:01.940
MATT RODBARD: Well there's a
great harmony between drinking

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.880
and eating in Korea.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.340
So you're not just going to
the bar and having 16 shots.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.230
You're having a full spread,
banchan, the plates that

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.420
arrive before the meal arrive.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.830
And then you have
a really hot soup.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.515
And maybe have some
mackerel, I mean

00:48:15.515 --> 00:48:17.640
there's like all these
dishes that are specifically

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.560
for drinking.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.057
And it's kind of meant to
prolong the drinking session,

00:48:22.057 --> 00:48:23.890
so to speak, when you're
out with your boss,

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.806
or you're out with your
friends, or you're out

00:48:25.806 --> 00:48:28.390
with your peer circle.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.760
So you can go out to two
or three of these pochas

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.200
and then maybe a restaurant
and maybe a karaoke.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.110
You have to eat to prolong it
to power yourself through it.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.510
So we have a spicy
clam soup, which

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.280
is like a really
classic pocha dish.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.350
It's just when you've
kind of had a few too many

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:50.780
and you start drinking that
warm fish stock and peppers

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.170
and it's just really light.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.245
And it's just rejuvenating.

00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:55.620
DEUKI HONG: It's
essentially like

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.203
what happens at our
restaurant or what

00:48:57.203 --> 00:48:59.040
I've seen in the past
few years is that--

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.766
and usually like a
K-town run, I guess,

00:49:01.766 --> 00:49:05.642
it's just so bad--
You eat dinner.

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:07.850
They'll eat dinner-- and
I've seen it multiple times,

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:08.910
it's not like an
occurrence like, oh

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.340
my gosh, that never happens.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:15.610
They'll eat dinner at our
place, go out, drink, you know,

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.540
pre-game or whatever.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.650
And then they'll hit the clubs.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.990
Preferably Circle,
New York City,

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.690
hottest Asian nightclub
in New York City.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.305
HILLARY: Hot tip.

00:49:25.305 --> 00:49:27.680
DEUKI HONG: And then they'll
come back to the restaurant.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.119
So literally, I'm like bro,
I saw you four hours ago.

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:31.910
What are you doing?

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.910
And you know, they're
like wasted at this time.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.970
But in every element of
their stop, they're drinking.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.260
Sometimes with food.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.490
Sometimes without food.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.000
But that relationship.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.020
You know, they'll
go to like a pocha,

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:49.100
where it's like pretty
much a night market.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.320
Not necessarily a gastropub.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.150
It's just like
really good stews.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.367
A lot of salty, savory dishes.

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:55.700
MATT RODBARD: Fried chicken too.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.408
DEUKI HONG: Yeah.

00:49:56.408 --> 00:49:59.270
That goes along with a lot
of the soju and makgeolli.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:02.481
There's drinking
involved in a lot of it.

00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:04.580
I don't know why because
Koreans are like,

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.322
our bodies are not
built to drink.

00:50:07.322 --> 00:50:08.530
Asians aren't built to drink.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.321
I think there's like
a science behind that.

00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:11.600
You guys are smart.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.770
Y'all look it up somewhere.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:14.450
But we do.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:17.320
And it's a big part
of our culture.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.140
HILLARY: I know our
time is winding down,

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.182
so I have some lightning
round questions for you.

00:50:21.182 --> 00:50:22.723
So I'm going to ask
them fast, you're

00:50:22.723 --> 00:50:23.812
going to answer them fast.

00:50:23.812 --> 00:50:25.230
MATT RODBARD: Okay.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.270
HILLARY: For novice
and beginner cooks,

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.182
where should they
start in your cookbook.

00:50:29.182 --> 00:50:31.140
MATT RODBARD: I like the
one pot doenjangjigae.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.890
I like making that
bean paste soup.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:34.360
DEUKI HONG: Make
the quick kimchis.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.526
MATT RODBARD: Quick kimchis?

00:50:35.526 --> 00:50:36.360
DEUKI HONG: Yeah.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.020
HILLARY: And for those
who are just less familiar

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.950
with Korean food in
general, how would

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:44.475
you suggest they approach
a Korean restaurant menu?

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:46.350
MATT RODBARD: For me,
ask a lot of questions.

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:49.184
You just go in and go in with
maybe a little bit of a plan

00:50:49.184 --> 00:50:50.600
but like I'm going
to have a soup,

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.975
I'm going to have
a barbecue, I'm

00:50:51.975 --> 00:50:53.410
going to have maybe a pancake.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:54.575
But start asking questions.

00:50:54.575 --> 00:50:56.290
It's so important.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.165
DEUKI HONG: I don't
think you're going to get

00:50:58.165 --> 00:50:59.350
any answers from a Korean.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:50:59.849
Whatever.

00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:01.482
I mean, pick something.

00:51:01.482 --> 00:51:02.835
Hopefully it tastes good.

00:51:02.835 --> 00:51:04.080
Roll a dice.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.660
What do you want me to say?

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.820
HILLARY: Do you have
any recommendations

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.550
for good Korean food in San
Francisco or is the answer

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.930
get on a plane and go to LA?

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:16.530
MATT RODBARD: It's a very--
San Francisco doesn't

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.180
have an abundance of
Korean restaurants compared

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:21.400
to other cities,
like Los Angeles.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.340
But honestly--

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.130
DEUKI HONG: Sorry,
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.820
MATT RODBARD: So I interviewed
in the book, I went to--

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.550
AUDIENCE: When are you
going to open up one here?

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.040
MATT RODBARD: This crowd wow.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.940
We felt the--

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:33.811
HILLARY: Serious.

00:51:33.811 --> 00:51:34.310
Serious.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:36.393
Someone just asked when
you're going to open here.

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:39.136
DEUKI HONG: If the right
opportunity-- I mean--

00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:40.844
AUDIENCE: So the
Chinese food went there,

00:51:40.844 --> 00:51:41.760
you need to come here.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.370
MATT RODBARD: Yeah,
I like that idea.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.626
DEUKI HONG: Chef Danny
is a good friend.

00:51:45.626 --> 00:51:46.492
And Chef Corey.

00:51:46.492 --> 00:51:48.200
MATT RODBARD: Let's
talk about Corey Lee.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.100
HILLARY: Oh yeah, let do that.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:49.820
Let's talk about Corey Lee.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.010
He's the chef of benu.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.659
He just got his
third Michelin star.

00:51:52.659 --> 00:51:53.950
MATT RODBARD: Korean-Americans.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:54.360
DEUKI HONG: I love Corey Lee.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.276
That's all I have to say
about Chef Corey Lee.

00:51:56.276 --> 00:51:58.250
I admire that man.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:01.020
I worship the ground
that he walks on.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.500
To put it lightly

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.300
HILLARY: I think for just
a little more background,

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:09.320
the food that he's doing at
benu-- sort of in the same way

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.320
that you see chefs of
Korean-American heritage

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.902
in America-- they wouldn't
say like, no I'm not

00:52:15.902 --> 00:52:17.860
cooking Korean food, I'm
cooking American food.

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.276
And for me, American food means
flavors from my childhood.

00:52:20.276 --> 00:52:22.180
Ingredients from where I live.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.870
And techniques that
I grew up using.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:30.194
So somebody like a
David Chang for example,

00:52:30.194 --> 00:52:31.610
you feel like he's
in conversation

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.170
with what Corey Lee is doing.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.461
DEUKI HONG: That's great point.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:40.220
HILLARY: And I think Dave
brought up Corey in your book

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:40.971
in that interview.

00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:43.469
MATT RODBARD: Oh I think he has
a similar opinion that Deuki

00:52:43.469 --> 00:52:44.530
has that Corey's doing.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:44.970
DEUKI HONG: I mean
not that intense.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:45.900
MATT RODBARD: Not that intense.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.390
But he's in a very
important figure

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.400
in talking about
Korean food in America.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.127
And he's here in San Francisco.

00:52:53.127 --> 00:52:54.210
I like Brother's Barbecue.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.820
That's another place.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.500
I think that's fantastic.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.910
HILLARY: But I have to say
this one thing about benu.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.530
They do this dish.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.580
When it arrives at your
table, it's teeny tiny.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.870
And it's this like
see through red shell

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.440
on top of which
you see an oyster.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.790
And you bite it and you're like,
I've had these flavors before.

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.330
This is like, what is this.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.530
Well it turns out
see through shell

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:19.990
somehow was made of kimchi.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:21.700
And there was also
pork in there.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.510
And it's like this
little baby bossam bite.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.710
But you know, it's magical.

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:27.751
DEUKI HONG: Chef Corey
Lee, ladies and gentlemen.

00:53:27.751 --> 00:53:30.030
Corey Lee.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.230
I wasn't fortunate enough.

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.037
I had to save about
seven paychecks.

00:53:33.037 --> 00:53:34.370
HILLARY: I went with my brother.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.427
He's a lawyer.

00:53:35.427 --> 00:53:36.510
MATT RODBARD: That's true.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:40.980
But really like the
classic flavors being

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.582
done in an interesting way.

00:53:42.582 --> 00:53:45.040
I think that's really the future
of Korean food in America.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.350
You're going to see
it time and again.

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.860
It's just the
traditional flavors.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.716
Not fusion.

00:53:50.716 --> 00:53:53.160
Not like kimchi grilled cheese.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.077
It's not that.

00:53:54.077 --> 00:53:55.370
DEUKI HONG: Hating on the
taco and the grilled cheese.

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:56.203
MATT RODBARD: Sorry.

00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:58.520
HILLARY: So yes
in San Francisco,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.510
we were saying-- one
answer to that question

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.210
of where can you find Korean
flavor in San Francisco is at

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:07.720
benu, if you're fortunate
enough to be able to go.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.710
And then you were saying
Brother's Barbecue.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.912
MATT RODBARD: Yeah, and
that's in Richmond, right?

00:54:11.912 --> 00:54:12.620
It's a good spot.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.270
I went there--

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:15.294
DEUKI HONG: We know no
places in San Francisco.

00:54:15.294 --> 00:54:17.210
We're like trying to
pull to you, we're like--

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:18.610
MATT RODBARD: We didn't
spend too much time eating

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.080
at Korean restaurants here.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.030
LA was such an important
part, we went there mostly.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:26.960
But I had a really good chance
to visit with Adam Johnson,

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.250
who wrote Orphan Master's Son,
who won a Pulitzer in 2013,

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.146
and we had a meal at Brother's.

00:54:32.146 --> 00:54:33.270
And I thought it was great.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.894
They make their own
time doenjang there

00:54:34.894 --> 00:54:36.900
and it's charcoal BBQ.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.494
It's a good one.

00:54:38.494 --> 00:54:40.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: You could ask
your audience where they do.

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:41.290
MATT RODBARD: Yeah,
where do you guys go?

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:42.310
HILLARY: Yeah, where
are you guys eating?

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.101
DEUKI HONG: Why are
we-- we're New Yorkers.

00:54:45.467 --> 00:54:46.425
MATT RODBARD: San Jose?

00:54:47.947 --> 00:54:49.280
DEUKI HONG: That's not SF, girl.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.550
MATT RODBARD: What's that?

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.080
Namu?

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:51.570
DEUKI HONG: Oh, Namu Gaji.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:52.570
No, that's not here.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.470
Is that here?

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:57.040
HILLARY: Yeah, that's
like Dolores Park.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.470
MATT RODBARD: Yeah.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:01.080
I think in two years too,
a bunch of other places

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.016
are going to open,
I would imagine.

00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:04.390
HILLARY: Yeah,
the Namu Gaji team

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.930
is opening a new
restaurant, I believe

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.770
on Divisadero, that's
going to be like just

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.216
focused on stonepot cooking.

00:55:10.216 --> 00:55:11.840
DEUKI HONG: She's
got the inside scoop.

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.998
MATT RODBARD: That's great.

00:55:12.998 --> 00:55:13.906
HILLARY: Eater.com.

00:55:13.906 --> 00:55:14.360
DEUKI HONG: Eater.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.360
MATT RODBARD: Yeah,
definite shout out to Eater.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.439
There's a question.

00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:18.980
What do we think
about Japanese food?

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.230
DEUKI HONG: Sick of Japanese--

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.852
HILLARY: What was the question?

00:55:21.852 --> 00:55:23.310
What do you think
of Japanese food?

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:24.851
MATT RODBARD: They're
very different.

00:55:24.851 --> 00:55:27.960
I've been to Japan a few times
and I think the world of it.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.311
It's a beautiful culture.

00:55:30.311 --> 00:55:31.060
They're different.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.260
There is a lot of
geopolitical elements

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.920
between Korea and Japan too
that we could talk at Google

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.780
another time about.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.655
DEUKI HONG: No, I agree,
it's very different.

00:55:38.655 --> 00:55:40.900
I think their technicians.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.177
When I see them making rice for
three years or whatever it is.

00:55:44.177 --> 00:55:46.010
You're dealing with--
especially [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:48.830
go on sushi like-- you're
dealing with two or three

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:49.520
ingredients.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.870
So you're not masking anything.

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.350
It's either it's how
you cook the fish that

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.460
affects the texture.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.269
And that affects the taste
of it and the experience

00:55:59.269 --> 00:55:59.810
that you get.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.615
And how you season your rice.

00:56:01.615 --> 00:56:02.990
So all of that,
like for me, it's

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:05.370
like when I see
less ingredients,

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.080
that means a lot of technique.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.232
It has to be a give, right.

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:11.130
So I respect that
cuisine so much.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:14.400
I think in a lot of what I do
comes from Japanese cuisine

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:14.900
too.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.504
And that's OK.

00:56:16.504 --> 00:56:18.670
MATT RODBARD: Got a shout-out
to a really great book

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.660
about Japanese food
called Rice, Noodle, Fish.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.300
HILLARY: Oh it's so good.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:21.800
You have to read it.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.860
MATT RODBARD: Done
by Bourdain Books,

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.420
Matt Goulding's the author.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.350
Highly recommend it.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:27.506
It's fantastic.

00:56:27.506 --> 00:56:29.590
HILLARY: I had a very
flippant thought which

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:32.590
is another tie that I
see between Japanese

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:36.040
and Korean food in America
is that both are better in LA

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.552
than in almost any
other location.

00:56:38.552 --> 00:56:40.260
Literally almost any
other American city.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.250
DEUKI HONG: SF is good.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:44.690
MATT RODBARD: Yeah
it is really good.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:49.650
HILLARY: It's just, Los Angeles
as a culinary powerhouse

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:54.690
in our country has a few really
niche areas where they just

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:55.380
really excel.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.887
And Japanese food
in LA is incredible.

00:56:58.887 --> 00:57:00.470
Are there any other
audience questions

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:02.486
before we call it a day?

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:04.400
AUDIENCE: Favorite Korean dish.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.960
MATT RODBARD: Oh great.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.501
DEUKI HONG: Yeah,
let's shut it down.

00:57:07.501 --> 00:57:10.810
MATT RODBARD: I like kalbijjim,
which is a braised short rib.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.550
DEUKI HONG: He changes It
every interview that we do.

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.830
I just want you to know
that he had like gamjatang

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.157
like a couple of weeks ago.

00:57:17.157 --> 00:57:18.740
MATT RODBARD: I know,
I had gamjatang.

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.707
We didn't really geek out about
Korean dishes in this panel.

00:57:21.707 --> 00:57:22.540
DEUKI HONG: You did.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.248
MATT RODBARD: OK.

00:57:23.248 --> 00:57:24.550
Well, read the book.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.270
There's a lot of
great dishes in there

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:30.296
and there's lots of cool
stories and yeah, that's mine.

00:57:30.296 --> 00:57:31.770
That's mine today.

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:32.700
What about you?

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.130
DEUKI HONG: Daktoritang, it's
the first dish I ever made.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.360
My mom makes it awesome.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.467
She can't cook for life,
but she makes that.

00:57:38.467 --> 00:57:40.300
HILLARY: I would say
mine is kimchi pancake.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.420
MATT RODBARD:
Yeah, what's yours.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.503
DEUKI HONG: Kimchi pancake

00:57:42.503 --> 00:57:44.410
MATT RODBARD: Kimchi pancake.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:46.950
And I want to thank Eater
for covering Korean food so

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.934
thoroughly and rigorously.

00:57:48.934 --> 00:57:50.100
And you're a big part of it.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:50.970
So thank you very much.

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:51.761
DEUKI HONG: Hillary

00:57:51.761 --> 00:57:53.080
HILLARY: Thank you guys.
