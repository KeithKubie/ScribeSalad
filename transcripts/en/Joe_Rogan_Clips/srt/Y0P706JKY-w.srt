1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,250
Your Willow Walker says the rest of the
country music is just biding rap and,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,510
and acting like they are so, well,
I think it was a little bit of that,

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:11,100
but I think at one point in time it was
a little that a lot of rappers would

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:15,450
look at guys like Waylon Jennings and
Johnny Cash and old school gangster

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,050
country guys, outlaw country
is way different from,
yeah, I love outlaw country.

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:22,530
You can't tell me Waylon Jennings,
Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson,

7
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,480
Johnny Cash aren't kicking it. Like
that's what the fuck is that right. But,

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,140
but that's,

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,280
that's not the same as you allocate
and Annelie be through your songs and

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,070
talking about cowboy boots and said
air force ones. No, not the same.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,130
There's something about the almond
brothers midnight rider and you know,

12
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,760
whipping post that's radically different
than you just sing it about your Ford

13
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:43,260
and, and you know, and
rafting on Saturday. Yeah.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,560
I don't think people even understand
tied to the whipping posts.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,870
You can't fake that song. Quit when
they came at me about the NRA interview.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,870
Um, last year, every day I smoked a joint,

17
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:58,620
woke up and laughed and listened to
that record like every single day.

18
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:00,930
I just wanted you guys to know.
It didn't bother me any.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,420
My wife just told me to
shut up talking to you all.

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,690
We went shooting a lot more and we play
almond brothers whipping posts every

21
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,710
morning because I had to remind
myself that this is normal,

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,300
that you are being done like this publicly
because you are disagreeing with the

23
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,720
system that people have agreed to that
you don't agree to and it's okay not to

24
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:19,170
agree.

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,710
So the Harmon brothers really got me
through that segment has stopped me from

26
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,020
punching a lot of bourgeoisie
black people in the face.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,360
Well you're a proponent of your,
your right to carry a gun. Yeah.

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,910
And I'm a lover of the U s nine
states constitution as a whole of of,

29
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,960
of all our rights and amendments.
But in particular, you know,

30
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:40,140
the first and second amendment rights
matter to me as an African American,

31
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,890
as an and as an American, first and
foremost, as an African American,

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,460
I've only been free 55 years.
My parents were born in apartheid.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,770
And as an American,
we are,

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,430
we are a country that broke off from
what we felt like with the tyranny of the

35
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,264
monarchy.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,680
And we did that because farmers in
guns [inaudible] wage guerrilla warfare

37
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,350
against at that time when the largest
armies and navies in the world.

38
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,420
So I honor that by continuing to
be in the spirit of those farmers,

39
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,180
you know, in the, in the
continuance of Crispus addicts,

40
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,060
the first person who died American
revolution was a black man. You know.

41
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:12,990
So for me,

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,530
I would dishonor those patriots
who started this country
at Christmas attics. I,

43
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:18,120
with dishonor.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,980
The lineage is an African American who's
only 55 years in a freedom by giving

45
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,430
government and my gun pet. That's
not something I believe in. Um,

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,780
government is people pro.

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,170
Part of the problem with given government
anything is that they're just people.

48
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:34,170
They're not something special.
Absolutely not flawless. Absolutely.

49
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,110
Give People Power over you and
theirs they'll, they will, I mean,

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,150
this is not saying we should stockpile
guns and point them at the government.

51
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,180
Know if people have guns, it's way harder
to just take over since the absolute,

52
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,570
that shit happens all the time in other
countries and it does happen. Absolutely.

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,600
People get occupied and governments
turn on them at government's changed the

54
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,680
rules and put places that were democracies
are no longer so absolutely that's

55
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,600
real. And we're never far from
it. Is it safe as you feel?

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,860
You're never far from it.

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,470
But I think what we need more of
is people like you that are, uh,

58
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,070
that are reasonable,

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,520
very educated in the matter
of or articulate person who
comes from a place where

60
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,730
they don't expect that argument come
from. Yeah, I understand. You know,

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,630
like think about left wing people are
Democratic People, progressive people.

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,220
You always think,
you know,

63
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,580
you think about democratic
people overwhelmingly being
appreciated by the black

64
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,120
community and you always associate
them with being anti gun. Yeah.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,420
That's a common thing. So when a guy
like you steps out and says, no, no,

66
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,100
I think it's a disservice to
take this right away. Absolutely.

67
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,560
If I didn't support it and fight for it.
I've been,

68
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,430
I've been an African American
40 40,000 years now. Right.

69
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,760
I have no democrats.
Primarily my entire life.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm from the south in particular the
southeast Alabama, Georgia, Florida.

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,710
I have never known a black male
Democrat that was working class at,

72
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,230
did not own a weapon. Mm. Not that.

73
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,390
So I'm going to follow the
examples of my grandfather.

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,050
I'm not going to listen to the National
Party in their rhetoric about DRM in the

75
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,710
population.

76
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,250
I think obviously we can agree that we
would all love it if we never needed guns.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,550
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Right.
Of course. Who wouldn't?

78
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,840
I'd rather not need it than be prepared
though. They're not be prepared. Sure.

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,120
Read right. Better to have it, not
to need it to needed not to have it.

80
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,390
And the part of the country
I'm from and what you do often.

81
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,210
Like I'm from a party country. I grew
up fishing, hunting and growing food.

82
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,330
My sister, girls who don't get to
hunter's regularly now still fish,

83
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,070
occasionally shouts out to Greg Street
when our biggest t J's down there.

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,560
So great fishermen.
Right?

85
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,310
But this is this normal in my part of the
country as not having straws and being

86
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,070
able to smoke in public and
in places like La is it just,

87
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,490
it's not that big of a deal. You
know, you, you, you know in my,

88
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,520
in my mind state a household
should have five guns, right?

89
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,540
You should have a revolver,

90
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,640
shove a semi automatic for fueling
your wife carrying out, you know,

91
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:55,630
in public he used to have a shotgun and
just cause there's a great all around

92
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,300
going to have, whether it's
burglars are vermin, you know,

93
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,570
you should have bolt action rifles, some
course case cash got to kill your meat.

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,620
You should have a semiautomatic rifle,
you know,

95
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,070
defending against here and there just
to fuck off on Sundays and show your

96
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,310
homeboys was dick bigger.
But what should,

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,860
what you should not do is give
up your right to own with. Yeah.

98
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,910
Or use them on people.

99
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,390
That's the thing about using them
on people is that it's so rare,

100
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,920
but so horrific and so,

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
so common for something that's so
horrific and everybody's against it.

102
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,383
But I don't,

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,070
I don't understand how you would
ever buy taking guns. I mean,

104
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:30,380
you'd have to take all the guns
away to stop that from home.

105
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,250
But how are you going to do,
how are you going to do that?

106
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,850
Criminals are going to give up of course.
Huh?

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,650
So there's no way the regular people
should probably not do that. That's,

108
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,960
that's where it gets squirrely.
It's like,

109
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,280
how are you going to get those guns
from the criminals? You're not,

110
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,540
you're not going to, you're not
going to joke. Well we can do though.

111
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,810
And I will say as an owner, you get
lazy. Sometimes you don't train enough.

112
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,140
We should try and more. And
that doesn't mean, you know,

113
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,550
he'll try to be the quickest draw
and you practice it, you know?

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,910
But what you want to do is make sure you
know what you're doing with your weapon.

115
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,350
Make sure you know how to clean your
weapon, makes you not a store you weapon.

116
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,210
And I took my son and my
nephew, yeah, shooting.

117
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,490
I'm about to start taking my 11 year
old girl Michael shooting because I want

118
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,070
them to know what they do if they see
a gun. So we've already went through,

119
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,030
what do you do if you're somewhere
and you see a gun, how do,

120
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,430
how do you get out of that situation
and get other kids out of that situation

121
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:20,300
and let an adult know all that comes
with it. You know? And you know,

122
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,510
the strange thing to me is that my mother,
when she was in high school,

123
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,860
was actually taught how to shoot
a rifle, right? Because the NRA,

124
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,250
which is now vilified and hate it
for four reasons, some deservedly so.

125
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,084
So I'm not,

126
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,070
they used to have big programs in public
schools to make sure that children new

127
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:41,060
firearm safety. So my mother school
and other schools benefited from that.

128
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,570
I don't care if it was just that sheet
of paper that told you gun safety before

129
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,404
you went and arrange.

130
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,200
That was just a piece of propaganda
they did that was better for the overall

131
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,570
public.
So I tend to say as Americans,

132
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,700
we've gotten away from
stuff like trades in school.

133
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,910
We've gotten away from different options
beside funneling our kids into college

134
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,360
debt.

135
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,870
And we've also gotten away from basic
training such as balancing a checkbook,

136
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,280
basic home economics.

137
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:04,670
So how do you make a Lasagna at home
by herself and stuff like gun gun,

138
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,810
gun shooting and archery. I think that
if those things return to public school,

139
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,480
you get a safer and more
confident student body.

140
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,150
You get a reduction on things
like bullying and bullshit,

141
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,180
and you get an increase on itself.
Propel interest of children,

142
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,000
and you start to me to grow
at scholars that excel.

143
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,680
But do you do, do you really, how
