JEN PERSON: Hello, I'm Jen
Person for the Developer Show.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.750
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.250
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.540
ARCore, Google's augmented
reality SDK for Android

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.810
is out of preview and
launching its version 1.0.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.700
Developers can now
publish AR apps

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.830
to the Play Store, which
makes it a great time

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.309
to start building.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:23.100
To learn more about
what's in this version,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
as well as details on the
latest updates for Google Lens,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
head on over to the post linked
into the description below.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.759
With Dart 2, we've dramatically
strengthened and streamlined

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.370
the type system,
cleaned up the syntax,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.350
and rebuilt much of
the developer toolchain

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.320
from the ground up to make
mobile and web development more

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.240
enjoyable and productive.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520
Coded instructions on
getting the pre-release

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.920
are on the post.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.650
If you use Compute Engine, you
probably spend a lot of time

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.980
creating, cloning, and
managing VM instances.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.720
Well, it just got easier.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.240
You can now create instances
from existing instance

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.930
templates, create instance
templates based on existing VM

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.050
instances, create
multiple persistent disks

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.410
as part of the virtual machine
instance creation workflow,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.510
protect your VMs from
accidental deletion

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.570
by setting a simple
flag, and more.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.610
Links to the docs
are on the post.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.090
Cloud IoT core is our
fully-managed service

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900
to help securely connect and
manage IoT devices at scale.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.630
With it, you can easily
connect and centrally manage

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.680
millions of globally-dispersed
connected devices.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.850
And it is now
generally available.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.450
More details and links to
get started are on the post.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
According to Google data
from 2016, 53% of visits

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.230
are abandoned if a mobile site
takes more than three seconds

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.600
to load.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.560
At Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
we introduced the Mobile Speed
Scorecard, an easy-to-use tool

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.050
that allows you to
compare your mobile speed

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.880
with other companies.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.710
For examples and a
link to the tool,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.260
please head on over to the post.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.870
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.940
I'm Jen Person for
the Developer Show.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.640
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you next time.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.000
Thanks for watching
the Developer Show.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.822
OK.

00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:08.530
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.240
I think we got it.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
JEN PERSON: There we go.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.504
Cut, print, OK.
