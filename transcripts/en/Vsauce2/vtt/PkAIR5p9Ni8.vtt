00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.430
This autonomous car showcased at the 2013
Guangzhou Auto Show has a built-in fish tank.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.910
And Javier Lloret created an interface called
Puzzle Facade that turned an entire building

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.230
into a giant interactive rubik's cube.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.230
Vsauce!

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.619
Kevin here, this is Mind Blow.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.940
Researchers have discovered that male Koalas
have a specialized sound-producing organ never

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.340
before seen in land-dwelling animal and it
makes the pitch of their mating calls 20 times

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.930
lower than it should be relative to their
size.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.750
(Koala sounds)

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.570
So Yeah.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.790
Swing over the edge of the world at La Casa
del Arbol in Ecuador.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.039
The swingset allows people to feel like they're
flying off into an abyss at 2,660 meters above

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.230
sea level.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.270
It's connected to a seismic monitoring station
that observes an active volcano nearby and

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.420
there's no harness or net or any safety precaution
whatsoever so riders use it at their own risk.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.940
The Zeisel is an off-road wheelchair.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.070
The year round all terrain vehicle is barrier
free and electric and it has the ability to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.509
perform on snow, sand, mud, grass, and stone.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.760
The battery lasts for several hours and it
tops out at 35 km/hour.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.630
Ninja sphere connects all of your devices
in the home and is able to monitor temperature,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.990
lighting, energy use, whether or not your
valuables are moving, and even your pets'

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.990
presence.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.689
The project is open source so that anyone
can contribute with the hopes it will help

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.680
the Ninja sphere cover a wider array of devices
in the future.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.520
New Wave Energy UK is looking to create a
high altitude aerial power plant.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.369
Positioned at 50,000 ft unmanned aerial drones
will harness multiple forms of renewable energy

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.579
where wind patterns are more reliable and
solar energy is stronger.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.360
There's also a smaller probability of weather
interference, so unlike green energy used

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.969
today such as windmills and solar panels,
there won't be downtime where fossil fuels

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.060
are relied upon as a backup.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.090
This is a tiny dwarf seahorse catching a copepod
at lightening speed because their heads are

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.030
perfectly shaped to sneak up on prey.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.590
The Hirose-Tanikawa lab is working on a mirror
that can change people's emotional states

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.000
by reflecting a different image of themselves
back to the user.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.040
By taking a picture of the user's face and
subtly changing the expression to look happier

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.950
or sadder - they found they can change the
emotional state of the person looking into

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.950
the mirror.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.849
And they hope to potentially use this in changing
rooms or department stores to alter your mood

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.630
while shopping or to help people struggling
with depression.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.770
The last camera capable of capturing a single
pulse of light cost half a million dollars

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.960
to create and students at MIT recently created
one for just five hundred dollars.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.330
Using the new time of flight camera you can
see light sweeping over the objects and eventually

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.319
lighting up the back wall.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.090
They hope that in the future this nano photographic
technology can be used for medical imaging,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.659
interactive gaming, and car safety.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.690
Snow2 is a HUD for skiers and snowboarders
and comes equipped with Bluetooth and GPS

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.400
so that you can calculate your speed, keep
track of friends on the mountain, find your

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.310
way around, see the forecast, and view calls
and text messages all in real time.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.600
Finally Void from Tundra is an audiovisual
installation that attempts to visualize the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:45.970
idea of emptiness

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.561
I'm gonna leave you with a comparison of gravity
between Earth and Mars using a rover and a

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.561
banana.

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:54.090
Oh and also, Kevin.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.960
I'm gonna leave them with something.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.090
An illusion.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.879
It's called Anomalous Motion - the image is
actually a still image but your mind think

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.879
it's moving.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.299
I talk about why in my newest video over on
Vsauce.

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.659
But, Kevin.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.030
Seventy five episodes of Mind Blow now?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.590
Have you guys watched them all?

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.360
If you haven't - you probably should.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.280
Yeah, there's a playlist at the top of this
video's description - (and) click that check

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.709
it out.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.000
Well.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:51.630
As always - thanks for watching.
