that morning we had a big party in lab
 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.890
that morning we had a big party in lab
and a lot of reporters came to get

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900
and a lot of reporters came to get
 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.019
and a lot of reporters came to get
comments from people at Harvard um I

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029
comments from people at Harvard um I
 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.850
comments from people at Harvard um I
think that I'm really excited and

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860
think that I'm really excited and
 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.550
think that I'm really excited and
because at high vote however it has a

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560
because at high vote however it has a
 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.250
because at high vote however it has a
lot of private funding and and so it's

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260
lot of private funding and and so it's
 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.890
lot of private funding and and so it's
so some labs that have projects with

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900
so some labs that have projects with
 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.140
so some labs that have projects with
less dependent on federal funding but i

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150
less dependent on federal funding but i
 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.360
less dependent on federal funding but i
think that lots of people in the US

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370
think that lots of people in the US
 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.850
think that lots of people in the US
there's thousands of universities many

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860
there's thousands of universities many
 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.680
there's thousands of universities many
of which have very bright people trying

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690
of which have very bright people trying
 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.160
of which have very bright people trying
to advance stem cell research and that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170
to advance stem cell research and that
 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.709
to advance stem cell research and that
blockading federal money to those

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719
blockading federal money to those
 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.560
blockading federal money to those
laboratories really hurts us a lot

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570
laboratories really hurts us a lot
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.190
laboratories really hurts us a lot
because we can't hope to bring Q's into

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200
because we can't hope to bring Q's into
 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.740
because we can't hope to bring Q's into
market I think by just having pilot

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750
market I think by just having pilot
 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.270
market I think by just having pilot
funding to universities and corporate

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
funding to universities and corporate
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.150
funding to universities and corporate
funding for pharmaceuticals and that i'm

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160
funding for pharmaceuticals and that i'm
 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.130
funding for pharmaceuticals and that i'm
really excited now that our current

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140
really excited now that our current
 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.860
really excited now that our current
president is looking forward to trying

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870
president is looking forward to trying
 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.410
president is looking forward to trying
to jumpstart stem cell research and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420
to jumpstart stem cell research and
 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.749
to jumpstart stem cell research and
biomedical research as a whole and i

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759
biomedical research as a whole and i
 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.950
biomedical research as a whole and i
think that as this money gets spread

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960
think that as this money gets spread
 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.749
think that as this money gets spread
around the country that we will see a

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
around the country that we will see a
 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.160
around the country that we will see a
lot of people from different

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
lot of people from different
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.380
lot of people from different
universities and institutions publishing

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390
universities and institutions publishing
 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.820
universities and institutions publishing
a lot of good work that's really going

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830
a lot of good work that's really going
 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.990
a lot of good work that's really going
to move us forward i'm really excited

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
to move us forward i'm really excited
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.390
to move us forward i'm really excited
that this is going on

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400
 
 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.870
 
I think that while the first FDA trials

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
I think that while the first FDA trials
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.220
I think that while the first FDA trials
clinical trials for stem cells are going

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230
clinical trials for stem cells are going
 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.300
clinical trials for stem cells are going
on now with spinal cord injury that many

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
on now with spinal cord injury that many
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.430
on now with spinal cord injury that many
of my colleagues and friends and I agree

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440
of my colleagues and friends and I agree
 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.080
of my colleagues and friends and I agree
that it will be decades before this

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090
that it will be decades before this
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.480
that it will be decades before this
becomes a more prevalent trend and I

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490
becomes a more prevalent trend and I
 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.080
becomes a more prevalent trend and I
think that looking at the current

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
think that looking at the current
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.520
think that looking at the current
current drugs for pharmaceutical

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530
current drugs for pharmaceutical
 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.130
current drugs for pharmaceutical
companies it can take maybe on a scale

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
companies it can take maybe on a scale
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.180
companies it can take maybe on a scale
of 10 years and a billion dollars to get

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190
of 10 years and a billion dollars to get
 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.880
of 10 years and a billion dollars to get
a drug all the way to market and so I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
a drug all the way to market and so I
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.460
a drug all the way to market and so I
think that means that for the stem cell

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470
think that means that for the stem cell
 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.200
think that means that for the stem cell
studies are being done it now in mice

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210
studies are being done it now in mice
 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.719
studies are being done it now in mice
that it will take at least at the very

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729
that it will take at least at the very
 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.080
that it will take at least at the very
minimum a decade Oh much more to be able

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
minimum a decade Oh much more to be able
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.300
minimum a decade Oh much more to be able
to get those two humans I think the fact

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310
to get those two humans I think the fact
 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.440
to get those two humans I think the fact
is we're so comfortable with taking

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
is we're so comfortable with taking
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.670
is we're so comfortable with taking
pills or taking shots but when gene

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
pills or taking shots but when gene
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.199
pills or taking shots but when gene
therapy came around no one was too

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
therapy came around no one was too
 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.760
therapy came around no one was too
excited about putting viruses into the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770
excited about putting viruses into the
 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.370
excited about putting viruses into the
body and I think that right now people

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380
body and I think that right now people
 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.590
body and I think that right now people
aren't too thrilled about putting stem

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600
aren't too thrilled about putting stem
 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.780
aren't too thrilled about putting stem
cells with stem cell-derived cells into

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
cells with stem cell-derived cells into
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.650
cells with stem cell-derived cells into
someone's body and I think that it's

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660
someone's body and I think that it's
 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.390
someone's body and I think that it's
really important that we try to take

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
really important that we try to take
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.860
really important that we try to take
this slow and be careful and make sure

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
this slow and be careful and make sure
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.810
this slow and be careful and make sure
that nothing that we does can ultimately

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820
that nothing that we does can ultimately
 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.290
that nothing that we does can ultimately
harm a person that these stem cells

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300
harm a person that these stem cells
 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.000
harm a person that these stem cells
won't hurt anyone and I think it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
won't hurt anyone and I think it
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.630
won't hurt anyone and I think it
definitely will take decades and I guess

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
definitely will take decades and I guess
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640
definitely will take decades and I guess
maybe as my generation gets older we'll

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
maybe as my generation gets older we'll
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.680
maybe as my generation gets older we'll
see some cells come around because

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
see some cells come around because
 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.300
see some cells come around because
there's a big interest in them and lots

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310
there's a big interest in them and lots
 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.020
there's a big interest in them and lots
of people interested but I think that

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030
of people interested but I think that
 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.210
of people interested but I think that
it's something in the new and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
it's something in the new and
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830
it's something in the new and
foreseeable future but not but

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840
foreseeable future but not but
 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.720
foreseeable future but not but
definitely not now and that the future

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
definitely not now and that the future
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.979
definitely not now and that the future
was definitely going to bring a lot and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989
was definitely going to bring a lot and
 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.620
was definitely going to bring a lot and
I'm really excited to see how it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630
 
 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.690
