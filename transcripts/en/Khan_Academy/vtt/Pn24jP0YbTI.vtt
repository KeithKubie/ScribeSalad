00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.076
It's now my honor to introduce our Commencement Day speaker,

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:09.776
the founder of the online education phenomenon

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.614
known as the Khan Academy, Sal Khan.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.958
Sal earned three degrees from MIT,

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.578
a Bachelor's in mathematics, as well as

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:23.150
a Bachelor's and a Master's degree

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.993
in electrical engineering and computer science

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:32.232
rounding out his education with a MBA from Harvard.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:36.533
Sal began his career as a hedge fund analyst.

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.414
Within a few years, however, he discovered

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:44.013
quite by accident what has become his calling.

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:45.980
Through preparing video tutorials

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.149
to help his young cousin learn math,

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.477
he came to understand his own gifts as a teacher

00:00:53.477 --> 00:00:56.846
and a great gift that he can give to the world

00:00:56.846 --> 00:01:00.852
by creating an online library of 1000s of

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:04.663
free bite-size videos that would shed light

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:10.761
on any topic he chose from geometry to the GDP.

00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:14.125
Today, the Khan Academy channel on YouTube

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:17.342
has more than 330,000 subscribers

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:21.915
and has delivered more than 156,000,000 lessons

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.518
and has for millions of students,

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:28.422
replaced bafflement with understanding.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.959
For launching this revolutionary experiment

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.396
in online learning, in the year 2012

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:38.766
Time Magazine named Sal Khan as

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:44.038
one of the 100 most influential people on the planet.

00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:47.274
This is not the first time that Sal has spoken

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:51.759
from the commencement stage here in Killian Court

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.910
because he also served as president of his class.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.657
In 1998, addressing his fellow graduates, Sal said,

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:08.571
"It is no exaggeration to say that we will change the world."

00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:12.731
Having checked this assignment off his to-do list,

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.794
he joins us here today.

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:18.307
Ladies and gentleman, Sal Khan.

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:26.976
[Applause]

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:32.047
Now this is a surreal, a deep honor to be here.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.863
For a whole set of reasons and as was introduced

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.366
obviously MIT has played quite a big role in my own life.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.626
But I think a much deeper role than

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.644
many of you all might appreciate.

00:02:42.644 --> 00:02:44.498
Some of you might remember the late nineties,

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:47.673
kind of when the first internet boom was happening,

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:52.199
there was a lot of talk about online education and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.944
most of the conversation back then about online education

00:02:54.944 --> 00:02:58.278
not too different than now, was around how to profit off it,

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.469
how to make money off it.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.114
Or some institutions were thinking about how to defend against it,

00:03:03.114 --> 00:03:08.529
or at least sit on the sidelines and see how things played out

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.258
Then all of a sudden MIT jumped into the mix in 2001,

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:14.027
and announced MIT OpenCourseWare.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.466
That it was going to take knowledge and resources

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:20.762
that used to be behind the walls of elite institutions and

00:03:20.762 --> 00:03:24.226
not charge for them but give them away for free to the world

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:28.557
And instead of saying how can we profit off of this, MIT said

00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:30.934
"Well there are some things that are higher than that."

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:34.740
That if we could empower an unlimited number of people

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.244
for all of time maybe, that is something

00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:39.720
we would be willing to spend resources on.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.857
When that happened I was just a couple years out of college

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:45.491
working at a tech company in San Francisco

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.417
I had no idea that my own career adventure

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.597
would lead to what I am doing now.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.339
But when I read that press release

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.003
I had never been so inspired.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.415
I had never felt so proud to come from this community.

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:02.023
And frankly a couple of years later,

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:04.445
when the videos that I had made for my cousins

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.785
and it became clear that

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:09.918
people who were not my cousins started watching.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:12.553
There was talk of, oh well this could be a business.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:15.155
I was in Silicon Valley, this is what it was all about.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:19.044
I worked for a hedge fund, a very for profit organization.

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.962
But it was the memory of how I felt the first time

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:25.158
I read that press release about OpenCourseWare

00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:28.421
and what it had become, that really gave me the clarity

00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.072
to understand what Khan Academy could be.

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:33.967
That it could be this institution that could reach everyone

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:37.385
and should transcend ideas of profits and businesses.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:38.990
And I say this not just to show

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.987
the connection this had for Khan Academy,

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:43.283
but there is a meta level idea here

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:47.142
that these days you hear a lot of universities and institutions

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:49.798
talk about teaching ethics, teching morality

00:04:49.798 --> 00:04:52.643
and instilling that in classes and

00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:55.963
they tell you to read about it, but MIT actually did it.

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.798
MIT actually lived by its actions.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.676
It actually put principle over profit

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.103
and it is continuing to do it.

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:06.073
Now with MITx now with EdX in concert with Harvard

00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:07.875
it is continuing to push the envelope.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.849
And I am just in awe, it feels like

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.474
we are living in a science fiction book of

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:14.818
what might happen in education in the next few years.

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:18.819
But my connections to MIT go even deeper.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.016
Obviously I went here, but my wife also graduated

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:24.558
from MIT class of 2001.

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:27.194
The president of Khan Academy and chief operating officer,

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:31.002
he was my roommate freshman year at Next House.

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:33.696
Room 343 for the two or three of you

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:36.136
who might have shared that room at some point.

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:39.206
One of our board members went to MIT

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:41.275
and his wife went to MIT.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.611
I am just starting. That is just a small sample

00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:45.812
of all of the people we know at MIT.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.280
But maybe even more surprisingly

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.583
the fact that of the people we know from MIT now

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:55.441
90% of them are married to each other

00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:58.725
and any time you have this type of love

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.961
come from one place

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.363
I think one should introspect

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.482
as romantic as the infinite corridor may be

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:10.170
I have seen such extreme coupling here that

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.273
I have often suspected that this whole place might just be

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:21.640
a front for some type of DARPA funded breeding project.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.585
Someone knows what is going on up here.

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:27.659
There are simpler explanations,

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.890
and I think the most obvious one

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.725
or at least the most clear to me

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.464
is that the admissions office here

00:06:33.464 --> 00:06:35.829
at both the undergraduate and graduate level

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.398
seems to have a somewhat unhealthy bias

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.369
for only admitting extremely attractive people.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.280
You're welcome.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.299
I thought that would go over well.

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:52.946
I think it goes even deeper than that.

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.648
As long as I can remember,

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:56.336
to any one who would listen to me,

00:06:56.336 --> 00:06:57.961
I have told people that MIT is

00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:02.280
the closest thing on this planet Earth to Hogwarts,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.388
to Harry Potter's wizarding school.

00:07:06.388 --> 00:07:10.149
That the ideas and the research and the science that

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.232
percolates behind these walls,

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.334
that's the closest thing to magic in the real world,

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.214
and frankly to people outside of this campus

00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:20.797
looks like magic. The faculty we have here,

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:24.075
these are the leading wizards of out time!

00:07:24.075 --> 00:07:31.618
The Dumbledore's and Mcgonagall's

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.395
and I guess president Hawkfield

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:36.932
you would be a Mcgonagall.

00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:42.084
The halls here they have secret passages and tunnels

00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:44.900
and around every corner there are strange and bizzare

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.466
magical objects and creatures,

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:51.952
some of whom may finish their thesis this decade.

00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:55.548
Maybe a few in the audience.

00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:57.810
When we're in Killian Court, it is almost a shrine.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.128
When you look at the names around us, you see

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:05.624
Newton and Darwin and Galileo and Archimedes

00:08:05.624 --> 00:08:08.457
and these are the great wizards of history.

00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:09.850
And they remind us that

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.238
we have inherited an ancient tradition, an ancient art,

00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:16.427
one that for much of history and even today to some degree

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:19.132
has always been sometimes vilified or suppressed

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.715
by forces of ignorance, but despite that,

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:23.536
has always shone through and has been

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:27.774
at least in my mind the prime cause of human advancement.

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:30.530
The people who come here, the students who come here

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.079
you!

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:36.018
There are these young people from all over the world

00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:37.751
who are all off the charts in some special way

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:39.953
for this kind of magic that goes on here.

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.756
Some come from affluent rich educated families.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.401
Some of you come from poor families

00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:46.193
where you are the first to get a college degree.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.360
Some come from environments

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.830
where their gifts were really celebrated.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.632
Some come from environments where most of their lives

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.245
they have had to hide their passions, their gifts

00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:57.237
for fear of looking different.

00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:01.110
But they come here suspecting that this might be a place

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.810
where they can spread their wings,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.322
where they can explore the world.

00:09:05.322 --> 00:09:07.647
They can finally look with clarity at

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.107
the mysteries of the universe,

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:11.290
the magic of everything that surrounds us

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.819
and MIT delivers on that.

00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:16.790
It opens our minds to what is possible

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.765
and even more uniquely it pushes us,

00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:24.064
and I do believe that MIT pushes us harder than

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.734
probably any other institution in the world.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.598
But when you do that you take them to another level

00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:33.373
you take them to truly recognize what they are capable of

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:35.075
and I think there is another side affect going to why

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.711
there is so much love here.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.713
When you have people regardless of

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.290
what they look like superficially,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.358
or where they come from,

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:44.918
or what type of background they come from,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.720
but they all have that same core desire

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.117
to understand the universe.

00:09:48.117 --> 00:09:49.789
They all have that same core desire

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.491
to push humanity forward.

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:53.663
And you bring them all together into a community like this

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:55.328
and then you push them

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.164
in a frankly very intense environment

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:58.899
you cry together, you laugh together,

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.600
you procrastinate together,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.744
you have sleepless nights together,

00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:06.306
you wander the halls together.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.476
It creates the deepest possible bond.

00:10:09.476 --> 00:10:12.112
It is like people who have fought in wars together.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.750
They have a shared experience that

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.418
other people might not understand or even comprehend,

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:21.159
and because of that, the rest of your life

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:25.058
you will feel connected to other MIT people.

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.290
You will want to be around them,

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.814
and you will seek them out

00:10:28.814 --> 00:10:31.631
and if you are in kind of a mixed group of people

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.867
and you hear someone who is not from MIT

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.869
start talking about how impossible something is,

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:39.301
how hard something is, or how difficult something is,

00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:41.308
you will seek out the other MIT person in the room

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:45.749
and catch a glance and you will both share a little smirk.

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:48.215
And while you are doing that smirk,

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:51.184
if they are your preferred gender,

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:55.463
you might see a certain twinkle in their eye

00:10:55.463 --> 00:11:00.512
and realize that you are irresistibly attracted to them.

00:11:00.512 --> 00:11:04.197
So coming here it really does feel like I have come to a family,

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.298
a family that I am deeply connected to and,

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.295
a family that I truly love.

00:11:08.295 --> 00:11:13.393
I hope to just give you some appreciation for the potential

00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:15.208
that you guys are about to leave with.

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.978
And when I said that 14 years ago at my commencement

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:21.229
it was kind of an idea on paper. But now I have seen what

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:23.969
my peers in my class and above/below me have done.

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:27.312
And it has really been nothing short of amazing.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:31.101
And with that I want to give you a sense of

00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:32.932
internal strength and happiness

00:11:32.932 --> 00:11:34.327
and not just because I care about you

00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:35.765
and I want you to be a happy person,

00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:37.436
but because I really do believe that

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:38.597
for you to really reach your potential,

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.198
you have to be centered and have a place to go.

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:43.637
When things get a little bit tough

00:11:43.637 --> 00:11:45.639
and you should take all of this with a grain of salt.

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.823
I am not a lot older than most of you.

00:11:48.823 --> 00:11:51.444
View me as your older brother or cousin or whatever

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.864
and what I am about to say.

00:11:53.864 --> 00:11:56.311
These are things that I still try to live by,

00:11:56.311 --> 00:11:57.382
but I don't do.

00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:59.853
I am at least as imperfect as any of you guys.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:01.388
But there are things that when I am able to do

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.057
I have found work quite well.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:07.494
The first is to just be as incredibly and

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.269
maybe delusionally positive as possible.

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:12.777
It is a very cynical place out there sometimes.

00:12:12.777 --> 00:12:15.235
And that cynicism will eat at your energy

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.271
and will eat at your potential. To fight it,

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:21.363
you should smile with every atom in your body.

00:12:21.363 --> 00:12:23.476
You should smile first thing in the morning.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.875
You should even force yourself.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.175
This is something I acutally do:

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:28.683
If I am in a bad mood, I actually force a smile.

00:12:28.683 --> 00:12:31.516
It releases things in your brain.

00:12:31.516 --> 00:12:34.791
You should smile with your mouth,

00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:37.023
your eyes, your face, your body and

00:12:37.023 --> 00:12:40.760
evey living and non living thing that you see.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.495
You should recognize that

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.542
the grass is greener on your side of the fence

00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:46.599
and even in the 1% chance that it is not.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.969
Just convincing yourself that it is greener

00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:52.027
will be a self fulfilling prophecy.

00:12:52.027 --> 00:12:56.476
If you find yourself in your life in an argument

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:58.745
with someone whom you respect,

00:12:58.745 --> 00:13:01.201
whom you care deeply about,

00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:04.143
that is a time, and it is not an easy thing to do,

00:13:04.143 --> 00:13:08.319
but try to surrender your ego to the shared identity of

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:11.558
the relationship that you have with that person.

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:13.760
If possible, do the exact opposite of

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.197
what your pride and ego tell you in the heat of a battle.

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:21.034
If you have the strength to do it,

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:24.550
right when you are about to try to get the last word

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.540
and you are about to say that kind of vindictive

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.944
or below the belt thing, just pause, don't do anything

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:35.749
and try to just give them a super-mega-hug.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:39.759
Recognize that material loss or gain, we'll all have it.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:41.997
But when it happens, be upset a little bit

00:13:41.997 --> 00:13:44.057
or be happy a little bit but keep it all in perspective.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:48.165
They are all silly relative to the things that matter,

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:50.296
your health, and your relationships.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:52.032
As much as possible try to make people feel that

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:55.535
you are listening to them. And I have a secret here.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.404
The best way to make people feel that

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:02.770
you are listening to them, is to listen to them.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.442
When you are stressed and

00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:06.780
there will be times of stress in your life,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.637
just look up at the night sky and imagine

00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:12.828
the scale of the universe, the age of the universe,

00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:14.554
the distance to the next star,

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:18.560
the other sentient creatures on other M-class planets,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.027
who are also looking at the night sky,

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.855
and think about that shared experience

00:14:22.855 --> 00:14:24.388
the civilizations that have come by,

00:14:24.388 --> 00:14:27.499
it will put your problems into a little bit of perspective.

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.202
If you can take a walk through the woods,

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:32.422
forget your name, your identity, your ambitions,

00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:33.873
and just for a little bit, for a moment

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:34.741
realize what you are.

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:36.342
Just another animal walking through the wood,

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.577
just another mammal.

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:40.713
Recognize that you are not quite sure why you are here,

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:43.817
but you enjoy the ride and you love the mystery of everything

00:14:43.817 --> 00:14:45.588
that surrounds you, and you want to explore it more.

00:14:45.588 --> 00:14:47.260
As much as possible

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.755
and this is something that is difficult and

00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.723
not something that I do anywhere near perfectly

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:55.456
but I try, is try to build true empathy for everyone.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.337
And a thought experiment that I often do

00:14:57.337 --> 00:14:59.009
to get me into that frame of mind,

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:00.681
and it is just a though experiment

00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:02.735
regardless of your actual spiritual beliefs.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:06.473
Imagine that time isn't a one way street.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:09.109
That you can go back and etc. etc.

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:12.278
In your next life you could be reincarnated

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.844
you could go back in time and be reincarnated as anyone.

00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:18.988
You literally, because of that, could be everybody in this room.

00:15:18.988 --> 00:15:21.754
And with that mental framework in place,

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:25.277
imagine that in your next life you could be that person

00:15:25.277 --> 00:15:27.477
you could go back in time and be that person that

00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:29.799
you are having the conversation with right now.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:31.935
Maybe that you are arguing with right now or maybe

00:15:31.935 --> 00:15:34.768
the person that you are passing judgement on right now.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.275
And if that is the case, then in your next life

00:15:37.275 --> 00:15:38.771
you will have to put up with

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:42.976
the current self righteous version of yourself.

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:45.478
So I want to just bring it all together

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:49.559
with another thought experiment that I like to do,

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:53.019
that helps me focus where I want to put my energies.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:58.941
Imagine yourself in 50 years. You are in your early 70's.

00:15:58.941 --> 00:16:03.373
You are near the end of your career.

00:16:03.373 --> 00:16:05.441
Hey! Oh! Oh! Very good! [Laughter]

00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:07.200
We have a few models here

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.410
if you have trouble visualizing that.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.472
But imagine at that stage you are on your couch in 2062

00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:17.516
and you have just finished watching

00:16:17.516 --> 00:16:22.953
the state of the union holograph by president Kardashian

00:16:22.953 --> 00:16:25.712
and you start to reflect on your life.

00:16:25.712 --> 00:16:28.452
You start to think of all the success you have had

00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:30.938
all the career sucesses, family sucesses,

00:16:30.938 --> 00:16:32.458
the great memories that you have had.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.927
But then you also start to think about the things

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:36.533
you wish you did just a little bit different.

00:16:36.533 --> 00:16:40.201
Your regrets, and I can imagine what they might be.

00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:42.709
You'll wish you spent more time with your children.

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:45.238
You'll wish you had told your spouse

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:47.051
that you loved them more frequently.

00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:48.607
You'll wish that you had spend more time and

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.543
told your parents how much you appreciated them,

00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:52.812
before they passed away.

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:56.571
And just while that is happening, a genie appears.

00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.313
And the genie says,

00:16:58.313 --> 00:17:00.520
"Well I have been listening in to your regrets."

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.214
"You seem like a good person."

00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:05.792
"I am willing to give you a 2nd chance, If you are open to it."

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:07.660
And so you say "sure".

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.330
And the genie snaps his fingers and you blink your eyes

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.570
and when you open your eyes you find yourself right there

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:16.668
right where you are right now June 8th 2012, in Killian Court.

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:19.439
Some crazy guy is giving a commencement speech.

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.836
And you say, Oh my God,

00:17:20.836 --> 00:17:25.295
I am in my 20-something fit and pain free body again,

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:29.299
I am around my peers again.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.451
The genie was serious. I have a second chance.

00:17:31.451 --> 00:17:33.213
I can have all the successes,

00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:36.394
all of the adventures I had the first time around,

00:17:36.394 --> 00:17:38.391
but now I can optimize things.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.659
Now when I see my classmates and

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:41.327
I give them that hug at commencement,

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:43.197
I can hug them a little bit harder.

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:45.398
I can show them how much I care about them.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.400
Now that my parents are back,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.836
I can finally tell them how much I appreciate them.

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:52.973
I can finally give them more hugs, more time.

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:54.087
I can do everything that

00:17:54.087 --> 00:17:56.876
I can laugh more, I can sing more, I can dance more.

00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:58.511
I can be more of a source of positivity

00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:01.518
for people around me and empower more people.

00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:03.507
And so here I am

00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:06.986
truly honored to be your commencement speaker.

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:09.900
Just in awe of the potential that is here,

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.325
the potential in this time that we are in,

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:15.461
a time when the revolutions, the positive revolutions,

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:18.728
are not going to be caused by generals and politicians.

00:18:18.728 --> 00:18:20.733
They are going to be caused by innovators like you

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:24.370
and in this time to see you the wizards of tomorrow.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.272
I am just excited by what

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.340
you are going to do with your second pass.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.212
Thank You.

00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:41.329
[Applause]
