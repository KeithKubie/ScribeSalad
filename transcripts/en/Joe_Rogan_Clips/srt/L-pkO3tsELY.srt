1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,600
You don't want, Frank Mir broke his
arm and he tried to keep fighting. Yes.

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,630
You too. Right? Yeah.
Yeah. I remember that.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,140
Cause I remember the crowd was
booing like woo. I was like, guys,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,470
you need to look at this. Yeah, no
that's a, that's a, that's, let me,

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,650
I will tell you about that because that
was a fun story cause like they um,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,511
I hadn't really,

7
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,500
there was one of the first times I think
they trusted me with a championship and

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,970
uh, he, he, you know, the arm
broke. I heard it, I saw it. And uh,

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,890
I remember, you know, I learned a lot.

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,320
I learned a lot about my
job right then because I,

11
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,070
what I did is I backed off and I let
the doctor come in and examine him.

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,710
Cause like, you know, sometimes
when you're dealing with an expert,

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,380
you don't want to cloud the way
you're supposed to get out of the way.

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,960
Like you don't go to the mechanic
and tell them what to do. So I had,

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,000
my mind was thinking like
that about the doctor.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,510
And so of course he comes in and she
doesn't know what she's, what she saw.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,300
So he missed guides her and says,
I think he's worried about this.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,320
And then she's like, hey, no, nothing's
wrong. And I was like, aw man.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,910
In my mind I was thinking is it was,

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,970
it's been great being here but I'm
not going to be doing this anymore.

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,560
You know what I mean?
And then beautiful.

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,930
He made that switch already in
your it. I swear. I was like,

23
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,950
in my mind I was thinking that I was
thinking about how to get out of there and

24
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:12,630
when they start throwing stuff,
oh you know the military camp from,

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,530
if you remember, they were over there
wrestling with the Samoan security guards,

26
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,450
tried to get in there and just going
crazy and people are screaming.

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,640
That's another, there's
other, there's other breakout.

28
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,470
It was an awful one. Yeah. So that, I was
thinking about that and then uh, you know,

29
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,390
but then you found it,
you saved me.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,990
Like I was thinking that my retribution
was going to be like some kid on the

31
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,510
Internet two weeks later.
Like I found out his arm was broken,

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
but you found the spot. And so then that
was watching the replay and I was like,

33
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,660
let's take a look at this. Hold on, hold
on. What's that on his arm? I'm like,

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,450
that's a broken arm. I got bomb is broken.
Look at that. Watch it one more time. Oh,

35
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,620
and I had the truck roll up on,
then I went into the octagon and I,

36
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:55,410
I remember saying immediately like, you
guys need to watch this. Like, here we go.

37
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,230
Let's play this. Here we
go. That's a broken arm.

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,090
So I'm gonna thank you for
that right there. Cause I,

39
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,680
my career path would've been different.

40
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,990
Well that was one of those things
where I felt an obligation to not just

41
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:10,980
interview the fighter, but to explain to
the entire crowd. Like, you gotta listen,

42
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,270
this is a no, it looked crazy. Look
crazy to me too. This is a broken arm.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,240
Like this guy's fucked right
now. Three places. And Tim,

44
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,850
thank you afterwards for saving
his career because he said,

45
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,270
if you didn't stop that fight and that
became a compound fracture. Fuck man.

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,510
Horrible things happen when the
bone breaks through the skin. Yeah.

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,960
I saw it happened. I saw him
afterwards and I said, man,

48
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,110
did you know your arm was
broken? And he told me, he
goes, yeah, I know. What was it?

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
What was your plan?
Where are you trying to continue?

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,640
So I knew I had a minute before.

51
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:43,470
The pain really becomes crippling
here is and watch this part, right?

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,880
Snap right there.

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,740
I mean that is 100% a double double break.
Yeah.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,120
Both parts of the both bones of the
forum snapped in half and it's an unusual

55
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,090
break because of where it is.
Yeah.

56
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:01,060
It just shows you how fucking strong
frank arm bars and how long the MD is.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,700
Oh, it was also weird as hell.
His arm went back into place.

58
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,950
How young and muscular
I talked to the doctor.

59
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,690
They say that happens
sometimes with athletes.

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,240
The muscles just put it
right back. Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,430
Well he had a plate put in there forever.
It's still in there. Look at me young.

62
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,750
We're fresh face. Joe Rogan,
man, that was young. Frank looks,

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,520
it's crazy. He looks so lean and young,
and he's a big old giant dude. Now.
