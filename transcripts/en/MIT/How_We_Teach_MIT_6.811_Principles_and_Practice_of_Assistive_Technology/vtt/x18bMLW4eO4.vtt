00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:28.461
PROFESSOR: Well
welcome everybody.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.790
I think most of the people
here in this class--

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.140
the presentations in this hour
are teams Kate, Don, and Chris.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.924
So team Don, in
particular, if you

00:00:38.924 --> 00:00:41.410
want to make sure you're
cued up and ready to go,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.230
that would be great.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.800
The presentations are
nine minutes in length.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.350
We will have a hard
stop at nine minutes.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.200
I have some signs
that we'll show,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.918
and why don't we get to it.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:58.550
We have three
presentations in this hour.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.024
We should introduce the
panelists quickly as well.

00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:04.190
Julie, do you want to start?

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.178
And then maybe Rob as well.

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:08.162
A quick introduction,
that'd be great.

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:09.154
JULIE GREENBERG: Sure.

00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:10.642
I'm Julie Greenberg.

00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:13.618
I work for MIT through
the Institute of Medical

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:16.346
Engineering and Science and the
Programming, Health Sciences

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:17.090
and Technology.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.074
And I'm excited to see
these presentations.

00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:20.562
ROB MILLER: I'm Rob Miller.

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:22.794
I'm a professor of
computer science here,

00:01:22.794 --> 00:01:24.939
and I'm one of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.522
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:27.010
Team Kate, take it away.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:32.850
PHILLIP ABEL: Hello everyone.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160
We are Team Kate.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.810
My name is Philip Abel.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.590
And with me here is
Raquel, Jenny, and Dhruv.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.890
Today we're going to talk
about the project we worked

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.490
on all semester, particularly
on the different prototypes

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.970
that we created for different
cochlear implants [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.880
that we created over the
course of the semester.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.190
The design process
that we went through,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.040
the experiments that we
ran, and the results we got,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.110
and what we learnt
from the process.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.240
So let's talk
about client, Kate.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.789
Kate works at a Cambridge
Disability Center,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.470
which means she is particularly
concerned with ensuring

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.020
that homeowners in
the Cambridge area

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.880
follow the guidelines
that ensure that people

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.510
with special needs can access
buildings, in the Cambridge

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.810
area specifically.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.920
So that's just an example of
one of the things she does.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.980
And in addition to that, she
has a profound hearing loss

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.790
and wears cochlear implants.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.480
There are two main
problems with this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.680
that Kate wants-- at the
beginning of the semester, two

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.650
main problems that Kate
wanted us to address

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.850
were the issue that her
cochlear implants weren't

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.520
water-resistant, and
then, in addition to that,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.180
the implants-- she wasn't
able to properly distinguish

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.780
between noise from behind her
or when someone was speaking

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.860
in front of her whenever she
was in a noisy settings--

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.900
in a noisy setting, sorry.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.380
So it was this problem
that we decided to tackle.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.810
And for this, we came
up with a HAAT context,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.260
which was to create cochlear
implants attachments

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.900
that provide water-resistance
and then also enable

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.080
sound blocking.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.070
So the idea of having
water-resistance

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.020
was to have something that would
help Kate be able to go out

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.430
whenever-- let's say in seasons
when it rains more often,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.060
she would be able
to go out and not

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.220
have to worry about whether her
implants are going to get wet

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.020
or not.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.390
And then in addition
to that, we decided--

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.530
we also thought
about making covers

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.510
that would enable her to
hear more clearly whenever

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.130
she is in a noisy sitting.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.412
In particular, she would
be able to distinguish

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.370
between the sound that's
coming in front of her

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.370
from the one behind her.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.610
Then, in addition to
that, we didn't really

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.190
tackle the problem
of attachment,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.170
but it was just one
main idea that we

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.610
tried to integrate into
all the different covers

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.570
that we made, to ensure that
whenever she attached it

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.250
on her ear, it's
wouldn't fall off.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.230
So over the course
of the semester,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.570
we brainstormed
different prototypes.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.890
At first, we began
with this idea

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.680
of creating one
compact cover that

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.240
would have all the
functionality she wanted.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.790
For example, a cover that would
be water-resistant in addition

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.490
to blocking sound.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.450
But when we spoke with Kate
during the iterative design

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.470
process, Kate told us she would
want a more modular design.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.500
So we decided to go
with a modular approach.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.852
So Raquel will take
it over from here.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.080
RAQUEL: OK, so I'm
going to talk now

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.180
about the process of
creating our prototypes.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.740
So here you see version
one of our prototype.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.280
So what we used
originally was just plain

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.130
Instamorph, which
is plastic pellets

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.350
that you can melt down and
form into solid plastic.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.900
So if you see in
the top left here,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.980
those were our original
ideas for the rain cover.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.160
So something to cover the
ear piece of the cochlear

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.940
implant, and then something
to cover the coil piece, which

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.270
is the flat, disk-like piece.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.410
And then on the right
here were our ideas

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.230
for the sound
blocking attachments.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.090
So we had this idea
to just slip something

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.585
onto the implant itself.

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:21.960
If you look at
the picture above,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.400
the microphone is
actually located right

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.490
on the very top of that curve.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.180
So that's why we're creating
these pieces-- to basically

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.650
fit right there
on the top, where

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.050
the microphone is located.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.830
We also dabbled a
little bit in trying

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.680
to create some things out
of silicone and clear resin

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.259
and didn't have much
success on that,

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:42.550
but it was part of the process.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.440
So these are v2 prototypes.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.560
So we started to try
and think about how

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.920
we can make these more
aesthetically pleasing.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.020
We tried to start incorporating
color into the Instamorph,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.470
incorporating a little hood
for the cord that comes out

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.460
of the implant and
also incorporating

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.440
a back layer to the rain cover.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.090
So here you see a plastic sheet
to provide water resistance

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.990
on the back side of
the cover as well.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.747
And then here is
the next version

00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:17.330
of the sound-blocking
prototype, which

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.246
we made of Sugru, which
we found we could just

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.130
make look a lot nicer and
smoother than with Instamorph.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.410
So then onto our
final prototypes--

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.170
it's kind of the next round.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.370
So on the left is a new
version of the sound-blocking

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.530
with Sugru, but with
a lot less Sugru,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.889
so it's a lot less heavier.

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.430
And then we incorporated
Dycem, which

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.401
is a material that
provides grip,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.525
because we were having an
issue with it falling off

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.130
of the implant.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.600
The middle part
is the coil cover.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.640
So we did end up using black
Instamorph with the back cover.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.080
I'll just say really
quickly, and then a vinyl

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.810
cover for the water cover.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.470
Final prototypes two-- so we
are moving forward with the ear

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.870
cover, with 3D printing.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.500
So these are our
first prints of that.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.864
And we're working with
Danger!Awesome to make these

00:07:08.864 --> 00:07:10.780
look a little nicer and
continue on with that.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.030
DHRUV: So in order to determine
the [INAUDIBLE] prototype,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.235
we performed two
sets of experiments.

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:25.990
So one is the
sound-blocking experiment,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.340
and the other was the
water-resistance task.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.720
So in the sound-blocking
experiment,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.890
we actually divided
it into two parts.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.920
One was the
quantitative estimation,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.910
where we wanted to quantify
how well our cover actually

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.650
blocked sound from behind and
enhanced sound from the front.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.890
The other was the
qualitative analysis.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.280
And we wanted to [? value if ?]
the cover actually

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.590
caused increased
comprehension for Kate or not.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.680
And the other type was
the water resistant touch.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.310
And the goal was to
restrict the amount of water

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.810
that goes into the implant.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.360
So the sound-blocking
experiment,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.010
we asked Kate to touch in the
center of the [INAUDIBLE] table

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.430
in one of the quiet classrooms
of the [INAUDIBLE] department.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.150
We placed the laptop at
various angles around Kate,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.760
and placed at different
frequencies and intensities.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.860
For each angle, and
for each intensity,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.350
we wanted to determine the
minimal threshold at which Kate

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.549
is able to hear the sound.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.740
This experiment was performed
both with and without

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.530
the cover.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.000
On the right, you can
see the comparison

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.260
of the result for both with
and without the cover--

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.290
had a frequency of 1000Hz.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.480
As you can see, the
listening of [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.680
and in the field
of view of Kate,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.307
and with the [? anterior ?]
views behind Kate.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.570
JENNY: For the water resistance
testing, we did two tests.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.580
One was this water bead
test where we put water

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.265
on top of the cover to just
measure whether the cover was

00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:21.010
actually waterproof or not, and
we put the implant, and then

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.650
a paper towel, and
then the cover on top

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.390
and let the water sit for both
10 seconds and then 10 minutes

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.090
and then checked to see if there
was any wetness underneath that

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.810
seeped onto the paper towel.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.480
There ended up not being any
witness on the water bead test

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.590
and-- for the water bead
test and the rain test.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.030
And the rain test was
just another one where

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.550
it is a little more realistic.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.180
We placed the implant
on a vertical surface

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.640
with the coil cover as well
and then splashed water on it

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.940
as if it were
raining, and we also

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.780
found that there was
no wetness either.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.100
So for the subjective
results-- this

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.460
is, I guess, another term
for Kate's feedback--

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.460
she provided very good
feedback from the beginning.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.650
She was really involved
with our design process,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.530
and these are a couple quotes
that we pulled from the most

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.720
recent feedback she gave us
on the sound blocking covers,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.030
and we actually tested them out
at a restaurant-- using them

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.570
at a restaurant in
a noisy environment,

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.880
just to find a realistic
setting and found

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.801
that the designs worked well.

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.426
PROFESSOR: In another
30 seconds or so,

00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:38.800
you should probably wrap up.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.310
JENNY: That's perfect, because
this is the last slide.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.270
So a few things we
learned-- our project was

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.630
kind of this
assistive technology

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.420
that we were augmenting onto
Kate's assistive technology,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.650
her cochlear implants.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:57.410
And that was interesting for
us to learn that-- of course,

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.740
assistive technology is
supposed to help someone

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.240
with their disability, but
it's, of course, not perfect,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.270
and we had to patch it to
make it even better and more

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.490
useful for Kate.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.810
Throughout the design process
we explored a lot of options,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.510
and we felt that
we could have gone

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.870
through this process faster
finding that ends quicker

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.840
so that we could have moved
on and created more prototypes

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.212
and gone even further
in our project.

00:11:25.212 --> 00:11:25.920
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.890
Thanks very much.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.095
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.590
We will get questions
from the panelists first.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.600
Rob, Julie?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.850
ROB MILLER: Sure, I can start.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.798
So how many of these prototypes
showed a whole range of things?

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:44.154
Which of those actually
made it into Kate's ears?

00:11:44.154 --> 00:11:46.574
JENNY: [INAUDIBLE] step back.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.055
This prototype, the
3D printed piece,

00:11:56.055 --> 00:11:57.930
is something we're
actually going to go with.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.670
And all of them made
it onto Kate's ears.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.740
She wore them all at
some point, but this

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.900
is the final, final one.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.200
And then the coil that you see
in the middle-- this one here

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.140
is made out of Instamorph,
and we decided not to 3D-print

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.760
that, because this is already
of pretty good quality--

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.439
or of quality good
enough that we wanted

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:22.730
to use for our final prototype.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.470
So this is also going
to be used as well.

00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:29.905
JULIE GREENBERG: Could
you go to the slide

00:12:29.905 --> 00:12:31.250
that shows the sound testing?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.750
JENNY: Yeah.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.790
JULIE GREENBERG: And could
you-- [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:47.870
So your results show
that it was enhanced

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.270
a little bit-- the sounds
coming from the front.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.380
And it was mostly suppression
of sounds coming from the rear?

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:53.880
JENNY: Yes.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.105
JULIE GREENBERG:
And that was all

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:59.301
tested with the 1000Hz tone?

00:12:59.301 --> 00:12:59.800
JENNY: Yeah.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.370
JULIE GREENBERG: Or were
there multiple frequencies?

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.310
PHILLIP ABEL: There were
multiple frequencies

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.432
at which we tested.

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.390
JULIE GREENBERG: Becasue
these are the results?

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.590
PHILLIP ABEL: So these are the
results that we got from that.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.240
I think Dhruv was
the one in charge

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.010
of the sound
directionality test.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.320
DHRUV: So actually it was
tested at different frequencies.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.560
Like the normal frequencies
for getting an audiogram, which

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.740
is [INAUDIBLE] from
250Hz, then it's goes up

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.230
to eight kilohertz.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.100
But the results that
we have accumulated

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.450
are just for one frequency,
which is like one kilohertz,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.570
but in the final report
that we're [INAUDIBLE],

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.320
we will mention about
all the differences,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.360
with all the tables and do that.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.700
So just to give an idea of how
the tech performed we actually

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.518
mentioned only one kind of
frequency in the presentation.

00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:49.351
JULIE GREENBERG: OK.

00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:49.940
Thank you.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.816
I wanted to understand this, but
now I want to ask the addition.

00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:58.130
So at the beginning
you mentioned--

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.740
so I wanted to see
if you could clarify

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.570
both what the goals
were in terms of--

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.860
was it about distinguishing
sounds front and back,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.359
or was it suppressing
some and enhancing others?

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:10.900
DHRUV: Could you
repeat the question?

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.610
I'm sorry, I'm
having hearing loss.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.520
Could you repeat the question?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.400
JULIE GREENBERG: Was
the goal of the design

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.725
distinguish where the sound
the sound was coming from,

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:26.579
or to help her hear some
sounds and not others depending

00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:27.740
on the direction?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.080
DHRUV: I would say no to both.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.860
It was more about
blocking sound from behind

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.620
and enhancing sound from front.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.140
So [INAUDIBLE] just about
analyzing the 2D space

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.225
around Kate so that they could
block the background noise

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:46.500
and actually
understand that it's

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.780
coming from the
conversation in the front.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.846
JULIE GREENBERG: So you
were using direction

00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:54.410
to define what was desirable
and what was undesirable.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.410
DHRUV: Exactly, exactly.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.520
I mean it was not
very well-defined,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.640
but you could see
the field of view

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.130
that we have catered here, from
the [INAUDIBLE] field of view.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.730
it was about 135
degrees, and we were

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.170
able to argue that
in the field of view

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.180
that is about 135 degrees
for a normal [? woman, ?]

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.010
we were able to enhance sound.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.740
And from the behind, that is,
outside the field of view,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.958
we reduced the sound.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.354
JULIE GREENBERG: So how did that
goal then affect your design?

00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:27.900
Because the other thing
that I was hoping your

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.635
could calrify-- I think this is
a question for the whole team--

00:15:31.635 --> 00:15:36.080
is the fact that
at one point you

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.300
said Kate wanted
modular solutions,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.296
but you attempted
to design something

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:44.129
that would provide both
the water-resistance

00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:46.524
and the sound-blocking
in a single device.

00:15:46.524 --> 00:15:48.440
So how did that
all fit together?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.210
RAQUEL: So what
you said is right.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.390
Our first thought was,
let's make one large cover

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.900
that can provide the
rain protection and also

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.530
some sound-blocking.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.882
But she wanted a more
modular approach, I think,

00:16:04.882 --> 00:16:07.090
because it's not always
raining, and you don't always

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.120
need this large cover.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.180
So she wanted something
smaller that she can just

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.680
put on a little bit
more discreetly.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.680
Like if she's in a
meeting, for example,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.500
and she's really more focused
on the sound directionality,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.000
or she's out with her friends,
and she's really more focused

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.982
on hearing what they're
saying in a noisy environment.

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:24.455
JULIE GREENBERG: Do you
design two different things?

00:16:24.455 --> 00:16:25.580
I guess I'm still confused.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.996
You designed two different
things, and which one of that--

00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:29.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:33.574 --> 00:16:35.490
RAQUEL: So we did design
two different things.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.290
So one is a set of rain covers.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.900
So a cover for
the ear processor,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.370
which is the curved part, and
then a cover for the coil,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.770
that you see on the right here.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.260
And then the left picture
is the separate piece, which

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.647
is the sound-blocking piece.

00:16:49.647 --> 00:16:50.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.396
I think in the interest of
time, we have to move on,

00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:53.580
but thank you team Kate.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.663
I think you've done great
work sort of prototyping

00:16:55.663 --> 00:16:57.410
through this [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.117
All right great, we're
going to do Team Chris next.

00:17:00.117 --> 00:17:01.617
If you can get set
up, that'd great.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.569
CAROLYN: I'm Carolyn, and this
is Phoebe, Durk, and Aarti.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.960
And we are Team Chris.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.849
So some context on our
client-- his activities

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.130
that he wants to do and his
assistive technology-- is

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.349
that Chris is an MBA
student at Boston College,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.190
and he has a genetic condition
called Miyoshi Myopathy.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.520
Miyoshi Myopathy is a late-onset
form of muscular dystrophy.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.269
So when Chris was
about 22, he started

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:30.810
to feel some weakness
in his muscles,

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.140
especially in his legs.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.952
And now he uses
crutches and a scooter,

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.660
depending upon the
distance that he wants

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.706
to go on campus and at home.

00:17:39.706 --> 00:17:41.435
So because he uses
these devices,

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.810
he needs to know a little bit
more about his surroundings

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.570
before he leaves.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.690
He needs to know if his
route is accessible,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.290
and if his destination is
going to be accessible for him.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.162
And right now uses a
few different things

00:17:51.162 --> 00:17:52.120
to help them with that.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.260
He uses Google Maps.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.040
He uses Yelp, and
sometimes he even

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.280
calls ahead to see what the
features of the building

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.729
are before he arrives.

00:17:58.729 --> 00:18:00.270
But what he really
needs is something

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.520
that's more centralized
and more comprehensive

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.150
so he knows exactly what
his route will look like

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.250
and exactly what features
are in the building

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.110
before he leaves his house.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.630
So that's what we tried to do,
is create a central location

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.910
for all of that data, so
that he has one place to go,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.823
and he will know
ahead of time if he's

00:18:16.823 --> 00:18:19.197
going to be able to use the
building the way he wants to.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.430
PHOEBE: So to do that
we made a website

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.650
called Successible
Maps, and we based it

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.600
on Boston College first,
to scope it down a bit.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.870
Our first step was to
make paper prototypes.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.000
So each team member made
pretty much drawings

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.420
of what we thought the
website should look like.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.810
This consisted of either
text or just image-based,

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.550
and we presented
this to Chris, and he

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.900
picked his favorite features
out of each of them,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.010
and we use that feedback
to create our second paper

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.630
prototype.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.470
And here, his feedback was that
he liked the map interface,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.940
and he liked how we had pop-ups
for obstacles such as potholes,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.320
as well as a bigger
pop up on top

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.340
of each buildings for
plans, and in there,

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.690
flags of obstacles
inside the building

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.790
and pictures of different rooms.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.400
Feedback on this
prototype included

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.380
a clear distinction
between the floor plan

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.380
and the text description
we had of each floor,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.450
as well as a summary page
for every building-- that's

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.410
a general overview of
different entrances

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.280
and exits for every building.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.280
Our next prototype--
sets of prototypes

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.750
are the software
prototypes, which

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.030
included our back-end
model of the data,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.380
such as buildings, and
flags, for floor plans,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.320
as well as the front-end of how
the website would look and feel

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.950
for our client.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.480
The feedback for this
was that Chris liked it,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.480
and he wanted to see a couple
more icons such as an elevator

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.280
icon, as well as time stamps
for every flag obstacle,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.380
or obstacle flag,
or things that pop

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.930
up, so that he can keep
track of what is actually

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.760
recent and relevant.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.082
DURK: As far as our
success metrics go,

00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:18.540
we had three main criteria we
were looking at, one of which

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.289
is the number of clicks
it takes to access

00:20:20.289 --> 00:20:24.100
the information, second of
which is how long it actually

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.080
takes to get the information
Chris is interested in.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.620
And finally, the amount
of certainty that he is

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.260
left with after
using the application

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.420
to get all of the information.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.680
To address this, we tried to
design that all into our app.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.330
So I can give a quick
demonstration right now.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:48.040
So we created it-- let's see.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:56.024
So our app ended up-- sorry
about that-- Sorry, just

00:20:56.024 --> 00:20:57.440
a second here, and
I'll pull it up

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.620
to show you exactly what we did.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.660
It is a-- there we go.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.870
Sorry about that.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.730
So we have two different
methods in which

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.070
we went about
presenting information

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.360
that Chris is interested in.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.517
The first of which is we have
various flags that call out

00:21:19.517 --> 00:21:20.600
for different information.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.860
So, for example,
accessible entrances--

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.660
you can click on the
flag, and it tells you

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.490
that, say, this is the only
accessible door to Stokes Hall,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:33.400
and that specific information
about that location

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.530
as it's overlaid on the
Google Maps-- you can see

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.290
what it actually looks like.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.050
We also have things like alerts
at various other locations

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.450
that can call attention to other
types of information that might

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.860
not be seen in other manners.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.340
Finally, on buildings, you can
click on the building itself

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.930
and view the information about
the building and its floor

00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.770
plans.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.440
So you can click on
an individual floor,

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.750
and see the floor plan,
and pieces of information

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.180
about the floor
such as locations

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.530
of accessible
bathrooms, or where

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.950
the elevators are located.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.300
Now Chris stated that as
far as our metrics go,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.720
we succeeded on the metric
of the number of clicks

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.290
as it takes less than
three to get to the desired

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.270
information about the buildings,
and as far as the actual time

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.460
that it takes to
accomplish it, Chris

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.390
said using previous methods,
he would take up to 20 minutes

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.390
to figure out a route
from building to building,

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.140
and with our app he
believes he can do it

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.940
in five to 10 minutes.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.850
So a 50% to 75%
reduction there, which

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.750
we were pretty happy about.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.950
And then he found it
very easy to utilize,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.380
and it was able to find the
relevant information very

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.310
quickly.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.830
He gave us a couple
more pieces of feedback,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.360
which we are going to
continue to incorporate in,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.620
such as adding the
labels onto the buildings

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.400
to say what their names are,
and some images actually

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.880
into the flags and the alerts to
show more specific information.

00:23:22.707 --> 00:23:24.290
AARTI: So a few of
the lessons that we

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.915
learned throughout the semester
while working on this project--

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:31.860
so specifically for Chris--
for his specific problem,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.920
we learned that things that
are labeled as accessible

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.450
don't necessarily mean
they're accessible to him.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.305
So, in general,
what he wanted us

00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:42.040
to do for the semester was
gather the specific facts

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.930
that he can use and figure out
for himself if the facility is

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.705
accessible for him,
because he didn't want

00:23:47.705 --> 00:23:49.080
to trust other
people's opinions,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.960
because it's not necessarily
true for him specifically.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.080
And so other lessons we
learned, which were overall

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.110
assistive technology-specific
or just design-specific

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.060
where that you really need to
get to your client really well.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.400
So you have to get
to know their needs,

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.550
their specific wants, and
don't go in with assumptions.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.670
So we went in with
a few, but they

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.140
were knocked down once we just
had conversations with him.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.610
And also, in general, universal
design is really difficult,

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.950
and you happen to think
really hard about it.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.350
So the product that we
made is specific for Chris,

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.399
but if we want to make
it accessible to people

00:24:24.399 --> 00:24:25.940
with different types
of disabilities,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.170
there's a lot more work
that we have to put into it.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.720
Overall engineering
lessons that we learned

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.170
were one, to continue to use
the iterative design process.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.380
And, for our team specifically,
a huge lesson we learned

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.446
was throughout the
semester we separated tasks

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:42.820
and we were very
modular with it.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.327
So we separated front-end
from back-end entirely.

00:24:45.327 --> 00:24:47.660
But when we wanted to put
them together a few weeks ago,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.550
it became really difficult,
because the front-end people

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.710
didn't know what was
happening in back-end,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.040
back-end didn't know front-end.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.050
And so we learned that
we have to continue

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.020
throughout the semester
to at least update

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.686
each other on what's
going on so that we

00:24:57.686 --> 00:25:01.377
know in general what's happening
in the whole scope of things.

00:25:01.377 --> 00:25:03.210
And so that's what we
learned this semester.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:03.780
Thank you.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.363
Any questions?

00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:05.761
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:05.761 --> 00:25:08.568
PROFESSOR: Thanks very much.

00:25:08.568 --> 00:25:11.196
We can go to the panelists.

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:12.900
ROB MILLER: You said
that Chris thought

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.810
that he would be able to
[INAUDIBLE] four times as

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.750
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.660
Did you actually [INAUDIBLE]
anything on that?

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.060
Did you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.360
DURK: Yeah, so
the reason that we

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.290
said that is that we did model
it after the Boston College

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.620
campus, which he is
already familiar with.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:39.050
So he did actually go through
the process of looking up

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.412
the information,
but I mean-- so he

00:25:43.412 --> 00:25:45.120
thought that he could
do it in that time,

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.240
because that's what it
took him to look it up.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.990
Even though he's already
familiar with it,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.630
it's not really an
unfamiliar place.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.140
We chose to focus
on Boston College

00:25:53.140 --> 00:26:00.310
because it was more directly--
we had the information,

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.990
and we could get a
better idea of what

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.470
it was he wanted, because
he had sort of seen all

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:12.219
of the bad parts and knew
what information he wished he

00:26:12.219 --> 00:26:13.510
would have known at that point.

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:17.740
PROFESSOR: Julie, questions?

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.620
OK.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.550
I have a question just on
the data side of things.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.460
The data that you use
to populate your map--

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.330
did you hand-collect
that, and are there

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.860
certain sources
of data that might

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.430
be useful for the rest of
campus or for other sort

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.690
of structured data
sets that might

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.540
be useful for a
project like yours?

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.160
DURK: So the right now,
we put in all of the data

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.930
that we're using.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.950
But one thing I
didn't actually show

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.570
is that users can input new
information into the app.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.660
So they're able to add
new flags very easily

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.830
as well as new buildings,
new floors onto buildings,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.560
and update that
with information.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.660
So right now it is fully
dependent upon users

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.480
to input the
information, but any user

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.136
can put that information
into the database.

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:04.760
PROFESSOR: Other
questions from mentors

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.126
or from students in the class?

00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:07.626
Anyone?

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.240
OK.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.870
I think your team has really
done some interesting work,

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.985
some very good work on this
campus accessibility question

00:27:17.985 --> 00:27:20.283
or this environmental
accessibility question.

00:27:20.283 --> 00:27:21.110
So well done.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.610
Great.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.151
Thanks a lot.

00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:29.880
[? IAN: Hi, ?] everyone.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.880
My name is [? Ian, ?]
and this is Christina,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.920
and our third member
Jane is not here today.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.400
But our team is Team
Don, and we created

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.580
an app called Your
Friendly Reminder.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.900
Your Friendly Reminder
is a reminder system

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.530
that will send daily
emails to our client Don,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.590
and allow him to see his
list of calendar events

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.170
in the early afternoon
where he typically tends

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.710
to have a cognitive deficit.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.390
So first we'll go through
the background of our client

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.790
and then you in a little bit
about our design process,

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.130
and how we kind of
came to this design,

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.240
and then we'll go through
our final prototype

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.665
and along with our testing
and our reflections.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.320
CHRISTINA: So a little bit
of background about Don--

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.610
he lives independently, but
he's actually very active,

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.740
and he's an advocate for
people with disabilities,

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.340
so he goes out to meetings
all the time to speak at them.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:30.520
And during his childhood
he contracted Polio,

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.070
which affected his left leg.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.400
And back in 2002,
he had a stroke,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.880
and this limited the use of
the left side of his body.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:43.010
And as a result, he has
cognitive difficulties,

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.550
which is what we focused
on for our project

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.240
during the semester.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.150
So about his cognitive
difficulties--

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:54.160
around 2:00 PM every
day, on a typical day,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.210
he would start to have trouble
processing his thoughts,

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:08.060
and it affects how he can
communicate with people.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.380
So one of the things that
we wanted to focus on

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.220
was, since he's a
very busy person,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.760
was to help him remind be
reminded of and encouraged

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.060
to complete his tasks
that he has scheduled

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.930
throughout the day
and also to ensure

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.010
that he acknowledges the
reminders rather than ignoring

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.510
them.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.380
So some of us is
the technologies

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.410
that he currently uses-- he
uses a leg brace to make sure

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.850
that he doesn't
hyper-extend his knee.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.310
He also uses a cane
to help him walk.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.540
He has Velcro on
his shoes, but one

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.200
of the most important pieces
of technology that he relies on

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.560
is his iPhone.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.450
And so he pretty much
stores everything

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.570
on his iPhone,
everything about his day,

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.030
and he keeps notes
on his iPhone.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:02.560
And currently, he enters all
of the events for his day

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.150
into his Yahoo calendar which
then is imported into his iCal,

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.590
and then he accesses
his events from there.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:14.560
And from then, he gets reminders
about when his events are

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.920
and what they are.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.680
So from this, we wanted to
create a reminder system that

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.910
would not only remind him of
his upcoming tasks for the day,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.470
but also encourage him to stay
focused while he's experiencing

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.300
cognitive overload.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.690
And the goals of our project
was to make the reminders more

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.860
gentle and humane so that
he would be encouraged

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.400
to actually look at them.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.240
And reminders that
would help him

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.810
internalize what
the upcoming tasks

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.840
are rather than just dismissing
them, as he does now.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.287
And we also wanted to make
sure that his calendar could

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.870
be backed up, because
that's something

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.370
that is very important to him.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.420
So for our first
prototype, we actually

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.140
thought of making an app and.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.600
So we had and test
out a paper prototype

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.350
of this app where he
could enter in his events,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.760
and it would create
a reminder for him.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.980
And we were thinking
about ways to make

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.330
this more of an interaction
where it would--

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.921
rather than stressing
him out with,

00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:30.170
oh, you have all these events
for the rest of the day;

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.050
it would help him to
calm down and focus.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.020
[? IAN: And ?] so one thing we
figured out about this design

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.820
is that we're basically just
creating a new application that

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.050
already does what iCal does.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.710
And so we went to
our second design,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:49.180
where we used Google scripts to
import his events from Google

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.310
Calendar and use
that information

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.680
to be able to reformat it and
send him an email that will

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.600
show him his list of events.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.780
So you can see here in
our second iteration

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.440
that we were able to
grab his calendar events,

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.720
but it's just in a list form.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.110
So he is PPAT, AAPT,
REMINDER, et cetera.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.815
And these calender events would
be listed in a single list,

00:32:12.815 --> 00:32:15.720
so that Don could simply look
at this email in the afternoon

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.520
and be like, OK, I
have all these events,

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.070
and this is just
one more thing that

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.000
will help me make sure
I complete everything

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.390
successfully and attend all
of the events that I need to.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.120
And so we move from
this to our third,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.710
iteration where we were
able to focus on what it

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.120
would look like in his phone.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.770
And so we wanted our reminders
to be more gentle and more

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:40.330
humane, rather than a little
pop-up from Apple or Siri

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.880
saying, reminder, you have
x event-- snooze, or OK,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.950
or dismiss.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.380
And so with this
Google script, we

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.800
were able to send him a
cute little email that

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.070
not only would that not
only had an image of a cute

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:00.090
puppy, or a kitten, or something
like that, but also had colors,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.450
and it was personalized.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.120
And we found out
later that Don really

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.700
like the idea of having
a personalized email

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.880
just for him.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.850
And so this email-- we called
it your friendly reminder,

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:14.760
and we were able to use
all of the information

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.060
that he already has, but
be able to use it in a way

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.890
to where he looks at
it and he feels good.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.180
And so one of the
problems that we ran into

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.590
is that we really wanted
a response system.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.510
And so we wanted
to send an email.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.890
We wanted him to be able
to look at this email.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:36.857
But how are we going to check
to see if we could do that.

00:33:36.857 --> 00:33:38.690
We didn't really want
to hack into his email

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.140
and check what time he read
it, and so the way that we

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.180
decided to implement this was
to have a response system.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.960
So he would simply
respond muffins

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.670
or whatever keyword we had.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.200
And so you can see right
here, there's a little text,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.310
and it'll be bigger in a second.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.830
To stop these reminders, reply
to this email with the word

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.620
muffins.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.790
And so he would reply to this
email with the word muffins,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.910
and then we would send him
another follow-up email saying,

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.850
thanks for your reply.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.000
We got your message.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.830
And so one thing
we found is that he

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.880
didn't like the continuous
spamming of the emails, which

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.670
I'm sure we can all relate to.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.030
And so we worked through
that, which I'll tell you

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.830
a little bit about in a second.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.530
And so our final
prototype removes

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.760
these constant reminders.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.850
And so there's
just one email that

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.850
will send to him within an
hour if he hasn't responded.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.500
And then we want to still
be able to have this reply

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.409
mechanism so that we
can still make sure

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.840
that he reads the email,
because as annoying as it

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.650
is to keep on
receiving emails, we

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.870
want him to look at this email,
and we want it to be effective.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.159
So here's an example of what
a sequence would look like.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.380
So you'd send him an email
in the early afternoon.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.139
So this one was sent
around to 2:26 PM.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:55.070
And so you can see
his events for today.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.460
And we changed the
keyword to brownie.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.930
And then there's another
cute kitty picture,

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.920
and so we-- in our back-end
we have a rotation of these.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.540
And so you can see that
Don checks his email quite

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.490
frequently, and he
responded within one minute,

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.120
responding the word brownie.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.420
And so we, in response, sent
him one last email saying,

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.510
got your message.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.590
Thanks for replying
and have a great day.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.820
And so this is what our
final prototype looks like.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.020
And so we tested it
on him-- like I said,

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.770
we first tested it
with trying to find

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.370
a balance between sending
him too many emails

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.430
but ensuring that
he checks our email

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.110
and doesn't dismiss it
like his other reminders.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.160
And so he found them
to be kind of annoying.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.040
He I might have even said,
"I find it harassing"."

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.430
So we tried to limit that to
two emails, because we still

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.610
wanted to see what was
the threshold of emails

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.980
we could send before he really
got so annoyed at us that he

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.360
would chuck his
phone at the door.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.100
And so he still
found them annoying,

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.650
but then we tried testing them
with zero follow-up emails,

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.960
and we found that he still liked
the idea of having to respond

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.950
and having someone A.K.A Your
Friendly Reminder follow up

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.260
on him within an hour to
make sure that he checked.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.790
And so, in
conclusion, we've also

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.030
learned that it's challenging
to evaluate a system like this.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.630
How do we each how do we
use our success metrics?

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.310
And how do we use data
points such as the time

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.130
we send emails, the time
he responds to emails,

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.000
and how do we make sure
that this product is

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.230
effective for him?

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.794
And so we found that that
was really difficult to do,

00:36:28.794 --> 00:36:30.460
but I think we were
able to, because one

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.700
of the things he said was "It's
one more step that leads me

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.550
to the end."

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.970
It might be one more
thing that will ultimately

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.480
lead me to the end
of the day where

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.050
I've completed all my tasks,
even though I do have it

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:43.800
in my calendar.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.720
I can look at it myself,
but one more email helps me.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.360
And so a little aside--
after the 10th time,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.490
the puppy gets old.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:56.140
So we start switching the
pictures to different kittens,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.340
and frogs, and little puppies.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.510
So our final prototype
was something

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.770
that we believe will
really help him,

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.090
and that we believe
will really allow

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:11.660
him to have more gentle humane
reminders that will ultimately

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.280
help him with his cognitive
deficit in the early afternoon.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.070
And the next steps were
looking for a work-around.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.840
And we've already
talked about this,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.498
so I will ask for questions.

00:37:28.498 --> 00:37:28.998
Thank you.

00:37:28.998 --> 00:37:31.438
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:32.908 --> 00:37:34.408
PROFESSOR: Questions
from the panel?

00:37:34.408 --> 00:37:36.186
Julie, Rob?

00:37:36.186 --> 00:37:37.894
JULIE GREENBERG: So
I think you're right.

00:37:37.894 --> 00:37:40.882
It is challenging to
evaluate a system like this.

00:37:40.882 --> 00:37:43.405
But if you had a lot more
time and resources, what would

00:37:43.405 --> 00:37:45.250
a more rigorous
evaluation look like?

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.300
So currently, we have a
Google doc in the back-end

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.090
where all of the
data that we have,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.000
including what time the
emails are sent out,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.080
what time he responds to them,
and what time our system is

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.970
responding to him-- we
have a few data points.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.650
But it's only about
three days worth

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.710
since we've implemented
this Google Doc,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.930
but we've been testing this
for probably about a week

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.930
and a half to two weeks.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.670
And each, probably,
couple of days,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.800
we'll get some
sort of reminder--

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:19.050
we'll get improvements
that we will implement.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.950
Does that answer your question.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.890
For example, the sending him
two follow-up emails rather than

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:25.390
four.

00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:30.659
ROB MILLER: Do you know if
this is having any effect?

00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:35.444
But I love the way you
expressed one of your goals

00:38:35.444 --> 00:38:38.860
as getting him to
internalize the [INAUDIBLE],

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.764
not just look at
it and dismiss it.

00:38:42.764 --> 00:38:47.615
Do you have any idea about
whether this is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:48.490
[? IAN: We ?] do not.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.000
One of the things
we really want to

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.340
was to find how many times
he comes back to this email.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.370
Because what we would like
for him to do is at 5:00 PM,

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.120
be like, oh what do I
have going on today?

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.530
Let me go back to this email
that Your Friendly Reminder has

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.880
sent him.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.690
So no we do not have that data.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:10.550
The only thing we have is
just his personal feelings

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.950
about it-- whether he
feels like it helps him.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.840
And he says that it
has, and so we're

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.070
hoping that-- at this
point it's enough for us

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.320
to feel like we've
done something.

00:39:24.918 --> 00:39:26.626
ROB MILLER: A follow-up
question actually

00:39:26.626 --> 00:39:27.751
also about internalization.

00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:30.700
So this keyword idea
for replying rather than

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:36.310
just [INAUDIBLE] button
there, then [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.790
Runs the script
and checks it off.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.808
But the keyword is
interesting, because it

00:39:41.808 --> 00:39:43.692
seems like there's a
possibility that you

00:39:43.692 --> 00:39:46.150
can help him
internalize it by making

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.031
the keyword relevant to what
he's supposed to do, instead

00:39:50.031 --> 00:39:52.346
of just muffins, unless
he actually is supposed

00:39:52.346 --> 00:39:53.338
to bake some muffins.

00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:54.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.826 --> 00:39:57.753
But if he's supposed to do
something else, [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:57.753 --> 00:39:58.794
Did you think about that?

00:39:58.794 --> 00:40:00.440
Did you talk about that?

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.030
GUEST SPEAKER: The keywords
are currently just randomized.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.488
We were thinking
of doing something

00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:05.779
along the lines of
reading through his events

00:40:05.779 --> 00:40:07.570
and then picking out
a word from that event

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.940
and then making that the
keyword, and that's something

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.300
we did debate, but we never
really implemented that,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.134
because we wanted to
add the other features,

00:40:16.134 --> 00:40:17.924
but that is something
that we have thought,

00:40:17.924 --> 00:40:19.925
and is a good idea, and
that we could implement.

00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:25.080
Any other questions?

00:40:28.475 --> 00:40:30.415
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have you thought

00:40:30.415 --> 00:40:32.355
of using this
application for persons

00:40:32.355 --> 00:40:36.235
with other types
of disabilities,

00:40:36.235 --> 00:40:40.450
such as psychiatric or
abnormal [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.950
GUEST SPEAKER: Well right now,
a lot of stuff is hard-coded,

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.900
so we can't really extend
this of more than one user.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.310
And that is something that
we do want to try to expand,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.564
but apparently-- I tried
to look all over Google,

00:40:51.564 --> 00:40:53.730
and they don't save your
first name for some reason.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.380
So even your first
name is hard-coded,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.800
and that's something
that we would

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.822
need to step away from in order
to expand this to other users.

00:40:59.822 --> 00:41:02.030
But that's something that
we would really like to do.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.270
AUDIENCE: I think cognitive
overload is something

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.355
hard to empathize
with sometimes What

00:41:09.355 --> 00:41:13.650
were your experiences
trying to empathize with Don

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.057
during this entire semester?

00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:18.140
GUEST SPEAKER: So I think
the biggest one that did

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.690
affect us was trying to
get conversations steered

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:24.304
n a direction-- it's
understandable that you have

00:41:24.304 --> 00:41:25.720
a lot of stuff
going in your mind,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.250
and just simply keeping a
conversation going on one way

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.600
did prove to be a little bit
tougher than we expected,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.500
but that is part of
the cognitive overload,

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.100
to have one goal in mind.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.030
And it was hard to empathize
with that at the beginning,

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.330
but the more we did
interact with Don,

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.960
we understood that
this is an issue,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.370
and it's not his or
our fault, and we

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:50.900
understood that we
needed something

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.380
to make this better for him.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.740
PROFESSOR: Maybe
related to that,

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.940
can you talk a little bit
about the design process?

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.380
does that mean
that sometimes you

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:06.200
have to kind of push or nudge
ideas in a certain direction?

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.400
How do you sort of navigate
this user input in this process?

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.900
GUEST SPEAKER: So
just getting ideas

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.959
at the beginning of the project
was a little bit tricky.

00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:18.500
Especially-- if you
guys didn't know,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.992
we actually started off with
a different project for most

00:42:20.992 --> 00:42:22.450
of the semester,
and then we decide

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:28.320
to switch gears and go something
more software-oriented, and was

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.960
definitely a tough
process to go through,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.432
but once we got something
going, it was a lot easier

00:42:33.432 --> 00:42:34.515
to streamline the process.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:38.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:43.600
I know that your team has had
quite a ride this semester,

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.250
but I think that has come up
with something very promising

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.155
with some interesting results.

00:42:49.155 --> 00:42:50.080
So well done.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.580
Great.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:56.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.539
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi guys,
we're team Jeffrey,

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:01.580
and then we're here to
present our product, which

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.070
is called touch 'n' sign.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.529
GUEST SPEAKER:
Which Jeffrey named.

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:05.361
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:07.380
So let's give a
little overview first.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.790
So our client is Jeffrey.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.890
He's sitting right over there.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.220
So his disability
is that he's blind,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.770
and generally he
lives with himself,

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.800
but sometimes he has a
seeing aide at his house,

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.650
and he actually goes
out quite frequently.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.650
Like sometimes he goes
out to the neighborhoods,

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:24.700
but every week or
so, he'll sometimes

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.040
go out to further places
like to watch a movie

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.730
or to catch an opera.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.895
And he's also a
pretty active member

00:43:31.895 --> 00:43:34.990
of a number of
community organizations.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.880
And, as such, he's in
charges of financial matters

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.500
as well as other matters.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.980
And because of
this, he often needs

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.059
to sign legal documents
or other important papers.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:54.140
So the goal of our assistive
technology for this semester

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.690
is to have a way for him to sign
these legal documents that he

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:02.190
needs to sign without the
help of his seeing aide.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.740
And so before, usually he just
has his seeing aide come over,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.240
and then he'll manually guide
Jeffrey's hand to the place he

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.046
needs to sign, but sometimes he
can always be at his house. .

00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:13.670
So then we wanted to
come up with a way

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.760
for him to be able to sign
his signature on the paper,

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.510
even when his seeing
aide wasn't there.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.890
And sometimes, for
certain organizations,

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:24.300
they actually need his actual,
written signature on the paper.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.986
So like sometimes we thought
about maybe just somehow

00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:29.360
printing it on there, or some
other way of electronically

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.880
putting it on
there, but they need

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.560
this thing called
a wet signature.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.070
So then this was not
always a possible solution.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.150
So what with Jeffrey
has already is

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.540
he has a software
called JAWS, which

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.530
is this really cool
software for blind people

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:46.730
on the PC that essentially reads
out what's on the computer.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.510
And it's like pretty
intuitive, and it's

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.540
a very detailed in
terms of the things

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.860
that it can describe to you.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.960
He also has an OCR software, and
Optical Character Recognition

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.780
software, or he has
someone that can

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.840
do for him, in which he can
convert general documents

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.870
into Word documents that
has the same characters

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.530
in the same places.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:08.760
So what he needs
is in two steps.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.830
The first step is he needs some
way, given a Word document,

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.640
to find where he needs to
sign on the Word document.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.120
So if you're given an
electronic Word document,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.300
he needs a way to know
on this document, where

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.370
the signature is.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.340
And then after he
has that, he needs

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.440
to-- from that information,
on the physical document

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.810
he needs to be able to locate
that on the physical document.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.542
So then we broke it
up into two steps.

00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:33.500
And then the first step
is like a software step

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.333
and then the second
step is a hardware step.

00:45:38.267 --> 00:45:40.600
GUEST SPEAKER: So basically
here is the software design.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.790
So the first design
we have activates

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.110
through a macro toolbar
in the Microsoft Word.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.980
So you can see
that whenever which

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.920
we find the signature file where
we first scan the documents,

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.670
and then we locate-- so
JAWS will read underscore,

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.130
underscore,
underscore, so we know

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.530
that it's a signature field.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.240
So then we trigger
the macro we have.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.970
So it reads out the
horizontal position and also

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.780
the vertical position,
basically giving

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.400
Jeffrey x-y coordinates to work
on at the mechanical solution

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.340
part.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.000
And it also tells him
which pages it is on.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.630
And also, for the
final design, we

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.490
basically simplified this thing
that Jeffrey needs to remember

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.580
and also the action
that he has to do.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.490
So we activate the
macro through hot keys,

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.750
and also we have more
intuitive wording,

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.970
and also we rounded
the decimal place,

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.915
because it doesn't have
to be too accurate.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.590
So the hardware
design iteration one.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.980
So the approach we have is
that we do fast prototyping.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.050
We have like
multiple iterations.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.860
So this is the very
first design we have.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.550
So the feature it had is
completely made by cardboard

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.620
and also floss.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.427
And also along
the board, you can

00:46:55.427 --> 00:46:57.010
see that there are
dots along the edge

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.550
to indicate the coordinates.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:02.440
So the x-y bar are tied on
the floss to slice through.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.570
So the feedback we got is
that it's not accurate enough

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.570
like for Jeffrey to
read the numbers,

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.920
and also it's hard it's
hard to put the paper on,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.450
because the x-y rails
are tied onto the board.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.790
And also Jeffrey has to count
the number of the bumps.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:21.970
So if he's interrupted, he
has to count again, which

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.930
is not very convenient for him.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.450
And also the second design
is that we improved it

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.600
by using a magnet bar, instead
of using the bump that we

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.300
manually made by the cardboard.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.890
So it's easy to slide,
but then the guided bars

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.370
are still too thin
to be accurately

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:41.660
lined up so that you can be
very horizontal and vertical.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.150
And also the movement
on the magnetic stripe

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:48.060
is not smooth enough, because
the cardboard is not even,

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.315
and also it's hard to tell
if the rails were straight.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.840
GUEST SPEAKER: So this
is our third design.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.970
So we took Jeffrey's advice, and
we made the board a lot bigger,

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.590
because he wanted
to have shoulders

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:07.469
so that if, for example,
if he needed to sign really

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:09.260
close to the edge of
the paper, we would be

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:10.780
able to move the rail to that.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.927
So for the third
design, we wanted

00:48:12.927 --> 00:48:14.010
to do something different.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:18.070
We added the braille ruler
onto the horizontal guide bar

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.520
so that after he finds
the vertical position,

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.300
he can simply move his hand
along the Braille ruler

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.930
on the horizontal bar
in order to figure out

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:33.080
the x part, the
horizontal position of it.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.832
But the feedback that we got
was that the thicker guide bars

00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:38.290
made it a lot more
easy to line up,

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.380
because we had the
braille rulers on the side

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.045
so that if we had a three--
if the guide bars are

00:48:44.045 --> 00:48:47.250
three inches wide, then
he could line it up

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.380
against the braille ruler
and have it be very straight.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.290
And that was pretty accurate.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.800
But the problem was that like
this design demanded too much

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.290
of the user, because if
you had to use one hand

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.130
to move down the bar, and then
you had to use the other hand

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.720
to move along the
horizontal position,

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.550
it was very hard to keep track
of the horizontal position

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.920
and sign at the same time.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.730
So Jeffrey actually preferred
like the previous design

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.890
that we had over this one.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:17.020
So we don't have a picture
here, but basically

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.630
what we did for
the third iteration

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:24.960
prime is we took stuff
from the third design,

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.760
but instead of just
having just one guide

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.890
bar with a horizontal
ruler attached to it,

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:33.860
we put the horizontal
braille ruler onto the board,

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.830
and then we added onto
it another guide bar,

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:40.190
so he would be able to
move two guide bars,

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.080
and not have to keep track of
the position with his hands.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.260
And then we still used
the same base as before.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.370
So the feedback that we got
was that again like the thicker

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:53.270
guide bars made it
a lot more accurate,

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.580
and then it was a lot more easy
to use than the previous one.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:03.500
OK, so we actually found
online at this place

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.840
called MaxiAid, something
that does the same thing

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.210
that we were trying to do.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:10.959
So we bought it, and we
tried to test it out.

00:50:10.959 --> 00:50:13.250
So it's like a commercial
product built on a clipboard,

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.980
and it has a ruler
that goes down.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.090
And then it has a thing that
clicks if you move it across,

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.950
so you can find
the x-y positions.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.450
But the feedback was
that Jeffrey really

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.380
liked the idea of
holding stuff down

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.680
with the clipboard, because
it makes it really stable.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.490
And he likes the
stability of it,

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:36.100
but the problem was
that it was just not

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.960
a very accurate
solution, because it

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.510
wobbled around a lot.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.480
It could only click, and the
clicks were hard to count.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.260
And there was no place on the
board for a Braille ruler,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:49.590
so it was hard to
find the position.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:52.380
So our final prototype--
we decided to kind of just

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.800
make a higher fidelity
version of the third design

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:01.510
that we had, and instead
of having tapered edges,

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.840
we decided to go with
just non-tapered edges,

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.185
because that would
make it easier.

00:51:06.185 --> 00:51:08.810
Because we didn't really see the
point of having tapered edges,

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.810
and we made the
whole board magnetic

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:15.330
so that it'd be easier
for the rails to stick on,

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.540
and they wouldn't fall off.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.677
And it's very similar
to the third design.

00:51:22.677 --> 00:51:24.760
GUEST SPEAKER: We're going
to watch a video of him

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.732
using the software.

00:51:35.664 --> 00:51:37.830
So right now he's trying
to find where the signature

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.111
bar is on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:42.111 --> 00:51:44.083
JULIE GREENBERG: Oh,
is that JAWS talking?

00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:44.576
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:51:44.576 --> 00:51:46.325
GUEST SPEAKER: This
is his computer, yeah.

00:51:49.299 --> 00:51:50.340
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.590
So I solved.

00:52:02.722 --> 00:52:04.666
Wow, that's super.

00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:07.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.500
PROFESSOR: Can you tale 30
seconds and wrap up please?

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.333
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:52:12.727 --> 00:52:16.210
This is him, and this
is what the result was.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:19.122
And then we measured
a bunch of--

00:52:19.122 --> 00:52:21.330
GUEST SPEAKER: We wanted to
know how accurate it was,

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.560
how fast it took him to use
the mechanical prototype,

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.770
and what he thought of
his overall satisfaction,

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:29.390
and these are kind of like
the summary of his results.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.580
And then there are
a lot of things

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.230
that we learned through this.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.540
GUEST SPEAKER: So basically
the first thing that we learned

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.980
was that there could
be a lot of challenges

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.110
that we didn't predict, and
also the fast prototyping

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:44.100
actually helps so that we
can make more iterations.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.620
And the second is
that the details

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.577
are the most important part
while we are doing the design.

00:52:48.577 --> 00:52:51.160
And the third is that we need
to take into account the burdens

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.640
that we have on our client.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:57.550
And also the manual
testing is very important

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:59.460
to find the flaws and the bugs.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.722
And the fifth thing is that
nothing can be really perfect.

00:53:02.722 --> 00:53:03.930
We have to make a trade-offs.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:06.690
So we have to choose
what we value more.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.680
And the last thing
is that documentation

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.640
is really important.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:15.040
It's easy to fall behind, so
it's really hard to make it up.

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.157
And that's a good ending.

00:53:17.157 --> 00:53:17.740
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.046
Thank you very much.

00:53:19.046 --> 00:53:21.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.010
Let' start with questions
on from the panel.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.626
ROB MILLER: I'm going to use my
question to ask you to back up

00:53:26.626 --> 00:53:28.375
to the slide where you
showed the numbers,

00:53:28.375 --> 00:53:32.260
just so that we can look
at them a little bit more.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:38.880
What do you think happened
overall on design [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.240
GUEST SPEAKER: Because it
was a commercial product.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.590
ROB MILLER: Oh, that
was the MaxiAid.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.160
GUEST SPEAKER: So
we wanted to see

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.160
what we could take from
that, and we [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.020
the clip art that
stabilized the paper.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.300
But in terms of accuracy,
it was hard for Jeffrey

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.960
to count the clicks.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.180
ROB MILLER: So which one
is the final clipboard

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.550
prototype that you did?

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.716
GUEST SPEAKER: So
we have it here.

00:53:57.716 --> 00:53:59.764
ROB MILLER: OK, but it's
not in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:59.764 --> 00:54:00.930
GUEST SPEAKER: No, it's not.

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.842
I mean we didn't test it yet.

00:54:06.642 --> 00:54:08.100
GUEST SPEAKER: Any
other questions?

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:08.600
Raquel?

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.040
RAQUEL: Can you go back
to explain the accuracy?

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.600
Like how many times
did you test it?

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.350
How did you determine
how accurate it was?

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.219
Was it one time?

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:18.510
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, we tested
it a few times for each,

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.130
and then we
essentially looked at--

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.920
so generally the accuracy
for how wobbly it was

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.780
was not a problem.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.022
it was essentially where the
signature line started versus

00:54:28.022 --> 00:54:29.188
where he started signing it.

00:54:29.188 --> 00:54:32.525
And then we just took
the average of those.

00:54:32.525 --> 00:54:33.941
ROB MILLER: What
did you find more

00:54:33.941 --> 00:54:37.144
challenging in this project--
the software side of it

00:54:37.144 --> 00:54:40.355
or the hardware side
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:40.355 --> 00:54:44.105
of an accurate measurement
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:44.105 --> 00:54:45.480
GUEST SPEAKER: I
think personally

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.510
found the hardware side
a bit more challenging.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:51.740
I think we are more towards the
software side as our studies,

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.070
so it's more out of our comfort
zone the do the hardware side.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:57.916
And part of it is also
iterating on hardware

00:54:57.916 --> 00:55:00.110
is more of a
time-intensive process.

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:02.750
GUEST SPEAKER: I think we had
hard time trying to scope out

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.186
our project-- do we want to
handle documents of all sizes,

00:55:05.186 --> 00:55:10.920
or do we just want to do it for
8.5" by 11" pieces of paper.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.548
And I think we wanted to make
the hardware solution very

00:55:14.548 --> 00:55:16.668
elegant, so it
took a lot of time

00:55:16.668 --> 00:55:20.834
to figure out how to make
it so that it's easy to use

00:55:20.834 --> 00:55:23.244
and simple enough to understand.

00:55:23.244 --> 00:55:26.560
GUEST SPEAKER: And also, a lot
of challenges that Jeffrey had

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.190
using our project, we cannot
see well during the design.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:31.400
For example, he wanted the
entire surface to be flat.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.090
And also, he wants to be able
to have a [? bump ?] to align

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:35.890
with the bar.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:38.870
So we kind of don't know that
when [? were ?] [? able ?]

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:42.620
to see everything, but when he
used it within-- at that time,

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.747
we realized what the flaw of
the design is so we can redo

00:55:45.747 --> 00:55:46.448
the thing.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.770
PROFESSOR: OK I think this team
has done some great iterations

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.750
and made good use of
Jeffrey's abilities.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:56.400
So well done.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:56.900
All right.

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:57.400
Thank you

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.018
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:59.018 --> 00:56:00.890
We'll let Team Felicity set up.

00:56:07.286 --> 00:56:08.690
ARI: Hi everyone.

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:11.470
So our product is vibeAware.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.840
My name is Ari, and these are
my teammates Becca and Simi.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.780
And our client is Felicity.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.140
Felicity has neurofibromatosis,
which has, as a result,

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:29.030
left her profoundly deaf
and with low vision.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:31.230
However Felicity is
very active, and she

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:34.690
tends to go out with friends,
she has doctor appointments,

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.710
goes to cafes, and of
all of these activities,

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.550
she notices that it's
really hard for other people

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.200
to get her attention.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.660
So that's why we decided
to create vibeAware.

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.440
VibeAware is a device
with two components.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.890
The first one Felicity
wears and the other one

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.160
she gives to a friend.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.300
When the friend wants to notify
Felicity and get her attention,

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.310
they can just a toggle
the button on the remote

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.030
and then Felicity will get
a vibration that'll let her

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:04.590
be aware that someone's
trying to notify her.

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.950
Hence the terrible word pun.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:13.510
And we're going to talk
about the design process.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.690
SIMI: So through our project
we used an iterative design

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.530
process.

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:21.330
And our iterations
went as follows.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.670
Our first design was
a toy car spin-off.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.890
Our second design
was a light ring.

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:31.090
Then we created a custom circuit
and finally, refined that

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.500
to our final design.

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.170
And I'll go over those
more specifically now.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:37.080
So in our first
iteration, we asked

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.340
ourselves the question,
how do we get an RF

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.660
signal to trigger a motor.

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:44.200
We're all software-focused
in our studies,

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.570
so we don't really know
a lot about hardware.

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:50.120
So we thought that
the best way to do

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.100
this is to use something
that's already out there.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.800
And that is a toy car.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.130
A toy car has two
switches that essentially

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:02.370
trigger two different
motors using an RF signal.

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:06.710
So we took apart a toy car, and
we learnt a lot through this

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:07.280
process.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.610
We learnt about RF signals.

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.860
We learnt about how this works,
what components are necessary

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.390
to make it work.

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:17.950
And through this design,
we kind of played around

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.330
to see what we could get-- how
big of a design we could get.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:26.000
But our pros in this design
were that we learnt about RF

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.420
signals; we found something
that works at a long range.

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.830
The cons are obviously
that it's huge, and bulky,

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.000
and it has a lot of
pieces that we don't need,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.710
and it's not customized.

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.972
So we went to our
next iteration,

00:58:37.972 --> 00:58:39.430
and we asked
ourselves the question

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:42.970
is it possible to create
this with a smaller design?

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.720
Again, we went with something
that's already out there.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.680
We went with this little
tiny light switch that

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.610
basically is remote controlled.

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:55.060
And we kind of hacked that to
create our own little vibeAware

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.200
ring.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.220
So this essentially
is a little light

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.050
with a motor attached
that we hacked on,

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:06.400
and the remote
control essentially

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:11.800
turns on the motor
as a notification.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.380
The pros of this
design were that it

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.930
was very light and
small, but the cons

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:18.840
were that it works at
a very limited range,

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.820
the battery was short-lived,
and the circuit was just hacked,

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.830
it wasn't customized to
what we wanted it to do.

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.360
But we got something to work.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.680
So now we're going to talk
about iteration three, which

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:36.230
basically progressed our
design further by three steps.

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:40.540
We asked ourselves the question,
can we get better range

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:41.800
with a smaller device?

00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.090
And Ari's going to
talk more about this.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.930
ARI: So the first
thing we felt was

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.510
that we weren't going to
be able to reach our design

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:53.940
objectives using off
the shelf hardware,

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.920
and we'd have to go and
create our own circuit.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.150
So this is our first end-to-end
custom circuit product

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.780
that we made.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.148
[CLAPPING]

01:00:05.148 --> 01:00:06.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.510
And I'll talk about what we did.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:12.330
So basically we did a search on
different hardware components

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.530
that we'd like to use.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.440
We ended up getting a small
cellphone vibration motor

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.590
from sparkfun.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:20.730
And the other
component we had was

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:23.050
the receiver and the key fob.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.870
So this was great.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.870
This had a remote control
that was already made,

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:30.750
and a corresponding chip that
we just had to supply power to.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.700
You didn't need any
other microcontrollers

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.250
or extra stuff.

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:37.500
And when you hit the remote,
it would set one of the pins

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:42.940
to high on this
transmitter/receiver device.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.550
It had up to 25 feet
of range, depending

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:50.180
on line-of-sight obstructions,
and it was only $12.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.590
So using that and
other basic components

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:58.470
like LEDs, push buttons, we
were able to create this design.

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:00.050
So we started with
this schematic,

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:03.230
and we had different-- pretty
much the easiest way you

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.700
could try to set this thing up.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.890
We tested it out
on a breadboard,

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:12.170
and then we tried to put it
all into a small proto-board.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:16.300
And afterwards, we put
it in a cardboard box.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:21.460
So surprisingly, Felicity
was really excited

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.750
when she received this, but
we felt that we could probably

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.270
do a little bit better.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.830
And so the pros of it was it
was our fully functional circuit

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.660
design.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.780
It had longer range
than the ring,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.980
and it was much smaller
than our RC car.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.470
The con was we really
didn't spend time thinking

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.540
about the enclosure.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.250
This one also had a
very large battery pack,

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.200
and again, the circuit
wasn't completely closed,

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.140
so it was a little bit fragile.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.120
So after this we said,
how can we improve this?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.620
How can we make it more durable?

01:01:58.994 --> 01:02:01.410
BECCA: So I'm Becca, and I'll
talk about this final design

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.800
that we put together.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.320
So the goal of the
final design was

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.637
to make something that was a
bit more durable and compact,

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:10.970
and so what we decided to do
was create an acrylic shell

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:12.464
for our final
circuit, and we also

01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:15.130
want to think about how we could
make the vibration a little bit

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.040
more strong.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.310
And so we decided to go
with a nine volt battery,

01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:21.210
instead of the smaller batteries
that we were using before.

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.909
And in this final design we've
considered both maintainability

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:24.700
and also usability.

01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:29.280
Because we were using
this nine volt battery

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.080
we have to make some
minor circuit adjustments.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.980
So since the receiver
uses five volt,

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.910
we had to use a linear
voltage regulator

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.140
to interface to two components.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.080
And so we edited that.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.530
And also in this
final design, we

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:44.940
had to consider how Felicity
was going be using it,

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.310
and so how these various
components like the motor,

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.940
the switches, the
LED, and the battery

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.941
were going to be positioned
in the final design.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.440
So I'll talk a bit
about this later,

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
but these are just sketches
of us brainstorming

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.890
as we were thinking about it.

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.598
And also, as we were
thinking about this,

01:02:57.598 --> 01:03:00.187
we decided to make the final
design a necklace instead,

01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:01.770
because at one point
in our interview,

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.990
Felicity had mentioned that
her sternum area is one

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.780
of her most sensitive areas.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.260
And so if we could leverage
that, and put a motor

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.176
next to that, we thought
that the notification

01:03:10.176 --> 01:03:11.310
would be more effective.

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:15.630
And so when were making
the acrylic shelling,

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.390
we first designed
it in the software,

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.320
and then just used
a laser cutter

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.710
to create the acrylic shelling.

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:24.085
And that's what
you can see here.

01:03:24.085 --> 01:03:26.190
And this was the
size we had to make

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:29.350
in order for the battery and
the circuit to fit inside of it.

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:30.730
And so this is our final design.

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.360
It's actually a
shiny black encasing,

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.200
but we had to tape it when
were first testing it out,

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.710
but as you can see, first
the antenna has to pop out,

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:42.100
because we wanted to
maximize the signal strength,

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.010
and we put the LED at the
top of the necklace device

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:48.210
so that it maximizes the
visibility when she sees it.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.082
And we have two switches.

01:03:52.082 --> 01:03:54.040
So one switch is she
flips it on when she first

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
wants to use the device.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.280
And the LED will turn on
that so she knows it's on.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.440
Then when her friend
triggers the device

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.140
and it starts vibrating, she
can press a second switch,

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.410
which is a push button
to reset the device

01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.639
and turn off the vibration.

01:04:06.639 --> 01:04:08.180
But the device will
keep on listening

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.280
until she switches off the LED.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.210
And so when we're
positioning the switches,

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.890
we knew that Felicity
was right-handed,

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:17.630
and so we put the
switches accordingly.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:21.380
And we also put the motor on
the back side of the necklace

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.730
so it was touching her skin.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:25.920
So some pros of this were
that it was more robust,

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.330
and we thought about the
positioning a bit more,

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:30.930
but inside the circuit
is a bit messy,

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:32.510
and the battery is really heavy.

01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:34.480
So the reason why we decided to
go with the nine volt battery

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.021
was because we wanted to make
sure she could still replace it

01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:39.387
once we've given this to
her a little while later.

01:04:39.387 --> 01:04:41.720
Because we were really tempted
to use a smaller battery,

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.500
but it'd be a lot harder
for her to replace,

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.666
and we really wanted to
think about maintainability.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.840
So we're running out
of time, but we also

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.910
considered distance
and vibration.

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.745
And she approved of
the vibration strength,

01:04:54.745 --> 01:04:56.120
and with the
distance we ended up

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.250
with 25 feet range, which
is good for the use cases

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.780
that we were considering.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.546
And just wrapping up and
talking about some learning

01:05:03.546 --> 01:05:05.420
and reflection that we
had with this project,

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.050
personally it was really
hard as a team for us

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:08.549
to narrow the scope
because Felicity

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:10.750
had a lot of great
project ideas,

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.900
and we also are all
software-oriented

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.210
so it was hard to learn
about the hardware.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.270
Designing AT is really difficult
because we have to customize,

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:21.537
and it's hard to scale something
that you're customizing.

01:05:21.537 --> 01:05:23.120
But working with
Felicity was amazing.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.320
She was a really fantastic
and understanding client,

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.600
and we really learned a
lot through the process.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.563
Thank you.

01:05:28.563 --> 01:05:31.050
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.634
ROB MILLER: So your
presentation actually looked

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:42.364
like a lot about exploring
[? the ?] products, right?

01:05:42.364 --> 01:05:44.340
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.126
I wonder if you could
say more about what you

01:05:48.126 --> 01:05:50.268
learned about how [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:50.268 --> 01:05:53.232
Some of it came out at
the end, [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:56.196 --> 01:06:01.136
The sensitive areas,
but can you say

01:06:01.136 --> 01:06:04.100
something about her
sense of comfort

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.076
while wearing
something like this?

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.760
BETH: So a few use cases-- so
we thought about this idea early

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.840
on actually in the
semester, but we moved away

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.480
from it-- but some use cases
that Felicity had initially

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.892
mentioned were like
during class-- she'd

01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:21.850
take some classes, and
it's really hard for her

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.540
to know when someone has told
her it's her turn to speak,

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.000
and so this was
one use case there.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.611
And also when
she's with friends,

01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:29.110
and she's at a
concert or something,

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.710
and if she gets lost
from our friends,

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:31.793
this would be an easy way.

01:06:31.793 --> 01:06:34.010
She doesn't always carry
her phone on her person,

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.410
and so if they text her,
she doesn't always know,

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:37.610
or if they're calling her.

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:40.390
And so this would be a quick
way to grab their attention.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:43.380
One reason why we moved away
was we thought about security,

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.700
and if she went
to a coffee shop,

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.390
and she wanted them to use it,
how comfortable would people

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:50.085
feel when someone's
just walking up

01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:52.790
to them with this random remote,
asking them to press a button

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:54.814
to ask for their attention.

01:06:54.814 --> 01:06:56.355
So that's why we
felt like, socially,

01:06:56.355 --> 01:06:57.855
it would be a really
awkward device.

01:06:57.855 --> 01:06:59.063
And so we moved away from it.

01:06:59.063 --> 01:07:00.890
ROB MILLER: Did you
ever actually try that?

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:02.660
Like go to a coffee
shop and [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.180
BECCA: Well we did it
with-- we were just filming,

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.300
and we asked them if we
could like just videotape

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.740
our conversation while she
was ordering something,

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:13.081
and they were already really
uncomfortable, and so--

01:07:13.081 --> 01:07:14.080
ROB MILLER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.260
BECCA: Well it
wasn't a-- oh, sorry.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.440
SIMI: So she actually
told us that she

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.480
was uncomfortable with giving
this device to someone else.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.930
I think part of one
discussion we had was

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:28.790
that she didn't want to have
to explain to someone else

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:31.180
why she's giving it to
them, because she already

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.930
has like trouble hearing
them and communicating

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:36.120
with them otherwise.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.990
She wants every
piece of information

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:40.990
told right away so
that she doesn't

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.669
have to answer
questions, and she

01:07:42.669 --> 01:07:44.335
was worried about the
questions that she

01:07:44.335 --> 01:07:48.432
would have to answer if she
gives someone this device.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.890
BECCA: And I guess the way we
mediated that was in the end,

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:53.120
the use cases we had for her
and the ones that she wants

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.760
is to use this with
friends and people

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.762
she's already familiar with.

01:07:56.762 --> 01:07:59.242
GUEST SPEAKER: I have another
question. [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:02.714
Were there any kind of
pre-fabricated circuits

01:08:02.714 --> 01:08:04.100
that we could have used?

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.945
I mean I love the fact
that you were able to-- it

01:08:06.945 --> 01:08:09.891
was very instructive
[? building ?] the circuit.

01:08:09.891 --> 01:08:10.873
But [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:16.765
Do you think that would
have been something that

01:08:16.765 --> 01:08:18.960
could have served the purpose?

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.460
BECCA: Yeah.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.569
So the receiver
itself is pre-bought.

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:23.840
So that's something we
used out of the box.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.617
I think our functionalities
are a bit more unsophisticated

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:28.950
that we didn't have to turn
towards [INAUDIBLE] and more

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:30.370
expensive things.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:32.164
The biggest, bulkiest
thing is the battery,

01:08:32.164 --> 01:08:34.080
and that was just something
we decided to use,

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.371
because it was easily replaced.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.482
With your team, I think over
the course of the semester,

01:08:42.482 --> 01:08:44.065
you've gotten to
know Felicity better.

01:08:44.065 --> 01:08:47.840
I'm interested in seeing what
the results are in evaluating

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.890
with them, and I think you've
done some strong work putting

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:52.890
together this prototype.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:53.120
Well done.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:53.695
All right.

01:08:53.695 --> 01:08:54.195
Thanks.

01:09:01.924 --> 01:09:03.340
BETH: Imagine
you're in your room;

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.756
you're sitting in
your wheelchair,

01:09:04.756 --> 01:09:07.140
and you pull something
out of a drawer.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.270
All of a sudden the drawer
starts falling on top of you.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:12.970
Now because you have
limited mobility,

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:15.630
you can't just move
that drawer back up,

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:18.720
and because you aren't
able to yell for help,

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.770
you're pretty much helpless.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:21.590
My name's Beth.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.890
This is Tanya and Laura,
and this semester we

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.970
had the pleasure of working
with Margaret, our client.

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:31.279
She found herself in this very
situation, and because of that,

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:35.180
she wanted to have a better way
that she could call for help.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.090
She lives in The Boston Home,
which is an assisted living

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.399
community for about 90
residents in Dorchester,

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:43.960
and she was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis,

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.890
so she is bound to
wheelchair, as are all

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.680
of the residents of the home.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.529
And like I said, the
goal of our project

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:56.430
is to design a system that
allows her to call for help.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.240
Currently the system in
place in The Boston Home

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.530
is just inaccessible for a
large percentage of the time.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:06.000
Currently, it's a button
that's attached to the wall,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.260
and when you're pulling
the drawer open,

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.360
the button's
nowhere to be found.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.800
So we did was
develop an iPad app--

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.070
we call it InstaAid--
and it allows

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:17.436
Margaret and many other
residents to call for help.

01:10:20.582 --> 01:10:22.540
LAURA: So we frequently
visited The Boston Home

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.081
throughout the course
of the semester

01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:27.290
to speak with both Margaret and
other staff members at the home

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:29.680
so that we could receive
feedback as we iterated

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.950
through several prototypes.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:34.210
What you see here is
an iPad screenshot

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:35.790
of our first prototype.

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:37.360
Before we got to
the stage, we did

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.720
do some paper prototype
sketches as well

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.540
and then implemented
that on the iPad.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:45.100
And in our first
iteration, our home screen

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.510
was too large buttons for
urgent and non-urgent requests.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:51.780
Pressing the urgent
button results

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.630
in a video chat with a nurse
at the nurse's station,

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.310
and then pressing the
non-urgent button leads you

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:02.970
to the screenshot you see
in the middle with six

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:07.200
cookie-cutter requests that
residents commonly have

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.960
such as please give me water.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.510
And pressing any
of these buttons

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:14.020
also leads that
resident to a video chat

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:19.070
with the nurse to specify more
information about the request.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:21.280
Some feedback we received
from this iteration

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.400
was that we should replace
that colorful icons

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.320
that we previously had with
larger and more contrast icons,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.700
so that it's easier for
residents to distinguish.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.100
And we were also
advised to remove

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.350
the urgent and non-urgent
distinction for requests,

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.550
because each resident
at The Boston Home

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:44.050
might have different views
of what urgent means to them.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:49.200
And finally, after
pressing one of the buttons

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.890
for common requests, rather than
being taken to a video chat,

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.980
we showed the resident
a screen that gave them

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.370
information about whether
their request has been received

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:04.170
by the nurse and whether it's
currently being addressed.

01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:07.170
So with this in mind, we moved
on to our second iteration.

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:09.820
So you can see the
difference in icons

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:12.110
that we have here-- with
the black and white,

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:15.190
the higher contrast.

01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:20.020
So we now have video
chat and send message

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.710
as two special icons that
we hadn't implemented yet.

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.730
But then the other
four buttons lead

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:30.620
to the request sent screen that
you see on the right-hand side.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.320
And it also gives the
option to close the request.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.250
And we also made a prototype
for the nurse in this iteration.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:42.720
You can see here on
the left hand side

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.170
that the nurse currently has
two outstanding requests,

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.180
and then if you presses
the process request button,

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.700
it turns to green, and
then she can close it

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.300
once it's completely fulfilled.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.010
Some feedback from
this iteration

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:02.990
is that we should introduce
a login system that

01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:05.810
persists even when the app
closes so that residents

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:08.014
don't need to login every
time they open the app.

01:13:08.014 --> 01:13:09.430
And at this point,
we still needed

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:13.170
to implement sending custom
text messages to the nurse

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.140
and the video chat.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.390
TANYA: So before we went on
to test our final prototype

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:23.320
and go on to actually deploy
this at The Boston Home,

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.672
we decided to conduct
a couple of experiments

01:13:25.672 --> 01:13:27.380
so that we knew what
we are dealing with.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.440
So the first thing
we asked Margaret

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.070
was how often she was unable
to access the call light

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.500
system when she needed aid.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:39.020
And she responded that it
was about 90% of the time.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.490
And we also timed the amount of
time that it took for a nurse

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:47.340
to respond to her request by
pressing the call light button,

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.550
and that ended up being
approximately eight minutes

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.420
every time she did that.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.910
And finally, because we're
using the iPad application,

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.190
and it depended on
her being able to send

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:58.465
this request to the
nurse's station,

01:13:58.465 --> 01:14:01.090
we wanted to make sure that the
Wi-Fi network was robust enough

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:02.350
to handle this.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.250
And we found that it was pretty
adequate-- that it covered most

01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:07.880
of The Boston Home-- but there
were a couple of dead zones

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.840
and transitions might
have been an issue

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.330
if she was moving while
she was doing this.

01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:16.730
So taking this all into account,
we made our final prototype

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:20.950
and were able to give this to
Margaret at The Boston Home.

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:23.520
So I'll just walk you through
a workflow of potentially

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.736
what a resident might do.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.890
So they are led to
this home screen

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:31.730
with the high contrast buttons
and can press something

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.688
like bring water, in
which case they will go on

01:14:33.688 --> 01:14:35.640
to the request sent button.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.350
That request is then
sent to the nurses side.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:39.860
It'll appear, and
they can go ahead

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.901
and say that they want to
process their request--

01:14:41.901 --> 01:14:43.600
that they've received it.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.399
And then that'll show up
on the resident's side,

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.440
saying request processed.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.910
They can go ahead and close
the request if they want.

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:53.970
The nurse can also go ahead and
close the request on their side

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:56.460
as well once it's
been fulfilled.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.144
Residents can also
send a text message.

01:14:58.144 --> 01:14:59.560
So it's a custom
message that they

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.070
can send if they don't have
any of the preset ones.

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.750
So I need to take
my medications,

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.750
and they can tell the
nurse that they want that,

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.830
and that will show up as a
custom message on the nurse's

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:09.590
side as well.

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:11.187
And it proceeds from there.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.780
So this wasn't shown
in this screencast,

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.150
but there's also a
video chat capability.

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:30.242
So this is us testing
it with Margaret.

01:15:30.242 --> 01:15:31.950
She can simply press
the button, and then

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:34.491
it connects directly with the
iPad, so she's able to do that.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.910
And what was great was when
we left it at The Boston Home

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:46.460
for a week, Don
actually was kind of

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.170
to make this Nurse's iPad mount.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.386
So, as you can see, it's at the
nurse's station with a bunch

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:53.510
of the other devices there.

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:56.390
So the nurse typically needs a
computer, the call light system

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:58.800
itself, as well as a
desk space for paperwork.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.054
So we put it right in
the center of the desk

01:16:01.054 --> 01:16:02.470
so that they'll
be able to see it,

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:03.850
and it's always going to be on.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.820
It's never going to turn off.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:10.270
And so that's just a
closer up version of that.

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:13.079
So after this, we went back,
visited our experiments,

01:16:13.079 --> 01:16:15.370
and tried to see what the
results of our week-long test

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.110
were.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.030
And we found that
Margaret was successfully

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:20.280
able to send the
request via her iPad

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.310
and then receive
aid from the nurse

01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:23.900
when she requested something.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:27.500
So the iPad was actually
only inaccessible one time,

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.430
but during that one
time, the call light

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.050
was also an inaccessible,
so she had to find

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:33.675
a different way to request aid.

01:16:33.675 --> 01:16:35.800
And we also found that the
response time is faster.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.600
It was about three minutes.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.667
And we are not
completely sure about how

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:41.750
that's going to work with
logistically, because we

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.583
believe that this might
be a faster response

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:45.530
time because it's a new
system, but we kind of

01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:48.106
want to see how it pans
out in the long run.

01:16:48.106 --> 01:16:49.980
And we also found that
there were no problems

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:54.085
with Wi-Fi connectivity

01:16:54.085 --> 01:16:55.460
BETH: So from the
very beginning,

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.160
Margaret's vision was
for her to not just

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.630
be the only client-- for the
entirety of The Boston Home

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:01.750
to be the client.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.400
So in this current
week, we've actually

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.810
been working to deploy this
system on more resident's

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:09.410
iPads, and we've already
received feedback,

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:12.140
and we're hoping to
incorporate that.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.884
We've also received
the piece of feedback

01:17:13.884 --> 01:17:15.300
that would be very
helpful to have

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.970
the location of the resident
when they send the request,

01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:21.370
and that's something
that we would

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:25.250
propose as a feature project.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.210
So ultimately, through
working on this project,

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:31.080
we want to reiterate that when
you design for one client,

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.430
that doesn't necessarily
scale for all.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.000
We learned this.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.620
We also learned that it's very
helpful to receive feedback

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.100
from many, many individuals,
not just your direct client.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:45.290
So we worked with a lot of the
individuals in The Boston Home.

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:47.630
And finally, it was
difficult for us

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.560
to scope this project initially,
because there is so much

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.340
potential, but we
wanted to deliver

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.740
a product that was
very useful in the time

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.090
constraints of this class.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:01.370
Ultimately, we'd really like to
thank our client Margaret, Don

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.170
Fredette, who many of
you have worked with.

01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:05.270
We really appreciate
his help on our project

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.770
and all of The Boston Home
staff have been really

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.632
great at giving us feedback.

01:18:09.632 --> 01:18:11.078
Thank you.

01:18:11.078 --> 01:18:13.488
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:16.862 --> 01:18:18.308
GUEST SPEAKER:
I'm just wondering

01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:21.200
what the variables that you find
really difficult to work with

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.170
were.

01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:26.208
Things that were sort of
[INAUDIBLE] in an ideal world

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:28.578
have a little more
control over [INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:31.159 --> 01:18:32.700
TANYA: I think one
of the main things

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.620
is definitely working
with the nurses.

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:42.099
So had started out with, of
course, talking to Margaret,

01:18:42.099 --> 01:18:43.890
and then we found that
as much as we needed

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:45.348
to talk to Margaret,
we also needed

01:18:45.348 --> 01:18:47.984
to talk to the nurse to
get her input on the UI,

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:50.400
and so on, and make sure that
she's comfortable with using

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.460
this system at her desk.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.496
But one, it was kind of hard
for us to meet with her,

01:18:55.496 --> 01:18:56.870
because every time
she was there,

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.860
she was always busy addressing
other residents' requests.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.420
And secondly, she
actually ended up

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:04.440
leaving halfway through the
semester, so the feedback

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.830
that we had gotten from
her and was not necessarily

01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:11.781
ported over to the next person
who's going to be there.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:13.280
So working with
that and making sure

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.571
that whatever was going to
be used from the nurses side

01:19:15.571 --> 01:19:19.070
would actually be used, even
though the residents would

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:21.604
be comfortable with the system,
it's not necessarily certain

01:19:21.604 --> 01:19:23.270
that the nurse would
be able to do that.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.590
So that was a bit of a hardship.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.898
ROB MILLER: I'm
wondering how much--

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.854
you had a slide
about experiments,

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:34.299
and you had a slide about
[? results ?] [? from ?]

01:19:34.299 --> 01:19:37.722
[? your ?] [? prototype. ?]
How much data was behind each

01:19:37.722 --> 01:19:38.700
of those slides?

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.634
So when you were measuring eight
minutes as a response time,

01:19:41.634 --> 01:19:43.101
how many trials was that?

01:19:43.101 --> 01:19:45.057
[? When you were ?]
measuring her success

01:19:45.057 --> 01:19:47.178
with the new system over
the course of the week.

01:19:47.178 --> 01:19:48.969
How [? many tests ?]
[? did you actually ?]

01:19:48.969 --> 01:19:49.960
[? get ?] [? there? ?]

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.501
BETH: So that's a
very good question,

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:54.000
and we're going to
answer honestly-- not

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.290
enough for a very good metric.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:01.020
So honestly, we spent
an hour with her.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.670
We did it maybe five times, and
that was kind of the average.

01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:07.752
However, to have a really
good metric, we would--

01:20:07.752 --> 01:20:09.960
ROB MILLER: Five times using
the old system you mean?

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.870
BETH: And five times
using the new system to

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.780
have some kind of a comparison.

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.820
But, of course, it's variable
throughout the course

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.220
of the week, and there are
many different variables

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.600
that would change that time.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.830
So a more rigorous
amounts of metrics-- we

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:31.010
could write scripts
for our current system

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:34.450
to figure out how much
time is collapsing

01:20:34.450 --> 01:20:37.234
between when the request is
sent and when it's processed.

01:20:37.234 --> 01:20:38.650
And that's something
that we would

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:40.135
propose to do for future work.

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.551
ROB MILLER: She
had it for a week,

01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:44.300
but it wasn't actually
logging the usage.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:47.270
BETH: We have analyzed the
logging-- we haven't logged it,

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:49.876
and we haven't
analyzed it either.

01:20:49.876 --> 01:20:52.000
PROFESSOR: Well, we'll Team
Beverly-Ann get set up.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.458
I think it's
impressive what you've

01:20:53.458 --> 01:20:55.359
done to build this
end-to-end system.

01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:57.900
Can I ask a question-- it was
pretty early on in the semester

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.830
that you chose to go with
an all-software solution as

01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:03.640
opposed to plugging in some
kind of wireless button

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:10.679
into the wall as
you might imagine

01:21:10.679 --> 01:21:11.970
you might go in that direction.

01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.660
Can you reflect a
little bit on that?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.850
Do you think ultimately
it was the right decision?

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:17.530
Or when you made
that decision, did

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:20.860
you know what you're going down?

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.680
LAURA: Sure.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.480
So all of us are
software people,

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:27.670
so that was partially an
initial reason for why

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:30.620
we wanted to go down this
route, but another reason

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.640
was just that we had
a lot of great ideas

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.540
for features that we wanted to
see in this app that wouldn't

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:38.601
be possible if we had chosen
to interface with the existing

01:21:38.601 --> 01:21:39.100
system.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.460
For example, this video
chat-- the concept

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.850
of sending custom
messages, maybe even being

01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:48.450
able to receive feedback about
how far along in the process

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:50.590
their request is in
terms of being addressed.

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:54.650
So all of us are really happy
with the way it turned out.

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:57.760
Margaret was excited about
the concept of video chatting

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.120
and other residents that we've
tested this out on were also

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.990
happy with the ability to
send custom text messages,

01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:07.590
so we think it worked out well.

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.596
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:12.431 --> 01:22:14.430
PROFESSOR: Let's get Team
Beverly-Ann to set up.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.660
VINNIE: Hi everyone.

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:23.890
We're team Beverly-Ann.

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:24.960
I'm Vinnie.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.330
SHRUTI: I'm Shruti.

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:27.450
ROBERT: I'm Robert.

01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:30.290
VINNIE: And this is
our final presentation.

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:32.830
Our client's name
is Beverly-Ann.

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:35.370
So she has a wide
variety of interests.

01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:37.910
She's a social worker
for the Department

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:39.200
of Children and Families.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.210
She's learning how
to code using Scratch

01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:43.530
and Arduino in her spare time.

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:45.000
She loves Wii Tennis.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.270
She has a backyard
garden, and her main goal

01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:49.500
is to maintain an active mind.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.900
And she's also been
diagnosed for 11 years

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.810
with the
Charcot-Marie-Tooth, which

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:58.880
is a neurodegenerative disease
that affects the extremities.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.720
SHRUTI: So everyone's experience
with CMT is different,

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.590
and in the case
of Beverly-Ann it

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:07.200
mainly manifests in sensory
failure and muscular failure

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.860
in her hands.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:11.470
So if you can see the diagrams
over there-- on the left hand,

01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:13.610
on the blue areas are
completely functional,

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:17.210
but the green areas are
experiencing muscular failure,

01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:18.490
and they tend to curl in.

01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:21.090
So they don't open, and thus
they're very useless to her.

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:25.650
On her right hand the sort of
gray areas are areas where she

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:29.250
can feel really well, but the
red areas are areas where she

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:29.750
cannot.

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:30.720
She feels numbness.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:34.560
And so she has trouble
gripping things as a result,

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.720
because she loses
feeling in that hand.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.970
And so as there is not just
a really consciously think

01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:41.900
about actions she
performs, and this

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.730
includes like picking up
and holding on to objects,

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:48.760
typing, and walking down
stairwells with railings.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.810
And you'll see in
the next few slides

01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:53.470
we chose to focus on the
problem with her right hand.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.970
ROBERT: So the assistive
technology challenge over here

01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:02.340
is that because Beverly-Ann
is so worried that she's

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.030
going to drop something
whenever she's grabbing it,

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.630
she becomes less confident
in grabbing objects

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.380
with just one hand.

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.720
And here we are trying to
reinstall her confidence

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.660
in grabbing objects
with her right hand

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:19.837
by notifying her whenever
her grip is becoming loose.

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:25.930
And to design our
product, we put them

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.920
into three stages of prototypes.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.700
And so, Shruti
talked about before,

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.560
we focused on the problem
with her right hand,

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.030
because she normally uses her
right hand to grab objects.

01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:42.020
And very early on,
we decided that we

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.780
want to quantify
her grip pressure

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:47.630
and then notify her whenever
her grip is becoming loose.

01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:52.590
So these are the early-stage
brainstorming ideas

01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:55.420
we had, and we were
focusing on exploring

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.980
different choices of where to
put the pressure sensors as

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:00.820
well as the circuit boards.

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:05.076
So the left part shows that
we put in the pressure sensor

01:25:05.076 --> 01:25:08.391
on the upper palm, whereas
the right part showing

01:25:08.391 --> 01:25:09.890
another idea of
putting the pressure

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:11.310
sensor on her fingertips.

01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:15.750
And then later on, we
followed the second idea.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:18.470
So this is our
prototype stage one,

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:21.730
and it's a low-fidelity
nonfunctional prototype.

01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:25.510
And we were exploring
multiple designs for this

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:29.170
[? look-a-like ?] prototype by
asking Beverly-Ann to try out

01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.740
different versions and then
see which one feels the most

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:32.420
comfortable.

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.700
And then this upper
part are the pictures

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:41.050
that are for the minimalistic
design for the gloves.

01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:45.860
That's the stage one prototype.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.370
For the stage two
prototype, we were

01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:49.820
mostly interested in
making a functional design,

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:52.600
so basically fulfilling
our goal of being

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.060
able to notify her-- one,
she gripping something

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.970
and it's slipping.

01:25:55.970 --> 01:26:00.120
So we constructed a
circuit on a breadboard,

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.110
and we hooked it
up to an Arduino,

01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:04.960
and then we coded--
we uploaded code

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.040
to the Arduino that would cause
a vibration motor to vibrate

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.000
whenever the sensors that are
also hooked up to the circuit

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.030
sense that you're
gripping the object,

01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:18.970
and then it's released
past a certain threshold.

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:22.270
And we actually tested
this with Beverly-Ann,

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:26.245
and she really liked how
loud the vibration motor was

01:26:26.245 --> 01:26:28.960
and how strong it was, and
she mentioned that it actually

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.960
helped her consciously
remember like, oh, I need

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.970
to re-grip and grip stronger.

01:26:33.970 --> 01:26:37.480
And she actually also really
liked the material of the glove

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.200
that we used, and
she asked us not

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.690
to cut it like how we did
for our first prototype.

01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:45.260
And is also pretty easy
to grip with the material

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:49.210
that we were using and
mostly we used this prototype

01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:51.310
to test the range
of sensor values

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:54.480
that output when she grabbed
different types of objects,

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.000
for example a cup, or
a mug, or utensils,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.705
and they actually turned out
to be around a similar range.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.089
SHRUTI: So the main problem
with the previous prototype

01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:06.880
was that it wasn't
portable because we have

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.350
to plug it into the computer.

01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:11.840
So the final prototype which
is actually on my arm right now

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840
is both functional and portable.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.070
So the idea is that we
printed a circuit board

01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:20.280
to do what our breadboard
was originally doing,

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.670
but that breadboard
was way too heavy.

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:25.660
So we got one custom
made, and that's here.

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.240
And then on the back, we
have an Arduino lily pad,

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.210
which is a lighter
version of an Arduino,

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:35.000
and it provides the code and
the power supply to the circuit.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.940
We have sensors
attached to the gloves,

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.680
and then we have an arm band.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.990
We discussed with
her a lot how she

01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:43.320
wanted to carry
this device around,

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.150
and her main
constraint was that she

01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:49.289
wanted it to be light,
but not on her upper arm

01:27:49.289 --> 01:27:50.830
or too close to her
wrist-- somewhere

01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.220
where it would be stable.

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.310
And so we chose to make an
arm band right around here,

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.620
so that it would be portable.

01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.680
And the vibration motor
is sewn into the arm band,

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.930
so that if I were to
turn the switch on

01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:05.110
to start it so that we
don't waste battery life,

01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:09.594
and squeeze it, and then let
go, I can feel the vibration,

01:28:09.594 --> 01:28:11.260
even though you can't
hear it, so that's

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:14.860
not disruptive to
other people around.

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.120
And the other thing
that we made sure to do

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.450
was that our power
supply is pretty light.

01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:21.840
It's only one AAA
battery, and because it's

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.400
like a standard AAA battery,
she can replace it whenever

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.560
it goes out of battery.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.903
So we don't have to worry
about prolonging its lifespan.

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:35.990
ROBERT: So for
experimentation, we mostly

01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:38.190
did with our stage
two prototype, when

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:39.810
we met up with Beverly-Ann.

01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:41.700
So we focused on two things.

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.860
The first thing is test
whether the prototype

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.720
is working as we
expected, in terms

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.230
of notifying Beverly-Ann
whenever her grip

01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:53.280
pressure becomes loose, and
also to see whether it actually

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.360
decreases the time when
she drops the objects.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.100
And also, the second
thing we focused on,

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.040
is to compare two cases-- one
is when she wears the glove.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.310
And then the other
case when she does not

01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:08.740
wear the glove in
terms of when would you

01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.100
grips different types
of objects, including

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.680
a cup, phone, plate, and a fork.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.665
And record different
holding times

01:29:17.665 --> 01:29:22.650
in the case when she grabs
various objects, both

01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.034
when she wears the glove and the
when does not wear the glove.

01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:33.040
SHRUTI: So we took a lot of data
in the beginning, especially

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.630
when we had to make
our second prototype,

01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:39.000
to figure out how
to sort of adjust

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.880
the code so that it would
work for her range of however

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.840
she would grip.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.450
And so, if you
can see here, this

01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:46.960
is like an example of the
kind of data we had to get.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.080
A lot of it is just
voltage readings,

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.220
but the key voltage
values here are

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.090
what voltage do we see when she
drops-- or she's about to drop

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.380
the object that she's holding.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.850
And what finger are we
reading this value from.

01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:02.710
And so based on that, we
were able to figure out

01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:04.220
how to tune the
code to accommodate

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:06.280
for all of her fingers.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.020
We were also able to get time.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.560
So the time in the
very last column

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.720
is approximately how
long she is holding it

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.740
before she either
unconsciously slips

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.640
it, or needs to put it down.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.390
And we actually saw
just between not

01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:22.720
having a prototype versus
having that second prototype,

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:28.010
a noticeable increase in the
amount of time, by about 50%.

01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:30.530
Unfortunately since our
prototype only recently

01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:33.390
became portable, we weren't
able to give it to her

01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.150
for a long period of time.

01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:38.890
And so we'd like to measure her
drop rate over about a week,

01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:41.580
and then see, after she's
gone accustomed to the device,

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:45.030
whether the time it takes for
her to drop it is longer now,

01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.079
instead of what it was before.

01:30:47.079 --> 01:30:49.370
And that's what we'll be
doing over the next few weeks.

01:30:52.425 --> 01:30:54.300
VINNIE: Here are a couple
reflections that we

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.890
had on the design process.

01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:58.600
So one thing, especially,
is that simplicity is key.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.490
I know this is something
very emphasized in the class,

01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:03.500
and that's very true.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.170
Another thing is that, in
order to design something

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:09.232
that your client can
use in real life,

01:31:09.232 --> 01:31:11.190
it's very important to
have multiple prototypes

01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:14.230
and to be able to deal with
any technical difficulties

01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:16.980
that you have, that come
up with the process.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.860
And, of course, you
always have to listen

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.190
to who you're working
with, because you're

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:26.100
a partner and a team, it's
not a customer/company sort

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.140
of relationship.

01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:31.600
And some reflections on
6.811 PPAT-- we were all

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.690
really glad we took the class.

01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:37.320
We kind of wish we had other
ways to educate ourselves

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.397
through about
disabilities beforehand,

01:31:39.397 --> 01:31:41.730
but we're really glad this
class give us the opportunity

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.790
to explore that.

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:45.207
And I'm just going to leave
you guys with this one quote--

01:31:45.207 --> 01:31:47.123
"If there's one thing
that PPAT has taught me,

01:31:47.123 --> 01:31:49.180
it's that a disability
isn't a good enough reason

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.910
to stop doing anything."

01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:52.460
Thanks, and we'll
take questions.

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.945
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:56.933 --> 01:31:59.418
PROFESSOR: Team Art can get
set up while we take questions.

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:07.370
GUEST SPEAKER: Is the
[INAUDIBLE] design--

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:12.340
is that something she'll have
to [INAUDIBLE] wearing and using

01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.825
[? based ?] [? on her ?]
[? lifestyle ?] and where

01:32:14.825 --> 01:32:18.304
the wires are out and there.

01:32:18.304 --> 01:32:21.690
Are there any ideas
for casing it?

01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:25.130
SHRUTI: So in terms of actually
being able to slip it on,

01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:26.760
we found that that's
relatively easy.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.890
And in terms of body
placement, we checked with her

01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:30.610
to make sure that was OK.

01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:32.480
The wires are honestly
our biggest problem

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.846
right now, because
they stick out,

01:32:34.846 --> 01:32:36.470
and if they get caught
on to something,

01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:38.910
that could be really
dangerous and could rip apart

01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:39.840
the circuitry.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.010
So along with giving
her the prototype

01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:45.720
to see how it works for
her out in the field

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.240
for like the next
few weeks, we're

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.260
also going to talk about how
to cover all of the circuitry

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.650
so that it doesn't stick out.

01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:57.190
And we have like cloth
and other materials

01:32:57.190 --> 01:32:59.905
ready to like start sort of
making this more compact.

01:33:02.695 --> 01:33:07.080
AUDIENCE: Have you thought
about using conductive thread?

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.260
SHRUTI: So we did.

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:15.520
The only issue was that the
board that we were using

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.910
required some components
that would require wires

01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:24.120
anyways, and so, as
a result-- and plus,

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.840
actually connecting to the
glove would have definitely

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.280
required wires, because
there's like a gap in cloth

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.310
here that she wanted to have
a watch or bangles and such.

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:37.610
So we needed to
use wires anyways,

01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:40.630
so we figured that
we might as well go

01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:41.840
the whole way with wires.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.998
And this way, we can
modify stuff easier.

01:33:43.998 --> 01:33:45.706
[? VINNIE: The only thing ?]
[? placed ?]

01:33:45.706 --> 01:33:48.657
[? in the lilypad ?] though is
that that's actually the one

01:33:48.657 --> 01:33:49.698
she's working on herself.

01:33:49.698 --> 01:33:51.195
Like she's [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:56.890 --> 01:33:58.181
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

01:33:58.181 --> 01:33:59.179
PROFESSOR: Yeah sure.

01:33:59.179 --> 01:34:01.674
AUDIENCE: My last
question is actually--

01:34:01.674 --> 01:34:03.670
so it seems like the
big thing for her

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.915
is that she needs
to remember that she

01:34:05.915 --> 01:34:07.662
is trying to grip something.

01:34:07.662 --> 01:34:10.157
And I wonder how much of
that reminder is simply

01:34:10.157 --> 01:34:12.652
from wearing
something on her hand,

01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:15.437
because it's kind of bulky, and
so it's kind of like, oh yeah,

01:34:15.437 --> 01:34:16.145
I'm wearing this.

01:34:16.145 --> 01:34:19.638
All right, I [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:19.638 --> 01:34:22.160
And [? that's ?] [? it. ?]
[? Will you ?] [? have ?]

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.488
[? to vibrate ?] only
when she's about to drop

01:34:24.488 --> 01:34:26.464
or if it's everything
that's [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:26.464 --> 01:34:28.934
If it's vibrating the entire
time she's holding something,

01:34:28.934 --> 01:34:34.880
is that enough of a reminder
to prevent her from dropping?

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:37.040
VINNIE: So I'm not
really sure, because when

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:40.110
we were talking to her, and
she was focusing on it--

01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:41.790
so when she had the
glove, we ended up

01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:44.540
having to just ask her questions
so her mind would be distracted

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:45.040
off of it.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.770
So I think if it's a
continuous vibration,

01:34:47.770 --> 01:34:50.572
she might get
habituated to it and not

01:34:50.572 --> 01:34:52.780
recognize it as something
that she has to respond to.

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.480
SHRUTI: That was that was our
main concern-- that if we just

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.550
had some sort of static device,
that she would get used to it,

01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:02.010
and then start ignoring it.

01:35:02.010 --> 01:35:04.500
But when we did
the data analysis,

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.659
we made sure that as soon
as her grip starts to slip--

01:35:07.659 --> 01:35:09.700
and we worked on this
really carefully with her--

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:10.840
it would buzz immediately.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.720
And she really felt
that it notified her

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.810
as soon as she was in any
danger of dropping something.

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:18.580
So she was like,
this is much better

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:20.910
than having some sort
of consistent reminder.

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:24.150
ROBERT: Also, I feel like it's
not really about her forgot

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:26.012
about she is
grabbing something--

01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:27.470
she knows she's
grabbing something,

01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:28.928
but it's just
gradually, over time,

01:35:28.928 --> 01:35:31.120
she's not sure how much
force she is exerting,

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.070
because she cannot
feel her fingers.

01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:36.830
So because of that, she
generally loses confidence

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:40.320
in grabbing things, just
because of the fear of she

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:40.960
might drop it.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.160
So it's really more
about telling her

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.280
that you won't drop
it, and just be

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.180
confident with grabbing things.

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.670
And then whenever you are about
to drop it, we will notify you.

01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:53.260
So having that
confidence really puts it

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.100
back into a normal
condition-- we're

01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:00.517
giving her the capability of
grabbing things with one hand.

01:36:00.517 --> 01:36:01.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:01.933
Thank you very much.

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.250
RACHEL: Hi everyone.

01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.970
I'm Rachel.

01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:12.980
This is Jessica, and
this is Stephanie.

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.196
We're Team Art, and
we're here to talk to you

01:36:15.196 --> 01:36:17.570
about the vertical screw lift
that we spent this semester

01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:20.420
designing and building.

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:22.080
First we'd like you
to meet Art, who's

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.163
actually right over there.

01:36:23.163 --> 01:36:25.910
We are really happy he
was able to come today.

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:28.250
He is an avid
hacker, rock climber,

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:29.790
and member of his
community, which

01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:32.450
is the town of Billerica,
Massachusetts, where

01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:34.000
he lives with his girlfriend.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.490
He is a very active,
gets himself around,

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:39.210
is very independent,
and wanted to be

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:43.352
able to take
advantage-- he works

01:36:43.352 --> 01:36:44.810
a lot with mechanical
tools, and he

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.470
wanted to be able to get in
and out of his wheelchair

01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:48.490
onto the floor.

01:36:48.490 --> 01:36:52.550
He's in a chair because he has
T5 Asia B Paraplegia, and that

01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:54.710
means he has no motor
function and limited

01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:58.800
sensory function below the
legs-- below the waist, sorry.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.910
He has a hacker space at the
Artisan's Asylum in Somerville,

01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:05.560
and this is where we spent most
of our time meeting with him.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.930
So, as I just said, our
goal was to design a lift

01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:11.360
to help Art move up
and down from the floor

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.410
in multiple settings.

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:15.420
So the idea was he would be
able to use it at his home,

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:18.240
or at the Artisan's
Asylum, or maybe

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.370
bring it into his car to take
it wherever he might be going.

01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:23.210
And we had a couple
of design goals

01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:26.090
with this-- we wanted a
clearance height of four inches

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.940
or less.

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:30.920
We wanted it to be able to lift
Art in less than 45 seconds,

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.190
because existing
devices like pull swings

01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:34.740
tend to be very slow.

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:37.630
And we wanted it to weigh
less than 20 pounds which

01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:39.860
is what his girlfriend
is capable of lifting,

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:43.410
but lift up to 300.

01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:45.905
The bottom line though, really
the most important thing

01:37:45.905 --> 01:37:47.780
in all of this, was that
we wanted our design

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.620
to be portable, and we
wanted it to be safe to use.

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.370
And with a mechanical
device like this,

01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:55.490
this is surprisingly
difficult to accomplish.

01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:58.070
So I wanted to walk you all
through the sorts of designs

01:37:58.070 --> 01:38:01.100
we were considering
while we were doing this.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:03.256
The first thing we
talked about as a team

01:38:03.256 --> 01:38:05.755
was this scissor lift design,
which is used quite frequently

01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:07.200
in industrial settings.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:10.700
It's what you might see on one
of those like cherry picker

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.600
things that the
telephone guy uses.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.280
But they're very complicated
pieces of machinery, actually,

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:20.820
and the actuators and hinges
are very expensive for them.

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.710
So we decided this
is not a good option.

01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:27.410
Next we thought about a
sort of out-there solution--

01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:30.460
the idea of using
a lifting cushion.

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.860
But these, we realized
after talking to Art,

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.720
would present us with
stability problems--

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:36.820
if we wanted variable
height, which

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.480
we do he might want to
transfer to a 12-inch surface

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.540
or an eight-inch surface,
or maybe to something

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:43.240
higher than his chair even.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.840
If it was only
partially inflated,

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.120
transferring on and
off of the cushions

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:50.380
would be a huge problem.

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:54.230
So we started talking about
using this tripod design, which

01:38:54.230 --> 01:38:58.290
would be very stable, and had
fewer parts than the scissor

01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.880
jack, we thought.

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.870
But the more we talked
about it, the more

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:05.878
we realized that the pulley
that we had designed,

01:39:05.878 --> 01:39:08.130
like right here-- that
pulls the seat up and down

01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:11.400
wasn't going to provide a safety
for Art when the motor was off.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.300
So the seat would be in
danger of sliding up and down.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.420
And so we'd have to install some
sort of manual break or chain

01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:19.976
mechanism, and we
thought long and hard

01:39:19.976 --> 01:39:21.600
about how to implement
this and decided

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.760
we weren't sure how to do it,
so we needed another idea.

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:28.080
And those of you who were
able to join us last time

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.538
will remember that we brought
in this cute little prototype

01:39:30.538 --> 01:39:32.970
about this big that
had a screw built

01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.870
into it, which basically-- you
turn the screw and the seat

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.120
goes up or the seat goes down.

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.260
And the thing that's
really wonderful

01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.200
that this is that even
when the motor's off,

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.786
the seat doesn't move
vertically at all.

01:39:43.786 --> 01:39:46.263
It's quite stationary.

01:39:46.263 --> 01:39:50.064
It's very stationary,
even on our big design.

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:56.170
So we can go to the next slide.

01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:58.510
STEPHANIE: So we
will be showing you

01:39:58.510 --> 01:40:01.208
our product and our functions.

01:40:01.208 --> 01:40:03.360
So currently what
Rachel is doing

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.902
is connecting a few 24-volt
batteries through Anderson

01:40:07.902 --> 01:40:10.890
plugs to our motor,
which was provided by Don

01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:12.585
Fredette of The Boston Home.

01:40:12.585 --> 01:40:16.545
It's been critically useful.

01:40:16.545 --> 01:40:22.485
So as you can see, because
that's a bi-directional switch,

01:40:22.485 --> 01:40:25.620
we have the capability
of having the motors turn

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:27.930
to different directions,
so we can essentially

01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:32.880
move the seat up-- Yes, thanks.

01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:38.560
As you can see, it
functions perfectly fine.

01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:45.350
So what exactly is this
contraption made of?

01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:47.720
Well, the frame is
actually made up

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.770
of a bunch of
80-20 aluminum rods

01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:52.300
that we actually scrounged
from an abandoned

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.290
laser in the physics lab.

01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:57.880
So the entire frame
would probably

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.120
cost you $200 to maybe $400
if we purchased directly

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.160
from the 80-20 site, so
we got really lucky there.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.350
The lifting mechanism
is actually--

01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:13.570
it's essentially a Acme rod
that we-- a threaded Acme rod

01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:15.600
that we purchased ourselves.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.620
And this is the life-size
version of the tiny screw

01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:23.470
that you guys saw in the
previous balsa wood tiny model.

01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:26.920
And we were able to obtain that
motor that's turning the Acme

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.960
rod and these batteries
from again Don

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.140
Fredette from The Boston Home.

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:36.430
The seat is made of
aluminum, and it was actually

01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:40.230
water jetted by someone from
the course three department.

01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:43.380
It weighs approximately
8 to 10 pounds,

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:47.380
so it bears a decent
bulk of the weight.

01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.680
And there is a lot of connective
hardware in our device.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.720
To actually interface the
motor with the Acme rob,

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.080
we had to purchase a few
sprockets and a chain

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:03.010
in order to actually
have the motor actuate

01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:05.770
the spinning motion
of the rod itself.

01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:09.410
And we had to purchase several
flanges, flange bearings,

01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:12.410
and thrust bearings in
order to reduce friction

01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:15.980
between the Acme rod
and the 80-20 frame

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:18.770
itself, as well as
actually connect

01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:21.955
the Acme rod to the seat.

01:42:21.955 --> 01:42:26.050
So as Rachel mentioned
before, our desired features

01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:31.020
involve preferably
moving Art up and down

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:36.540
about 22 to 24 inches
in less than 45 seconds.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.150
We would like a clearance
distance of four inches,

01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:44.540
and we wanted the device to
weigh less than 20 pounds.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.890
Currently, our device
lifts and lowers

01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:51.750
a complete length in
approximately 30 seconds,

01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:54.100
so we definitely met
the first feature.

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:56.230
We also met the second
feature in the sense

01:42:56.230 --> 01:42:59.330
that we have a clearance
distance of four inches.

01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:01.730
Unfortunately, we
were unable to make

01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:04.600
this apparatus weigh
less 15 pounds,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.200
because it weighs 30 pounds.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.110
And that can be attributed
to the really, really

01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:12.230
heavy aluminum frames.

01:43:12.230 --> 01:43:14.770
And currently, it
actually does not

01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:18.260
lift weight, because
the motor does not

01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:20.410
provide enough torque
to actually lift

01:43:20.410 --> 01:43:22.440
a significant amount of weight.

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:31.734
JESSICA: So we got pretty
close with this design,

01:43:31.734 --> 01:43:33.650
but there are still a
few improvements that we

01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:35.540
would have liked to make.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.470
First and foremost, we
need higher torque motor.

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:41.380
Our current motor does
not have enough torque

01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:44.977
to actually lift
weight and that's

01:43:44.977 --> 01:43:46.435
the primary function
of our device,

01:43:46.435 --> 01:43:49.590
so if we can't perform
that, it's a problem.

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:53.240
We would also like to reduce
the weight of this contraption,

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.840
because it is a little
heavier than we'd like.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:00.070
So lighter and thinner
parts would be optimal.

01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:02.390
Another issue is portability.

01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:04.280
That was one of our
original design goals

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.250
and we haven't quite
gotten there yet.

01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:09.580
Our current idea
would be to add wheels

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.720
to the back end
of it and a handle

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.170
so that you could
tilt and pull back.

01:44:16.170 --> 01:44:21.020
And safety-- the
device is pretty safe,

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:23.806
except for the loose
chain that's open here,

01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:25.555
so we would like to
be able to cover that.

01:44:28.485 --> 01:44:29.860
And some of the
things that we've

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:35.430
learned through this project
are that parts are expensive.

01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:36.720
Software is not so expensive.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.980
Parts are expensive.

01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:44.940
Understanding and designing for
your user is very important,

01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:48.280
but you also have to keep in
mind safety, and feasibility,

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.950
and it can be
pretty complicated.

01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:53.440
Iteration, therefore, is key.

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:56.270
That is one of the most
important things you can do.

01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:59.960
And sadly, with our limited time
frame, and our large device,

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.625
it was hard to iterate
as much as we wanted.

01:45:03.625 --> 01:45:06.000
Like I said, the most valuable
resource there, of course,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.940
would be time, since we didn't
have enough time to iterate

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:09.940
as much as we'd like.

01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:16.520
Reaching out to others
for assistance--

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.080
that's super important.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.550
We received a lot
of help from Art

01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:23.560
from the Department
of Material Science.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:28.180
And we received a
lot of help from Don,

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.150
who gave us a lot
of parts, and who

01:45:30.150 --> 01:45:32.860
helped us connect
all of this together.

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:35.625
And from the PPAT
staff in general.

01:45:35.625 --> 01:45:37.500
And so with that, we'd
like to thank you guys

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.492
and open the floor to questions.

01:45:39.492 --> 01:45:41.982
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:46.330 --> 01:45:48.788
ROB MILLER: I wonder if you
could talk a bit about-- I know

01:45:48.788 --> 01:45:50.946
you said that it can't
actually lift anyone,

01:45:50.946 --> 01:45:52.938
but did Art try to get on it?

01:45:52.938 --> 01:45:56.922
So what is the process
like for getting yourself

01:45:56.922 --> 01:45:58.416
situated on that platform?

01:45:58.416 --> 01:46:02.898
And is it stable enough to
be [? in that ?] [? state ?]

01:46:02.898 --> 01:46:04.930
without falling
over [INAUDIBLE]?

01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:09.070
STEPHANIE: So it's definitely
based on Rachel just

01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:11.220
standing on the apparatus
and jumping on it--

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:14.430
it's definitely stable in terms
of actually holding up weight.

01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:15.180
But the issue is--

01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.150
RACHEL: I should add though--
this is a new development.

01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:19.804
That was not true
until Sunday, when

01:46:19.804 --> 01:46:22.220
Art helped us [? machine ?]
apart to keep the seat stable.

01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.322
We had all of this working,
except the [? seat ?] was

01:46:26.322 --> 01:46:28.310
wobbly for the
longest time, and we

01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:31.789
were concerned about this as
a design feature, obviously.

01:46:31.789 --> 01:46:35.268
We actually didn't get to
the point of having tried it,

01:46:35.268 --> 01:46:38.250
but we'd like to do that
[INAUDIBLE] questions?

01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:42.226
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:46:42.226 --> 01:46:44.214
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:44.214 --> 01:46:46.250
STEPHANIE: Ideally
though, there should

01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:49.034
be no issue with Art
transferring into and out

01:46:49.034 --> 01:46:51.200
of the chair, because this
would be positioned right

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.200
next to his wheelchair,
so that he would have

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.890
to do a slide over
onto the chair,

01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:58.314
once it's set at
the ideal height.

01:46:58.314 --> 01:46:59.980
ROB MILLER: But if
you're on the floor--

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:00.925
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:47:00.925 --> 01:47:04.029
ROB MILLER: [INAUDIBLE] lift
himself up and [INAUDIBLE].

01:47:04.029 --> 01:47:04.570
RACHEL: Yeah.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:12.160
So the clearance of four inches
was a design goal given by Art.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.506
Four inches is the
maximum distance

01:47:14.506 --> 01:47:16.380
that he's comfortably
able to move vertically

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:17.930
to a different surface.

01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:21.395
JESSICA: And so we were trying
to counter that with the design

01:47:21.395 --> 01:47:23.870
[? itself. ?]

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:27.335
GUEST SPEAKER: So that frame
that's parallel to the chair,

01:47:27.335 --> 01:47:30.800
and running through [INAUDIBLE]
come up to seat height,

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.780
and then you would [INAUDIBLE].

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:39.192
PROFESSOR: Any questions?

01:47:39.192 --> 01:47:41.525
AUDIENCE: What do you think
are the trade-offs of making

01:47:41.525 --> 01:47:43.910
it lighter and the
safety [? constraints? ?]

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:46.225
if it's lighter, wouldn't
it be easier to tip over?

01:47:46.225 --> 01:47:49.470
Have you guys thought about
what happens if it falls over.

01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:52.065
RACHEL: So I guess I should
talk into the microphone.

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:57.370
Basically, no,
because the center

01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:00.169
of mass of this
contraption is always

01:48:00.169 --> 01:48:02.460
going to be over the center
of the center of the frame,

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:06.860
and with a user on it,
or transferring onto it,

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.650
there's always going to be
weight over the support base.

01:48:11.650 --> 01:48:13.520
In terms of making
it lighter, we

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.940
wouldn't be looking probably
to replace the entire frame.

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:18.990
We might make it out of
like a smaller 80-20.

01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:20.580
i feel like that
was a possibility.

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:22.663
But the biggest thing we
could do to reduce weight

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:24.440
is to reduce the
thickness of the seat.

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.784
Half inch aluminum holds
up like 1,000 pounds,

01:48:26.784 --> 01:48:27.950
and that's just unnecessary.

01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:30.590
It's just happened to be
what we had lying around.

01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:33.140
It was what we didn't
have to pay for.

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:36.130
And if we had a lot of time, we
would probably go and mill out

01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:40.350
some shapes in the bottom to
optimize thickness where it was

01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:45.150
necessary and cut out extra
weight where it wasn't.

01:48:45.150 --> 01:48:47.960
The other reason that
it's heavy in general

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.670
is just that we ended up
finding that lighter components,

01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:53.092
like components that weren't
made for heavy-duty usage

01:48:53.092 --> 01:48:54.550
we're going to
stand up to the wear

01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:57.010
and tear we expected
this device to see.

01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:58.960
We actually had a
second prototype

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:01.330
that never made it in here,
because it was terrible.

01:49:01.330 --> 01:49:03.871
We bought cheap components, and
they were lighter components,

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:07.350
and they didn't work
at the rotations.

01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:10.260
That rod right now is
turning at 400 RPM,

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.610
and so it has to be
able to spin really

01:49:13.610 --> 01:49:15.710
smoothly and without bending.

01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:18.270
And so any material
that's tool-grade steel

01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:21.746
doesn't work and et
cetera, et cetera.

01:49:21.746 --> 01:49:22.621
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:49:22.621 --> 01:49:24.529
In the interest of
time, we should move on,

01:49:24.529 --> 01:49:26.437
but thank you very much.

01:49:26.437 --> 01:49:28.690
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:30.926
Can we get Team Paul to set up?

01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:39.400
YI: So we're Team Paul.

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.370
My name is Yi.

01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:42.150
LEXIE: I'm Lexie.

01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:43.650
BRADY: And I'm Brady

01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:47.392
YI: And we are design
a coffee crane.

01:49:47.392 --> 01:49:48.810
Which we'll let you know.

01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:50.950
So first we just want
to quickly review.

01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:52.640
So our client is Paul.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.960
He has been an amputee
for over 30 years,

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.220
so he uses these forearm
crutches to help him.

01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:04.510
And then because he had
an injury with his hip,

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:07.290
[INAUDIBLE] so he's been kind
of regaining his strength.

01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:08.790
And he's doing
physical therapy now,

01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:10.290
so he's mostly staying home.

01:50:10.290 --> 01:50:13.019
So our client's not
going to be around.

01:50:13.019 --> 01:50:14.560
So we're designing
this for the home.

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.800
So the problem
statement is we want

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.190
to design a device
or a mechanism that

01:50:19.190 --> 01:50:21.430
allows Paul to carry at
least one full cup of coffee

01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:24.230
around his house without
spilling of without gripping

01:50:24.230 --> 01:50:30.240
onto the cup like is, which
is how he carries it before.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.641
And the success metrics that
we had were current status--

01:50:36.641 --> 01:50:38.140
well, I guess, the
previous status--

01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.049
is that coffee cup can only
be filled to one third full.

01:50:41.049 --> 01:50:43.340
So in the morning, he can
only fill it up to one third,

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.910
walk to the sofa, and then
sit down, and then drink

01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:48.580
the one third cup of coffee
and then go back to get more.

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.040
And he had to
claw-grip on the cup.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.049
So because he's using
crutches, that sometimes

01:50:54.049 --> 01:50:56.340
can be turbulent-- so even
if it's only one third full,

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.710
it can still spill on his hand.

01:50:58.710 --> 01:51:01.390
And so when we were
coming up with goals,

01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:04.190
we two goals-- the livable
goals and the ambitious goal.

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:06.710
So we wanted to
design something that

01:51:06.710 --> 01:51:08.840
doesn't spill when
it's 2/3 full,

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.990
and there's no need
to hold on to the cup

01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:12.830
like he does now,
where it's clawing.

01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:15.300
And then hopefully it can
be removable with 20 seconds

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.400
on and off time.

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.780
And then Paul gives us a
rating of six out of 10,

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.800
and it works for
one of his mugs.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.390
Because that's one
of the main things

01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:25.550
Paul wants is he wants to use
his mugs, instead of maybe

01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:26.930
a thermal or something.

01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:31.350
An ambitious goal is no spill
with coffee cup 3/4 full,

01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:32.630
and no need to hold it.

01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:34.725
And then removable
within 10 seconds,

01:51:34.725 --> 01:51:36.350
and then Paul rates
it eight out of 10,

01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:38.800
and it works for
all of his mugs.

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.430
And then just some of
our early prototypes.

01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:43.380
So we were thinking
of maybe if we just

01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:47.720
cover the cup with one of these,
which works really well-- it

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.800
will not spill.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.700
And then just maybe put it
in one of the stage holders,

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:54.260
and then just put the stage
holder on his crutches.

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:57.360
And because his mug didn't fit
in that-- that's too small--

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.430
we were thinking of
another kind of cover,

01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:02.760
which is the flexiCover.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.320
So it takes actually a
lot of strength to put on,

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.367
and you have to stretch it.

01:52:07.367 --> 01:52:08.950
And then we were
thinking, well, maybe

01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:12.180
we can use some sort of
gyroscopic cup holder

01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:14.620
idea, which allows it to swing.

01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:18.490
And then this works horrible,
and there's spilling

01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:20.130
even when you put the cup in.

01:52:20.130 --> 01:52:22.850
And then we thinking
this kind of clamp

01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:26.610
to clamp onto his crutches,
which we have here.

01:52:26.610 --> 01:52:32.010
And Paul actually destroyed
it, because it's too weak.

01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:34.710
He broke this things
when we tested it.

01:52:34.710 --> 01:52:36.612
And then, after all
those iterations

01:52:36.612 --> 01:52:38.070
and looking for
the right products,

01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:42.370
we have a final prototype.

01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:45.990
LEXIE: So our final
prototype-- one of the main

01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:51.240
we-- products that we
found was the Spill Not.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.570
And basically it's a product
that if you put a coffee

01:52:55.570 --> 01:53:00.490
mug on it, you can put it
at any angle basically,

01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:03.690
and it won't spill the contents.

01:53:03.690 --> 01:53:06.880
And this has to do
with the forces--

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.440
as you move this way--
counteract the other forces.

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:14.975
So, magic.

01:53:14.975 --> 01:53:17.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:20.855
But this definitely works
with basically any mug

01:53:20.855 --> 01:53:22.730
that you could put in
here, and it definitely

01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:25.440
works with all of Paul's
mugs, and probably any he

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:26.770
would get in the future.

01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:29.390
And it definitely is no spill.

01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:33.550
The only time it would spill
is if it hit something or gets

01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:35.250
jarred in any way.

01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:40.590
So we decided to put it on a
rod far away from his crutch

01:53:40.590 --> 01:53:43.600
so it wouldn't actually
hit into his crutch,

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:46.420
and basically just
put a hook on the end

01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:52.180
so that he could easily
connect it onto the rod.

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:56.740
And then it would be easy
to just slip on and off.

01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:59.640
And we needed a stronger
clamp, obviously.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:02.040
This is not actually the
one we ended up using.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:03.370
I don't have a picture of it.

01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:09.210
We got clamps from Don
Fredette, and basically it's

01:54:09.210 --> 01:54:11.500
a clamp that he would
leave on there permanently,

01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.060
and he's really OK with that.

01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.860
He actually really
likes that it's there

01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:18.120
and it's very solidly
on his crutch.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:24.670
And then he can just attach
this rod to the clamp then.

01:54:24.670 --> 01:54:28.140
And then we added
this handle on it

01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:31.330
to make it even
easier to put on.

01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:35.070
And this is the product
on Paul's crutch.

01:54:35.070 --> 01:54:36.660
It doesn't have the
handle on it yet.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.686
This picture was taken
before we put in on.

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.870
So some of the
assumptions that we

01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:45.970
made while making
this final prototype

01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:50.100
were that when he's putting
the Spill Not on and off,

01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.960
he would be able
to remain standing,

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.560
and he wouldn't spill anything.

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.400
And that basically he would
be able to move around

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.800
his apartment and
maneuver in there.

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.400
And so when we went to
experiment with this,

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.460
we actually were using the
weaker clamp at the time,

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:12.380
so we basically couldn't test
with the coffee cup in it,

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:16.990
but we were able to test
different rod lengths.

01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:19.690
So there's eight-inch, and
then we also tested a 12-inch,

01:55:19.690 --> 01:55:22.880
and then we tested where
he was able to hold it

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.260
out this way with his
crutch, and this way,

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:28.620
and then this way basically.

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:34.000
And we found that straight
ahead was the best orientation,

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.650
because it didn't
knock into the wall

01:55:35.650 --> 01:55:40.700
and all the other ones
did, with the eight-inch.

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:47.600
So this is a video of
Paul putting the clamp on.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.070
And as you can see, it
doesn't take very much time,

01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:54.420
because the clamp
is already on there,

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:56.480
and he's just
putting the rod on.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:59.380
And then he puts the
Spill Not on top of it.

01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:03.240
And he can maneuver with it.

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.740
And it just kind of
hanging out there.

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.430
And he's able to maneuver.

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:12.870
That's his cat.

01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:15.990
He's able to maneuver around
his apartment fairly easily.

01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:31.650
BRADY: So as you can see
from our success metrics,

01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:33.840
we had Paul test
out the prototype.

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.690
We left it with them for a week.

01:56:35.690 --> 01:56:40.230
Asked for his feedback, and he
gave us very, very enthusiastic

01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:40.870
feedback.

01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:41.510
He loves it.

01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:44.100
He rates it 10 out of 10.

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:46.710
It was actually really nice to
see when we walked in the door

01:56:46.710 --> 01:56:49.350
when we met with them that
he had the clamp still

01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:51.640
on from when we'd given
it to him last week.

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.490
He said he hadn't taken it off.

01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:56.440
So that was really nice.

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.580
And he said he's been
walking around his apartment

01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.260
with full cups of coffee.

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:02.860
He hasn't spilled anything
yet, so he's really

01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.039
really happy about that.

01:57:05.039 --> 01:57:07.080
Obviously he doesn't need
to hold the coffee cup,

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.650
because it's out
on the Spill Not.

01:57:08.650 --> 01:57:11.590
So that was another one of our
ambitious goals that we met.

01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:13.830
The one part that
we didn't quite meet

01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:17.820
is it does take a little bit
longer to put on and take off,

01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.812
because it is that rotating
motion putting on and taking

01:57:21.812 --> 01:57:24.020
out the extension as opposed
to, say, a quick release

01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.228
clamp or something like that.

01:57:25.228 --> 01:57:28.230
But that was a trade-off we were
willing to make because it's

01:57:28.230 --> 01:57:29.670
definitely more sturdy.

01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:32.010
Like we said, he
destroyed our other clamp,

01:57:32.010 --> 01:57:36.030
because he's got really,
really good grip strength.

01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:39.035
And like we said, it works
for all of Paul's mugs.

01:57:39.035 --> 01:57:40.076
So that part's fantastic.

01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:45.890
All right so what did we
learn through all this?

01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:50.370
Nothing is as simple
as it first appears.

01:57:50.370 --> 01:57:52.039
You kind of
underestimate the task

01:57:52.039 --> 01:57:54.330
when you think, oh, I just
need to have him walk around

01:57:54.330 --> 01:57:56.038
his apartment with a
full cup of coffee--

01:57:56.038 --> 01:57:57.630
how hard can that possibly be?

01:57:57.630 --> 01:57:59.965
But it turns out, it was
actually really, really

01:57:59.965 --> 01:58:02.090
difficult, and if it hadn't
been for the Spill Not,

01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:05.012
we probably wouldn't have been
able to accomplish the goal

01:58:05.012 --> 01:58:07.220
that we had set for ourselves,
but that Spill Not was

01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:09.960
definitely a lifesaver.

01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.620
Fail fast and iterate
until success.

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:15.160
Like we said, the covers
probably would've worked OK,

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.840
but they're really hard to put
on and take off, so from then

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.310
that kind of sparked
the rest of our ideas.

01:58:21.310 --> 01:58:23.410
And then with the Spill
Not, we thought maybe

01:58:23.410 --> 01:58:26.240
he could just hang it off
the handle of his crutch

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.382
but that doesn't really
occur to you-- well

01:58:28.382 --> 01:58:30.090
what happens if it
bumps into his crutch,

01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:32.490
and all of a sudden it
start's spilling everywhere?

01:58:32.490 --> 01:58:34.850
So fail fast and
iterate from there.

01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:36.600
And finally, keep the
end user involved.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.020
Paul met with us
pretty much every week.

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:41.306
He was always available,
and we definitely

01:58:41.306 --> 01:58:42.680
came up with
something in the end

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:45.809
that he's very, very happy with.

01:58:45.809 --> 01:58:48.350
And from Paul we learned to be
grateful for the small things,

01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:51.240
such as being able to
carry a full cup of coffee.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:53.370
And his favorite quote
and the thing and he

01:58:53.370 --> 01:58:54.950
said literally every
time we visited

01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:56.700
was 'You guys are
doing wonderful stuff.

01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.850
This is great.

01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:02.440
So keep it up."

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:02.940
All right.

01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:05.028
That's it.

01:59:05.028 --> 01:59:07.463
[APPLAUSE]

01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.910
BRADY: Yes?

01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:11.754
ROB MILLER: So what
you ended up with still

01:59:11.754 --> 01:59:12.990
has three parts to it right?

01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.490
BRADY: Yes.

01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:15.615
ROB MILLER: There's the
bar; there's the Spill Not,

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:19.690
and [? the coffee ?] [? cup. ?]
Did you explore trying to cut

01:59:19.690 --> 01:59:20.664
that down to two?

01:59:20.664 --> 01:59:22.914
Certainly, you need the cup
to be able to [INAUDIBLE]?

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:37.390
BRADY: You mean as in from here
and eliminate the hook portion?

01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:41.090
LEXIE: Well when you're spending
it on, it would kind of-- I

01:59:41.090 --> 01:59:44.130
mean you could do
it, but I think

01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:48.710
that it was a little bit hectic
if you wanted to spin it on,

01:59:48.710 --> 01:59:51.170
it would kind of flip
the Spill Not around.

01:59:51.170 --> 01:59:52.870
BRADY: Plus the
other part is how

01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:55.390
Paul uses it is once
he's out of the kitchen

01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:57.620
and into his living room,
the table is actually

01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.170
at just the right
height where he

01:59:59.170 --> 02:00:02.050
can remain standing and
gently set the Spill not.

02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:04.850
Onto the table and unhook
it from his crutch.

02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:09.110
So then he doesn't
run the risk of-- he

02:00:09.110 --> 02:00:10.600
would you have to
remain standing

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.245
and try and unscrew it with
the cup still on the Spill Not.

02:00:13.245 --> 02:00:14.870
ROB MILLER: It helps
with the delivery.

02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:16.453
BRADY: It helps with
the delivery time

02:00:16.453 --> 02:00:18.607
onto the-- exactly.

02:00:18.607 --> 02:00:22.432
[? ROB MILLER: The ?] other part
of that would be that if you

02:00:22.432 --> 02:00:28.370
could attach the clamp to the
rod, but is difficult for him--

02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:30.330
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

02:00:31.744 --> 02:00:33.660
BRADY: Finding a clamp
that worked really well

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:38.140
and then finding the correct
length rod to keep it out,

02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.750
away from the crutch was
kind of an iterative process.

02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:42.333
Like I said, we tried
out the 12-inch,

02:00:42.333 --> 02:00:44.270
we tried out the eight-inch.

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.770
and.

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.240
Other thing is he
really liked the idea

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.170
of keeping it on
there permanently,

02:00:49.170 --> 02:00:51.389
at least the clamp.

02:00:51.389 --> 02:00:53.680
And if there would have been
a quick release clamp that

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.790
worked very well, we
probably would have looked

02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:57.790
into that a little bit further.

02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:59.540
But the clamp that he
liked the best thing

02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:00.570
and that definitely
worked the best

02:01:00.570 --> 02:01:02.278
is the one that was
on there permanently.

02:01:02.278 --> 02:01:06.748
So it made more sense to just
be able to unscrew the rod.

02:01:06.748 --> 02:01:09.218
AUDIENCE: Could I
suggest that maybe you

02:01:09.218 --> 02:01:10.947
look into getting
him a crutch you

02:01:10.947 --> 02:01:15.650
would attach this to that
he only uses in the house?

02:01:15.650 --> 02:01:18.230
BRADY: So Paul's crutches
are actually custom.

02:01:18.230 --> 02:01:19.870
AUDIENCE: Are they
super expensive?

02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:20.370
BRADY: Yeah.

02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:26.970
The previous group mentioned
like $200 to $400 for aluminum,

02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:29.465
we'd be easily double
that max price.

02:01:32.034 --> 02:01:34.117
ROB MILLER: [INAUDIBLE]
bend you over for any kind

02:01:34.117 --> 02:01:35.370
of adaptable gear.

02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:37.132
AUDIENCE: What?

02:01:37.132 --> 02:01:38.840
ROB MILLER: It's called
any time you say,

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:40.480
oh, adaptable equipment.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:43.170
Drop your drawers and bend
over, because there's something

02:01:43.170 --> 02:01:45.724
you really don't like.

02:01:45.724 --> 02:01:47.140
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm
wondering if we

02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.070
can get t-shirts with that "Fail
fast, iterate until success."

02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:52.380
[LAUGHTER]

02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:54.966
BRADY: The MIT motto right?

02:01:54.966 --> 02:01:57.320
PROFESSOR: In the interest
of time, thank you very much.

02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:57.903
BRADY: Thanks.

02:02:03.295 --> 02:02:03.920
KELLY: Hi guys!

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:04.910
I'm Kelly

02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:05.610
EDDY: I'm Eddy.

02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:06.360
EUNICE: I'm Eunice

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.950
KELLY: And we're here to talk
to you guys about script speak.

02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:12.237
So our client this
semester was Barbara,

02:02:12.237 --> 02:02:14.820
who was a former teacher who now
lives at the Leonard Florence

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.990
Center.

02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:17.670
Barbara, over a
year ago, found out

02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:20.910
that she was diagnosed with
Primary Lateral Sclerosis,

02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:24.020
which is a neurodegenerative
disease, which

02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:25.880
results in muscle weakness.

02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:28.710
As a result, speaking
for her now is very hard,

02:02:28.710 --> 02:02:34.340
and her speaking has gotten more
unclear as time has progressed.

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.080
Because of her
first speech, she's

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.160
faced several challenges
in different sorts

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.300
of environments.

02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:40.800
When it comes to
group environments,

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:43.950
it can be very hard for
people to understand her,

02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:46.432
because often they're
very, very noisy.

02:02:46.432 --> 02:02:47.890
She also trouble
speaking to people

02:02:47.890 --> 02:02:49.820
who don't understand
how her speech

02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:55.330
functions, such as
non-native English speakers,

02:02:55.330 --> 02:02:58.750
or a taxi drivers-- people who
just don't have correspondence

02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:59.760
with her.

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.930
She's also found that in
virtual environments, It's.

02:03:01.930 --> 02:03:04.830
Also very difficult for
her to talk to people.

02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:08.290
So through phone or video chat.

02:03:08.290 --> 02:03:08.790
I'm

02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:12.530
Currently she's tried out two
solutions besides speaking,

02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:15.650
and one of them was
called Proloque4Text.

02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:25.400
This is an assistive
text to voice app,

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.530
and she found a very
unintuitive to use,

02:03:28.530 --> 02:03:31.046
because technology
is not her forte.

02:03:31.046 --> 02:03:32.670
And she also try
using something called

02:03:32.670 --> 02:03:35.890
a BoogieBoard, which is a
more physical board that she

02:03:35.890 --> 02:03:37.890
can use instead.

02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:39.840
And through this,
she found that it

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.920
was nice because
she could write,

02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:44.290
but also kind of inconvenient,
because she would have

02:03:44.290 --> 02:03:46.070
to write out everything
she wanted to say,

02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:47.790
and she couldn't
save it anywhere.

02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:51.120
And so both of these solutions
we're lacking something.

02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:55.310
And knowing that she
was technologically not

02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:59.620
very equipped, we
knew that had to be

02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:02.500
simple to fix her problem.

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:04.740
And so we decided to
create ScriptSpeak.

02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:09.510
ScriptSpeak is a text to voice
app, whose main purpose is

02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:11.930
to be as simple to
use as possible,

02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:14.900
as well as customizable, so the
user can enter in any phrases

02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:16.380
they want.

02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.320
And ultimately, it should
expanded the environment

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:22.980
in which she can speak.

02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.320
EDDY: So our success
metrics are here.

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.350
Our livable goals
is what I'm mainly

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:30.150
cover, which is we wanted
her to be able to attempt

02:04:30.150 --> 02:04:32.060
to speak-- one of
the main reasons

02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:34.740
is you use it or lose it, right?

02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:37.160
So she continues to
try and use her speech,

02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.010
but even over the
course of this class,

02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:43.800
we have seen a significant
decrease in her ability

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.350
to pronounce certain syllables.

02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:48.770
So we want to be able to
try, but if she ends up

02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:51.500
not being able to speak, we
want to be able to either type

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:54.600
out the phrase, or if she's
already spoken that phrase,

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.450
she can find it in her
history or in her favorites

02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.890
within five clicks.

02:04:58.890 --> 02:05:02.660
We want to basically have
her increase the efficiency

02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:06.570
of her speech by lowering her
response time by about 20%

02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:07.410
overall.

02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:10.270
So basically, an amortized
cost over how many times

02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:14.040
she reuses phrases, as opposed
to her current method, which

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.490
she has to type every
phrase, whenever

02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:17.490
she's going to speak it.

02:05:17.490 --> 02:05:20.849
So she can't really reuse
or use the components

02:05:20.849 --> 02:05:23.140
that are available, even
though the features are there.

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:25.350
It's just very
complicated for her.

02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:30.050
And larger, noisier environments
from five to 10 people.

02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:33.290
So right now she's really
OK with speaking to you

02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:35.030
and using her current
apps when it's

02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:39.090
one-to-one or one-to-three,
especially for our meetings.

02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:41.410
But in other
settings, she wasn't

02:05:41.410 --> 02:05:45.530
unable to use her apps
because the iPhone is too low.

02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:48.685
And the iPad app she hadn't used
for an extended period of time,

02:05:48.685 --> 02:05:50.910
so she was very
uncomfortable using it.

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.780
So we wanted to give
her a solution she can

02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:55.700
use in both of those settings.

02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:01.020
So we started prototyping
with her main point being

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:01.692
keep it simple.

02:06:01.692 --> 02:06:02.650
The simpler the better.

02:06:02.650 --> 02:06:06.070
So we started off-- we gave
her this paper prototype where

02:06:06.070 --> 02:06:06.980
we had her test.

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.920
And right from the
start, we found out

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:13.920
that we found that
most of the common UI

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.440
functionality that
we're all used

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.270
to with apps in the
app store don't really

02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:20.460
seem intuitive to her.

02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:23.850
So swiping to delete, and a few
other of these characteristics

02:06:23.850 --> 02:06:25.980
were not something
she would use.

02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:27.780
So we stripped that
down, and we went

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.280
back to how UIs are
more intuitive in terms

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:34.600
of you see, and you click on
it, and that's what you get.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.650
So we see here the star
for favoriting and so on.

02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:40.040
Then we created our second
prototype really quickly,

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.070
because we wanted to get
something in her hand

02:06:42.070 --> 02:06:43.160
with App Inventor.

02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:47.640
So we built basically an app
that she could click the text

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:51.800
and it would like play, and
she can add text and store that

02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.024
into her history.

02:06:53.024 --> 02:06:54.440
So that was our
initial prototype.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.330
Then we started
having the iOS app.

02:06:56.330 --> 02:07:00.110
So we don't want to have no
interaction until too late.

02:07:00.110 --> 02:07:02.060
So we started of-- we
had her history page

02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:03.950
and her favorites page
right from the start.

02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:06.800
But we needed to
update a few things

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:11.850
so we could have the stars be
on and off as she would like it.

02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:13.850
And then we connected both.

02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:15.537
So whatever she did
on the history page,

02:07:15.537 --> 02:07:17.120
it was reflected on
the favorites page

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.640
if it was necessary.

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:22.860
And then after we finished
this, we brought it to her,

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:26.397
and we got a piece of
feedback we didn't expect,

02:07:26.397 --> 02:07:27.980
which is that she
wanted it to connect

02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.530
between her iPhone and her iPad.

02:07:29.530 --> 02:07:31.550
Initially, she said
that her iPhone

02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:34.350
was too low-- the
volume was too low,

02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:37.040
so she really couldn't use
it in most environments,

02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.252
but then she told
us that if she's

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:42.710
going to be a smaller setting,
she's in her phone with her,

02:07:42.710 --> 02:07:44.800
because it's less heavy.

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:46.800
So we needed to
connect both of them.

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:49.340
So we just connected
the apps through Parse,

02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:51.126
and we're going to
deliver that to her.

02:07:51.126 --> 02:07:52.500
So the functionality
is the same.

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:54.459
It's just now whatever
she types in in one

02:07:54.459 --> 02:07:55.750
will be reflected in the other.

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:00.460
So we'll have a demo for you.

02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:01.876
KELLY: Now we're
going to show you

02:08:01.876 --> 02:08:04.570
guys a demo using the simulator.

02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:06.830
However, the text-to-speech
doesn't actually

02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:13.720
play on a laptop, so we will
play it for you on our iPad.

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:15.840
But as you can see,
we have the app

02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:18.010
working on both the
phone and the iPad,

02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:19.460
so it's customizable for both.

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:21.152
EDDY: Trying to
find your screen.

02:08:21.152 --> 02:08:22.565
KELLY: Pull it that way.

02:08:22.565 --> 02:08:25.144
EDDY: This way?

02:08:25.144 --> 02:08:26.935
Seems like the simulator
cannot be dragged.

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:34.860
KELLY: It can't be dragged over.

02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:36.193
EDDY: It cannot be dragged over.

02:08:36.193 --> 02:08:37.480
KELLY: Can you switch it?

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.430
No, you can switch
the-- [INAUDIBLE].

02:08:41.706 --> 02:08:43.678
I don't remember [? that. ?]

02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:52.410
EDDY: In any event, we do have--

02:08:52.410 --> 02:08:54.498
KELLY: Wait [INAUDIBLE]
should be moving.

02:08:54.498 --> 02:08:55.956
AUDIENCE: Go in
System Preferences.

02:08:55.956 --> 02:08:58.420
EDDY: Oh, in System Preferences?

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.110
So in any event, we do have
the app loaded onto our iPad.

02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:05.800
So we added the feature
that she can compose

02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.740
a sentence with
previously said text,

02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:12.290
and then she can
play it in the end.

02:09:12.290 --> 02:09:13.748
So can store her
name, and whenever

02:09:13.748 --> 02:09:17.100
she has to type in her name,
it's always there for her.

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.610
We also added that she
can delete her messages,

02:09:20.610 --> 02:09:24.090
and she can go to her
history, and in her history

02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:26.050
she can favorite the items.

02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:27.624
And then if she
deletes these items--

02:09:27.624 --> 02:09:29.040
SYNTHETIC SPEECH:
This is awesome.

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.205
EDDY: So she can play it.

02:09:31.205 --> 02:09:32.710
A little plug-in there.

02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:34.614
And if she delete
these from her--

02:09:34.614 --> 02:09:36.030
SYNTHETIC SPEECH:
This is awesome.

02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:38.450
EDDY: I'm sorry.

02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:42.000
If she deletes these
from her favorites,

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.090
it reflects in her history.

02:09:44.090 --> 02:09:46.490
And since we also delete
it from the history,

02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:49.030
it no longer shows up.

02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:54.820
We have another,
more intensive--

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.200
technical difficulties.

02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.513
KELLY: Sorry, the simulator's
too big for that screen,

02:09:59.513 --> 02:10:00.932
so we just have to go.

02:10:00.932 --> 02:10:04.640
EDDY (WHISPERING): So
we'll just continue on.

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:09.300
It's fine we'll
just continue on.

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:11.219
it'll be fine.

02:10:11.219 --> 02:10:13.260
KELLY (WHISPERING): I
don't know how to use this.

02:10:26.344 --> 02:10:27.010
EDDY: All right.

02:10:30.595 --> 02:10:32.020
KELLY: Present,
present, present.

02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.150
EDDY: So that's most
of the functionality.

02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:40.360
And now it's connected as well.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.930
And she's been using
this past week.

02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:45.960
A week and a half.

02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:48.020
EUNICE: So we did a couple
experiments with her

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:51.510
to see how well our app worked
compared to all the other ways.

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:54.630
So we asked her to say
a short phrase first.

02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:57.479
So just to say "Hi, my name is
Barbara" four different ways.

02:10:57.479 --> 02:10:59.770
First by speaking, and then
writing on the BoogieBoard,

02:10:59.770 --> 02:11:03.070
and then ScriptSpeak, and
then also her app Proloque.

02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:09.727
As you can see, the
second time-- the orange

02:11:09.727 --> 02:11:11.810
is when she writes the
phrase the very first time,

02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:14.010
and then she saves
it in the app.

02:11:14.010 --> 02:11:17.450
And then when she
closes the app and then

02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:22.370
access it the second time,
ScriptSpeak is a lot faster.

02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:25.450
The first time takes
a while, because this

02:11:25.450 --> 02:11:26.780
was on her iPad, which is new.

02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:29.110
So the auto correct
wasn't trained enough

02:11:29.110 --> 02:11:30.568
with what she usually says.

02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:39.280
So another thing
that we also measured

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.950
was the number of
clicks that it takes.

02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:46.797
Also for ScriptSpeak, it
takes a lot fewer clicks.

02:11:46.797 --> 02:11:47.630
As you can see here.

02:11:47.630 --> 02:11:49.870
And also for Proloque,
the other app,

02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:53.800
it is very inconsistent, because
it's very confusing for her.

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:56.200
So even though she saved
it, she couldn't find it,

02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.070
so she had to end up
typing it again, which

02:11:58.070 --> 02:12:01.310
is why it takes so many clicks.

02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:05.715
This is a video of
her using Proloque.

02:12:05.715 --> 02:12:08.010
Play it.

02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:09.998
We don't have time
for the video.

02:12:14.428 --> 02:12:15.922
EDDY: We can play it.

02:12:19.408 --> 02:12:21.410
KELLY: Oh my gosh.

02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:24.710
OK, we can move on then.

02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:26.370
EDDY: So basically
in the video, you

02:12:26.370 --> 02:12:29.090
see that she doesn't feel
comfortable with Proloque.

02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:30.671
So we asked her to
repeat the phrase,

02:12:30.671 --> 02:12:32.670
and she has to type out
the entire phrase again,

02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:34.461
because she doesn't
know where it's stored.

02:12:34.461 --> 02:12:35.990
Whereas, in our
application, she was

02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:39.140
able to go to the other screen,
and immediately just find

02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:41.820
in her history, and then
she favorited it after that,

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.920
and she had it as well.

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.795
So she was able to play
from the history page

02:12:44.795 --> 02:12:45.990
without any real time.

02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:49.140
It was like a three,
four second time

02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:50.890
to reply, whereas
the other [INAUDIBLE]

02:12:50.890 --> 02:12:55.190
was just as when she typed it.

02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:57.779
EUNICE: And then we asked
her to repeat the experiment,

02:12:57.779 --> 02:12:59.070
this time with a longer phrase.

02:12:59.070 --> 02:13:01.590
And as you can see, the second
time it was a lot shorter.

02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:04.097
With Proloque, it seems
like the second time is also

02:13:04.097 --> 02:13:06.180
a lot shorter, but actually
it didn't really work,

02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:07.600
so she clicked
it, and the phrase

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.590
was entered into her
text like multiple times,

02:13:11.590 --> 02:13:13.270
and she was very
confused about it.

02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:16.890
So actually, even those it
was fast, it didn't work well.

02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:24.380
And as for the number of clicks,
similarly, it was fewer clicks,

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:25.380
but it didn't work.

02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:28.860
So that didn't
accomplish the goal.

02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:32.070
This is the amount
of time she used it.

02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.820
So we left the app with
her over a weekend.

02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:37.725
And she used-- this
is the information

02:13:37.725 --> 02:13:38.710
we got from her iPad.

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:41.490
She used this phrase
twice, three times--

02:13:41.490 --> 02:13:45.060
so she was actually
using this app to speak.

02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:48.540
And she also used
on her phone more,

02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.612
but we couldn't get
the data for that.

02:13:51.612 --> 02:13:54.112
PROFESSOR: I think we're going
to stop here, just so that we

02:13:54.112 --> 02:13:55.280
have time for questions.

02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:56.720
Thanks very much.

02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.120
[APPLAUSE]

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:02.480
Questions?

02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:04.880
GUEST SPEAKER: I know
that in the beginning,

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.532
you were going with a different
direction with Barbara, right?

02:14:08.532 --> 02:14:11.871
For using kind of a [? door ?]
automation, something.

02:14:11.871 --> 02:14:15.200
Was it really difficult
to kind of switch gears

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.700
and go in another
direction when you

02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:19.540
realized the first goal
wouldn't be achievable.

02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:21.540
KELLY: Yeah, that was
probably the hardest thing

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.915
we had to deal
with all semester,

02:14:22.915 --> 02:14:25.790
because when we finally chose
our idea to go with software

02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:30.560
and develop and app, with
lost around a month's time.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.480
So we had to really
cram it all in,

02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:35.160
but it basically made us
realize that early on we

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.410
got to learn how to fail fast.

02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:39.730
And so you can go with an idea,
but only until you realize

02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:40.890
that's it's not possible.

02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:43.032
And you shouldn't just
hold on to one thing,

02:14:43.032 --> 02:14:45.490
because you think that that's
the only idea that she wants.

02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:47.660
And so it's really important
to always communicate

02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:51.162
with your client and throw out
any ideas you have as well,

02:14:51.162 --> 02:14:52.870
because you're also
part of the solution,

02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:54.797
and you have as much
say in it as they do.

02:14:54.797 --> 02:14:56.380
And you can bounce
ideas of each other

02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:59.930
and come up with
something really awesome.

02:14:59.930 --> 02:15:02.880
EDDY: Another part
of that is that part

02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:05.020
of what we have here
in our lessons learned

02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:07.880
is we came up with an
idea of the ScriptSpeak

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.170
that we were never
asked for initially.

02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:12.640
She really didn't think of
it as a possible solution.

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:15.600
She wanted home automation,
and we focused on that,

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.750
until we found
out by regulations

02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:20.160
that we would have
too short of a time

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.580
to actually make a difference.

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:24.500
So we were able to make an
idea and converse with her

02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:27.500
about something that she
didn't particularly want.

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.000
And then the moment we came up
with that idea, she was like,

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:30.666
oh, I love that.

02:15:30.666 --> 02:15:31.170
Do that.

02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:32.484
Forget the door.

02:15:32.484 --> 02:15:35.600
So it was a hard
process, but we ended up

02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.630
liking the project we had.

02:15:37.630 --> 02:15:40.570
And we're all CS majors,
so it was definitely

02:15:40.570 --> 02:15:42.170
our home-field advantage.

02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:44.705
GUEST SPEAKER: So was it
something that you just

02:15:44.705 --> 02:15:46.429
intuitively knew would help her?

02:15:46.429 --> 02:15:48.220
KELLY: So she actually
mentioned many times

02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:50.720
that she would like an app that
would help her speak better,

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:53.129
because it's the most difficult
problem she deals with.

02:15:53.129 --> 02:15:55.670
She just didn't know that it
was possible to create something

02:15:55.670 --> 02:15:56.600
that could fix it.

02:15:56.600 --> 02:15:59.280
And so we realized that
hey, we're CS majors.

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.780
We can definitely
do this for you.

02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:03.690
And she was amazed the see
that it was actually possible.

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.980
PROFESSOR: Other
questions or comments?

02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:11.480
OK.

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:12.813
I think we're at the time today.

02:16:12.813 --> 02:16:14.326
Thank you very
much Team Barbara.

02:16:14.326 --> 02:16:16.060
[APPLAUSE]

02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:18.140
Well, down there
today everybody.

02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:22.010
Thanks for coming out for these
three hours of presentations.

02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:26.390
We will have a class selection
next Wednesday at one o'clock,

02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:30.580
and then the showcase is from
3:00 to 5:00 next Wednesday.

02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.358
Thanks very much.
