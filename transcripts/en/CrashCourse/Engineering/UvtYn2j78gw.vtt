00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.840
If you want to take to the skies or fly to
Mars, you’re going to need a machine to 
get you there.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.820
Humans dreamed of taking flight for thousands
of years, but it took special tools, techniques,
and materials to make it possible.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.100
It took aerospace engineering.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:26.100
[Theme Music]

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.980
We’ve been able to accomplish some
remarkable things since machines have given us
the power of flight.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.180
Astronauts visited the Moon in less time than
it takes to cross the Atlantic by boat,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.460
and my direct flight from LA to Missoula takes
less time than it takes to drive across LA County.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.640
We’ve been able to do these things because
of aerospace engineering, the field dedicated
to designing and building machines that fly.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.480
It’s broken down into two main parts: aeronautical
engineering and astronautical engineering.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
Aeronautical engineering is focused on making
aircraft – like gliders, jets, and helicopters

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.740
– while astronautical engineering builds
spacecraft – like probes, satellites, and spaceships.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.500
Both disciplines made enormous strides in
the 20th century thanks in part to the Cold War
conflict between the US and the Soviet Union.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.080
That rivalry gave us the race to land on the
Moon, as well as advancements in jet propulsion,
radar, materials science, and so much more.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.520
Today nations still compete, but so do private
companies – and the goal isn’t just getting back
to the Moon, but making it to Mars.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.299
It’s not only a good headline.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.670
If we’ve learned anything from the Space
Race, it’s that competition drives innovation.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.720
The rocket company SpaceX plans on sending
people to Mars as early as 2024 and, to make
that happen, you need a lot of innovation.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.140
But whether you’re sending people across space
or just flying around in the atmosphere, you’re going
to need to know some basic flying principles.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.840
For atmospheric flight, the critical one is
lift, and the most basic form of lift is buoyancy.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.580
Buoyancy works because the atmosphere has
what physicists call a pressure gradient,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.160
meaning that air pressure gets a tiny bit
smaller for every little bit higher you go.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.000
The difference in those pressures creates a
small upward force, which can push an object
up if it’s light enough – that’s lift!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
The earliest form of flight, hot air balloons,
uses this principle.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.180
That big ball of hot air is pushed up because
it’s lighter than the surrounding cooler air, and it
pulls its passenger along for the ride.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.660
If you want your balloon to be stationary, what
engineers might call in equilibrium, then the sum
of the forces should be equal to zero.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.800
That means that the weight of gravity pulling the balloon – and the gas inside – downwards needs to exactly balance out the force of the pressure gradient pushing up.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520
But balloons are pretty impractical for most
applications.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.880
They’re so dependant on the surrounding environment
that things like changing weather conditions can make
it hard to precisely steer or even land in one.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.320
To fly more effectively, you need a propulsion
system, or something that pushes you forward.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.400
A propulsion system usually consists of a power
source, and a propulsor, which is something that can
convert power into forward motion.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.260
There are three main propulsion systems that
you’ll use as an aeronautical engineer:

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.160
a heat engine with fuel, an electric motor
with batteries, or an electric motor with
solar cells.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.660
The goal with any of these systems is to provide
enough thrust to overcome the drag of the aircraft.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.600
For commercial airplanes that do a lot of
consistent travel,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.660
you’ll want to keep the engine efficiency high
and fuel usage low so that you’re not burning a
hole in your wallet.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.620
For something like a fighter jet, where speed is key, you’ll
need more thrust to accelerate quickly, which means
that engine efficiency might go out the window.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.040
Most modern planes rely on the jet engine,
which has five core elements: an inlet, compressor,
burner, turbine, and nozzle.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.520
The inlet brings air into the engine, and
that air is fed to the compressor.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.910
The compressor then increases the pressure
of the incoming air before it enters the burner.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.090
At this stage of the engine, that high-pressure
air is combined with fuel and burned.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.660
This creates hot exhaust gas that’s used
to turn a turbine, which produces thrust as
that air is passed through the nozzle.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.380
Finally, the nozzle acts as your propulser,
pushing the plane forward.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.720
Now, there’s a few important things to consider
here.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.360
You need to make sure that you have a sturdy
inlet that can operate efficiently –

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.320
meaning that it can bring in enough air to the
compressor – for your aircraft’s entire flight.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.220
When you’re flying at low speeds, your compressor
can handle pulling air into the engine itself,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.320
but at higher speeds, a good inlet design allows you
to have better maneuverability without disrupting the
air flow to the compressor.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.640
You also need to design your engine with materials
that can withstand a lot of heat.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.320
For instance, the blades in your turbine can
experience temperatures of several hundred
degrees Celsius.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.860
You need to make them from special metals that
can withstand that heat, like a nickel-based superalloy,
or add a system to actively cool the blades.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.660
If you decide to cool them, you’ll need a hollow design so that you can pump cool air into the blades and out through small holes on their surface to keep everything cool.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.880
Put that all together, make sure you have a
good nozzle to act as a propulser, and you’d
have yourself a quality propulsion system.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.340
Now, that will get you pretty far here on Earth, but
think about traveling to space and you’re going to
have to deal with a whole other slew of challenges.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.100
And the biggest one is actually you.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.780
You might think that technological limitations
are what’s stopping us from traveling the stars –
and that’s certainly part of it.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.860
But your greatest obstacle will come from
the human body’s difficulty in adapting to the
challenges of deep space.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.380
Our bodies can’t just flip a switch and
suddenly adapt, so you’ll need to build ships that
can mimic an Earth-like environment.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.020
Some aspects, like creating a breathable atmosphere,
are pretty easy.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.660
Others, like dealing with weightlessness are
much harder.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.420
One thing we don’t yet have is artificial
gravity.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.460
Gravity affects everything from the development
of your bones and muscles, to how easily your
heart pumps blood through your body.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.320
Without it, astronauts in space experience
issues like weaker muscles or blurrier vision
after just a few days

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.250
One way to deal with this, at least in theory,
is to take advantage of the apparent centrifugal
force and create a spacecraft that spins.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.720
This could effectively mimic gravity in a
similar way to how water stays in a rapidly
spinning bucket.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.780
Space is also full of radiation, which can
increase the crew’s risk of cancer and even
hurt the ship.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.400
Long-term exposure to radiation can severely
damage onboard electronics, causing short-circuits
and corrupting memory.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.000
So if you don’t want your design to
get fried in space, you need to build it to
withstand that radiation.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.580
Using insulating materials for computer chips
instead of the usual silicon will help.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.820
So will designing electronics to have external
shields made out of things like lead.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.980
That’ll make the overall size of your system
larger, so you have to factor that in too.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.460
And that’s just space itself.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.020
There’s even more to consider once you start
talking about dealing with the atmospheres
of other planets.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.740
Take a look at Mars, and you’ll find an
atmosphere about 1% as dense as Earth’s,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.560
and a temperature that ranges from -125°C in
the winter to about 20°C in the summer –

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.860
all things that your designs need to be
able to handle if we ever have hopes of
traveling or even living there.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.140
But before you go off and try and colonize
another planet, it’s good to start of with a
simpler mission,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.400
like designing a satellite that doesn’t have all the
problems of needing an astronaut on board.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.460
Satellites have three main elements: the payload,
the bus, and the launcher.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.060
The payload is all the equipment that performs
the satellite’s main functions, like receiving
telecommunications or processing and sending data.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.380
The bus refers to the systems and structures
that provide functions like power, protection,
stability, and orbital control –

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.460
which all allow the payload to perform its
intended mission.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.440
The launcher, or the launch vehicle adapter
assembly, is the connection between the bus and
the rocket that boosts the satellite into orbit.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.830
All of these parts need to come together in
the design of your satellite.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:28.980
And you better make sure all your math is right, because a simple calculation mistake can be devastating, both in terms of human life and in the cost of all your equipment.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:36.680
Back around the turn of the millennium,
NASA lost a 125 million dollar Mars orbiter just
because of a mix-up of units.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.300
NASA’s team was using metric units while
the manufacturer was using English ones,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.480
ultimately throwing off the orbiter’s calculations
and causing it to burn up in the Martian atmosphere.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.800
There’s one last, special kind of spacecraft
you might need to design, a spacesuit.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.460
You see, a spacesuit isn’t just a set
of clothes that you wear in space – it’s
basically it’s own human-sized ship!

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.980
It protects an astronaut from getting too
hot or too cold, provides them with oxygen to
breathe, and can even store drinking water.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.680
And they have those gold-lined visors that
shield their eyes from the super bright sunlight
of space.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:16.300
And the suit’s tough exterior provides protection from
space dust, which can actually be really dangerous when
it’s moving around faster than a speeding bullet.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.680
You can’t beef the suit up too much though,
because astronauts still need to be able to
move around effectively.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.800
Conserving energy is also important since
the food options are a little more...limited
up there.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.390
That’s why engineers are always trying to
come up with better spacesuit designs, like
NASA’s Z-2 advanced prototype.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:42.000
The Z-2 uses advanced composites to achieve a lightweight, highly durable suit that could withstand long duration missions in harsh environments, like the one found on Mars.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.080
Whether it’s SpaceX, NASA, or someone else,
whoever plans on getting to Mars will need
spacesuits like these.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.500
And a good spaceship.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:54.900
But with the right engineering practices,
and a little luck, there’s a good chance that we’ll
one day be a multiplanetary species.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.080
Today we learned all about aerospace engineering
and its two main fields of aeronautical engineering
and astronautical engineering.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:08.780
We applied the concepts of lift and buoyancy to
flying, and found out how a propulsion system is more
effective than something like a hot air balloon.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:14.300
Then we learned how managing the human
body in space is one of the biggest challenges
that aerospace engineers face.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.500
Finally, we learned what goes into making
a good spacesuit.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.580
I’ll see you next time, when we talk all
about computer engineering.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.300
Crash Course Engineering is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios, which also produces Space Time!
