We're days away from the end
of Obama's presidency, which...

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.172
I don't know
if you guys are aware--

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.740
we're getting
a new president pretty soon?

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.876
-You guys don't pay attention to
the news. -(audience groaning)

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.378
But-but what's
Hussein-in-the-Membrane

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.148
got planned now that he won't be
busy pardoning turkeys 24/7?

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.851
Well, according to <i>Billboard,</i>
Obama made an offhand remark

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.553
to the ambassador to Sweden

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.990
-that he's still waiting for
his job at Spotify. -(laughter)

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.459
The well-known streaming service
that informs your friends

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.761
you were listening
to Papa Roach all day.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:31.131
Well, Obama's quip inspired
Spotify CEO

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.900
Daniel Elk to tweet,
"Hey @BarackObama,

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.202
"I heard you were interested
in a role at Spotify.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.503
Have you seen this one?"

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.205
And it wasn't just him
pointing at his dick,

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.007
although
that would have been hilarious.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.308
It was actually a job listing

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.310
for President of Playlists
right here.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.846
Ah, we're having lots of fun.
Makes you forget for

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.181
a second that
the next Secretary of Defense

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:48.949
is probably going
to be Waluigi.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.351
-(laughter and groaning)
-Um, so, comedians...

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.921
Comedians, in case

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.789
the Spotify gig
doesn't work out, what's another

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.824
tech job Obama might consider
after office?

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.160
Ify.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.329
I think he's gonna bring hope
and change

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.098
to the street fight videos
on <i>Worldstar Hip Hop.</i>

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.067
-HARDWICK: Yes, points. Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.169
-Katy.
-Um, I don't know about Obama,

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.238
but Biden's got a job moderating

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.473
the all-natural MILF subreddit.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.609
-HARDWICK: Okay, points. Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.511
-All-natural, Flula.
-President of Tinder,

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.280
because he's used
to dealing with dicks all day.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:20.380
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
Very good one. -(laughter)
