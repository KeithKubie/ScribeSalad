00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.050
Let us look at a connection between
your class projects and human cognition.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.780
Beginning with psychometrics,
psychometrics is the science of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.030
measuring human intelligence,
aptitude, and knowledge.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.280
Computational psychometrics is
the science of building agents

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.188
that can take the same tests of
intelligence that humans take.

00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:22.690
All the [INAUDIBLE] building
AI agents that can address

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.200
the Ravens test of intelligence,
it will provide opportunities for

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.870
thinking about human cognition.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.520
While we will be looking only for

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.595
how well your agents perform on the
Ravens test, in principle [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.229
psycho-metrics will also look at
the kinds of errors that AI agents make.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.200
If the errors the AI agents make
are similar to those that humans make,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.690
then that may provide
a source of hypothesis

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.670
about human thinking on this
Raven's Test of Intelligence.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.340
It is also interesting to note that
people with autism perform about as well

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.310
on the Raven's Test of Intelligence
as neurotypical people.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.470
This is a little surprising, because
in general, people with autism do

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.180
not perform as well on other tests of
intelligence as the neurotypical people.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330
Note that Raven's test of
intelligence is the only test that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.390
consists only of visual
analogy problems.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210
All other tests of
intelligence also include

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.460
a large number of verbal problems.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.440
Might I suggest that some of
the thinking strategies that people with

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960
autism are better aligned
with visual reasoning.
