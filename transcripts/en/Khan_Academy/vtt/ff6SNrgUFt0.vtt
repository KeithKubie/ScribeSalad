00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:02.737
- Alright, let's tackle part b, now.

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:06.916
Derive the magnitude of the
acceleration of block 2.

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:11.916
Express your answer in
terms of m1, m2, and g.

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:13.988
And like always, try to pause the video

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:15.428
and see if you can work
through it yourself.

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:18.740
We already worked through
part 1, or part a,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.480
I should say, based on this diagram above,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.326
and there's a previous video.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:24.857
So, now we're ready to do part b.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:27.959
And we've already drawn
the free-body diagrams,

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:31.709
which will help us determine
the acceleration of block 2.

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.170
Let's just think about what
the acceleration is, first.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.198
We know it's going to
accelerate downwards,

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:38.706
because, there's a couple
ways you can think about it,

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.854
the weight of block 2 is larger
than the weight of block 1,

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:44.379
they're connected by the
string, so we know we're gonna

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.577
accelerate downwards on
the right-hand side and

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:48.655
upwards on the left-hand side.

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:49.758
The other way to think about it, is

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.358
the weight of block 2 is
larger than the upward force of

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:57.358
tension. And the weight of
block 1 is less than the

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.939
tension pulling upwards.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.094
So, you're gonna accelerate upwards on the

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.976
left-hand side, accelerate
downwards on the right-hand side

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:05.423
and a key realization is,

00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:08.653
the magnitude of the acceleration
is going to be the same

00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:11.667
because they're connected by that string.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:16.033
So, the acceleration, I'll
just draw it a little bit away

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.128
from the actual dot, so
the acceleration, here,

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:23.309
has a magnitude a, it's gonna
go in the downward direction

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:26.403
the acceleration on the left-hand
side is gonna be the same

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:30.199
magnitude, but it's gonna
go in the upwards direction.

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.266
So that just gives us a sense of things.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:36.471
They say, derive the magnitude
of acceleration of block 2

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.330
Alright, so this is,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.419
let me leave the labels up there,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.858
so this is block 2 up here.

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:44.936
And we know, from Newton's 2nd Law,

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:47.271
that if we pick a direction,
and the direction that matters

00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.501
here, is the vertical direction.

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.748
All the forces are acting in

00:01:50.748 --> 00:01:53.339
either the upwards or downwards direction.

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:55.673
So, the magnitude of our net forces,

00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:58.516
we care about the vertical dimension here,

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:01.209
is going to be equal to the
mass times the acceleration,

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.674
in that, in that dimension,
in that direction,

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.101
I guess you could say.

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:09.038
And so let's just think about block 2.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:13.461
Block, Block 2.

00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.233
And since the acceleration,
we know is downwards,

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.799
and we wanna figure out what a is,

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.284
let's just assume that positive,

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:24.918
positive magnitude specifies downwards.

00:02:24.918 --> 00:02:27.169
So what are the net forces?

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.990
Well, the net forces are going
to be the force of weight

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.675
minus the tension, and
that's going to be positive.

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:35.245
If we think about it in
the downward direction.

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:37.439
The downward direction being positive.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.469
So we're gonna have m2g, the weight,

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.470
minus the tension,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.859
tension is going against the weight,

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.009
minus the tension is going
to be equal to the mass.

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:54.009
Is going to be equal to m2
times, times our acceleration,

00:02:55.746 --> 00:02:57.468
and we need to figure out
what that acceleration

00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:00.123
is going to be.

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:02.401
So, we do that same blue color.

00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:06.059
Times the acceleration.

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.353
Now, we could divide both sides by m2,

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.559
but that's not going to
help us too much, just yet.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.719
Because then, we would've
solved for acceleration in terms

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.719
of m2g and T.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.149
We don't have any m1s here, so
we're not solving in terms of

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.823
m1, m2, and g.

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:26.411
We're solving in terms of m2, T, and g.

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.886
So, somehow, we have to get rid of this T.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:31.089
And what we can do to get rid of the T,

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.270
is set up a similar equation for block 1.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.270
Block 1, Block 1

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:42.397
Here, since we're concerned
with magnitude and

00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:44.218
especially the magnitude
of acceleration, and

00:03:44.218 --> 00:03:46.275
here the acceleration is
going in the upward direction,

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:47.656
we could say that the upward direction

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.327
is the positive direction.

00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:52.391
And so, we could say that T

00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.854
minus, we know that the tension is

00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:55.152
larger than the weight,

00:03:55.152 --> 00:04:00.152
T minus m1g is going to be equal to

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:04.411
is equal to m1,

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:09.411
is going to be equal to
m1 times the magnitude of

00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:11.977
the acceleration.

00:04:11.977 --> 00:04:14.786
And to be clear, these
magnitudes are the same.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:16.854
And we already know that the
magnitudes of the tension

00:04:16.854 --> 00:04:18.014
are the same.

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:19.938
And now we have two equations

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:21.420
with two unknowns,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.440
and so, if we can eliminate the tension,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.714
we can solve for acceleration.

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:27.596
And we can acutally do that by just

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:29.361
adding the left-hand side
to the left-hand side,

00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:32.159
and the right-hand side
to the right-hand side.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.159
You learned this probably
first in algebra 1. If,

00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:40.306
if this is equal to that
and that is equal to that,

00:04:40.306 --> 00:04:42.315
if we add the left side to the left side

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.438
and the right side to the right side,

00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:44.944
well, we're still gonna
get two things that are

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:46.313
equal to each other.

00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:48.971
So when you add the left-hand sides,

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:50.272
what are you going to get?

00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:55.224
So, you're gonna get m2g,

00:04:55.224 --> 00:05:00.034
m2g minus m1g,

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:03.402
minus m1g,

00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:06.675
and then you're gonna get T minus T.

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:08.100
These two are going to cancel out.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.548
So, let me just cross them out.

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:11.093
So that was convenient.

00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:13.323
Is going to be equal to

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:18.323
m2a, is going to be equal to m2a

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.755
plus m1a,

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:25.755
plus m1 times a.

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.418
And now, we just need to solve for a.

00:05:28.418 --> 00:05:29.811
And how do we do that?

00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:32.228
Well, we can factor out an a
out of this right-hand side

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:37.228
here, so this going to be m2g minus m1g

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.090
is equal to

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.681
let's factor out an a,

00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:47.681
a times, times m2 plus m1,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.870
and now to solve for a,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.225
we just divide both sides by m2 plus m1.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:56.303
m2 plus m1,

00:05:56.303 --> 00:06:01.179
m2 plus m1,

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:02.498
and there you have it, we get a

00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:04.040
is equal to

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.552
a is equal to this.

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:06.413
And, notice, we have solved it,

00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:08.586
we have solved for a in terms of

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:10.502
we have solved for a in terms of

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:13.323
m1, m2, and g.

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:15.889
And this is the magnitude of
the acceleration of either

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.548
block 1 or block 2.

00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:19.592
Now, some of you might be thinking,

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:21.670
wait, there might be an
easier way to think about this

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.751
problem, and I went straight
from the free-body diagrams

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.197
which is, ya know, it's
implied that this is

00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:29.960
the way to tackle it, using the tension.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.388
But, another way to tackle it,

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:32.538
you could've said, well,

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:34.256
this would be analogous, it's not the

00:06:34.256 --> 00:06:35.893
exact same thing, but
it would be analogous

00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:39.968
to imagine, two, these two
blocks floating in space.

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:42.255
So, this is m2, here, and I'm not gonna

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:44.914
use pulleys here, so that's m2.

00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:46.667
And it's connected by

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.070
a massless string,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.070
to m1, which has a smaller mass, m1.

00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:58.788
And let's say that you
are pulling on, pulling

00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:00.378
in the rightward direction, now we're just

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.861
drifting in space.

00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:06.983
With a force of m2g, we're not,

00:07:06.983 --> 00:07:09.839
we just care about the magnitude here, and

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.429
I know you might be saying, wait, okay,

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:14.332
is this is the gravitational
field or whatever else,

00:07:14.332 --> 00:07:15.655
but I'm saying, let's
just say you're pulling

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:17.164
in this direction with a force

00:07:17.164 --> 00:07:20.949
that happens to be equal to,
that has a magnitude of m2g,

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.762
and let's say you're
pulling in this direction,

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:29.762
with a force that has
a magnitude of m1, m1g.

00:07:30.936 --> 00:07:33.916
Now, this isn't exactly the
same as our, as where we started

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:37.144
where we started, we saw what
I have just kind of drawn,

00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:39.356
but I have it in the presence
of a gravitational field,

00:07:39.356 --> 00:07:41.028
and I have it wrapped
around those pulleys,

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:44.093
and then the gravitational
field is providing these forces.

00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:46.205
But let's just assume,
just for simplicity that

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:47.808
that you're drifting in space and you're

00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:50.014
pulling on m2 to the
right with a force that's

00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:52.951
equivalent to m2g, and you
are pulling to the left

00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:55.842
on m1, with a force of m1g.

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:58.812
Well, you could just view this as one big,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:02.820
you could just view the m1,
the string, and m2 as just

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.397
one combined mass.

00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:07.881
You could just view this
as one combined mass,

00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.346
of m1 plus m2, and you could say, alright,

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:14.662
well from that one combined mass,

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:15.940
I am,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.949
whoops,

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:20.721
that one combined mass, I am

00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:24.537
I am pulling to the right
with a magnitude of m2g,

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.350
and I am pulling to the left

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.154
let me make that a
slightly different color

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:30.562
so you can see it.

00:08:30.562 --> 00:08:35.562
And I am pulling to the
left with a magnitude of m1g

00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:39.482
and now, this becomes a
pretty straight-forward thing.

00:08:39.482 --> 00:08:40.880
What would be the acceleration here?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.842
Well, you could say the net,

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:46.403
the net magnitude of the force,

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:48.071
or the magnitude of the net force would be

00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.846
m2g, we'll take the rightward direction as

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:55.846
the positive direction, m2g minus m1g

00:08:56.117 --> 00:09:00.064
minus m1g, and then, so
that's the net force,

00:09:00.064 --> 00:09:01.504
in the right direction,

00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:03.826
the magnitude of the net force
in the rightward direction

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:05.081
and then you divide it by its mass,

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:06.624
and you're gonna get acceleration.

00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:08.979
Force divided by mass
gives you acceleration.

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:13.979
So, you divide that by our
mass, which is going to be

00:09:14.077 --> 00:09:18.083
which is going to be m1 plus m2,

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.020
that's going to give
you your acceleration.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.928
So, you could view this as a simpler way

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.279
of thinking about it. But they,

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.179
notice, either of them give
you the exact same answer.

00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:30.630
That's one of the fun
things about science,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.509
as long as you do logical things,

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.839
you get to the same point.
