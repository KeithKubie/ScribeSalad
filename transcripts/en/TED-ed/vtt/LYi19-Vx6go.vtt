00:00:07.297 --> 00:00:09.157
Take a look at this image.

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.657
What might this be?

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:12.067
A frightening monster?

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.597
Two friendly bears?

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:16.557
Or something else entirely?

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:17.957
For nearly a century,

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.427
ten inkblots like these have been used

00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:24.117
as what seems like an almost 
mystical personality test.

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:27.697
Long kept confidential for psychologists 
and their patients,

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:33.357
the mysterious images were said to draw
out the workings of a person’s mind.

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:35.885
But what can inkblots really tell us,

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.425
and how does this test work?

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:43.205
Invented in the early 20th century 
by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:47.645
the Rorschach Test is actually less about 
the specific things we see,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.920
and more about our general approach 
to perception.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.300
As an amateur artist

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.220
Hermann was fascinated by how visual 
perception varies from person to person.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.687
He carried this interest to 
medical school,

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:03.347
where he learned all our senses 
are deeply connected.

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:08.087
He studied how our process of perception 
doesn’t just register sensory inputs,

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:09.868
but transforms them.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:13.898
And when he started working at a 
mental hospital in eastern Switzerland,

00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:17.308
he began designing a series 
of puzzling images

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:21.358
to gain new insight into this 
enigmatic process.

00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:23.578
Using his inkblot paintings,

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:26.688
Rorschach began quizzing hundreds 
of healthy subjects

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:29.608
and psychiatric patients with 
the same question:

00:01:29.608 --> 00:01:31.648
what might this be?

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:36.278
However, it wasn’t what the test subjects 
saw that was most important to Rorschach,

00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:39.102
but rather, how they approached the task.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.432
Which parts of the image did they 
focus on or ignore?

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:44.682
Did they see the image moving?

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:48.382
Did the color on some inkblots help them 
give better answers,

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:51.462
or distract and overwhelm them?

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:54.492
He developed a system to code 
people’s responses,

00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:59.472
reducing the wide range of interpretations
to a few manageable numbers.

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:04.124
Now he had empirical measures to quantify 
all kinds of test takers:

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.945
the creative and imaginative,

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.955
the detail-oriented, the 
big-picture perceivers,

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:12.655
and flexible participants able 
to adapt their approach.

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.375
Some people would get stuck,

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.055
offering the same answer 
for multiple blots.

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:20.275
Others gave unusual and 
delightful descriptions.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:22.985
Responses were as varied as the inkblots,

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:26.035
which offered different kinds of 
perceptual problems–

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.855
some easier to interpret than others.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.905
But analyzing the test-taker’s 
overall approach

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:34.785
yielded real insights into 
their psychology.

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:37.505
And as Rorschach tested more 
and more people,

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:39.775
patterns began to pile up.

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:42.355
Healthy subjects with the same 
personalities

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:45.295
often took remarkably similar approaches.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:47.945
Patients suffering from the same 
mental illnesses

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:49.845
also performed similarly,

00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:53.045
making the test a reliable 
diagnostic tool.

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:55.425
It could even diagnose some conditions

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.135
difficult to pinpoint with other 
available methods.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:00.465
In 1921,

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:05.205
Rorschach published his coding system 
alongside the ten blots he felt

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:09.791
gave the most nuanced picture of people’s
perceptual approach.

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.570
Over the next several decades,

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.860
the test became wildly popular in 
countries around the world.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.207
By the 1960s,

00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:21.517
it had been officially administered 
millions of times in the U.S. alone.

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:24.828
Unfortunately, less than a year after 
publishing the test,

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.408
Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly.

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.448
Without its inventor to keep it on track,

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:32.888
the test he had methodically gathered 
so much data to support

00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:36.548
began to be used in all sorts 
of speculative ways.

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:39.598
Researchers gave the test 
to Nazi war criminals,

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:43.288
hoping to unlock the psychological roots 
of mass murder.

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:46.538
Anthropologists showed the images to 
remote communities

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:49.438
as a sort of universal personality test.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:54.798
Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions
based on reductive decoding charts.

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:58.239
As the test left clinics and entered 
popular culture

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.609
its reputation among medical 
professionals plummeted,

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.279
and the blots began to fall 
out of clinical use.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.009
Today, the test is still controversial,

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.909
and many people assume 
it has been disproven.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.929
But a massive 2013 review of all the 
existing Rorschach research

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:20.349
showed that when administered properly 
the test yields valid results,

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.569
which can help diagnose mental illness

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.349
or round out a patient’s 
psychological profile.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.419
It’s hardly a stand-alone key 
to the human mind–

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.799
no test is.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:34.709
But its visual approach and lack 
of any single right answer

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:38.379
continue to help psychologists paint
a more nuanced picture

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.499
of how people see the world.

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:41.969
Bringing us one step closer

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.189
to understanding the patterns 
behind our perceptions.
