Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:04          All right, well we could probably do a show just on Facebook, but let's, let's move to the others because in a certain way, I think Facebook is becoming increasingly irrelevant, at least in the political space that my judgment of that may be slightly off, but I just don't see that much traction any more with young people. Do you think that's basically fair? I disagree. I think that Facebook, I think that the majority of these companies disseminate their content through the social media platform. So I think that there are always going to be relevant and there is, they dominate the market in terms of advertising revenue. Um, even even the big news organizations, uh, disseminate their content through Facebook. So I think it's, I think they are relevant. I don't know. I don't know what the trajectory of that is. Yeah. I don't mean that they're irrelevant, but it seems to me that the, the conversation that I really think is important about all of this seems to be happening much more on Twitter.

Speaker 2:          00:54          I assume. Not necessarily that the money in the advertising and the mainstream media reach and all of those things aren't relevant on Facebook, but that the real sort of, I don't know, the gestalt of this or something is on Twitter and Youtube. So that's the, let's ship there for a second. So, uh, Twitter, I'm sure you see me, uh, tweeting all the time about the shadow bands and the rest of it. So what the hell is going on with Twitter? Well, we went, we went undercover into Twitter and last year and early 2018 and we caught a number of engineers describing a shadow banning, uh, removing posts. When people don't know that they're sharing their content, they don't know that they're being banned, that we actually have quotes from the engineers talking about what they have done. I mentioned earlier with this, a direct messaging expert, a guy named [inaudible] Singh who works on the Twitter DM team, says that he can peruse all of your messages, your private dms.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Uh, he says that there are key words that Twitter uses to filter tweets, uh, the American flag, God guns. Uh, and then, then we talked to another engineer, not jump over the first one there. So they can literally look at your direct messaging. That's what they told us. Private direct messages. They said they have teams. This is a guy named Clay Hain. So they have hundred hundreds plus of people that, and he says, quote, I've seen a lot of Dick pics on quote. So I understand they have to do some of this to, to, to ban pornography and you know, Gore and content. But apparently this is what they told us that I don't know why they'd have to look at your private messages, but, and they've also said that they don't do that. So that's the thing. Why do they say one thing in public? Another thing in private is what we've found.

Speaker 2:          02:34          But, but again, I try to only speak to what I can actually a videotape of what the engineers said. And this Abenov for Draven guy was, there was a congressional hearing with a lobbyist. Ted Cruz did ask him, uh, do you do this? And he says, we do not do that. Well then why did your engineer say they were doing it? So I just think they're being dishonest. So that's the type of sort of underhanded tactic they're using the shadow banning cause you have no idea. Again, you just don't know when you put something out. Is this getting to all of my people or is it not? Or can some people not retweet it or the rest of it? I mean it's a pretty clever, if they were trying to silence people, it's pretty clever way of doing it. Right. I think that's the unethical part.

Speaker 2:          03:15          They don't tell people that they are doing and they don't tell people their political positions. I just want them to be transparent. I think Facebook kind of thing. Not to go back to Facebook, but they put out a thing. We are, we are banning white nationalists. Well at least they're telling us where they stand. I'm not the, not that that is a good thing, white nationalism. But if they were to do more of that sort of thing and say we are, we are taking an editorial perspective in the New York Times, The Washington Post. You can see on the op Ed pages what they believe in. They're there. They're rather transparent about it. I would say more so. So I think that these companies should take an editorial position, but when, when we hear, um, print icing at Twitter on the hidden camera, say who talks like that, who talks about God and the American flag and guns must be a Russian Bot says print icing at Twitter.

Speaker 2:          04:02          Well, I'm fine with that as long as you say it publicly, as long as you make it part of your editorial positions so that people know, okay, this company is a, is extremely left wing. Any of the Banning's or any of this ever happened to people on the left? I know there were some instances maybe with Auntie Phi accounts are a couple of things like that, but it always seems like you have conservatives and people on the right talking about it. Yeah, I don't, I'm not, to my knowledge, and I think our reporting overwhelmingly focused on, on why he even mentioned Donald Trump's account and insinuated that they were, that they were working with the government to give information to, I dunno, deep state individuals. This is Clay Haynes, a network security engineer at Twitter told us about Donald Trump's accounts. I've never seen anything on the other end of the spectrum from, from my vantage point when Trump's account got taken down for those couple of hours.

Speaker 2:          04:59          And then it turned out to be just, what was it? They said it was some accident or some young, some low level guy did it for you. That must've been like a Whoa, that just shows you the power that any, any individual here would have access to be able to shut down. Even for our, for our purposes, we're always, I'm always trying to prove it. Like I want to get them on tape admitting why they did it. But there are the, there are these, you know, I guess you could call them low level people that do things that are not acceptable. Um, and it's policed more. So at Facebook I would say. Yeah. Anything else going on with Twitter and that's all that we reported on the shadow banning the, the, the, the, the private DM messages. Uh, and the shadow banning were the big ones. What do you make generally of the political politization of Twitter specifically? So, you know, if you were to click on the search bar on Twitter on any given day and you see the Twitter moments, it's all, you know, they're always showing you the Trans Story of the day or, or whatever the left is leading with that day. They're

Speaker 3:          05:58          always sort of pushing that down your throat. Um, is that just consistent with everything else you view these companies?

Speaker 2:          06:04          What I will say is that we have more stories coming on, that sort of thing. So I would, I would hold my tongue because I don't want to scoop myself. We've got a number of people on the inside that are, that are maybe focusing on the search functions at these organizations. So we'll, we'll, you'll be, you have to stay tuned

Speaker 3:          06:21          to see what we young, yeah, that wouldn't surprise me. I mean when I searched certain people, even if they're verified, if they happen to be on the right, sometimes they don't pop up. But I get a zillion random accounts before that. Or I often think that the, um, the trending tab right. Seems like it's completely manipulated. You know, what they are commenting on and what they're, you know, cause sometimes there's a comment beneath the trend or whatever. It all just seems made up. And,

Speaker 2:          06:45          and, and, and for project Veritas, the, the priority is to prove it, is to, is to catch them on tape admitting it. And that is what we will do. And we will have more stories soon. Huh.

Speaker 3:          06:55          And all of this, all those friends. So let's move to youtube. We're on youtube right now. I've had people in the past, years ago when I did, at one time I did have an email address from somebody of youtube and they told me, cause I kept saying, people keep complaining that they are unsubscribed from my channel. I kept getting emails every day. And one time someone from Youtube admitted to me, they said, there's a bug on your channel. And we're trying to work it out with a couple of weeks after that. After I followed up a few times and then I couldn't get any more information, I got an email from the guy saying I'm no longer handling this case. And now you have to go to the, you don't have an email address to respond to any more, go to the general tab and complaining or whatever. Uh, so I have to publicly shame them all the time. You probably see me doing this with teams and youtube and Twitter. Every time I get demonetized I fight them. And then they usually not always lie. Rose, for example, they did not re monetize. Um, they didn't really, they did not rule you monetize that one. It was d monetized by the algorithm and then confirmed by manual review. Now that's their right to do that. Again, you want some transparency with it. Um, but unsubscribes video's not going out to feeds all of these things. What evidence do we actually have that these things are here?

Speaker 2:          08:07          Well, we did a story in 2017 between the New York Times reporter named Nick Dudek and Youtube. And again, I can only talk about what I report that that's my rule. So I don't, I don't like to, to comment on things that I don't, I haven't had personal experience with, but there was a relationship between these networks like the New York Times and hopping to post and, and Youtube. And there, there are favors given to, to these, uh, organizations over say your show. Um, and, and that's something that we've, we've, we reported on an exposed, so what would a favor look like? Well, preferential treatment and the end to getting into the, the scientifics of it, I'm not sure, but preferential treatment where the video would, would, would show up more frequently at the top of the, of search query. Um, it's this Guy Nick Dudek who was a social accounts video editor for The New York Times, talked about his relationship with this guy inside youtube.

Speaker 2:          09:07          So there's a sort of, you know, two way street there between the two companies where favors are done. But with the New York Times now, why are they doing them favors? I, that's what I was talking about earlier, where these companies have enormous power because even the likes of the old media transmit their messages through the new media. That's where the majority of people get their information from. So, um, but that, that was that guy nick duty, actually the executive editor of the New York Times. Dean Baquet is his name. Actually we believe, let that guy go. He actually, uh, uh, terminated Nick Dudek for telling us this stuff. No one reported on that. But, uh, I don't know whether they terminated him for telling the truth or for or for lying about what he had said. So how do you combat that? The part where every time you guys released something that I look at it, I'm always hesitant to retweet it.

Speaker 2:          10:00          I've shared some of your videos sometimes, but I'm always like, ah, if, if this is the one where you know he got duped or you know, it's only being shared by Breitbart or whatever, then it's like you like basically that you have some sort of secondary layer of censorship to get through. Well, I'll tell you what, we've done 200 acres, Huffington post and buzzfeed and CNN. They in touch in any of this. Well, they have touched it. I mean, Anderson Cooper reported on this stuff we did during the 2016 election on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are stories in the 2018 election, made the New York Times. Um, we've gotten a lot of local media coverage. We've been in terms of being duped, weave, weave in and out of 200 undercover investigators. They say things are edited, they're edited out of context. They're, they're not real. I mean, and you actually ask them what specific edits are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          10:50          Because to say that video is edited and it's like saying words are arranged, all journalism is edited and to tell a story and they said, well, you didn't wear the pimp costume and the acorn office. Well you know, okay. But I presented myself as as a, as a pimp. Um, and even the New York Times said that and pimp protocol doesn't require wearing of Pinot fought for to be a pimp who were a big pink jacket and drive a Cadillac vehicles. Um, and I said, well, there was a scene change in the NPR investigation. Okay. Is that the best you got? I mean, I, there was a cutaway shot or the guy was laughing and I was narrating over it in 200 investigations. I mean, they've printed 300 corrections and attractions about me. I have a wall in my office called the wall of shame and it's all these corrections and attractions about me.

Speaker 2:          11:33          The Washington Post that I went after acorn due to an animus about African Americans voting. They made it up. Pulitzer prize winning reporter Carol, letting just made something up out of whole whole cloth. So, I don't know. I think there is a, I think it's not about the, um, the, the, what we do is real. The tapes, you see, there's never been a case where you saw wasn't real. There was one thing with the Washington Post that blew up. They turn their cameras back around on us and everyone, you know, said, well that's unethical. What exactly? It was unethical about it because we went undercover into CNN. We infiltrated something called a rain bros at which was a, a gay group where this producer was in. Nobody questioned the ethics of it. Nobody questioned the ethics because the end was so obvious. And whether or not you think that the means are justified, depends upon whether you think there's a compelling public interest and what you are exposing.

Speaker 2:          12:29          So when these things get interrupted, then people say it's unethical. But we think that undercover work is justified, particularly into the big 10 companies and the big media due to the urgency of the circumstances. But in all of our work, no one's, no one's ever able to actually say what exactly has been fake about it. And that's from my perspective or are you shocked at actually how the collapse of mainstream media has precipitated so quickly at this point? Like it seems to me that it's just, it's over. I mean now, just in the last couple of weeks now with, with Trump and Russia and just the amount that these people have just lied over and over. And finally, thanks to Twitter and Youtube and the rest of it, if we're not being shadow and everything, there's enough of us that can get a counter narrative out there, but they just keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          13:17          Well, I think it's the death of, I think it's, it's uh, uh, you've covered, cause I watch your show, a lot of the political reasons why media is dying, but I actually think it's goes back to Jefferey's Zucker said in the last two weeks about, I don't know if you saw that tweet where Brian Stelter said, we're not investigators. Well, that was an unbelievable moment because that's really, they're not, they're not investigative reporters. And people have to remember a thing about CNN talking about CNN, CNN, we don't, we're not investigators where journalists, so here's the thing. This is very important. People talk about politics. People talk about, you know, the media is algorithms, but it's also economics. Investigative reporting is very, very expensive and it's a naturally philanthropic activity. Investigative reporting, going back 40 50 years, it was always a loss leader on the company's balance sheets.

Speaker 2:          14:06          People have to remember these are, these are businesses. They're not interested in the public interest. They're interested in, in generating a profit, and that's fine, but, but don't pretend that you serve the public interest. We had a CNN insider on tape. John Barfield said, this is a business, the CEO of CNN, Jeff Zucker told us a stop talking about the climate accords. Let's get back to Russia. It's about ratings. It's not about ethics and it's been, you know, spending. It's important to illustrate though. You're not saying there's anything inherently wrong with that. He's allowed to make money. He's allowed to do business. But, but don't pretend you're operating in the public interest because investigative reporting, and let, let, let me, let me, you had mentioned, you know, people don't, if people are wary of what we do, it's naturally the tip, the spear. You have to use deception to a degree.

Speaker 2:          14:55          Either you deceive your source or you deceive your audience. The problem with journalism and the reason why it's in decline is because these leakers, these sources and government and elsewhere intentionally transmit stuff to the media and they paired it to the masses. A. I. E. Jeff Zucker saying, we don't investigate what we're told. And that's what, you know, what, what has been referred to as a pseudo event. They create something they transmitted unquestionably. And there's the economic factor. There's a symbiotic relationship between people and power. What we do at Veritas is we, we go undercover and we, we completely defy the narrative. And that's, and most networks don't want to air it because? Because it's risky because it's questioning that the normative order of things, it's easier to do little videos about squirrels on skateboards. Now, I did this big story during the election, you know, for Bob Creamer resigned from the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Speaker 2:          15:57          And a lot of these companies say, we're afraid that if Hillary Clinton wins, she'll take away our FCC license. So it's, it's, it's this, it's this economic issue that is inherent in media and it requires independent people to do something about it because the networks are not going to do something about it. They are, they're in the business of generating a profit. It's so fascinating to me because it's like they're not even in the business. Right. I get it. So they're in the business making a profit and that's fine. That is what businesses, but they're not even in the business of pretending anymore because it's like during the whole Mueller investigation, every week there was another leak to the New York Times and it's always an anonymous leak. And then for the last two years they ran anonymous leak stories and it's like, shouldn't have, somebody had been investigating why the Mueller, uh, operation is leaking.

Speaker 2:          16:45          That actually would have been a story. Right. Where was that story out of the New York Times? Well they had and James Clapper and John Brennan and Munis or intelligence clapper who lied under oath. Is there intelligence agency people and maybe not the most always ethical people and they're just parroting what they're told on on TV things or when things are, and again, I go back to this whole distinction and because when you, when you report from a podium, when you say something in a press conference, the, the damage to society done by broadcasting, what you are told on the record is often more pernicious than the damage that say I do by deceiving some guy in a bar so that I can get the truth out of them. It is a, it is a huge difference. And, and I think that journalists tend to be that you, you sort of have to play confidence games.

Speaker 2:          17:33          You know, you have to seduce your source so to speak. But there's, there is, there's a two, there's a relationship between sources and the media that I think has become corrupt. I think that the, the anonymous or the reliance upon anonymous sources has become corrupted. You look at Bob Woodward, legendary reporter that gives a great journalist. By the way, I don't think these journalists are bad journalists. I don't even think they're bad people. I think they're part of an industrial system of production that that manufactures the public's consent. But you look at Bob Woodward, he writes a book called fear and he, he uses quotes secondhand from anonymous sources on background, on deep background, hearsay quotes and then he recreates events and he puts that, those events in quotation marks. And I get attacked for selective editing. I don't report anything unless you can hear and see it come out of the person's own mouth.

Speaker 2:          18:26          So I think that, I think that journalism has become corrupted due to this overreliance upon sources, anonymous sources especially. And I think that that's why we need videotapes. I literally remember being in like junior high school and watching CNN and they would say a source on Capitol Hill. And I would always think this is insane. What sources I Capitola anyone can be on Capitol Hill. It could be the guy that's walking his dog on Capitol Hill who is the janitor for the, you know, fast food joint. We don't, we don't see or we don't see that sources face. We don't know what motivates that person. We don't know what words were used. You know that that person exists. We don't know if that person exists. I mean, can you imagine if I said there are sources inside CNN, he says that Jeff Zucker said they'd call me a liar.

Speaker 2:          19:12          Yeah. And, and, and I, and there's an analogy here. I heard someone say that when you use an anonymous source, it's like you're taking withdrawal out of a bank account of credibility, but you have to deposit into the bank account, trust with the audience. And nowadays we don't see these, we don't see these anonymous sources we see on an over reliance upon. And every time you actually opened the reporter's notebook, every time you look at the transcript, every time you see the raw data there, there is a, there is a difference between what you are told and, and by the people that are asking you to trust them. But that's the bottom line. These, these, these immediate companies don't trust us with the raw information. They don't want us to have the raw, unfiltered truth. They need to propagandize us with their version of it.

Speaker 2:          20:03          It's crazy once you see it, right, like once you really clearly see it. Like I was actually in the green room with Jordan Peterson while he was being interviewed by Nellie Bowles who was the author of the New York Times who made that whole Brouhaha about enforced monogamy and it's like, that is not what this conversation was about. Or I had a whole day here, literally an entire day from 8:00 AM to about APM with a journalist for a journalist from a der Spiegal who then wrote a piece about me and labeled me the grand allusionist of the alt right. Yeah. They leave their labels. They did. There's a light and know this at the time, but there's a law in Germany that if you're going to print something, a quote from somebody, you have to get the quote cleared. So he spends all day with me, hours of hours and hours and hours.

Speaker 2:          20:48          He doesn't quote me once. Wow. I mean that's the level that, what is that? It's not selective editing. Yeah. They called me the master of ceremonies instead of an anchor. They used the master of ceremonies. I mean just like what the Washington Post Guy, there was nothing. I was like grand man. The Washington Post, this printed like five attractions just in reporting about me. It's like these guys have the audacity to claim that I'm a liar. In one article they said what the latest project Veritas video leaves out and the actual fact that I allegedly left out was that this CNN producer that we recorded was based in Atlanta. Supposedly this was a big fat, but I didn't leave it out. It was in the video. The Washington Post had to print a retraction that that they didn't change the headline. What the what the video left out.

Speaker 2:          21:31          They retracted the entire thing. There's another thing in the Washington Post about this book fear and there was a quote that said, there's no evidence that he did not say the things attributed to him in referencing. There's no evidence. He did not sell that. This is, you know, we live in this weird world and I think that videotape cuts through all the propaganda, like a hot knife through butter. If you catch these people on video tape, they're forced to address it. And I think that video is, is, that's why we choose the medium of video, because words, words do not transfix in a way that video does. And I think that words are the, frankly, the propagandists tool because they put you in a box by calling you names like that. My calling the masters of ceremonies by calling you what you were, you're not what that is.

Speaker 2:          22:17          You are. You got, I know we could trade these stories all day long. I'll just give you a one more. But that same reporter from New York Times, Nellie Bowles, she wrote the story when Peterson and I left Patrion. They actually did a story on it, which was quite shocking. It's a horrible story filled with factual errors. But even there, there's a quote from the head of trust and safety, a patriot and where she says, you know, you're not allowed to say these words on our platform except so as I'm sure you know Carl Benjamin is are going to occur. I've never said those words on their platform. I contacted the author and it's like she just doesn't care and she knows she's not going to get fired and why even tell the truth. So it's like they, they just don't, one thing that people are doing and more frequency is recording their interviews with these people that we, and that's something that I would encourage as long as it's legal to do so.

Speaker 2:          22:59          But you're on the record. So it's, it's, it's legal because they're consenting to the conversation even in, in California. And we had one individual inside CNN record, Alison Camera, she does a long panel discussion about voter fraud that cut the tape right before the guy actually brought up instances. So something that people are doing now, is there audio recording these interviews for that reason and releasing the full interview on Youtube? Right. So we've seen a lot of that actually Tommy Robinson has done that. Right? This guy, Avi Yemeni has done that with a yes, this Jim J. I would not. I would, I would employ your audience, never do an interview with the press unless you audio tape it. And that's for your own, um, for your own protection for sure. The other thing you can do, at least in our situation, I really only do these shows now. If it's live right, if it's alive, you can edit me.

Speaker 2:          23:50          You might be able to sandbag me and I have to be smart enough to work with that, but you at least can edit me. So Andrew Breitbart was my, one of my mentors and he would take this very, we were different people, but he would take this perspective of, you know, just as much press as possible. I'm proudly who I am. I guess it was a different world 10 years ago, but he would do, he would just give them everything. Um, I think that there's two different ways to play it, but we certainly to record, uh, the interviews is a good, a good path. And some people are leaking us these audio tapes and we put the, we put the long version out on Twitter and Alison Camerata at CNN was so humiliated by this raw version of the interview that she actually removed she, she left Twitter because people were tweeting at her while all this, uh, all these angry tweets.

Speaker 2:          24:36          So we talked a little bit about anonymous sources. What do you make of just like the anonymous accounts all over the platforms that often are the drivers of a lot of the bad behavior. So for example, there are anonymous accounts that have 20, 30, 40,000 followers that I see all day long, selectively editing video clips of me or just any, you know, any decent human being. And it's like they can do it with complete impunity because their names aren't attached to any of this. And what, what are you going to do? What, what do we do in situations? I mean, I, I've got people impersonating me and I'm not verified. I got 500,000 followers that this morning. I don't know who else. I guess there's Julian Assan. She's also not verified. Um, I don't know how to solve these problems. I don't know what the public policy solutions are.

Speaker 2:          25:19          My, my perspective. And I mean, everyone asked me what do we do about it? I say the solution is to inform the people. The solution is to show people the rot, the corruption, to, to rake the muck as it were, to be a muckraker to illuminate all the problems. Because I think the solutions become self evident when people know that there's a guy in a room in San Francisco arbitrarily determined, oh, we're going to take away and take away the blue check mark. We don't like that guy's politics film that show people those conversations behind closed doors because then they can't get it. There's impunity. They, they can't get away with it. And, and that's the, that is the solution. The solution is to expose it. Um, what, I mean, I can't believe that I'm, I mean, I, on one hand, I don't want to complain about it because it makes it me feel like I'm, you know, ingratiating myself to Twitter.

Speaker 2:          26:08          I'm not, I'm not a verified human being or a platform. And I and, and, and why not? What is the definition of, of being verified. But certainly when you are verified, it does help your, your stories get out. It does. It's people know that it's actually you and I'm sure you've had people, many people impersonating me. I don't, I don't know what the solution is, but I know that to find the solution we have to properly identify the problem and educate the people with what they're saying. You need a mole in the verified department who can just click that button. Maybe we already have one. Ah, it's, they always question is whether to cut bait. If you will be, if you will be verified with your blue check by the time this video goes up, I will be very impressed. That would be amazing. That'll be interesting somehow I think you haven't been sitting on that one.

Speaker 2:          26:51          Now the question with undercover work is when do you cut bait? Because you have these people who are in on the inside and then you have to make an editorial decision on when do we release the story? Like we have people right now, right now as I speak inside the big networks, um, who work for them. They come to me and they are so sick by how these companies project themselves. You know, all the news that's fit to print, the most trusted name in news. That is not what they hear in, in the newsrooms. They here, they, I mean we had one person say that people were crying, they were crying the night of the election at the Washington Post. Everyone was sobbing and the things that were being said that night would shock you. So these people come to me, we're calling it the be brave initiative and we think that the heroes are, these are these individuals on the inside and, and I think that they'll blow the whistle, they'll tape them.

Speaker 2:          27:46          That works. And hopefully that that will change people's perception of big media once and for all. How do you think a Trump somehow understood this? How is it that this orange man with crazy hair somehow understood that like this wasn't like he was, you know, he was always sort of a Twitter troll and doing this thing. And he understood the celebrity and he understood public relations in business obviously. But this very specific thing that we've been talking about for the, for the last hour, Trump really seems to understand this. Do you have any sense of what that is? My perspective is that it was about earned media. They was about generating are. I think that there was some something written about this where he, his advisor said, you can't run this campaign on earned media alone. You have to be more traditionally said the hell I can't watch me.

Speaker 2:          28:33          And he got some, I don't know how much it was, five, $10 billion in earned media. It's this, it's this notion of, I think a lot of people, particularly on the conservative side of the spectrum, tend to complain about wine, about, you know, the mainstream media. They, they, they, I call it the conservative ghetto. They stay talking to themselves. But, but then there's this other vision where you were, you, you, you hack the media, you, you, you participate in the media. It's again, going back to Andrew Breitbart, he would, he would, um, uh, love to go on these shows that the definition of success is being covered by the mainstream media in it's, it's, it's a tough dance because they attack you, they call you and Julie, you know, Jordan names and those sorts of things. But if you play it the right way and he covered by the media, that's, that's real power.

Speaker 2:          29:18          And Trump understood that he could win the election with earned media. It was absolutely brilliant. Nobody else saw it. Everyone thought he was nuts. But he won the election on earned media on getting these big ABC, CBS, NBC New York Times to, to cover him, to talk about him. It was brilliant. It was amazing. And everyone thought he couldn't, it couldn't be done. And he did it. And I, and by the I have the same vision, although on a lesser degree I tell my team, I tell my employees, the definition of success is to get on the front page of the New York Times. Because in Manhattan, what, what you, you know, people have to realize is that if it is not in the New York Times, it does not exist. They don't pay attention to things on the outside. I hate to give them that power, but it's still true to a degree.

Speaker 2:          30:07          So to, to be successful is to be covered by the people that we hate. And also, and also not to get stuck where we want to be loved by those people. Yes. But because that's the problem. That is, that is the problem. We want to be loved. And Rush Limbaugh says, you know, I, I learned that to be hated as a sign of success. And that's where a lot of Republicans go wrong. Trump did not go wrong. A lot of Republicans want to be loved by the New York Times, by politico. Um, it's tempting. I want to be loved you. Everyone wants to be loved, but we're going to be hated for what we say and do. So it's being co, so Trump's getting covered by them, but he also calls them fake news. Brilliant. It's Andrew Breitbart 2.0 all right.

Speaker 3:          30:54          So in, in summation here, if you had to, if you were in the predictions game, where do you see the platforms do, do you sense that the way we communicate right now we're, we're all on these things and we're all subjected to these objective rules and seemingly arbitrary decisions and all of those things. Do you sense that five, 10 years from now it's going to still be the same or do you think that things are going to massively change?

Speaker 2:          31:21          They are only going to change if independent citizens have the courage and the willpower to do something about it? I don't trust the politicians. I don't trust the people on television to do anything about it because they're stuck in the status quo and they're fat and happy. It's going to require citizens, independent people. You know, some of these insiders, I know some of them and others, they have to blow the whistle. They have to summon the righteous indignation. I think that journalism has the power to change hearts and minds, real investigative reporting, uh, to, to be the, uh, what has been called the custodians of conscience. And if we can shock that people, show them what's going on behind the closed doors, I think it can change things. If that does not happen, I think we'll enter a brave new world where that doesn't happen.

Speaker 2:          32:10          We're a long gun, right? Yeah, but, but, but, but, but there are people, I know these people, they're going to blow the whistle. But if that does not happen, then we're going to enter a brave new world. But where the story has to be so big, here's the silver lining. Even if we get banned, even if you get banned and I get band, everyone gets banned, the stories will come out and other people will share them proxies, we'll share them and they'll share the information that, that people will have a right to know that we'll want to see. But I think it's going to require an effort by, by independent citizens and brave patriots willing to blow the whistle. That is the only saving grace I can see for this country. Uh, the, the heroes amongst us, they, they can, uh, to pitch a little bit. They can go to our website and I will give them a camera. I will pay their legal bills, I will hire them if they are fired by their employer. Twitter and Facebook have not sued me. I get sued a lot. I have not been sued by those companies. They do not want to give heft and weight to the stories that we have unmasked. They do not want to give us free publicity. So there is a, uh, a strategy here to, to hold these people accountable.

Speaker 3:          33:19          I'm going to ask you one more actually, which is, I've asked this of a few of my guests that I think are on the forefront of saying on popular things are doing work that is challenging and interesting way. What is it about you? Why, why, why do you James O'keefe put your ass on the line

Speaker 2:          33:35          if I, if, if very tasks went away tomorrow and I had no employees, I'd be out hustling on the street with a cam quarter and this is I, this is what I was born to do. Like I can't do anything else. And it goes back to this whole idea of a justice complex, like the acorn investigation that cost me $1,000 to do. I borrowed my grandmother's Chinchilla coat, a camcorder that a friend gave me, an a borrowed copy of final cut pro and acorn was defunded. Both houses of Congress are democratically controlled. President Obama signed the bill. It doesn't take money to do this. It doesn't take power to do this. It takes, it takes will. It takes the design. It takes a belief in justice. It takes a desire to to expose something, to inform your fellow citizens and finding people who are likeminded. If they were to take away my organization, I'd be doing this the rest of my life.

Speaker 2:          34:23          I had nothing else I could do because I believe in it. I actually believe in what I'm doing and the people that I find I have, I have a profound responsibility to serve the the people, to tell the truth to the people and people coming forward that want to blow the whistle. This is, this is why Veritas now exists, is to equip those people and to protect them. I'd be willing to go to jail to protect a source. I have been to jail. I've been incarcerated. I've been sued. I've been set up. It's not, it's not the worst thing. The worst thing is not to to serve the people that come to me and want to tell a story, and that's why we exist and we're going to keep doing it until people are honest.

Speaker 3:          35:05          On that note, you can follow James and Project Veritas on Twitter for as long as they're still on Twitter. It's at project underscore very tough.
