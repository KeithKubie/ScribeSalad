00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.240
So here's my idea, Charles.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.460
You know how in Star Trek
they have a transporter room?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do know that.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt; So let's see if we can
do a transporter slide.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.560
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.720
It's like the Electric Slide.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, so
I'm going to dematerialize,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.440
rematerialize someplace else.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.360
And you'll rematerialize here, so
you can drive the rest of the lecture.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.460
&gt;&gt; Makes perfect sense to me.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.795
I don't see anything ridiculous
about that at all, it's good.

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.821
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Did it work?

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:23.611
&gt;&gt; It worked.

00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:24.342
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:00:24.342 --> 00:00:26.299
&gt;&gt; All right thanks Michael,
I think it is awesome.

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:27.925
&gt;&gt; No, no that's really cool,
and you know what else?

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:29.455
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; I got your almonds.

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:34.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
Curse you Kahn!
