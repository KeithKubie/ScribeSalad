00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.500
Hey there strange lovers, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.270
Welcome to the Sanctum Sanctorum, the home
of Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme!

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.000
It's from the upcoming Dr. Strange movie!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.720
And in the movie, Dr. Strange defends our
world from invaders from other dimensions,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.110
using his mind and mystic artifacts of untold
power.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.440
And I know it sounds strange, but some physicists
think the idea that there are multiple universes

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.800
other than our own is entirely possible, and
what it means is that out there could be people

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.800
like-

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Hello Julian

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
Well, like him.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.850
Yeah, I was afraid of that, he’s evil.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.270
See our universe is big, really big, possibly
even infinite.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.009
But since there's only 118 elements, you can
only combine them in so many ways.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.140
That means, eventually everything is going
to have an exact copy.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.850
And that means there should also be copies
of us that are just a little bit... off.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.480
There could be a version of me that’s left
handed or has perfect eyesight or has crazy

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.480
opinions.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.800
Comb your hair!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.159
Now under normal circumstances you should
have to travel really, really far away to

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.860
run into these exact copies.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.890
MIT Cosmologist Max Tegmark thinks you should
have to travel 10 to the 10 to the 29 meters

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.549
before running into that handsome devil.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.610
That’s a number so huge it needed a second
level of exponents to convey: it’s exponentially

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610
exponential!

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.951
So how Evil Julian got here I don't know,
maybe through an Einstein-Rosen bridge DON'T

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:49.390
TOUCH THAT!

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.060
Well that’s just great, now we have another
universe to deal with.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.920
And ut looks like reverse Julian over here,
or Nailuj as I call him, is from another theorized

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.009
kind of universe.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
But unlike Evil Julian’s, is entirely separate
from our own.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.039
Nailuj seems to be from a universe where the
"arrow of time" flows backwards.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.950
In our universe, it flows forwards because
things move from a state of order to chaos:

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.970
balloons pop, candles go out, and we age and
get more wrinkly.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.069
But some theorize that on the other side of
the Big Bang could be a mirror universe, where

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.450
the arrow of time, at least from our perspective
points backwards!

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.900
So balloons un-pop, candles un-blow, and Nailij
just keeps getting younger and smoother.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.500
Of course, on this side of the Big Bang, it
is possible that there are other universes

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.849
making up a multiverse.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.780
One popular idea almost immediately after
the Big Bang space expanded at a rate so rapidly,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.050
multiple times the speed of light, that eventually
it slowed down and the universe we saw coalesced.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.730
But opens up the possibility that some areas
didn't stop expanding and until later.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.010
They kept inflating like bubbles.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.560
And eventually when they slowed down and their
universes formed, they were completely different

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.909
from our own.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.800
In these universes the laws of physics can
be totally different.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.970
Electrons and protons could have different
masses or gravity could have different strengths.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.110
The speed of light itself could even different!

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.790
So what that means is in these universes,
the constants we know and love, could mean

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.030
that atoms can't form and nothing can exist.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.430
And it looks like this particular universe
is not contained inside it's bubble.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.530
Oh man, Trace and the DNews gang are going
to kill me.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.330
If this torrential void doesn’t destroy
the entire universe first.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.909
Um, I have an idea...

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.750
Well that was convenient.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.650
Of course all these ideas are just possible
ways that other universes could exist.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.099
But that means that there are some very tantalizing
possibilities out there.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.379
What if somewhere out there, superheroes are
real.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.870
And they're not just the product of so guy
named Stan's imagination.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.760
If the universe like the really existed, well
that would really be a Marvel.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.940
Hey we'd like to thank Disney, Marvel and
Youtube for coming together to make this whole

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.140
crazy thing happen.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.360
