Try solving this practice problem on variation. You'll want to decide which type

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.115
of variation it is first, and then set up the correct proportion. Write your

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.745
final answer here, and don't worry about the unit; I've already included it for

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.043
you.
