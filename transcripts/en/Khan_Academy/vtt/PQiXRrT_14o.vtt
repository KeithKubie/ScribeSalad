00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:01.938
- [Voiceover] So, I
have this somewhat hairy

00:00:01.938 --> 00:00:03.630
function definition here,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.184
and I want to see if we can graph it.

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:06.611
And this is a piecewise function.

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:09.600
It's defined as a different,
essentially different lines.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.200
You see this right over here,
even with all the decimals

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.366
and the negative signs,
this is essentially a line.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.713
It's defined by this line
over this interval for x,

00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:17.833
this line over this interval of x,

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.048
and this line over this interval of x.

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:21.473
Well, let's see if we can graph it.

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:23.467
I encourage you, especially
if you have some graph paper,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.333
to see if you can graph
this on your own first

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.069
before I work through it.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.158
So, let's think about this first interval.

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:31.340
When negative 10 is
less than or equal to x,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.773
which is less than negative two,

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:38.628
then our function is defined
by negative 0.125x plus 4.75.

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:43.266
So this is going to be a
line, a downward sloping line,

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.100
and the easiest way I can
think about graphing it is

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.767
let's just plot the endpoints
here, and then draw the line.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.100
So, when x is equal to 10,

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:57.138
sorry, when x is equal to
negative 10, so we would have

00:00:57.334 --> 00:01:00.366
negative zero, actually
let me write it this way.

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:02.433
Let me do it over here where I do the,

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.600
so we're going to have negative 0.125

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.284
times negative 10 plus 4.75.

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:13.400
That is going to be equal to, let's see,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.866
the negative times a
negative is a positive,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:20.866
and then 10 times this is
going to be 1.25 plus 4.75.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.967
That is going to be equal to six.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:29.032
So, we're going to have the
point negative 10 comma six.

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:32.836
And that point, and it
includes, so x is defined there,

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:34.600
it's less than or equal to,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.800
and then we go all the
way to negative two.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800
So, when x is equal to negative
two, we have negative 0.125

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:46.834
times negative two plus 4.75 is equal to,

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.400
see negative times negative is positive,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.933
two times this is going to be point,

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:57.033
is going to be positive 0.25 plus 4.75.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.580
It's going to be equal to positive five.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.285
Now, we might be tempted,
we might be tempted,

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.701
to just circle in this dot over here,

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.979
but remember, this interval
does not include negative two.

00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:11.633
It's up to and including,
it's up to negative two,

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.866
not including.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:17.667
So, I'm gonna put a
little open circle there,

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.434
and then I'm gonna draw the line.

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:23.308
And then I'm gonna draw the line.

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:28.066
I am going to draw my best
attempt, my best attempt,

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.700
at the line.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.314
Now, let's do the next interval.

00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:33.945
The next interval, this one's
a lot more straightforward.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.100
We started x equals negative
two, when x equals negative two

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.100
negative two plus seven is,
negative two plus seven is five.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.466
So, negative two, so
negative two comma five,

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.433
so it actually includes
that point right over there.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.366
So we're actually able to fill it in,

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:54.100
and then when x is negative one,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.100
negative one plus seven is
going to be positive six.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.501
Positive six, but we're not
including x equals negative one

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.560
up to and including, so it's
going to be right over here.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200
When x is negative one,
we are approaching,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.700
or as x approaches negative
one, we're approaching

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.533
negative one plus seven is six.

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:17.633
So, that's that interval right over there.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.700
And now let's look at this last interval.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.333
This last interval,
when x is negative one,

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.750
you're going to have,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.256
well, this is just going
to be positive 12 over 11

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.261
'cause we're multiplying
it by negative one,

00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:34.261
plus 54 over 11 which
is equal to 66 over 11

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:36.485
which is equal to positive six.

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:39.740
So, we're able to fill
in that right over there,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.500
and then when x is equal to 10,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.176
you have negative 120 over 11.

00:03:45.176 --> 00:03:46.655
I just multiplied this times 10,

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:49.567
12 times 10 is 120, and
we have the negative,

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.879
plus 54 over 11.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.565
So this is the same thing.

00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:55.894
This is going to be, what is this?

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.894
This is negative 66
over 11, is that right?

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:05.600
Let's see, if you, yeah,
that is negative 66 over 11,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.830
which is equal to negative six.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.838
So when x is equal to 10,

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:13.730
our function is equal to negative six.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.861
And so this one actually
doesn't have any jumps in it.

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:21.861
It could've, but we see,
so there we have it.

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:25.562
We have graphed this function
that has been defined

00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:28.266
in a piecewise way.
