00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Every single minute, twenty four people around the world flee their homes

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.340
because of violence and natural disasters, war or human rights violations.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.340
As a result, there are around sixty-five million people who have currently been forcibly displaced from their homes.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.920
Fifty percent are under seventeen years old

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.180
while seven percent are unaccompanied minors.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.420
But where do they go?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.300
While many have discussed the social and political implications of these moving groups,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.040
we wanted to understand 'how do you build a refugee camp?'

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.180
Refugee camps exist around the world

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.840
from Azerbaijan to Thailand to one of the largest camps Dadaab, located in Eastern Kenya

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.920
which currently has two hundred and forty-six thousand (246,000) people living in it.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.940
We decided to visit Lesvos, a Greek island near Turkey

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.020
which has been an essential entry point into Europe for refugees

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.540
fleeing places like Syria and Afghanistan and making the trip across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.160
The capital of Lesvos is Mytilene, a surprisingly lively port city

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.540
considering its population size of around 30,000 people.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640
But as the refugee crisis began in 2015,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.380
it became one of the spontaneous sites for those fleeing war and persecution,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.880
and a transit refugee camp called Kara Tepe was set up on the outskirts of the city

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.820
which would become a gold standard for refugee camps.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.440
Currently, it is housing at-risk populations.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.960
In the beginning Kara Tepe was just an Olive Grove;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
no place to shower, no place to use a bathroom. It was complete chaos.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
At the peak of the refugee crisis, thousand of people were arriving daily to this area.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.480
They would stay for two to three days

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.600
and then continue their journey to mainland Greece.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.000
At times, five-thousand (5,000) people were occupying Kara Tepe

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.200
even though its capacity was 1,400.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.360
So the first thing that refugees need when they arrive at the camp is information.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.820
After their traumatic experience, they may not know which country they're in,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.320
they don't speak the language,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.300
and they need information in this critical time to understand the process.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.120
So I arrived here, I think it took us around ten hours.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.020
In the sea.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.000
Hearing someone speaking the same language with them.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.120
"Don't be afraid, you are safe here."

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.140
"Listen to me and you will go through these procedures,"

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260
"You will get your paper, you will buy your ferry ticket,"

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.880
What do they need to ensure that they can be safe here while they stay here,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.300
but knowing that they would be moving off the island very very shortly

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.420
and they need the information that would be key for them

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.920
to make informed decisions about their journey to Europe.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.480
Another really important aspect, obviously, for everyone is water.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.380
And so when this crisis first happened,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.940
what they would do is have people lined up and handing out water.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.640
But thankfully it's close to a city

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.080
and they were able to actually hook the water up through the city

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.760
to right here.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.720
The whole island is suffering this problem.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.460
So for this reason, we provided the tank capacity of 15 cubic metres of water.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.820
So in case there's a water cut, we have our own reserved water on site.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.580
- Hi!
- Hello

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.640
I youtube'd you, 6 million subscribers!

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.440
Okay, say hi to our new friends.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.960
Can you let us know your name?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.580
How are you?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.680
- Eman.
- And my name is Tharouat.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.200
And they've been nice enough to let us see into their home,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.180
and talk to us about how what it's been like here at the site.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.220
So what were you studying?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.220
I studied English.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.120
Can he speak Arabic?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.220
- Yeah

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.160
- What's that?
- Topography

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.780
M: They're both very smart people.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.200
G: They're both smart. Smarter than us!

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.820
Water is not only essential for hydration,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.820
but a key component of the WaSH program

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.480
which stands for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.840
Poor sanitation can lead to diarrhoea, dysentery,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.960
cholera outbreaks, and other serious issues if not contained.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.040
You have to imagine 5,000 people with absolutely nothing.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.500
So we're talking about open defecation, this kind of situation.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.780
The first response is always chemical toilets

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.740
that are placed at least 50m away from the nearest dwelling.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.480
These are not sustainable and only a temporary solution.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.460
The priority is then to build proper toilet, bathing, and laundry facilities.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.800
Ten showers, fourteen latrines, ten washing areas.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.080
As you can see, everything was built as basic as possible,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.120
just to be able to deliver as soon as possible

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.260
and being able to relieve the situation.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.760
For me, I accept everything here.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.380
I am happy for I am here.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.200
I don't know.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.940
We were students, but he don't complete.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.540
Unfortunately, I don't complete, too.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.780
And I stopped for the war.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.840
Because of the war.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.580
My familly's in Holland.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.100
So we want to go to Holland,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.220
and we want to complete our education.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.000
So once you've got this situation in control,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.340
you're able to monitor and to track them.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.600
Then you can switch to a different distribution method.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.800
Having like a kiosk, like the one you have behind us.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.360
People have a certain amount of items they can receive per week.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.780
This is the most popular item -- the baby wipes.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.280
Why do you think this is so popular? Because it's just used for everything?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.100
Yeah, you can use it for a baby, you can use it for yourself.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.200
So they may have things like toilet paper, wash scrubs.
- An example of the sanitary pads is like this.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.200
And we take this nice bag

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.280
- We use always for dignity reasons.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.500
- And we give it like that. So no one will know it's sanitary pads.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.740
So people come here, and you mention they have a card.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.560
- Yes.
- So how does the card work?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.480
This is the month, the shelter, the householder.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.940
Two adults, five minors, one kid.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.400
Food in Kara Tepe is delivered to people's door

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.640
in order to avoid complications that occur when forcing people to wait in long lines.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.360
And there are several nutritionists who have designed balanced meals,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.420
which include any dietary restrictions.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.840
Next up is shelter.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.020
In the beginning, refugees were staying in tents.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.440
But as the site is built out, refugee housing units,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.120
or RHUs, come into play.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.000
These were designed in Sweden, in partnership with Ikea.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.780
Plastic houses that can be built in a day

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.760
and help against the weather and the elements.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.800
As Kara Tepe's population became more stable and permanent,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.120
the final step was to install isoboxes

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.540
of which there are currently 258.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.180
In each shelter, the capacity recommended is six people per shelter.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.640
But they'll be focused on one particular family,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.320
or a group of people who know each other?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.260
So for example, this area is mostly Arabic speakers and African a little bit.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.120
And then in the backside area and in this area is more Farsi speakers that are originally from Afghanistan.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.220
So these isoboxes have only been here for a few months now,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.880
and they're basically just solid structures with not a whole lot on the inside.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.660
- Really hot.
- Yeah, they can get really hot.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.680
Some of them, I think, have AC units installed.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.000
But at least protection from the elements in extreme cases of weather.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.340
- That... kite.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.880
Whoa!

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.460
- That's amazing!
- YouTube!

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920
Okay, sit down

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.320
Got a little. YouTube.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.580
G: Why did you start making kites?

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.740
Hasan: "The kites are the only toys available for kids. They have no other toys to play with."

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.640
"So I became a master in making them!"

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.000
G: So how long have you been here in Kara Tepe?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.220
H: Three months.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.620
G: Three months. Okay.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.000
H: Now, seven and a half months.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.180
G: Seven and a half months.
H: Yes.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.460
G: In Greece.
H: Yes, yes.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.780
Electricity has been always a really big challenge.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.980
We needed to respond with renewable energy,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.560
like the solar panels.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.420
And at the same time we have an olive kernel burner.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.180
Kara Tepe has the same electrical installation as the common house, for the entire camp.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.820
Which is why renewable energy has become so essential.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.800
Here, behind us, the structure with the cupcakes on it,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.200
these are solar panels,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.140
and these solar panels will power these isoboxes to have one light,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.200
plus a USB port to charge your phone.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.360
And that's also really important because the USB port

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.700
and their phones is how they use flashlights at night

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.260
and obviously the light is important for them to be able to see at night.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.840
Being connected to Wi-Fi is also extremely important to the refugees.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.260
The news is always changing.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.000
The options are always changing.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.780
Or even if the options stay the same,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.140
the rumours around those options are rampant.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.240
So it's incredibly important for refugees

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.280
to be able to go online,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.380
to be able to check and see what the actual facts are

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.880
around those circumstances here.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.040
So it's a really interesting camp because it's so well put together,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.260
there's so much sort of thought and order which goes into it,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.380
which you've been told, in other camps, is not necessarily the case.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.120
Some of them have much rougher conditions,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.860
have a harder time getting water, or sewage, or electricity.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.860
So basic needs are being met here,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.640
that's an interesting good thing to see.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.920
Kids, children who've been staying here for eight to nine months,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.580
they need to have access to education.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.120
This is part of the human rights, you know.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.540
And children rights.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.040
Eman: I just studied to pass the exam. Just to pass.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.380
G: Would you learn Shakespeare?

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.360
E: Yes, Shakespeare.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.420
We have a whole subject just for Shakespeare,

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.640
and theatre for Shakespeare.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.100
It's very difficult.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.300
G: Because it's hard for us to understand.
M: Yeah, even if we speak English.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.060
E: Yeah, I don't understand it.
M: Another language.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.300
E: It's not English. I don't know.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.800
Education programs for a refugee and moving, displaced populations

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.740
are the basic courses that will enable them to join, at a later stage, a normal curriculum.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.760
As the camp becomes more established and more long term,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.380
things like psychologist offices come into play,

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.620
and doctors offices come into play, to help with,

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.980
not only trauma that has happened from the previous events,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.420
but chronic issues with health and mental stability.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.880
You know, these are people who,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.900
for the most part, have fled war.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.220
They're seeking sanctuary.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.880
They really want nothing more than to live a safe life.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.780
They want their kids to go to school.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.740
They want to pursue their dreams.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.000
And they're stuck here,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.920
and they really have no true sense of what's gonna happen

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.840
for them in the next few months.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840
No sense at all.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.460
If we want to go to Holland, I think we have to wait for the passport to go to Holland.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:50.180
Then there we can say that we maybe don't want to come back.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.800
I don't know the law. So I don't know.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.820
We came here to talk about the actual logistics of building a refugee camp,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.140
but you are just consistently meeting people,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.760
talking to people,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.560
and realising the humanity of it all.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.660
And not only refugees, but the people who work here

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.480
who are so passionate about the work they do and care so much,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.640
put themselves into...

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.140
I think the issue is just so complex.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.140
Like so often people have these opinions on them.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.480
They're like, "this is my opinion, and this is the way it should be."

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.980
But it's so complex.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.120
The levels of what's going on,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.680
and the empathy that's required for everyone to understand

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.300
and to move forward is really high.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.020
It takes effort to learn about these things.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.020
The whole thing is just being educated on the issue,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.360
but not projecting your feelings too much

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.620
and not projecting that anyone can understand the entirety of this crisis.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.620
And it's just a really difficult situation that

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.360
a lot of people are put in without wanting to be.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.620
So being compassionate, being empathetic,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.620
is the most we can do

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.120
to people who are suffering.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.120
And so if something were to happen in your country,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.400
there is laws and ways that you could leave,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.940
and have something like this to be set up,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.500
but you would always want your freedom back.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.780
So far this site, the way it's improved,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.880
and now the quality of life now existing here,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.640
it's amazing.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.680
You can't find another site all over Greece with the same living conditions.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.720
But of course, as a human being,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.700
I would like also these people to move somewhere else,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.320
get something better.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.060
Not a camp or site, or whatever you want to call it.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.060
For the IRC, the ultimate would be to see

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.060
a world where there were no refugee sites.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.160
Where refugees could be integrated into local communities.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.320
Where refugees are integrated into urban settings.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.900
They are living lives that are full

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.320
and self sufficient,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.280
and free.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.600
All we want from the government is to help us just to go out from here.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.380
Yeah, we don't want anything -- just to go from here.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.660
"Our Greek brothers spared no effort with us at all."

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.600
"And despite their limited resources,"

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600
"they did more than what they should."

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.400
"But we hope for more than this."

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.220
"Not because we are greedy, but we hope they move us out of this prison."

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.720
"If you lock the bird up in a cage made of gold,"

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.720
"it will not be happy, it will be a prisoner."

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.940
"I am looking for some freedom and peace."
