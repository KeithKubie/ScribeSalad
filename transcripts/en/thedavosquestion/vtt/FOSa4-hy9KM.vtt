00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
&gt;&gt; I do believe India can become a superpower
in the coming years to

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.429
come, or the decades to come, but what India
needs to strengthen from

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.989
inside is its infrastructure, its energy security,
dependence on

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:21.540
various forms of energy needs to be increased.
Primarily with focus on renewables like solar,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.370
wind, and various other
forms of energy.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.100
Education is another thing that needs to be
strengthened to create a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.899
workforce for the world which adds quality
and value for all the

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.690
services around the world.
Manufacturing is another area that India needs

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.609
to focus on, and it's
already doing, getting the highways in place

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.079
to move the Indian
economic goods in and out of the country,

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.350
within the country, making
the hinterlands, reaching out to the hinterlands

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.579
with power, telecom
and various other progressive materials is

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.780
what makes India a
superpower in the future.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.499
And I think we're geared up for that and we
should be going for that.
