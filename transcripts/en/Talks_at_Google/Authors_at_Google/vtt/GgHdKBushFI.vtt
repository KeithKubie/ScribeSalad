JOE LAZAUSKAS: Thanks, Eric.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.817
And hi, everyone.

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:08.900
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.960
It's definitely an
honor to get to speak

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.550
at a place like Google.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.670
And it's also awesome because
this gave me an excuse

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.520
to spend expensive
trip out to LA

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.730
and escape the frigid,
depressing, New York cold.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.230
I know you guys probably
think this is cold,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.870
but this is like
beach weather to me.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.328
I'm going to be out there later
in, like, my "Jersey Shore"

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.650
tank top just fist pumping
on the beach in Venice.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.840
And I'm really glad to be here
to share some of the lessons

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.070
from my book that just came out
just a week ago, with my friend

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.000
Shane Snow, who
co-founded Contently.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360
For those of who
don't know, Contently

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.410
is a technology company
based in New York.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220
We basically have a
network of over 100,000

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.830
freelance creatives
throughout the world

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.160
and a technology platform that
is essentially like Salesforce

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
for content, allows you
to manage your content

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
for all parts of your
organization, different aspects

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.190
of the customer journey,
different departments

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.410
within your org.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.280
It makes sure all of it is
really high quality, aligned,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.290
on brand, all that good stuff.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.640
And what I do is
content strategy there.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520
I head up our content
strategy group.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.920
So I help our
customers figure out

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.830
what stories they should tell,
because this is something

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.780
I'm really passionate about.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600
I'm a journalist by trade.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
I had a news site that
I started out of college

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.370
that I ran before Contently.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.350
And then I came to
Contently to figure out

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.740
how to tell our story.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230
It's line that
propelled our growth

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.870
from a startup with
just a few people to one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.660
with hundreds of employees
all over the world.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.700
And it's something
that we've seen

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.130
make a really big
impact for our clients

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.350
over the past seven years.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.710
As the dynamics of search
and social platforms

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.070
have broken down the walls
between brands and consumers,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.760
we've seen the power of what
can happen when a brand is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.350
able to tell its story.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.260
And what I want to talk about
here today is just a few

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.217
of the keys that I see to
the future of storytelling

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.550
for businesses, the things
that will separate those that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.890
do a really good job from
those that tend to struggle

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.610
or continue to put out
product one sheets and display

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.710
ads in sheep's clothing.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.370
And so this is a lot of
stuff that's in the book.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.654
Eric was kind enough to
buy about 25 books that are

00:02:25.654 --> 00:02:26.820
scattered around here today.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.930
So please take a copy.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.800
If there's probably
some extras, take some

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.150
and give them to a friend.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.550
And I hope that what
I present here today

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.200
will peak your
interests a little bit.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
So at Contently, we have this
mirror on our wall that says,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.960
those who tell the
stories rule the world.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.760
It's a Native American
proverb, and it's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.240
something that really captures
the ethos of the company,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.910
something we really believe, And
every presentation, everything

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.570
we do, we want to tell a story.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.970
So I want to start with
a story here today.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.780
And it's a story of Thomas
Edison, known to you guys

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.682
probably as a really
great inventor.

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.140
But what a lot of
people don't know

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.810
is that Edison was an
even better businessman.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.320
He was kind of like the
Steve Jobs of his day.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.610
And what Edison was a
really, really good at

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.990
was gathering a bunch of
engineers, understanding

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.570
what was the next
big thing that would

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.110
capture people's attention
that would really wow them.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.090
And then bringing together
really smart people

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.610
to make those things and kind of
take all the credit after that.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.340
And so around the turn
of the 20th century,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.040
Edison came up with an
invention called a kinetoscope.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.430
And what Edison realized
was that if you took still

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.420
images and moved them in rapid
succession in front of light,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.850
you could create the
illusion of life.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.680
You could create
a motion picture.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
And whenever Edison knew
that he had a really, really

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.730
good invention, he would
build up a lot of hype.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.120
Like Jobs, he would
pack a bunch of people

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.520
into a large auditorium.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.800
In this case, it would
be an opera house.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.390
And people would
come out, and they

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.170
would put on their best
blazers and suits and top hats,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.430
their finest furs.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.460
And they would sit in
anticipation for Edison

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.600
to come out.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.310
And Edison would wait, and
he'd wait for them to build up,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.960
wait for all the anticipation
to build up, and he'd come out.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.120
I don't know if like Jobs he
would wear black turtleneck

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.430
and put his hands like this
in front of a spotlight,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.640
but I'd like to
imagine that he did.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.070
And so Edison came out and he
unveiled his newest invention

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.600
of the kinetoscope.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.830
And it started to play,
and people gasped.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.800
People ran up to the screen and
put their hands in front of it.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.300
They couldn't believe
what they were

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.280
seeing, that it wasn't real.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.180
And you know what they saw?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.060
It's this.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.740
It was garbage.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.120
People literally
watched garbage.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.570
This first movie was
straight-up garbage.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.750
People put on their finest
furs, their best top hats.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.370
They got a babysitter to go
and watch the kids at home

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.510
so that they could
watch garbage.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.740
But the thing is they loved it.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.560
And this led to the
launch of Hollywood.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.430
There's 23 movies released
between 1900 and 1909;

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.040
the next decade, over 4,600.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.220
In the '20s, nearly 7,000
films, and some of those

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.200
films were quite good.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.700
They were hits.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.686
But then something happened.

00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:31.810
And the number of films
being produced in Hollywood

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.490
started to decline.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.740
And there's a reason for that.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.770
It's that while there's a few
really good films, most of them

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.340
were garbage.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.060
Most of them had no narrative,
no plot, and no story.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.809
They were just grainy footage
of a train or garbage.

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.100
And it's actually one of the
first storytelling lessons

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.790
that we'll learn, which is
that garbage stories are

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.070
only cool when
there's they're novel.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.660
Only when that medium
first comes out

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.900
were people willing to
come in and get dressed up

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.120
all fancy to go watch garbage.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.860
But once it stopped
being new, they

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.090
stopped wanting to
keep coming out.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.040
And this is a pattern that we
actually see with all mediums,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.250
with web content.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.340
So I don't know about you
guys, but when I first

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.340
got the internet, I
got that AOL dial-up,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.040
had that sweet serenade of
shutting off my mom's phone

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.840
line and dialing up.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.580
GeoCities was my jam.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.640
I was just enamored,
from a young age,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.280
with this dynamic where
you could go and see

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.680
this information and
content that people from all

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.659
over the world were
posting, or see stuff

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:31.950
that your friends were posting.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.741
And it didn't matter
if it was good or not.

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.810
I'd spent hours reading
random Xangas and LiveJournals

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.010
and GeoCities pages.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.096
I would read the embarrassing
emo poems and confessionals

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:44.220
that my friends would post.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.130
And I have to admit, I probably
posted some of those myself

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.030
as well.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.110
Please, no one
try and find them.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.200
I'm sure they exist somewhere.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.820
But eventually what
we get is that that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.920
stopped becoming novel.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.100
And before long,
the internet became

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.340
this kind of cesspool
of garbage content being

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.060
posted onto the web.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.500
We got bad eHow articles about
how to write bad eHow articles.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.810
We saw this with blogs.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.310
When the first-person
blog came out,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.380
we had people like Bill
Simmons and Pete Cashmore

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.780
that were able to build this
giant audience without a lot

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.920
of promotion just by posting
these first-person blog

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.670
posts and essays and online.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.980
But eventually, we just got
more and more of that crap.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.105
We got this slew, this
cesspool of first-person blogs

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:33.730
and narratives.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.070
It became harder and
harder to break through.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.730
We saw this with infographics.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.229
It used to be that
if you could make

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.520
an infographics in
the early 2000s,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.260
you'd get on, like,
any blog out there.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.160
But so many people started
creating bad infographics that

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.110
didn't communicate
information very well,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.320
that didn't tell a story,
that by 2008, Mashable

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.290
was banning any guest post
submissions or any submissions

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.820
with infographics in them.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.410
We saw this with Facebook.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.870
So when brands
first got Facebook,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.880
when first Facebook
first opened to brands,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.620
it seemed like a miracle.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.510
You could just
post, like this post

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.990
if you will if you hate
Mondays, and people would get

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.970
hundreds and hundreds of likes.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.880
Brands would get a each to
30%, 40% of their audience.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.500
But what happened is brands
kept posting that kind of crap.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.776
And eventually people
stopped engaging with them.

00:08:22.776 --> 00:08:23.400
It wasn't cool.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.080
It wasn't novel
anymore that you can

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.750
interact with Tide on Facebook.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.250
And reach dropped
to less than 2%.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.940
We saw this with Instagram,
with Pinterest, with LinkedIn.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.480
The same pattern is
that eventually there's

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.730
new platforms, people
are interested in it,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.970
and it gets flooded
with so much garbage.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.910
And this is what we
call the Edison cycle.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.350
Technology enables a new medium.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.240
People make garbage.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.770
And then people
ignore the garbage.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.200
So in conclusion,
everything is garbage.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.926
That's the end of my talk.

00:08:57.926 --> 00:08:59.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.150
Actually, no, there's more.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.970
But then something
else happened.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.040
So do you remember this chart
we had a moment ago, the garbage

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.514
chart?

00:09:10.514 --> 00:09:11.930
Well, something
really interesting

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.800
happened after that.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.760
Can anyone guess?

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.155
Get five free books
if you can guess it.

00:09:19.155 --> 00:09:20.280
I think we have five extra.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.160
AUDIENCE: Cold War.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.165
JOE LAZAUSKAS: Cold War?

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:25.970
[LAUGHS] One for the Cold War.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.610
One more guess.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.542
JOE LAZAUSKAS: Very close--

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:34.650
"Star Wars."

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.790
So in 1977, "Star
Wars" came out.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.670
And it recaptured
and reinvigorated

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.357
people's imaginations with
what going to the movies

00:09:42.357 --> 00:09:42.940
could be like.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.620
People started to
get that feeling they

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.420
had from that first moment where
they saw Edison's film, where

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.490
you went, and it was an event.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.930
You'd take your friends.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.610
You'd perm up your 'fro, get
your best friend's jacket,

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.480
best bell bottoms,
You'd go again and again

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.350
and again to see "Star Wars"
because the story was so good.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.800
It captivated you so much.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.250
It created this incredible
sense of wonder.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.600
And this is, in fact, where
the cycle continues in mediums,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.330
is we see that technology
enables the new medium,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.950
people make garbage,
people ignore the garbage.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.480
And then with every medium,
creativity breaks through.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.240
So that's why Shane
and I-- my co-author

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.031
likes to call this
actually the "Star Wars"

00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:26.380
cycle, in part, because
we're huge "Star Wars" nerds.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.660
In any medium, we'll
see that the key

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.720
is that creativity and great
stories need to break through.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.200
And this led to the
advent of blockbusters.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.560
And it's something that we
saw revitalize the industry,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.650
as people started putting in the
care and effort and investment

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.900
to make better and better films.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.640
And we see this
with all mediums.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.510
So let's go back to web
content, by the late 2000s,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:56.370
content on the web had a lot
of noise, a lot of mess in it.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.060
And especially in financial
content, so banks,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.080
financial brands had started
posting content on the web.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.210
But most of it was these bad
PDFs, white papers, basically

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.270
bank brochures
re-posted to the web.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.200
Then there is one company
called Mint that came along.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.700
That was one of our
first customers.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.817
And I think when we think
about brands creating content

00:11:17.817 --> 00:11:20.150
on the web, it's a really
inspiring example because they

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.420
thought, what if we
talked about the one thing

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.890
that everyone
really cares about,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.580
which is how to manage
your money better?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.850
Whether you need to buy a
house, pay student loans,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.940
just save, better manage
your credit card debt,

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.580
it's something that
matters to anyone.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.920
They found that no one was
doing a very good job of talking

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.390
about money on the web.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.810
So they started writing in
very colloquial language,

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.540
first person, very
visual-heavy language.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.120
And they started amassing
millions of readers.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.770
They put out things
like a visual guide

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.790
to the financial crisis, that
are reported all over the web.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.290
And they're one of
our first clients

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.830
that really showed us how
brands and businesses that

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.500
told really good dynamic
stories could build

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.450
incredible relationships,
because people

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.556
were emailing Mint every day.

00:12:09.556 --> 00:12:11.430
Thousands of people
would email Mint and say,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.000
thank you for helping me
pay down my student debt

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.250
or pay off my car
or buy a house,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.720
because they were making a
difference in people's lives

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.490
through the stories
they were telling.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.560
And this is
something that we see

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.020
is that the science
of storytelling

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.470
actually shows that great
stories build relationships.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.120
Great stories make us care.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.640
Over the last 10 years,
a lot of new research

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.250
has come out that shows
that a strong connection

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.450
between storytelling and the
chemical oxytocin in our brain.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.820
For a while, we didn't
know much about oxytocin.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.430
We just knew it was something
that was released when mothers

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.830
would be close to their babies.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.610
But what we have seen
of late is research

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.550
that shows that when we
engage with really, really

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.340
good stories, when we are
captivated by a story,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.950
it actually releases
this empathy drug

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.280
oxytocin in our minds
that makes us care more

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.315
about the person that's
telling us the story,

00:13:06.315 --> 00:13:08.690
be it the protagonist, the
brand that's telling it to us.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.710
It builds a connection between
us and the person telling it.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.620
And research has shown that
storytelling can break down

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.720
barriers to foster
compassion, tolerance,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.580
and respect for differences.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.190
It's shown that it can
build those interpersonal

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.020
relationships and that
sense of connectedness.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.200
So we think about
this modern world,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.180
where that barrier between
businesses and individuals

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.390
and the rest of the world
has been broken down,

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.860
where we no longer have
a means of just having

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.360
someone's captivated intention.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.550
But we have to earn
it every second

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.460
because we have this magical
device buzzing in our pocket,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.390
beckoning us for our attention
and with thousands of stories,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.520
that you need a really
compelling narrative

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.160
to build those relationships
with people and make them care.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.310
And as human beings,
we are absolutely

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.900
programmed for stories.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.310
When we hear a story,
the neurons in our brains

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.130
fire at five times
that capacity.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.200
It illuminates the
city of our mind.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.470
And we store information
so much better.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.680
And that's what's led to the
rise of this thing called

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.360
content marketing,
which is essentially

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.120
the practice of a
brand telling its story

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.180
to engage with people, to build
relationships with the folks

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.040
that it wants to sell to.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.560
But this doesn't have
just to do with marketing.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.570
It has to do with
all the relationships

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.390
that we have as human beings,
with the relationships that we

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.030
have as a leader with the
people in our company,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.190
as a team member with the
other people on our team.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.370
So when we tell our story,
we're able to draw people

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.470
in and build empathy
between us and them.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.800
And we really believe that
the businesses of the future

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.050
will figure out how to
tell breakthrough stories,

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.050
or they're going to fail,
because there's really

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.490
no other option if you
want to actually gain

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.950
people's attention and
a place in their minds.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.180
And so we think about
the three keys that

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.470
will lead to great storytelling
by businesses and leaders

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.060
and everyone else in the future.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.710
Telling those
breakthrough stories

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.440
that goes above and
beyond just the garbage

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.900
status quo of a
given medium is key.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.030
But there are other things
as well that we think

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.490
will have a really big impact.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.470
Next story I want to
tell is of Netflix.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.980
So in 2008, Netflix acquired
the rights to "House of Cards."

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.980
Everyone thought they
were crazy at the time

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.670
because everyone said, Netflix,
you're a technology company.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.530
Why are you spending
$100 million on a show?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.750
But "House of Cards"
was a really big hit.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.830
Next they came out with
"Arrested Development."

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.624
Everyone was like,
OK, that makes sense.

00:15:32.624 --> 00:15:34.540
"Arrested Development"
was a big cult classic.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.650
People loved it.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.126
But then they came
out with a show

00:15:37.126 --> 00:15:38.500
called "Orange is
the New Black,"

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.290
and people started to scratch
their heads because there

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.870
was no one famous in
"Orange is the New Black."

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.110
There is no
Kevin-Spacey-type figure,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.040
who obviously wouldn't do so
well today, but at the time,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.530
was extremely popular, in
"Orange is the New Black."

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.480
In fact, the biggest star in
"Orange is the New Black,"

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.210
the biggest name, was this guy.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.910
And no one was actually going
to go start watching a show

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.440
to see this guy.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.390
But the thing that
Netflix knew--

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.645
I'm just going to leave
this up for a second.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:16.690
The thing that Netflix
knew is that they

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:22.030
had so much data about their
audience's viewing habits.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.887
So Netflix is
obsessed with data,

00:16:24.887 --> 00:16:27.490
with tracking how
people watch things,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.460
the succession in which
they'll watch shows,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.430
their finish rate on shows,
their re-watch rate on shows,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.040
and the interlap
between when people

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.300
watch one show or another.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.850
Where is there a
correlation between watching

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.500
x-show and y-show?

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.961
How do people discover
shows within Netflix?

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.460
What are the things
that will prompt

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.230
them to start
watching a new show

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.180
and then keep
watching that show?

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.600
With "Orange is the
New Black," Netflix

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.890
needs something pretty unique.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.070
So through all their
data, they knew

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.910
that certain viewers really
loved any shows or movies

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.520
with women-led ensembles.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.010
And they knew there was a big
overlap between those viewers

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.450
and people who watch "Weeds."

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.839
"Weeds" was one of the most
popular shows on Netflix,

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.599
one of the best gets they'd ever
gotten when they licensed it

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.890
from Showtime.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.530
It was constantly in the
most popular in Netflix.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.589
They saw people watching
it all the way through,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.190
calling out for work for
12 hours on a Tuesday

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.829
to just sit back
and watch "Weeds"

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.109
and maybe smoke up
a little themselves.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.820
And they also knew
that those people

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.110
were very likely to
watch a show that was

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.320
prompted to them by Netflix.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.780
So there are
certain viewers that

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.750
took Netflix flicks
recommendations very seriously

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.207
and would watch a
show unprompted.

00:17:42.207 --> 00:17:44.290
So they saw there's this
intersection with "Orange

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.260
is the New Black," which
a women-led ensemble, that

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.790
was started by the same show
runner, Jenji Kohan, as "Weeds"

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.880
and would succeed
well with viewers

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.920
that were prompted by
Netflix recommendations

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.180
to watch this show.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.890
So they pushed it out to that
target audience of people,

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.330
and they were able
to get "Orange

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.280
is the New Black" to essentially
go viral with these viewers.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.920
People just watched it
all the way through.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.870
They posted on Facebook,
on Twitter about it.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.370
And "Orange is the
New Black," which

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.710
was a much smaller investment
than "House of Cards"

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.070
was, was a huge success
and actually paid off

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:23.800
in three months, helping Netflix
earn over 630,000 subscribers,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.830
more than "House of Cards"
or "Arrested Development"

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.970
had for them.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.190
And this is a
formula that Netflix

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.860
has repeated over and over,
with "Stranger Things,"

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.320
with "13 Reasons Why."

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.470
And while 35% of
network shows get

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.770
renewed after the first
season, 70% of Netflix

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.530
shows get renewed, and
that's because this data

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.470
and technology power that
Netflix has gives them

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.120
double the advantage.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.840
And so we think about the
future of brand storytelling,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.640
of content marketing.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.885
I truly believe that human
creativity will always be key.

00:18:57.885 --> 00:18:59.260
I think robot
writers are getting

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.350
really good at doing
things like writing up

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.780
game recaps from basketball
games or baseball

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.490
games or any financial reports.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.430
But when it comes to
telling human stories,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.130
I think that humans will
always win in that capacity

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.650
because we're able
to tell our story,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.470
and we're able to use that to
connect with people in a way

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.940
that robots or AI can't.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.850
So I think that will always
be a constant in storytelling

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.190
and the quality of brand
storytelling out there.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.010
But I do believe that
technology has the capacity

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.005
to help us really understand
what the people we want to each

00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:32.380
want to see, what's going to
engage them the most, what's

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.450
going to make them call
off of work all day

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.630
and sit down and
watch what we put out

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.270
or read the articles
we put out, or engage

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.920
with what we post out on Twitter
and Facebook and LinkedIn?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.420
And while right
now what we see is

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.220
that most people in
the industry are just

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.860
using a little bit of technology
to help them figure out

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.420
what their audience
actually wants,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.500
what they'll engage with.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.480
The smartest people
in the industry

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.750
are using the first-party
data they have available,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.260
the amazing slew of search
and social tools that we

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.140
have available, many of
them put out by Google,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.720
to understand what our
audience really wants.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.820
And they're riding the
crest of that wave.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.070
And that's why I really
believe the second key will

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.070
be taking advantage of
that technology advantage

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.430
to tell great stories.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.590
And for my third
and final key, I

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.074
want to tell the story
of a young Kevin Costner.

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:21.740
He's in a field.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.740
He's kind of looking
confused and sultry.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.100
And he hears a voice, if you
build it, they will come.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.390
And they did come.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.060
But there's one problem.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.110
They were ghosts.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.020
And so what does this have
to do with content marketing

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.530
and brand storytelling?

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.580
Well, right now we have
seen that [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.700
last year's show that 5% of
all branded content put out

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.370
gets 90% of the attention.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.800
And so essentially,
a lot of brands

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.720
are creating content, but
very few are being successful.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.180
And that's because so many
folks see creating content

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.390
as the ultimate goal.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.130
They create a blog.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.997
They create content.

00:21:01.997 --> 00:21:03.080
They publish that content.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.330
And they just expect
people to magically come.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.250
They expect it to work.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.720
But usually, they don't.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.820
And if they do, it might just
be some bots or some ghosts.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.870
And while content spend across
the marketing industry is up,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.070
content strategy is flat.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.550
Less than 40% of marketers
in B to B and B to C

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.170
have a documented
content strategy.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.635
It's self-sabotage.

00:21:25.635 --> 00:21:27.260
And this is something
that we're really

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.290
obsessed with at Contently
is creating and implementing

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.600
a methodology and
a content strategy

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.300
for every single client
that we work with.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.480
And we actually think there's
a simple formula for building

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.080
an audience that can help
marketers and brands really

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.821
understand the cycle of
content creation and content

00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:47.570
optimization that they
need to go through.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.830
And to explain that, I want to
go back to the 16th century,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.640
to 1500 AD, to the
advent of mass media.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.210
So during the
Italian Renaissance,

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.720
it was a flourishing time
of culture, information.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.704
And there was the first
mass media publication.

00:22:08.704 --> 00:22:10.370
It was called the
[? "Ivicci." ?] It was

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.770
essentially the TMZ of its day.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.670
And so what would happen is
you would have these gossip

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.040
writers, and they would
go out to the churches,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.330
to the markets, and they
would gather the day's gossip.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.280
And they would come back,
and they would print it

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.660
up using the printing press.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.990
It was a new invention
that came out in the time.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.970
And so they would
painstakingly go and print up

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.420
these newsletters of the day,
these gossip newsletters using

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.435
the printing press.

00:22:40.435 --> 00:22:41.810
And then they'd
go out and they'd

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.495
distribute it all around town.

00:22:44.495 --> 00:22:45.870
But there's
something interesting

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.830
that started happening.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.560
So there's the [? "Ivicci" ?]
writers using the printing

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.204
press.

00:22:49.204 --> 00:22:50.620
Then some other
writers said, hey,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.730
I bet we can beat
the printing press

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:57.140
people to market if we just hand
write our gossip newsletters.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.380
So they started hand writing
the gossip newsletters.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.150
But then something happened.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.190
They started getting
their heads chopped off.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.170
Because it turned
out that people

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.840
really didn't like it when you
talked about who is bribing who

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.820
and who was sleeping with who.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.100
There was a lot of
gossip writers getting

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.540
their heads chopped off.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.702
So big reason for that is
they'd put their name on it.

00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:20.850
It would be "The Daily
Gossip" by Antonio.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.820
So what they did
instead, started

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.140
taking their name off it.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.140
And the people who were
doing the printing press

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.920
started hand writing
as well because they

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.720
realized it was faster.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.790
And the gossip
newsletter started

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.359
to flourish because
they'd go out,

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.900
and they'd do it in
the dead of night

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.774
so they wouldn't get
their heads chopped off.

00:23:36.774 --> 00:23:38.910
No one knew they were
posting it there.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.799
And this tells us one thing,
which is that strategy matters.

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:44.090
How you publish it is as
important as what you publish.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.754
Just because there's a
new way of doing things,

00:23:46.754 --> 00:23:48.920
a new technology that allow
you to put it out there,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.320
doesn't mean it's
necessarily going to succeed.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.420
And it's a deeper
pattern that we actually

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.340
see throughout
all forms of media

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.980
that have succeed throughout
time when folks are trying

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.740
to build an audience,
which is that you go out,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.842
and you start creating content.

00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:04.800
You have a hypothesis
for what's going to work.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.950
So let's print out
some gossip newsletters

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.600
using the printing press.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.340
Then let's engage people.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.790
Let's go out, distribute
it around town in daylight,

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.540
and then optimize.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.706
So what did they figure out?

00:24:15.706 --> 00:24:17.340
It was too slow.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.950
So next, try hand writing
it, put your name on it,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.660
engage, go out, post it
around town, and optimize.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.765
Oh, shit, we're getting
our heads chopped off.

00:24:27.765 --> 00:24:29.140
So what did they
figure out next?

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.780
Take the name off
it, engage, go out

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.469
and distribute it in the
dead of night, then optimize.

00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:35.260
You keep your head.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.070
Everyone's happy.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.240
You have a successful
newsletter.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.020
To illustrate how this
has happened again

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:47.440
throughout history, I want to go
to 1851, my hometown, New York,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.270
the Lower East Side.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.080
And this was the start
of, the advent of,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.230
the big mass-market newspaper.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.950
Everyone who is anyone,
anyone who was anyone

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.340
had a newspaper at this point.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.740
And there was essentially two
big rivals in the newspaper

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.540
market at the time in New York.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.810
There is Joseph Pulitzer
of the "New York World"

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.750
and Andrew Hearst of
the "New York Journal."

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.680
And at this time, the printing
press had gotten pretty good.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.824
It was a really efficient, good
piece of technology to use.

00:25:20.824 --> 00:25:22.240
You couldn't beat
someone to print

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.809
by hand writing a newspaper.

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:24.850
Printing press was great.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.350
So reporters would go out.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.890
They'd gather today's news,
bring it back, print it up

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.170
in the newspaper.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.940
And then they would give
it to these chain-smoking

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.765
11-year-olds to go out and
hand out to people as they

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:38.890
were getting on the subway.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.999
They'd gawk, extra,
extra, read about it.

00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.790
And what they found is
because the only way

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.880
to really get to sell newspapers
and get in people's hands

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.520
was to have as sensational
headlines as possible,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.530
something you'll
probably find familiar

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.300
if you've been on
Facebook lately.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.510
So it'd be things like, "Woman
Survives Mad Leap" and "War

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.610
is Coming."

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.880
But then this journalist, one
of my favorite people in history

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.120
came along and proposed a better
way to tell these stories.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.000
Because at the time,
what the "New York World"

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.700
and "New York Journal" really
wanted was loyal subscribers.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.530
They want people who would
get the newspaper delivered

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.960
to their house every day, have
a sustained model, instead

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.690
of having to go and
compete for sales just

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.780
by having chain-smoking
11-year-olds hawking newspapers

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.710
at subway stations.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.900
And Nellie Bly was
a young journalist.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.140
She came in to Joseph
Pulitzer's office.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.270
And she asked for
a job that was seen

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.340
by most as only a job
for men at the time.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.520
But she was a brilliant
woman, incredibly courageous.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.890
And what she
proposes is that she

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.210
wanted to get locked up in a
mental hospital for two weeks

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.300
and document everything
that was happening inside.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.730
And so Joseph Pulitzer said OK.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.240
She went.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.580
She got locked up.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.380
And she wrote everything she
could about the atrocities

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.530
inside the mental hospital.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.730
Joseph Pulitzer got her out.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.959
They published a serial story
about all the atrocities

00:27:01.959 --> 00:27:03.500
in the New York
mental health system.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.510
It led to mental health reform
inside of New York state

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.470
and then eventually
across the country.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.520
But even more importantly
for Joseph Pulitzer,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.250
it led to a great
degree of loyalty

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.330
for the "New York World."

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.070
People started subscribing.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.570
And this teaches
us a lesson, which

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.420
is that where content is
everywhere, as it is today,

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.090
go deep, tell bigger
stories, tell better stories.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.910
Tell stories that differentiate
you from the next website

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:28.860
out there.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.250
That gimmicks are fleeting, but
quality always builds loyalty.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.020
And again, we see
the flywheel pattern.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.690
They started
creating content that

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.974
was just sensational headlines.

00:27:39.974 --> 00:27:41.890
They would have the
chain-smoking 11-year-olds

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.410
go and hawk it all over
New York subway stations.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.660
They'd optimize because
there was no loyalty.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.850
So then they started
creating better stories,

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.030
deep, investigative stories.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.855
They engaged people, had the
chain-smoking 11-year-olds hawk

00:27:54.855 --> 00:27:56.879
the newspapers all over town.

00:27:56.879 --> 00:27:57.670
And they optimized.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.545
They got subscribers.

00:27:58.545 --> 00:28:01.030
They got a better
business model.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:06.700
And this led to the biggest
newspaper empires and media

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.380
empires in the country.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.720
Andrew Hearst eventually
adopted this model

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.630
and now has this glimmering
glass tower in New York.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.630
Joseph Pulitzer took the lessons
that he learned and started

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.960
Columbia Journalism School.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.280
And this eventually
trickled down

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.200
to all these different trades.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.590
It wasn't just mass
newspapers that

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.790
were extremely successful,
but verticalized magazines,

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.450
and under Hearst's empire,
in fashion, in news,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.300
and economics.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.670
And finally, I want
to show how this has

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.129
applied during the digital age.

00:28:41.129 --> 00:28:42.670
I want to tell the
story of Upworthy.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.950
I know we often
derive Upworthy today.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.920
But there's a lot we
can learn from its rise

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.540
into the fastest-growing
media company in history.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.420
So in 2012, Upworthy
came out, and they

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.370
had a simple idea,
which is that there

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.680
was all this awesome
content that was out there,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.700
really inspiring
stories on YouTube that

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.350
basically had been thrown away.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.910
It had really incomprehensible
titles and metadata.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.150
It wasn't really searchable
or findable by anyone.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.967
And they thought, what
if we take that garbage--

00:29:18.967 --> 00:29:20.800
it's actually pretty
good-- and repackage it

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.680
in a nice package, different
headlines, very shareable,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.980
very shareable article
format and then

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.980
distribute it out there?

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.390
Test it a bunch
of different ways

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.720
on Facebook, through Facebook
ads, just a few dollars each,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.840
and figure out which packaging
worked best, which headline,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.112
which hero images, et cetera.

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.320
And then they would optimize.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.920
They'd test all these different
ways of getting it out there.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.072
They'd find the winner.

00:29:45.072 --> 00:29:46.780
And then they'd send
it to as many people

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.521
as possible through organic
and paid Facebook distribution.

00:29:50.521 --> 00:29:53.020
And then, over time, they would
figure out better and better

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.600
ways to package content.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.540
They'd figure out what types of
videos they could find or make

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.170
worked really well,
really inspired people.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.830
They'd go and they test it 25
different variations, at least,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.480
every story.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.679
And they'd optimize.

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:10.720
And then they'd figure
out even better packaging,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.620
the one with the
dinosaurs and the ribbons.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.020
They'd engage people through
an email newsletter list

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.700
that they built up.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.020
And they were able to optimize.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.150
They were able to build
a huge business out of it

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.120
because they got a huge
audience that they built up

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.400
on Facebook and via their
email lists, people who

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.160
loved these inspiring stories.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.830
And this allowed
Upworthy to become

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.500
the fastest-growing
media company in history,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.070
to greatly outpace "Business
Insider" and "Huff Post"

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.400
and other fast-growing
media giants of its time.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.730
Now, eventually, Upworthy
stopped figuring out

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.890
how to optimize
and do things that

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.490
were passed the click-bait
headlines that Facebook cracked

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:50.400
down on.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.610
But nonetheless,
this cycle worked,

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.590
this pattern worked
extremely well for them.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.860
And that's because
they were able to crank

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.620
the flywheel faster
than everyone else.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.150
Other folks out there were
testing different headline

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:06.660
variations.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.118
But Upworthy was doing it in
a way where they are committed

00:31:09.118 --> 00:31:13.590
to doing it at rapid speed, to
A/B test as fast as they could,

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.690
and optimize faster
than everyone else.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.730
And while Upworthy
has faded away--

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.646
I mean, they still have
a pretty good audience

00:31:19.646 --> 00:31:21.600
of 20 million
readers each month--

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.530
we've seen other digital
publishers copy this model.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.860
And this teaches us that the
faster you crank the flywheel,

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.200
the better it's going to work.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.610
And as marketers, as
people want to tell stories

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.630
to build audiences, we need to
test and crank that flywheel

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.930
as fast as possible.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.600
And if we do, we
will get the kind

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.390
of insights that allow
us tell the stories

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.484
that our audience will
really love and engage with.

00:31:45.484 --> 00:31:46.900
And that's why I
believe right now

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.690
we are entering a golden
age for all content types.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.720
The ability to use technology
to tell incredible stories

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.880
to figure out what
our audience wants,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.770
to measure the performance
of those stories

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.300
and optimize continuously over
time has never been greater.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.020
As an individual creator,
you have so many tools

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.720
to go out there and create
incredible interactive data

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.940
visualizations, to create
snowfall style stories,

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.500
to create quick motion
graphic video, even if you're

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.092
someone like me, who isn't a
great coder or a programmer

00:32:18.092 --> 00:32:19.300
or even a great videographer.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.830
The tools we have out there
are just so tremendous.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:27.190
And that the marketer of today
is really today's director.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.040
But let's not be the
garbage director.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.050
Let's do content marketing
that breaks through.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.500
Thank you.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:38.594 --> 00:32:40.760
AUDIENCE: So the first
question that I wanted to ask

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.920
was around the challenges today.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.607
And so what I mean
by that is every day

00:32:45.607 --> 00:32:47.690
I meet different kinds of
people that will tell me

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.110
some spiel along the lines
of I want to tell my story,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.880
but I feel like it's
already been told.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.312
And to some extent, that might
be true, if you've studied

00:32:56.312 --> 00:32:57.020
or read Campbell.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.360
But would you have
any words of advice

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.805
or point us in the right
direction of like how

00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:04.680
do you approach that?

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.374
Like, how do you get past
that mental hurdle of I

00:33:07.374 --> 00:33:08.290
want to say something.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.998
I feel like what I
have to say is unique.

00:33:09.998 --> 00:33:12.450
But it's already been told.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.406
JOE LAZAUSKAS: I'd say
that, especially if you're--

00:33:15.406 --> 00:33:16.530
you have a business, right?

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.760
There's a chance you
started it for a reason that

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.799
is unique to you, that
hasn't been said before.

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.840
You have a perspective on
the industry, something

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.312
you're passionate about, that
other people haven't said

00:33:28.312 --> 00:33:29.520
or haven't thought of before.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.340
Like, for us, it
was this simple idea

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.595
with Shane and or
co-founder, Joe,

00:33:35.595 --> 00:33:40.290
is that Shane was a student
at Columbia Journalism School.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:45.660
He graduated 26 years old, saw
that all these different really

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.970
talented writers around
him were looking for work,

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.710
couldn't find work,
couldn't figure out

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.501
how to make a website
to get freelance work

00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:54.030
because the recession was
just destroying digital media

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.920
all over the place.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.120
Our other founder, Joe,
was a young [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.070
in Vegas, who really couldn't
find any writers to create

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.470
content for his blog, because
he saw that becoming really

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.120
important with the
increase in search traffic

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.971
and the advent of social media.

00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:12.429
And they came
together to basically

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.639
to create a company to
bring those two together.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.659
That's like a unique brand
story that no one else

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.239
had told before and is
incredibly compelling.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.830
Our sales people tell it
in most every meeting.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.040
We also had a unique
perspective on the role

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.020
that content and
storytelling could

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.840
play in helping brands build
relationships with people.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.330
I think most
businesses will find

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.210
that they have a similar story,
a perspective that they have,

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.030
what they believe is coming in
the future for their industry

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.590
that they can talk about.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.810
This is especially
true in B to B, right?

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.929
It's kind of hard to be a
thought leader in cereal.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:50.087
I'm not sure what you can really
say if your Captain Crunch

00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:50.795
or Count Chocula.

00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:52.170
At that point,
you seem to create

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.110
more entertaining content
that people will really like.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.470
But if you're in any sort
of specialized industry,

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.150
particularly B to B, you should
have something unique to say

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.120
or some perspective on where
the industry is headed.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.774
And that's what you
should leverage.

00:35:07.774 --> 00:35:09.690
You should look at your
audience, what they're

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.790
searching, the questions
they're asking,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.140
and then figure out
how can I tell stories

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.540
that answer that
question in a way

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.510
that no one else has before.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.070
And the biggest
thing is you just

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.440
have to get out there
and start trying things.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.040
So many brands want
to just sit there

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.350
and wait for the perfect
opportunity to come along.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.460
But the thing is, is
that, if someone else has,

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.072
or if you're looking
for a case study that--

00:35:38.072 --> 00:35:39.280
I think Seth Godin said this.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.120
If you're looking for
a case study that's

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.590
come out about what
you want to do,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.840
chances are you're going to
be too late at that point,

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.420
because you're just going
to be the "me too" person.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.125
You're going to be
that brand that's

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:53.420
jut saying something that
someone else has already said.
