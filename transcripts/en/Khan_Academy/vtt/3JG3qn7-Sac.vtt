00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.190
So where we left off in the
last video, we kept trying to

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.900
approximate this purple f
of x with a polynomial.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.510
And we at first said we'll just
make the polynomial a constant

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.190
and set it -- it's just going
to intersect f of 0

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.880
at x is equal to 0.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.940
So that's a first -- you can
kind of all think of it as a

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.590
0 of order approximation
of the function.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.230
Then we said, oh, what if not
only do they intersect at x is

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.920
equal to 0, but let's say that
their slope is the same as x is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.140
equal to 0, and that's
that approximation?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.470
And that's about as good as
you're going to do with a

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.020
line, especially as
you get close to 0.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.820
And we said, OK, that's good,
but what if their second

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.650
derivative is the same?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.380
And that's where we ended
up with -- we added

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.690
this term here.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.360
And I hinted that we'll just
keep doing this process.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.880
And so you could imagine, if I
want the third derivative to be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.910
the same, I could add another
term right here, plus, where I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.310
know what the value of f of
x's third derivative is at 0.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.860
So I'll write that as f to
the third derivative at

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.130
0 times x to the third.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.280
Now what do you think is
going to be down here?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.490
What's going to be
he denominator?

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.690
You might be tempted to say
that we'll put a 3 down here.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.000
But it turns out you're going
to put a 3 times a 2, which

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.910
is a 6, or 3 factorial.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.700
Now why is that?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.560
Let me just take a little
departure here and I think

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.700
you'll start to understand
why you put a 6 down here.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.510
Why this isn't a 3
and you put a 6.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.370
Here you put a 2, but 2 is
also 2 factorial, right?

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.000
2 factorial is 2
times 1, right?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.480
Hopefully you remember what
factorial -- actually, let

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.140
me tell you what factorial
is just in case.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.610
10 factorial is equal to 10
times 9 times 8 times 7, dah,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.510
dah, dah, dah, times 2 times 1.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.870
So you're multiplying all of
the numbers up to that number.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.380
4 factorial -- and the numbers
get big very, very fast -- is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.670
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.960
2 factorial is equal
to 2 times 1.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.060
1 factorial is equal to 1.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.290
Now this is kind of
a weird definition.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.820
It comes out of combinatorics.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.100
Actually it works for what
we're doing is, well, 0

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.850
factorial is also equal to 1.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.470
I know that might be a
little un-intuitive.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.700
This is just a definition.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.280
It's like saying that i squared
is equal to negative 1.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.450
It is a definition that it
makes formulas be more

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.720
general, I guess is a
simple way to put it.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.790
But let me erase all of this
because that was just a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.580
divergence just because I
realized I was going to use

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.100
factorial, so you should
know what a factorial is.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.825
But I think that's a fairly
straightforward concept.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.820
So going back to
what we were doing.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.030
I was asking you why do I put
a 6 down here instead of a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.810
3, like we put a 2 here?

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.840
Well, let's just take
this term alone and take

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.770
its third derivative.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.840
So if I have the term and it's
f, the third derivative at 0, x

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280
to the third over -- and
let me just write 6 as

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.240
3 times 2 or 2 times 3.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.210
That'll make it a
little more clear.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.500
What's the first
derivative here?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.010
What happens when I take
the derivative once?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.080
Well, I'm going to multiply the
whole thing by the 6 exponent

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.230
and decrement the
exponent, right?

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.660
So I'm going to multiply the
whole thing times 3 times f,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.660
the third derivative, x
squared over 2 times 3.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.600
So that first time I did
it, this 3 and this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.100
3 cancel out, right?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.850
That red's looking a
little bit too demonic.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.630
Let me pick another color.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.150
And then when I take the
second derivative what

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.110
am I going to get?

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.390
Well, the 3's gone, now I just
have a 2 in the denominator, so

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.760
I multiply the whole thing by 2
times f prime prime prime of 0

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.830
times, and I decrement the
exponent, x to the 1 over 2.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.390
Well, now the 2's
cancel out, right?

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.580
So the reason why you're
putting a factorial there is

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.645
every time you take a
derivative you're decrementing

00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:04.360
the exponent 1, and multiplying
the whole expression

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.010
by the exponent.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.460
So if you're going to take n
derivative, you're essentially

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.070
going to be multiplying this
expression times n factorial.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.130
So you don't want an n
factorial out here.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.560
You put an n factorial
at the bottom.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.380
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.300
Play around with it yourself
and it should start to make

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.290
a little bit more sense.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.970
So in general, if we just
kept doing this process

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.350
forever, what would the
function look like?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.580
The reason why I'm covering
this is because going this way

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.390
we're going to be able to prove
what I think is the most

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.090
mind-bending concept
in mathematics.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.590
And it will make you love
mathematics, hopefully.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.490
Some people actually --
well, I won't go into the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.570
spiritual aspects of it.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.990
So what would be this, if I
just kept saying that I'm

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.710
just going to keep taking
derivatives and adding them to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.730
this term, this polynomial?

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:11.290
Well, the polynomial would
become p of x is equal to f

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:18.440
of 0 plus f prime of 0 x.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.010
And let's just divide it by 1
factorial, just to make it

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.640
clear that that's a
1 factorial, right?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.690
And that's an x
to the 1, right?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.060
That's just this term,
but I just wrote it a

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.980
little differently.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.250
This term right here, this
is f of 0 times x to the 0.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.650
I know that's really
messy, but hopefully you

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.270
see what I'm saying.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.640
And that's over 0
factorial, right?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.920
0 factorial is 1, x to the 0
is 1, so it's just f of 0.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.740
And then plus the second
derivative at 0 times x squared

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.570
over 2 factorial plus --
and we just keep adding.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:06:00.170
The third derivative at x is
equal to 0 of x to the third

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.970
over 3 factorial, and
we just keep going on.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.430
So we could do
this to infinity.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.810
And actually we will do
it, and this is called

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.240
the Maclaurin Series.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.570
So if we just wanted to
approximate this as hard as we

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.410
can, essentially take the
infinite derivatives of it, we

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.090
get the Maclaurin Series.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.340
So we are going to define
this polynomial p of x.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.120
It's going to be the infinite
series, the infinite sum.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.260
Let's start with n is equal
to 0, and we're going

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.415
to go to infinity.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.580
What is each term?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.180
It's going to be f of -- well
it's going to be f, the nth

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:57.220
derivative of f evaluated at
0 times x to the n

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.950
over n factorial.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.260
This is the Maclaurin Series.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.730
We're later learn that the
Maclaurin Series is a specific

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.070
example of the Taylor Series,
which is a specific example

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.150
of a power series.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.140
But anyway, this might seem
very complicated to you.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.350
I have all the sigma notation.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.830
Just remember, this is
essentially just that and I

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.240
just keep going to infinity.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.030
And if you play around with
it it should make sense.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.580
But I think this will become a
lot more concrete when I do

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.200
this with a specific f of x.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.230
This is where it gets cool.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.910
In case you don't think
it's already cool.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.470
So let's pick f of x to be,
to me, the most amazing

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.010
function of them all.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.420
If I ever built a shrine or
a church or something or

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.100
skyscraper, I would somehow
make this function show up all

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.220
over the place, and then years
from now people would be awed

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.960
by the mysticism of it all.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.280
But anyway, let's try to
approximate e to the x

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.690
with a Maclaurin Series.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.120
You know that sigma thing,
that's hard to memorize.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.020
Just remember you want all the
derivatives to be the same.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.590
So let's make the
approximation of this.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.795
Actually, I won't prove it.

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.820
It's out of the scope of
what we're doing right now.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.030
But the approximation, even
when it's centered at 0,

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.660
actually equals the function
when you take the infinite sum.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.470
But let's just see
what it looks like.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.890
Because this is pretty cool.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.940
Before we start building the
polynomial, let's just figure

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.550
out a couple of things.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.590
So what is f prime of x?

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.470
That's also e to the x, right?

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.540
What's f prime prime of x?

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.170
Well that also
equals e to the x.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.140
We have learned and actually
recently did a proof that

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.050
the derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.720
But that also needs a second
derivative and the third and

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.946
the fourth and the nth
derivative of e to the x

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:52.600
is equal to e to the x.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.040
I could take an arbitrary
number of derivatives of e

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.700
to the x and it equals e to
the x, which is amazing.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.300
The rate of change of the
function at any point is

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.360
equal to the function.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.360
The rate of change of the rate
of change of the function at

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.660
any point is equal
to the function.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.570
I mean that's -- I want to just
go some place and ponder it,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.400
but I'm too busy making videos.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.320
But anyway, back to
what we were doing.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.040
So what is f of 0?

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.230
f of 0 is equal to e to the 0,
which is equal to 1, right?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.390
Well that's also going
to be f prime of 0.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.560
That's also e to the 0,
which is equal to 1.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:37.350
So all of the derivatives, the
nth derivative at 0 is going to

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.522
equal 1 for this specific case
of f of x, for e to the x.

00:09:41.522 --> 00:09:43.990
And this is why
this is so cool.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.130
But actually, it actually
gets even more amazing.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.240
So, you hopefully realize
that f of 0 and all of

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.320
its derivatives at
0 are equal to 1.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.530
So now we can do the powers
of the Maclaurin Series

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.530
in the next video.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.032
See you soon.
