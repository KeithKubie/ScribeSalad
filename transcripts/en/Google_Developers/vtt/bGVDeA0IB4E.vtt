MANO MARKS: Hi.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.865
I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.260
I'm a Developer Advocate on
the Google Maps API team.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.984
With me today is Steve Gray.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:15.900
STEVEN GRAY: Hi there.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.700
MANO MARKS: Steve is a
Google Developer Expert.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.230
Steve tell us a little bit about
the Google Developer Expert

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.780
program.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.780
STEVEN GRAY: Google
Developer Experts are really

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.210
experts that Google
has recognized

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.910
as an expert in certain product
fields, so for me it's maps.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.890
And we go to conferences.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.479
We talk at events.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.190
We build sample
codes and blog posts

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.895
about how to use
different products.

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:39.770
You can really say that
we're the go-to gurus

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.170
for the different products.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.330
MANO MARKS: You've built an app
using the iOS SDK for Google

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.470
Maps, and it's called Synaptic.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.720
Tell us a little bit about it.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.546
STEVEN GRAY: Synaptic pulls down
data from the UK Met Office.

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:56.670
MANO MARKS: The Met Office?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.635
Sorry, I don't
know what that a--

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.260
STEVEN GRAY: The Met Office is
a government body here in the UK

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.700
that deal with all
things weather related,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.637
so forecasts, they
build models for what's

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:09.220
happening in the
weather on the island

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.500
and get the data out
as forms of forecast

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.050
on TV, and the data
out to us developers.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.010
MANO MARKS: Great.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.710
The app we have running here.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.230
Why don't we go ahead and
take a little bit of a look

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.099
at it, so that people can
see what we're talking about?

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.390
What am I looking at right now?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.540
STEVEN GRAY: This is the
precipitation forecast

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020
for the UK for the
next few hours,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.930
and as you see the
layers are animating

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.970
across the map and bands of rain
that are coming across the UK.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.325
The more red the actual
color is on the overlay,

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:48.009
the more rain
that's in that area.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.550
MANO MARKS: This is
the kind of thing

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.165
that you would see in
TV broadcast at night,

00:01:56.165 --> 00:01:57.790
or something like
that, and telling you

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.910
about what's going on.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.590
STEVEN GRAY: Yeah.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.470
MANO MARKS: How did
you do this animation?

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.980
STEVEN GRAY: When the app
starts, if you just load it,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.949
it pulls down the latest
forecast and the latest

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.110
observations for the UK.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.920
Then lines up the
images as an animation

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.970
and then loops
random on the map.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.266
So you can see this really nice
flow of images across the map.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:26.140
MANO MARKS: And you're
using ground overlays.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.432
You're basically
just changing the PNG

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:30.640
that the ground overlay uses?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.973
STEVEN GRAY: Yeah, that's right.

00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:36.020
I basically go away and
fetch up all the images

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.290
and the animation.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.980
And when that's preloaded, then
just start the animation off,

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.480
and for every loop
around the timer

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.890
it will insert the ground
overlay onto the map,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.080
and it gives us nice
illusion of animation.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.040
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.540
What are some of your favorite
overlays that you've got here?

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.060
STEVEN GRAY: There's two
really awesome overlays here.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.700
My favorite is the clouds
and the rain together.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.800
And as we fetch the images.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.120
MANO MARKS: It does take a
moment to fetch the images,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360
but once it does
it, they're cached,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.960
so they can run through it.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.060
And you can see that it's
actually pretty fast.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.380
STEVEN GRAY: You go away
and fetch all the images,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.560
so that we don't have this
broken cycle of animation.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
We've got one infinite loop
of the animation of the latest

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.130
forecast.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.890
You have here the cloud cover
and the rain cover of the UK

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.200
forecast for the next few hours.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.190
MANO MARKS: You can barely
see the UK on there.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.020
STEVEN GRAY: Yeah, this
is natural for the UK.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.060
We're always under clouds.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.775
It's a given.

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:48.900
MANO MARKS: I've noticed
that since I've been here.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.020
STEVEN GRAY: We have
this layer, which

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.186
is really nice, because
everything you load this up,

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:55.880
it will load up the forecast
for the next 8 to 12 hours.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.070
My other favorite is
these observation layers.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.650
You have this
infrared observation,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.170
and this is a
really nice overlay,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.040
because it's actually the images
that come from the weather

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.620
satellites that are
looking down all the time.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.280
It's the unprocessed images
that you don't really

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.000
get to see on the
weather reports.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.589
And as you see, you have
this kind of inverted look

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.380
where you can see the
clouds cover coming across.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.050
Again, you can't
really see the UK

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.040
but, when you run the code on
different days-- obviously,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.910
it's live data, so
we're covered in clouds.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.030
You can see the
overlay of the UK,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.880
and it's a really good indicator
of whether you've actually

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.680
put the ground overly
on the map correctly

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.635
when it all lines up
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:39.635 --> 00:04:41.260
MANO MARKS: This is
an interesting one.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.530
If you take a look
at the rainfall one,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.310
you can actually see that
underneath the animated

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.550
overlays you actually
have, is it a custom map ?

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.330
Or is it a tile overlay?

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.746
STEVEN GRAY: It's a tile overlay
that I've created myself.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.030
When we're putting
the ground overlays

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.650
of the actual
visualization on top of it,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.470
it just allows us to remove
the labels for the places,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.970
because we don't really want
to see the labels on the map.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.470
MANO MARKS: Right,
so just give them

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.690
a nice, clean background there.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.190
OK.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.040
Cool.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.650
And again, this is an open
source project, so its

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.060
up on GitHub.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.750
Here's the link for that.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.710
And if you want to explore
the Google Maps SDK for iOS,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.500
here's the link for that.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.890
And specifically, if you want
to look at the ground overlay

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.946
documentation,
you can look here.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:44.570
All right, thanks
for coming in, Steve.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.191
STEVEN GRAY: No problem.

00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:46.230
Thanks for having me.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.330
MANO MARKS: Pleasure and
thanks for listening.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.880
Bye.
