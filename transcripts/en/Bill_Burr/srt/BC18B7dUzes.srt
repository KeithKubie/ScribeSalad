of the names we have been favoring.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,990
First name Birdie. Fuck you.
You're not naming a kid birdie.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,780
You're full of shit. Ah,

A short from my grandmother or
Sula last name starts with a g.

10
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:37,840
Her initials would be B U G bug.
Is this too weird of a name?

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,950
Oh, you fucking hipster
cunt. No, it isn't. Go ahead.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,640
Name your fucking baby
birdie. You fucking dope.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,410
I imagine the DMV calling her name or a
teacher calling her name and roll call.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,220
What do you think? You
know what I think you know?

15
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,570

People who got the [inaudible].

for no fucking reason when you were in

19
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,804
school.

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,300
You're literally giving people a reason
every fucking day to fuck with your kid.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,890
Why would you do that?
Give her a pretty name

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,570
Birdie. Yeah. You know, I,

23

you know why God gives someone like you
sperm that works. It's just, it's just,

24
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,840
I don't understand it. I mean, you know,

25
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,740

right now. You gotta be fucking Shit me.

27
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,490

see the history of this
birdie meaning of the name.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,030
Well, I remember there
was lady bird Johnson.

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,070
Birdie was until recently
a middle aged ladies club.

34
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,963
What

35
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,610
birdie was until recently,

36
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,180
a middle aged ladies club member
wearing a bird decorated hat.

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,230
But now it's just kind of a
vintage nickname. Think Haiti.

38
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,100
Does that supposed to be Lucy Josie.
Oh, Josie eyes are going, Mami. Milly.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,850

style in a big way.

baby birdie inspired by first lady,
