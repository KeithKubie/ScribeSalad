00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.320
Here are examples of some popular and representative component models.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.330
First off, from the Sun Microsystems, now Oracle Enterprise Solution,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.270
there are Enterprise Java Beans also called EJB.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.410
Included in this is J2EE and JSP, which is Java Server Pages.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.350
Of course, they compete with Microsoft and

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.550
Microsoft offers COM, which is the component object model,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.020
DCOM, the distributed COM, OLE, ActiveX, and COM+ for transactions.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.696
Microsoft also offers .NET and

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:38.240
in .NET there were technologies such as the common language infrastructure, CLI,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.373
and the common language runtime, CLR, and ASP.NET.

00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:48.200
An older component technology is CORBA and its component model is called CCM.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.610
CORBA itself stands for the Common Object Request Broker.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.590
And it comes from the Object Management group.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.990
It includes an Object Management Architecture and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.550
an Interface Description Language called IDL.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.380
Finally and more generically, there's web services.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.570
These include web service description language, WSDL, Universal Description,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.700
Discover and Innovation markup, also called UDDI.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.740
And the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP.
