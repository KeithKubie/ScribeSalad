00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
- Please, guys, I wanna go
  have lunch at Mar-a-Lago.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.739
(classy jazz music)

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.741
A lady cameraman.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:10.076
Very strange.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.644
What do you do
 during your period?

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:12.578
Can you film?

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.446
Yuck.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.380
(beeping)

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:15.815
I'm an excellent multitasker.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:16.783
Watch this.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.253
I think it's like that.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.455
I used to peer in
 on her all the time

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.091
when she would wear
 very loose nighties.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.693
That's how I knew my
mother was going to bed.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.362
(beeping)

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.396
I'm doing it.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.098
So, we cleaned up the body

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.667
and we continued
 the bachelor party.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.069
I like butt stuff.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.104
He stepped right out
 of a Bradley's catalog

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.139
and now he's the slate guy?

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.075
And I said, I'll
  chop your legs off

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.509
if you ever say that again.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:44.710
And she didn't believe me.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.180
And that's why she
  walks so funny.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.848
I don't wanna touch the hair.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.484
I'm tired, I want a hamburger.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.655
I farted a little
  bit on that one.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.791
Everybody's out
  of here, get out.
