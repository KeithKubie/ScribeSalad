[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.119
I'm Michal Borkowski,
and I'm the CEO

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.570
at Brainly, which is the biggest
global social learning network.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.040
I strongly believe it's about
users, not about marketing.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.290
So when we focus on users, when
we deliver the best quality

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.630
answers to them, then
we see the traction.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.080
So it's all about execution.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.690
Marketing, of course, helps.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.280
But it is like a
follow-up to what we do.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.430
It's not like the core of
our activities right now.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.650
I find the most
interesting is that we

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.430
are putting the student
in the first place

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.770
in the whole educational system.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.620
So we are creating the product
that users want to use,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.080
that they love to use.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.020
And that's why we believe
the disruption in education

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.990
will happen.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.300
And then I strongly believe
that teachers and parents

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.510
will follow that direction.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.110
So in our opinion, the
disruption in education

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.210
should start with
students, not with

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.090
the educational assistants,
teachers, or parents.
