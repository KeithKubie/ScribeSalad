00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.300
 The bees play a fateful role on Earth, so that some of them claim that if extinct, it will be followed by humanity 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.800
 _ Translation of AraSense _ 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.500
 So, with this massive drop in bee numbers, do we have to worry? 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 What happens if all bees die? 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.600
 Simply put, if the plant produces a flower, you can bet that the bees will help them reproduce. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.120
 This effective, long-lasting relationship with the floral and floral flowers attracts bees 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.580
 , And helps bees _ his body fluffy - like Velcro adhesive _ Pollen pollute efficiently 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.560
 From the male part of the plant to the female part of it 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.760
 This seemingly simple mechanism is directly responsible for producing 70% of the vegetables, fruits, seeds and nuts we consume on a daily basis. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.440
 70%! This translates to the equivalent of $ 200 billion of global agricultural income. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.680
 This huge responsibility is accomplished by groups of bee merchants raised by professional Nahlimin for a single purpose, 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 It is transferred to farms and orchards to be cleared by crops. 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.849
 But since 2006, these energetic and active bees have mysteriously disappeared. 

00:00:54.849 --> 00:01:00.449
 The chaos of the collapse of the colonies has left about a third of the commercial bees abandoned. 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.660
 In fact, some beekeepers reported that 90% of their bees simply, 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.860
 He came out and no longer 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.640
 In some colonies, mites, viruses, parasites, 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 But now many take into consideration a class of insecticides called neonotinoid compounds. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 This neurotic toxin is used to kill insects that feed on crops, 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 It also affects the central nervous system when bees absorb polluted nectar. 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.240
 Since nectar is transferred to cells, the entire colony may be affected, leading to confusion and mismanagement. 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.740
 On top of this, other factors such as long and cold winter seasons, 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 The lack of genetic diversity in commercial bees, and limited nectar in the fields, may be the cause. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.320
 If the situation continues, the entire food chains and networks may be at risk. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 Take the plant for example; 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.980
 These nuts are used as feed for chickens and farm animals. 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.540
 Less bees mean fewer almonds, which may lead to fewer cattle, and ultimately fewer milk, cheese, eggs and meat production. 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.740
 Not to mention that almonds are used in grain products, bread and many other food products. 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.480
 Ordinary cows and milking cows may also be severely affected by the disappearance of alfalfa fields 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.920
 Which are used to harvest hay for cattle. 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.860
 Are you looking forward to activating in the morning? 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.320
 As bees pollute Arabic coffee, which grinds its seeds for coffee, you should rule out that. 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.760
 In the absence of bees, our diet will consist of the bulk of corn, wheat and rice, 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.780
 As they are plants fertilized by wind. 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.980
 Do you like your clothes? Not only is cotton the most lucrative crop in the United States, 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 But also represents about 35% of the world's used textile fibers. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.680
 If you can forget all the jeans, towels, towels and family brushes 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.420
 And high quality paper products. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.780
 Simply put, we will live in a completely different world in the absence of bees, 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.899
 This is without mentioning the suffering of great economic pressure because of his absence. 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.080
 So, while we will not necessarily get extinct if this pattern continues to decline, 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.440
 However, a world without the buzz of bees will undoubtedly be ... very painful. 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.180
