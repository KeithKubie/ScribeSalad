00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
You may have seen cotton candy
dissolving in water before,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.140
maybe from us
on our channel before,

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:05.893
and maybe from a video
of a raccoon,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.340
who was handed as a treat.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.860
But today, we want
to find out just

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.200
how much cotton candy you
can dissolve into water.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.540
[Music]

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.900
Guys, cotton candy.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.700
Cotton candy is great.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.300
Some place is
called candy floss,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.090
&gt;&gt; Fairy floss.
&gt;&gt; or fairy floss.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.000
Few names.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Lots of different
things to call it.

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:30.000
But you know it, you love it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.050
It's super fine thin strands of
sugar in a big old puffy ball,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.300
and it's delicious.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.500
We should make some.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.700
We should make a lot.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.860
We should make so much.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.500
Before we get to making our
giant batches of cotton candy,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.382
which is coming

00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:46.560
in this full-size
industrial cotton candy machine,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.300
we do have a few other things
we want to learn and try.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.404
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.254
We are going to explore the hows
and whys of cotton candy,

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.275
starting with how it
was originally made,

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:57.500
scaling it up
to an industrial-sized machine,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.200
and then seeing just how much
we could dissolve into water.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.360
Now, the first machine was made
by a dentist, I believe?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.640
But some people think it
actually dated back all the way

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.300
to Italy in the 15th century.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.513
So we're going to start with
some of those original styles,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.040
and scale it up from there.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.540
1 cup of sugar.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.560
1 tablespoon of water,
and that's it.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.660
Those are the ingredients
for super basic candy floss.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.950
Now, we're just going to stir
the sugar in the hot water

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.100
until it all dissolves.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.600
So we've let our sugar
caramelized on the stove,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.420
and now you can see

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.200
that we're getting
these really nice strings,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
and this is what we want.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.646
So what we're going
to be doing is wait

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:30.863
until it cools
just a little bit,

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:32.500
and then we're going
to be taking our forks,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.100
dragging them back and forth
over the top of our pot,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.400
and it's actually going to help
us make some candy floss.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.500
But make sure

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.700
if you're doing this
with somebody else,

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:41.174
that they're not
standing in the way.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:42.569
You don't want
to get hit with this.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.091
Burnt sugar.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.600
I have a scar on my arm from
doing a video with burnt sugar.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960
If you remember
the candy Iron Man helmet,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.567
I dripped some Sugar on my arm
while I was doing that.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.520
Got a little scar
right there from it.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:04.560
[Music]

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.700
Like Spider-Man,
but sugar Spider-Man.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.300
We have a lot.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.120
This is actually really cool.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.000
Look at this.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.300
Okay, so we're not,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.140
like it was saying
we're not the best.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.300
You can see that we've got
these little drips everywhere,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.100
but it's actually really pretty.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.520
So then, you can like,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.330
if you wanted to put this
on a top of something,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.900
you can like wind
it into a nest,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.400
and that's just a really
pretty, like decoration.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.590
So original candy floss.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.000
We got the OG candy.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.100
I don't even know if you
can call this cotton candy.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.100
Candy floss kind of works
because it's thin strings,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.100
but it's not as fine as you get
with an industrial machine.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.280
And so, it's more like--

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.480
It actually looks
a lot like fiberglass.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.500
I'm kind of having a hard time

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.200
like mentally getting
through putting it in my mouth,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.370
&gt;&gt; but it's delicious.
&gt;&gt; Floss works.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.060
[Music]

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.460
That was really good.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.760
Taste like sugar,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.900
and then the little drips
that we have that probably

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.200
shouldn't be in there are just
like little crunchy bits.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.880
Homemade version with a fork,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.160
and professional version
with the big fancy machine.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.400
So you can see this has
a lot finer strings.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.600
In fact, you can't even
really see individual strands.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.815
Because they're so fine,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.400
it really has turned
into a cotton like consistency.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.700
This is very very thin,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.800
but compared to the stuff
that comes out of the machine,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.340
it's not the same.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.480
Oh, no.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.300
This stuff in the
pot is caramelizing

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.600
and crystallizing already,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.200
and I put a blob of it my mouth,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.240
and now my teeth
are stuck together?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.500
And they're going to be
like that forever.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.200
I did this to myself.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.700
Yeah.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.300
We've moved outside,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.000
and there's a very
good reason for that.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You can probably see...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.200
Well, maybe you can see,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.480
as it's starting
to heat up already,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.735
it starts throwing
little wisps of sugar.

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:49.224
It makes a huge mess.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:50.500
That doesn't stop.

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.200
Okay, new plan.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
It's not going to be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.100
how much cotton candy we
can dissolve in water.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.800
It's going to be how much Nate
can dissolve in his stomach.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:31.420
[Music]

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.920
No!

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.700
Our tower's coming
along beautifully,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.730
but unfortunately,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.600
we just had a little bit
more wind picking up,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.710
and it just got
gusted, and its...

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.300
It collapsed a little bit.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.400
What from here to here.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560
Very unfortunate.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.240
But we do still have
a giant mound of cotton candy.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.680
[Music]

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.700
Now, we're going to time-lapse
us eating all this cotton candy.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.540
No, we're not.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.980
Not gonna happen.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.980
That's too much.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.100
I'll die.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:13.020
[Music]

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.600
So let's start grabbing pieces
that are approximately

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.980
the same size.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.400
I started with two piles.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.830
&gt;&gt; So I'm just going to--
&gt;&gt; I was gonna do the same.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.914
Do you think we can fit one

00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:21.520
of these whole piles
in one cup of water?

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.575
I'm just gonna stick
a pile in it,

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:23.600
and see if we can go from there.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.444
These two, I broke,

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:26.691
these were just individual
pieces I broke in half.

00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:27.700
This is gonna be fine.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.400
This is, this is fine.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Oh, this is
my new favorite game.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.260
[Music]

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.900
Doesn't seem to be slowing
down once you hit--

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.460
No.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.200
Okay, that was
exactly that much.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.900
So let's start
breaking up some more.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.033
So, let's take this piece,
and keep this one,

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:46.600
and dissolve that one.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.280
Keep that one,
dissolve that one.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.599
Is it slowing down at all?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.880
Maybe a little.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.100
Kind of starting to get
off the sides a little bit.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:40.100
[Music]

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.400
This has been like, what?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.900
30 cotton candy.

00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:46.242
It's hard to tell.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.981
Yeah, this is a lot of sugar.

00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:49.400
We can tell you that much.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.400
Oh, yeah, there it is.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.800
This is what's happening now.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.500
So while it is still
melting the cotton candy,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.100
it's not really dissolving
into the water anymore.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.464
So I'd say we
probably hit our limit,

00:07:01.464 --> 00:07:03.500
and possibly even gone past it.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.200
All of that is in this.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.770
This much cotton candy.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.000
In fact, this has,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.500
as we've been
like tearing it apart,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.900
&gt;&gt; and--
&gt;&gt; It's been compressing.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.300
Yeah, when you grab a piece,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.900
and you squeeze it
to tear it apart,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.400
and you really
squish part of it,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.240
and so you end up with slightly
more condensed cotton candy.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.307
So more than this much
cotton candy has fit

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:24.500
into this single cup of water.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.000
This is for science.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.320
[Music]

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.740
Oh.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.240
I actually think it smells more
like cooking sugar,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.340
like when we were making
the other kind of,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.800
like the caramel on the stove?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.413
I think it smells
kind of like that.

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:39.884
It does.

00:07:39.884 --> 00:07:40.790
It almost taste...

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.400
Definitely not as
runny as water.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.050
Look at that.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.610
It looks more like oil.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.120
It tastes a little
burnt as a warning.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.200
I don't know why.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.900
We didn't burn our cotton candy,
so that's a little confusing.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.100
That was like a taste.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.800
Yeah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.340
Now, do you understand
what I went through?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.900
It's much thicker

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.020
than I thought it
was going to be

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.190
while drinking it.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.740
That much sugar,
that's perfectly compressed.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.400
Uncompressed as you
would find it,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.000
you know pouring out of a bag,
normal white sugar.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.260
That's about how much
we're looking at right there.

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.800
Maybe even a little bit more,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.488
and this is actually
about how much sugar goes

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:22.020
into a two-liter bottle of soda.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.200
You ever finish off
a two-liter bottle of soda,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.720
that's what you're drinking.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.020
Let's melt a little
bit more of it.

00:08:27.027 --> 00:08:28.600
There's another thing
I want to try.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.780
I want to see what it looks
like to melt it over steam.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.040
[Music]

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.400
As you can see, a cone of
cotton candy would not survive long

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.900
over a steaming pot.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:54.700
[Music]

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.560
Next test, fire.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.560
We're going to see what happens.

00:08:57.562 --> 00:08:59.662
We know we can melt sugar,
sugar will melt.

00:08:59.662 --> 00:09:01.100
It'll caramelize, it will burn.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.460
But we haven't tried
it on cotton candy.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:16.400
[Music]

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.600
This is awesome.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.600
It's like tunneled through it.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.740
[Music]

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.800
It's almost like a lime
Jolly Rancher now.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.700
That's so good.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:39.300
[Music]

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.020
All right.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.400
I think it's competition time.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.900
What's the rules?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.500
Throw the most cotton candy
into the fish tank.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.600
Go.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.800
All right.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800
That's too easy.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.090
We need to play horse.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.420
[Music]

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.480
No.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.400
Come on, me.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.760
There.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.910
No.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.220
I'm just gonna--

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.220
Oh.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.070
Oh, denied.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.864
Blocked.

00:10:08.864 --> 00:10:09.500
Yes.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.920
[Music]

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.720
&gt;&gt; That's gross.
&gt;&gt; That's really cool though.

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:17.380
I can't--

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.700
Let's take like
yeah big old blobs at once.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.260
Well.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.060
1, 2, 3.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.820
[Music]

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.580
Oh, no, that's so cool.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.700
The quickest way to get rid
of cotton candy.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:44.940
[Music]

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.210
I literally can't fill it
fast enough to get it all.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.360
It's gone.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.300
And it's gone.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.620
Holy cow.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.400
That was like...

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.440
This was a pile,
the volume of an adult person.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.030
Two adult people when we began.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.860
When we began,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.980
it was more than
two adult people.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.900
Yeah, it was higher
than we were sitting down.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.600
Guys, that's not all,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.120
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:07.100
That box up at the top,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.515
it's going to take you
to our last video.

00:11:08.515 --> 00:11:09.400
You should go watch that.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.500
The other box is

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.250
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.500
You should check
that one out too.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.600
If you are not subscribed,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.057
you gotta hit this bomb
to get in the club.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.260
That way, you're never going
to miss out on a cool video.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.840
Also, don't forget
to ring that bell.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.900
We'll see in the next one.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.860
Talk to you then.
