00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.340
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Okay, hello.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.440
We're ready to start
our program today.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.260 position:56%
I'm Gail Shirazi of the Israel and
Judaica section here at the library.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.860
The program today is Global
Refugees: The Case of Jews

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.810
and Greeks in 20th
Century Czechoslovakia.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.920
The program is cosponsored
by the European division here

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.040
at the library, the Hebrew
language table, and in cooperation

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.590
with the Embassy of
the Czech Republic.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.150
This program was another
collaborative program,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.270
thanks to Michelin Amir
the Holocaust Museum

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.220
who is always sharing
wonderful ideas

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.550
with us to bring to the library.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.010
I want to thank -- yay, Michelin.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.210
I want to thank the
European division,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.570
Graham Harris and Erica Spencer.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.320
Our geography and map division for
helping scholars with their maps.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.810
The Czech embassy, Robert
Rajak, and Mary Fetzko.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.270
Audrey Fisher of the press
office and Galina Cheverovsky

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.300
and Kayam Bozak [spelling assumed]
of the Israel Judaic section.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.980
And thanks to our speakers today,
Amy Kaslow, Dr. Michal Frankl

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.090
and Dr. Katerina Kralova.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.480
Amy Kaslow is a columnist,
photo journalist and activist

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.670
on behalf of world refugees.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.790
For over 30 years she has written
about lives disrupted by war.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.930 position:56%
These stories are reflected in her
photographic exhibit called Victims,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.290
Perpetrators, Eyewitnesses
and Survivors: Life after War.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.470
She is a White House appointee
to the governing board

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.990
of the US Holocaust Museum.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.310
Both Dr. Frankl and Dr.
Kralova are fellows at the Jack,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.410
Joseph and Morton Mandel Center
for Advanced Holocaust Studies

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.410
at the US Holocaust Museum.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.980
And I'll give brief biographies
because we have a lot to do today.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.020 position:56%
Dr. Frankl is head of the Jewish
studies and history of anit-Semitism

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.490
at the Prague Jewish Museum.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.810
He has written extensively on
German and Austrian refugees

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.980
in Czechoslovakia prior
to World War II.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.230
Dr. Kralova is assistant
professor of contemporary history

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.220
at the faculty of social science
the Charles University in Prague.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.590
She is fluent in Greek,
Czech, English and German.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.450
I have two announcements
to make before we start.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.690
Please turn off your cell phones.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.900
And this is being webcast.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.510
And when it comes to the
question and answer period,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.630
it's going to span the audience.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.350
So if you don't want to be taped,
you can leave at that point.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.650
Thank you.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.510
I'd like to introduce Amy Kaslow.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.340
&gt;&gt; Amy Kaslow: So good afternoon.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.840
It's a nice turnout.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.390
I'm going to talk very briefly
about Victims, Perpetrators,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.280
Eyewitnesses and Survivors.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.000
They are longtime refugees
languishing in camps.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.740
They're soldiers whom
unemployed meeting

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.470
for a smoke or idle conversation.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.920
They're elderly savoring a
bowl of soup in a soup kitchen.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.590
They're children whose
playground is a toxic dump.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.380
Unfortunately, past is prologue.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.840
And with today's parallels,
we see a lot of challenges.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.680
And I think a lot of this
landscape will be familiar to you.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.830
We're talking about
a lost generation.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.800
We're talking about trauma,
corruption, security issues.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.920
Justice, elusive justice.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.940
This is 1989 Baghdad.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.570
This little fellow is along
the banks of the Tigris River.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.990
He's a beggar who's hustling a
foreign visitor with card tricks

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.160 position:56%
and he was a rare sight at the time.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.500
But since the Gulf War, intra-Iraqi
fighting, countless insurgencies

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.140 position:56%
and of course the ISIS assault on
Iraq's independence, such as it was,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.510
the number of young
Iraqi beggars has soared.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.160
Traditionally pampered,
even insulated

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.950
by protective Arab parents --

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.300
and you find this all
over the Arab world.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.460
Children here and throughout
these conflict areas are peddling

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.590
everything from cigarettes to sex.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.180
And it is an absolute 180-degree
difference in the prospect

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.570
for children growing up in
conflict areas in the Middle East.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.000
These folks back from the
front, eight-year war with Iran,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.270
these Iraqi men, are shopping for
wedding dresses for their intended.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.730
By now they've married.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.050
They've probably had
multiple children.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.250
And those children now,
if past is prologue,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.950
those children now are suffering
from the same kinds of difficulties

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.640
that the beggar boy,
30 years earlier,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.370
20 years earlier, suffered from.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.160
Unaccompanied children are the
most tragic byproducts of conflict.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.620
And the most vulnerable, of course.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.980
These three are orphans who escaped
Vukovar, which is a Croatian town,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.530
emblematic of the massacres,
the mass graves

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.880
and the widespread devastation
of post-war Yugoslavia.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.780
Raped, tortured, often
forced to watch

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.150
as their own family members
endured this, victims were refugees

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.640
and their lives only
became more complicated.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.590 position:56%
They languished in those UN camps
and other hastily constructed homes.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.990
And as we see today,
government agencies,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.070
international relief organizations
try to provide the basics.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.030
Food, health, housing.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.640
But those efforts fall
severely short of needs.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.470
In this instance, in Croatia,
the state radio devoted hours

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.580
to desperate family
members who were calling

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.250
out for their family
members on the air.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.990
And it was and remains crushing.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.300
This is a very familiar site.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.130
It is a refugee camp.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.040
This one in Macedonia right
near the Albanian border.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.720
This is just post-Kosovo,
part of Yugoslavia.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.080
These families lived in
horrendous conditions.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.000
This particular camp was built
on top of a toxic waste site

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.280
and had plastic sheeting put on top
of it and then soil on top of that.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.480
The toxicity leaked of course and
there were a lot of open sores

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.690
and a lot of health issues among
the refugees living in these camps.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.000
So even the camps themselves
can create big, big problems.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.210
Forget about busting
out of the camps.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.870
This is a sheep herder, a
Palestinian sheep herder, 1983,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.520
ten years after the '73 war.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.820
He entered a world back then
that was profoundly impacted

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.330
by the divide between Israel
and its Arab neighbors.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.630
Today, the majority of west
bank Arabs are youth, his age.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:00.700
And upward of 50% of the
population is under the age of 15.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.790
There is staggering unemployment
in this cohort, perhaps 30,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.710
maybe as high as 60% unemployment.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.090
The data swings wildly on this.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.020
But it is among the
highest in the world.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.500
These toy assault rifles
were dangling

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.810
from an east Jerusalem
shop fairly recently.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.530
And they are marketed to five- and
six-year-old Palestinian girls.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:31.280
If past is prologue, and I
think this is a recurring theme

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.560
in our daily lives, trying to
grapple with these just collections

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.460
of strife all over the world.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.160
This is the kind of sort
of subliminal training

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.440
that comes out of conflict.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.950
This is the end of the
Cold War, or is it?

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.250
Some say no.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.620
But the end of the Cold War
and the fall of communism,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.120 position:56%
at least the first fall, was a major
shredding of the command economy.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.090
And any kind of safety
net that caught folks

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.490
who needed housing,
healthcare and food.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.090
Hardship really spared no one,
except for the privileged few,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.630
those who had protection.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.180
And this is a Russian woman.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.480
This is not a Russian Jew.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.560
This is a Russian woman
who has no medical care.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.860
She has no food.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.160
She needs money.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.770
She has no job and she needs
to look after her family.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:31.680
The aging suffer probably the
most in post-war societies.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.790
They're often shut out of services
or simply forgotten or ignored

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.140
by those who have undergone
trauma themselves.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.020
This group is very smartly dressed.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.200
They put on their Sunday best every
time they go to the soup kitchen.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.080
It's a famous one in Moscow.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.460
It's called Hama and some of these
patrons ride the very dangerous

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.940
metro in Russia in Moscow.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.830
They ride two hours each way
to get a hot meal each day.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.250
Their penchants of
course have shriveled.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.080
Government assistance has
vanished and fuel and food prices

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.370
of course have gone
through the roof.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.910
This for them is just the
latest in a succession

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.970
of horrors they have
suffered over many decades.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.270
I don't have to remind many

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.360
in this group there were
pogroms, anti-Jewish pogroms.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.470
The Holocaust, the Gulag,
Stalin's forced labor camps.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.420
Refused immigration.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.740
Banishment to Siberia.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.690
Viscous anti-Semitic attacks.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.650
The wrath of skinheads,
the ellipsis, it goes on.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.920
Today the soup kitchen serves
hundreds of indigent Jews.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.820
Most of these people live in
isolated, decrepit apartments

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.570
and houses, some with no
running water or heat.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.050
This is Srebenica.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.630
I was there last summer
with the Holocaust Museum.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.090
We were part of the delegation
observing the 20th anniversary

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.450
of the commemoration of
the massacre in Srebenica,

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:08.260
which is on the border
of Bosnia and Serbia.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.240
And it's a mountaintop place.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.650
It's really a remarkable
place to get to.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.080
Lots of nips and tucks
and big turns.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.180
It's probably emblematic to most as
sustaining one of the most savage,

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.740
most horrific assaults
of the Balkan Wars.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.230
This survivor is cradling
a child and a grandchild.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.630
And she is among the many
Muslim women who fled and lived

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:44.690
in the forest on roots and leaves
and other nutrients she could find.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.030
The women came back
after this assault

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.410
and they came back
obviously to destroyed houses.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.110
Their men, their boys were gone.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.770
Most of the girls were gone.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.680
The children were gone.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.620
Houses pockmarked by shells.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.900
Fields were laid with mines.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:12.880
Constant reminders of terror that
should have ended decades ago.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.800
But those things are
still very present.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.230
There are many, many swaths of
areas around Srebenica for example,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.750
and throughout the
Balkans that are minefields

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.640
and difficult to traverse.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.000 position:56%
In Srebenica and throughout Bosnia,
Muslim women suffered enormous shame

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.560
when they were left with
babies born from sexual attack.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:40.190
This is a young woman in Guatemala,
where there is full-out gang war,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.990
as there is throughout
the northern triangle

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.780
in Honduras and El Salvador.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.450
This particular Central American
nation ranks among the worst

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.270
and most violent countries.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.050
And women and girls are
the most vulnerable.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.370
They are under intense
pressure to marry.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.090
Legal age is 14 but they bear
children before they even really

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.070
learn how to take care
of themselves.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.500
And it's something that is so --

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.000
it's repeated so often
throughout the world.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.820
I'm just giving you a little
snippet to think about.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.620
Slightly older.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.920
This is Nigeria.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.510
Like so many nations embroiled
in or emerging from conflict,

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.530
Nigerians are just strangled.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.730
They're strangled by corruption.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.310
They're strangled by fear.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.310
The country has huge debt
and crumbling infrastructure.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.280
Even as it pumps billions
of dollars' worth of oil.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.820
That's how corrupt it is.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.190 position:56%
More than two-thirds of the citizens
live below the poverty line.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.560
HIV/AIDS, the top killer,
is still quite vicious.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.990
And its staggering infection
rate is the third highest

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.270
in the world behind
India and South Africa.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.330
These villagers have
no running water,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.750
no electricity, no telephones.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.760
And they have the only health
clinic in the area for 37 villages.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.140
That health clinic
has a plastic curtain

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.000
with two rooms that are barren.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.330
No drugs, no facility.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:15.990
The most naked feeling of course
for the women and the girls is

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.200
that they're vulnerable to
the radical Islamic groups,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.630
especially Boko Haram who is
widely known for kidnapping

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:28.170
and sexually enslaving girls, as
those cradled in this woman's arms.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.620
Gangs and opportunism.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.480
Well, this is Brazil
outside one of the favelas,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.160
which is these squatter
settlements and impoverished areas

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.810
that line the big cities
in the country.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.840
There is full-out gang warfare
throughout this part of the world.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.080
And this gentleman has
been captured, happily so,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.150
into a work program
sponsored by an NGO.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:58.430
He's left the gang in
favor of a full-time job.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.510
And he's lugging a sack
of bottles for recycling.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.900
The gang war is just
gripping in El Salvador.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.580
This woman lost all of her boys.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.140
It's been over four years since
this gang truce in El Salvador.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.810
It's a broker deal designed to
reduce the number of killings.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.500
Not to reduce them all told.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:27.420
Just to reduce the numbers, in
exchange for prison transfers.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.660 position:56%
It's really hit the skids of course.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.740
This fellow is a young boy
whose mother commutes upwards

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.590
of five hours a day round trip
for her work as a housekeeper

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.890
for more well-to-do Salvadorans.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.350
He does not leave his
corrugated metal housing.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.710
Does not even go outside

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:51.900
because gang members live
next door, across the street.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.690
And nothing is sacred.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.660
This is where he lives.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.740
This is a typical drive
through a street in El Salvador.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.830
It's pretty tense.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:15.650
And if you go to most of the places
where there are ongoing strife,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.700
you'll find this kind of presence.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.740
These are the backs
of genocide heirs.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.180
These are the Rwandan perpetrators.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:31.200
Some of them who wiped out nearly
800,000 Tutsis in just 100 days

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.330
with machetes, hatchets,
clubs, knives, spears.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.150
They cleansed cities, as
they said, in the countryside

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.340
of what they called cockroaches.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.090
There's a lot of inflammatory
speech,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:48.570 position:56%
which we see at the Holocaust Museum
and elsewhere as a leading indicator

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.010
of much more violent behavior.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:58.340
The Hutu rallying cries were laced
with hate speech spewed by leaders

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.140
on the radio, in churches.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.850
This is possible distinguished as
the fastest genocide in history.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.830
Left the country with
more than 100,000 orphans

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.730
and 250,000 rape victims.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:19.120
A traumatized population
for generations.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.680
Yes, I'm getting a wrap-up, so I'm
going to give you a few more faces.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.120
This woman was left for dead,
crawled back from one of the piles

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.800
of bodies in Rwanda inside a church
where she had gone for safe haven.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.200
And the divets in her
forehead and around her skull,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.340
you can see where the
hatchet marks were.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.710
This is an example of someone
who sought refuge, a refugee.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.560
Somebody who's now living where
she came from, returned refugee.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.310
And somebody who has to
make it through her life.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.990
And you can imagine the trauma.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.580 position:56%
I'm going to wrap up with these two.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.210 position:56%
These are octogenarian eyewitnesses.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.320
These are Ukrainian
neighbors who recall 1943

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:13.000
when the Nazi soldiers marched
through Rava Ruska with 1,500 Jews

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.070
into the forest just a few
miles from the Polish border.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.730
And they are recalling
this Holocaust by bullet.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.830
He was not recalling as clearly
as she would have liked him to,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:30.570
so she gave him a little
stimulation and she reminded him

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.010
that his own family provided
the horse that carried the cart

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.450
of limp bodies to the mass graves.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.700
And she said that her mother had
to supply their kitchen table

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.960
to the Nazis to rest
guns and to consume food.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.500
The Nazis needed a little
snack in between their murders.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:19:00.140
Last, I will leave you with the
Buddhist nuns outside of Nanpean.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.190
These women have shaved heads
because they symbolize widowhood.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:10.310
Their husbands were murdered by
the Khmer Rouge and today they live

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.360
in a monastery built near the site

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.600
of a Khmer Rouge prison
and execution ground.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.980
And as you probably know, an
international court outside

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.200
of Nanpean is pursuing charges

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.100
against the Khmer Rouge
founders, strategists, operatives.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.760
It's an effort towards
representative justice.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.190
They can't possibly
try all the millions

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.660
of people who were perpetrators.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:41.020
These women, 30 years after the
genocide, these women are part

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.080
of a nation where everyone
is a survivor, where victims

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.590
and perpetrators live side-by-side.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.860
And where the narrative
has a lot of holes in it

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.310
because there are a
lot of non-truths.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.270
But here at this former
execution ground turned monastery,

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.020
the abiding belief is karma.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.050
So thank you for this
brief introduction

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.510
into the beautiful conversation.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.530
[ Applause ]

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.030
&gt;&gt; Michel Frankl: Good afternoon.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.500
Many thanks to both institutions,
the Library of Congress as well

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.330
as the US Holocaust Memorial
Museum for helping us

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.290
with setting up this event.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:29.160 position:56%
We are very pleased that we can from
the perspective of two historians

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.700
who deal with Czech in my case
or central European, and Czech

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.590
and Greek and many other
histories in Katerina's case

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.310
that we can contribute to a debate
which is becoming more central

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:47.860
and more global as the title
of this session indicates.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.960
And many thanks for
this very stimulating

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.190
and also very emotional
introduction that reminded us

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:05.420 position:56%
that refugees suffering is something
which is still very much with us.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.780
My presentation at least is
going to be about history.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.540
And I am going to discuss
the parallels as well

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.590
as the differences, then we will
do question and answers later on.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.540
But I must say that as somebody
who came here in summer,

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.630
the end of August, from central
Europe, from the Czech Republic --

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.570
as somebody who tries to make
clear to the Czech Republic

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.750
that discussion about refugees,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.790
the history of refugee
policy is an important topic

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.130
and shouldn't be ignored.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.330
Coming here right at the moment
when refugees were just streaming,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.210
flowing across the region
was very difficult for me.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.470 position:56%
And it is a very strange feeling
watching the European refugee crisis

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.830
from abroad.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.860
But it's also another
enriching perspective.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.530
One of my motivations
for researching refugees

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.300
of Czechoslovakian refugee
policy was that if you look

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.710
at what has been written
about Jewish

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.640
and non-Jewish refugees during the
Nazi time, during the Holocaust,

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.830
there's been much focus
on western countries.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.550
Western Europe, United
States, United Kingdom.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.860 position:56%
And much less attention to the east.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.320
As if refugees were just a
topic of liberal democracies

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.510
and the question was
only, "How is it possible

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.150
that liberal democracies guided by
their values or not so have failed

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.450
to deal with the Holocaust?"

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.700
This is the very simplified notion
that you can see very often.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:52.330
However, refugees are also going
to the east, whatever it is.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:58.140
And it is also in eastern Europe or
if you want post-communist Europe

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.830
where the history of refugees,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:07.580
the history of refugee
policy should be discussed

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.340
and where society should try
to come to terms with that.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.590 position:56%
Would it help in the current crisis?

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.890
I don't know.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.440
But I believe it will
create a better environment,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.340
more informed environment for
discussing where we are today.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.520
Czechoslovakia, and we are now
going to focus on Czechoslovakia,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.320
is known historically, especially

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.170
in the integral period,
as a place of refuge.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.820
It is very often idealized.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.800
And the goal of our two
presentations is not necessarily

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:52.550 position:56%
to turn this upside down, but rather
to provide alternative perspectives

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.240 position:56%
and more information for discussion.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.190
Let me start with a specific event.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.020
Shortly after midnight
on March 12th,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.220
1938 an usually full train arrived

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.220
at a Czechoslovakian border
station of Bratislava.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.640 position:56%
And those on board were not usual
passengers of a sleep night express.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.460
Most of them had packed only
the most necessary items.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.660
After hearing the news
of the German troops

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:30.360 position:56%
and Gestapo approaching towards
Vienna via the Anschluss of Austria.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.180
For endangered anti-Nazi
activists and many Jews,

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.380
the Czechoslovak border seemed
to be the best way and one

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.490
of the last escape ways as
well to avoid the Nazi rule.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.540
Among them was Richard Berman,
journalist and a staunch critic

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.560
of the Austrian Christian
Social and [inaudible].

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.410
And he recorded his
excitement on arrival

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.820
into the free Czechoslovakia.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.260
I quote, "Finally I will
sail to Greece again.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.950
I was delivered safe."

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.150
He therefore found it hard
to believe what followed

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.850
after the train pulled
into Bratislava.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:16.160
All refugees were forced out of the
train and after a couple of hours

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.990
of tense waiting they
were returned to what had

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.960
in the meantime become
Nazi-ruled Austria.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.480
In Burman's narrative, the image
of freedom, both personal and that

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.780 position:56%
of the country of Czechoslovakia,
this image turned in the description

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.690
of an ugly and prison-like waiting
room at the railway station.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.140
And this is apparently a
description of a real place.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.500
This place can be viewed
as a symbolic expression

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.500
of the profound surprise
and disillusionment

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.930
with democratic Czechoslovakia.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.160
Justs before being returned
to Austria, Burman managed

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.280
to telegram the Czechoslovakian
president Edvard Benes,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.820
whom who he knew personally.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.150
And you can see the
telegram on the slide.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.810
Appealing for the refugees
to be accepted.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.450
And this message ended up without
any reaction or any answer.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.300
It ended up in the archives

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.010
of the Czechoslovakian
ministry of interior.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:25.410 position:56%
I picked a little bit of the
language of that very short telegram

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.890
and you can see that it
does appeal to the humanity

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.210
of the Czechoslovak democracy.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.840
And I'd like to connect this
with this element of surprise

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.220
that Burman must have experienced.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.480
And apparently he was
not the only observer

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.900
to perceive this contradiction
between the image

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:52.350 position:56%
of democratic Czechoslovakia and the
same country turning back refugees.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.410
He certainly could remember how
Czechoslovakia was deceiving

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.710
anti-Nazi refugees.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:05.860
In 1934 for instance, from
Austria, after the suppression

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.910
of the leftist uprising in
Vienna and other cities,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.530
when approximately
2,000 social democrats

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:20.030
and communists were
living in Czechoslovakia.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:25.980 position:56%
So the point I'm trying to make when
I focus on this particular event is

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:33.440 position:56%
that what Burman couldn't understand
and what he was trying to come

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:40.040
to terms with was one of the
most profound, important shifts,

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.010
if not the most important shift

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:48.660
in the Czechoslovak refugee
policy in the 20th century.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:54.960
And apparently refugee policy
is all about categorization

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.460
of people, unfortunately.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.150
Who is a refugee?

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.910
What is this based on?

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.890
What groups should be allowed on?

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.470
And these refugees in Bratislava

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:10.360
in 1938 witnessed a
shift of categories.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.580
First Burman and other perceived
themselves and others as opponents

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.040
of Nazism and the language
is connected to the language

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.030
of political opposition to Nazism.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.930
So first they perceive
themselves as opponents of Nazism.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.780
Czechoslovak authorities
treated them as Jews,

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:33.950
which meant in this particular
case, as unwanted Jewish migrants.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.710
We do not have much time to discuss
Czechoslovak refugee policy before

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.650
this point, but apparently interval
Czechoslovakia was not all bad.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.800
Interval Czechoslovakia
served as a refuge

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.690
to refugees from the Soviet Union.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:04.110
It became a temporary home
to a lot of people escaping

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:09.320
from Nazi Germany, as well as to
the Austrians whom I mentioned.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.550 position:56%
Most of these people who came before
1938 wouldn't experience something

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.850
like that.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.140
They wouldn't experience
refusal on the border.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.250
They would have had a
program, especially the fact

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.420
that Czechoslovakia
wouldn't consider them

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.350
as permanent residents.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:36.290
Czechoslovakia is at this time
thought of rather as a place

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:41.400
for temporary refuge before
the refugees will find a final

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:47.430
definitive home, for
instance somewhere overseas.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.220
Yet if you look at a policy,

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.890
a rather liberal policy
towards anti-Nazi refugees,

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:00.190
starting with 1933, we can
see that all these groups

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.190
that were excluded
from this tolerance.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.510 position:56%
And in a very simplified way I could
say that these were two groups.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:11.890
One was people who were
considered to be eastern Jews,

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:13.890
especially Jews of Polish origin.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.410
So stateless Jews.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.830 position:56%
And the other group were communists.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.530
I'm not going to go
into details about this,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.070
and we can leave it to discussion.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:30.210
However, we can see in the second
half of the 1930's especially

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:37.200
after the Nuremburg Laws, 1935 in
Germany, we can see that elements

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.110
of ethnic categorization and
elements of, if you want,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:46.010
administered anti-Semitism,
are sneaking in in the practice

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.850
of Czechoslovakia refugee policy.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:54.390
And it's a longer process
of categorizing all Jews,

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.980
all Jewish refugees, as what
was called the eastern Jews,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:09.080
those who were unwanted, to those
who were understood to be something

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.030
in the very opposition to the
notion of proper citizenship.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:22.550
Thus the border closure of 1938
doesn't come out of nothing.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:28.040
Now let me come back to 1938 and
just give you a couple of episodes,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.440
and these are only examples.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.140
Throughout the spring
and summer of 1938,

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.140
Czechoslovak border guards
were routinely hunting refugees

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.130
around the border with Austria.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.910
And along the swampy
banks of the Danube.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.940
And I don't know how many
refugees were turned back.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.710
Neither do I know how many
made it into Czechoslovakia.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.690
But I've extrapolated
from very partial sources

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.460
that there might be some 10,000
cases of return of refugees.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.100
Which is a large number for
those of us who can remember

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.690
for instance the discussions
about the Swiss policy

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.790
in 1938 and then again in 1942.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.180
These are very similar numbers.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.460
The Czechoslovakian and Swiss
numbers are rather similar.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.860
So there's never been a significant
discussion in the Czech Republic

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.700
or Czechoslovakia about this event.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.180
On this particular slide,

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.400
let me just make a short
remark about the map.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.030
I picked up a map which
includes the events of 1939

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:45.280 position:56%
so that you can see protectorate
Moravia, so occupied Czechoslovakia.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.840
In 1938, the time we talk
about, this is not yet the case.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.250 position:56%
But that was all the borders we need

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:57.050
for understanding the
story that we discuss here.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:04.650
I've picked an event on
the shores of the Danube.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:10.390
A refugee from Vienna named Pavel
Kostner who was born actually

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.480
in Czechoslovakia in
Bratislava, escaping from Vienna.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.430
He's caught by the Czechoslovakian
border police and they report

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:24.120
in very cold language
how he committed suicide.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.830
This is an extreme case.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.130
It's not typical.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.430
It's an extreme case.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:35.900
But it testifies to the
very extremity of the nature

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.050
of the Czechoslovakian
refugee policy.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.360
And Czechoslovakian refugee
policy was not exceptional.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.570
It was typical at this time.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:53.860
The extremes of the refugee policy
were also illustrated on the fate

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.370 position:56%
of a group of Jews from [inaudible].

00:33:55.370 --> 00:34:02.090
Jews who were brought by the
Austrian side during the night.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.450
One night in mid-April,
1938 across the Danube.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:13.060
Czechoslovak officials found them
in the morning freezing, wet.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.360
They fed them.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.210
They sent them back immediately.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:20.420
And then the same thing was then
repeated on the Hungarian border.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.290
The group was subjected
to humiliating labor

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.410
on the Austrian side of the border.

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:32.070 position:56%
And had to survive in a region where
the borders of the three states met.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:36.480 position:56%
Eventually, the Bratislava community
found the only solution available

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.010
and accommodated them
on a towboat anchored

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.190 position:56%
on the Hungarian side of the Danube.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.580
The Danube counted as
international borders.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:49.170
That's why none of the three
states could really intervene.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:53.770 position:56%
And here you can see a short excerpt
from a report about the situation

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.380
on the boat and the
terrible situation.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.830
Suffering, spiritual and physical,

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.290
to which these people
were subjected.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.200
It took three or four
months, during which none

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.000
of the three states was willing
to provide even a temporary refuge

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.590
to arrange for the emigration,
overseas, mostly to Palestine

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.730 position:56%
and to the United States of America.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:28.070
Now the policy that was developed
towards Austrian Jews became model

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.390
in 1938.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:36.000
And it was replicated against
other groups of refugees.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.980
But very interestingly, and
this is yet another shift

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.170
in the Czechoslovakian
refugee policy.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.240
The groups that followed,
that were excluded,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.650
were Czechoslovak citizens,
former Czechoslovak citizens.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.730
And their own country was trying
to not allow them or to expel them

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.310
or to have them emigrate
as quickly as possible.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.390 position:56%
It was almost as an automatic reflex

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.240
that Czech officials
were sending back Jewish

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.040
and also some German
refugees from Sudetenland

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.080
after the Munich Agreement.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.000
And after the Christian Act.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.060
After the Munich Agreement,
the border areas

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.980
of Czechoslovakia were
annexed to Nazi Germany.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:29.130
And they were also dumping
Jews with Polish citizenship

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.860
across the border in Ostrava.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.530
And I've just included a quote
from a letter by Ilsa Verber,

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.690
in which she testifies
about the horrible scenes

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.790
in the no man's land.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.670
No man's land is a
proliferating term by this time.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:53.700
Into no man's land on the
Czechoslovak/Polish border.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:37:00.200
I could add many more events
on the Czechoslovak border

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.790
of something I call not
just a physical border,

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:09.990 position:56%
but a border of citizenship in the
sense that refugees, and this is one

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.430
of my conclusions here
-- that the development

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:18.660
of the restrictive policy
towards refugees is essential

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:25.790
in reframing the rules of
citizenship, also for those

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.240
that are not yet refugees.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.900
So that Jewish refugees coming from
the outside were contributing --

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.200
or rather the policy towards

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.420
such refugees was contributing
towards eroding the rights

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.990
of Jews living inside
of the country.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.670
And one thing that is connected
with this is also a revision

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:53.080
of citizenship in Czechoslovakia
instituted in January 1939,

00:37:53.080 --> 00:38:00.340
similar to for instance Polish or
Romanian revisions of citizenship.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.370
A revision of citizenship
which stripped Jews who escaped

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.120
from Sudetenland of their
Czechoslovakian citizenship.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.280 position:56%
I have just picked one single case
of a person, random case of a person

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.940
who was denaturalized
in this process.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:27.280
Therefore, the refugees were
discounted citizenship became an

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.500
impulse, or perhaps
if you want a pretext,

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.370
to revise citizenship
along ethnic lines.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.390
So refugees and citizenship are
always interconnected categories.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:44.190
And it's important that we
think about them in this way.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.040
As a conclusion,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.750
1938 in Czechoslovakia is
certainly a turning point.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.860
And by this turning point,
Czechoslovakia ceased

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.530
to be a refuge, but
rather became a country

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:02.470
that was generating refugees.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.230
It was a county which increasingly,

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:10.430 position:56%
especially after the second World
War, understood itself as homogenous

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.130
in terms of nationality
or ethnicity.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:19.020
I just mentioned that
Czechoslovak Germans

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:25.530
and some Hungarians were expelled
after the second World War.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:30.570
And because we don't have much
time, this gives me the opportunity

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:37.210
to invite Katerina who will
show a totally different facet

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.370
of the Czechoslovakian
refugee policy.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.340
&gt;&gt; Katerina Kralova:
Hello and welcome.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.350
It's wonderful to see so
many guests around here.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.750
And I would say that
many of you have the one

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.720
or the other experience
of being an immigrant.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.720
Be it from the Czech
Republic, Czechoslovakia,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.030
Greece or somewhere else,
coming to the United States.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.920
Or maybe passing other
countries as well.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.650
I would like to thank the Library
of Congress, which I am delighted

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:21.760
to use for my research and read
those books which aren't covered

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.900
by the hosting institution.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.980
I am now a visiting fellow at
the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:37.460
And I will add to the long story
the two speakers spoke about,

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.150
which was wrapped altogether
in an opening session

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.840
that you got a global picture.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.610
So we are speaking about
global refugees in many senses.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.940
And I would say this
is our message as well.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.780
A lot of the refugees we are
speaking about didn't stay for long

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.010
or forever in one of the countries.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.880
It was much more about
more difficult migration.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.260
Not only in Europe, but also
between different continents.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.940
And we were travelling in time.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.870
So you heard about
the interval period.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:20.240
And I will push you a bit farther
to the time of the Cold War.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.780 position:56%
And I will stay with Czechoslovakia,
or maybe rather the Czech Republic.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.030
I will explain why.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.970
And I will speak about
Greek Civil War refugees.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:38.050
It is very strange that, as
Michel already suggested,

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:42.790
it's a difficult time for us to be
observers from another continent,

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:47.120
from oversea, of what is
happening in Europe nowadays.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.990
And how as our country and
our political representatives,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:55.580
our political elite,
how they are discussing.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.990
And of course our fellow citizens,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:03.400
how they are discussing the refugee
crisis in the Czech Republic.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:09.330
What I would like to bring up is
a case which can be an example

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:14.300
of a good practice,
which we all like to see,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.760
especially in today's situation.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.750
And this is based on a case of the
Greek migration at the beginning

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:27.120
of the Cold War and
late-'40's, early-'50's.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.330
Going and bringing us up
to the very recent time.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:37.330
And I will need to
switch the presentation.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.050
Well, as I already mentioned,

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:03.810 position:56%
in those days after the second World
War, in the late-'40's, early-'50's,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.880
Greek Civil War refugees were
streaming to the countries

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.360
of what became the eastern block.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:16.590
It's very interesting to
see all the trajectories,

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.360
how they came to which country.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.460 position:56%
Over here from a private
collection you can see a picture not

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.020
yet from Czechoslovakia,
but from Bulgaria.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.490
There are all these refugees
gathered for a picture,

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:39.210
for a school picture they were
taking in Bulgaria while they were

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.110
about to move to other countries.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:47.100
And some of them settled
in post-war Czechoslovakia.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.930
It's interesting to see that in
today's terms we are speaking

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.050
about temporary asylum

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.880
and discussing how long this
temporary asylum is taking.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:04.140
Experts are telling us there is
not a short-term temporary asylum.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.920
It's much more about refugees
staying and lasting in a country

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.020
for about 20 years, until they
may return to their own countries.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.570
And it's not only now.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:21.920
These Greek Civil War refugees were
staying Czechoslovakia for about 25

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.240
or more years, as you will see.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.840 position:56%
So this has a longer trajectory than
only the time we are speaking about,

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.670 position:56%
which is so vivid for us just today.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.970
Just for clarity, I
would like to say

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:41.280
that during my presentation I will
often speak about Czech Republic

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:47.960
and not Czechoslovakia, even if
historically it was a country

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.540
which had an official
name Czechoslovakia.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.350
But since the Greek Civil
War refugees settled only

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:57.710
in the Czech part, in Bohemia
and Moravia, they were coming

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:02.800
to Slovakia only for medical care
and not settling there really.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.620
Excuse me that I do this shortcut
and speak about Czech Republic.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.690
And the other thing is I speak
about Greek Civil War refugees

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.890
and maybe sometimes about Greeks.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.340
I am speaking about those

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.150
who had Greek citizenship
while leaving their country.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:28.580
Which doesn't always appeal to
the ethnicity, because in the case

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:33.210
of Czechoslovakia, Czech
Republic, about one-third of them

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.360
as you will see were a
Slavic Geek population.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:45.250
Or Slavomacedonians, as they are
called who had Greek citizenship

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.390
but their identity may
have been mixed up.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.940
And of course in the course

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:57.900
of the Cold War they have shifted
their personal identities sometimes

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.290
towards the Macedonian
identity in terms

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.680
of today's Republic of Macedonia.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:10.350
So the number of those who were
in Czechoslovakia was quite high.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.710
For my research, which I started
with a group of my students

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:19.740
about six years ago, I used
the Czech National Archive

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.950
and other Czech archives
and local archives as well.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:26.980
And I had the privilege to
record data with my students.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.800
I wouldn't do that on my own.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.190
About 200 hours of interviews of
the first and second generation

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:39.680
of Greek Civil War refugees,
which we recorded with 60 people.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:44.610
All of the interviews which
were recorded in Czech,

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.050 position:56%
some of them were recorded in Greek.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.880
Unfortunately we didn't find a
platform yet to put them online.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.960 position:56%
But all of the Czech interviews in
Czech language are accessible online

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.020 position:56%
at the webpage at Memory of Nations.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.320
So those of you who
want to read more

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.970
of the personal stories
can try this page as well.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.990
And several segments
are in English as well.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.950
So for those of you
who don't speak Czech,

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.780
you may have the first glimpse of
what was happening online as well.

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:24.590
Well, who were the refugees and how
did they come to Czechoslovakia?

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.040
How did it all happen?

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.260
Just to give you a
historical background,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.720
speaking about Greek Civil
War, it's a long story.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.810
And very often historians
are wrapping it in a way

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.040
into three rounds or three circles.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:46.320
The one, the split within Greek
population was happening already

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.020
during the second World War.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.060
And that's sometimes first drawn

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:58.230
around where the leftists
resistance fighters were fighting

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:04.670
against the other fighters,
closer to the republicans,

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:09.710
or maybe best to say
anti-communist views.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:14.740
Once the second World War in Greece
was over, which was a bit earlier

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.660
than we speak about the end of
the second World War in Europe.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.880
And it's already in autumn 1944.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.160
Very soon another round,
a so-called second round

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.830
of the Greek Civil War started.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:29.310 position:56%
And because it happened in December,

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:34.660
it came up in the history
as the name [inaudible].

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.650
This second round, a very violent
one, took only several months.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.980
But we can still speak of a
kind of post-conflict society

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.400
and about flourishing democracy

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.680
after the second round
of civil war in Greece.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:56.530
Because very soon after, in
spring 1946, the third round

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.080
of Greek Civil War started.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.810
It lasted about three
years and sometimes

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.410
in literature you can read only

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:11.130
about the so-called third
round as the civil war.

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:16.980
That was also the timing where
many people were about to escape

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.330
from Greece for various reasons.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:23.760
But mostly because of the fight
which was happening in Greece.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.870
If you imagine the mountainous
territory of norther Greece,

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:33.310
these mountains and villages
were bombed and napalmed

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:37.060
with the help of Greek
western allies.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:42.030
Because at that point of
course we are already speaking

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:45.390
about a world splitting
in the east and west.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:50.960
So Greece became a part
of the western world,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:55.140
whereas those fighters in
the mountains were fighting

00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:03.100
for their ideals and for their
political beliefs of communism.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.560
And there were many of them.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.810
But speaking in terms of
the refugees, the peasants,

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.580
the Greek peasants in the villages,

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.960
they certainly were very afraid
not only of the political violence

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.580
which was happening at
that time in Greece.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.170
But I want to remind those
of you who may not know

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:30.960
that there were tens of thousands
of Greeks imprisoned in that period

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.290
in Greek prisons and
on solitude islands.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.050
But also several thousand

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:44.140
of them were sentenced
to death and executed.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.170
So this is a very turbulent
atmosphere

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:51.220
in which this all is happening,
just to give you the background.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:59.260
These people were seeking for
their refuge in the countries

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.870
which Greece is neighboring with.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:06.280
And as you can see, in fact all
of the countries became more

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.630
or less part of what would
be called the eastern block.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.810
Of course the differences.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:18.520 position:56%
We can't speak of the same political
system in Albania or Yugoslavia.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.090
One different case
was Bulgaria as well.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:26.510
So these were mostly heading to
the north to those countries.

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:31.110
And you can see that the
division here in 1950,

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:38.180
the number of 76,000 refugees,
which went even higher.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:45.060
Most historians estimate about
100,000 people who moved only

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.760
from Greece and only
within two years.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:54.190
You see that the number of refugees
in these years is a very big one.

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:57.820
Most of them were heading first
to the neighboring countries,

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.270
but they settled or were
moved to other countries.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:08.780 position:56%
And as you can see, the number of
Yugoslavia would be the highest one.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.500
It needed to be said that
this number is counting most

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.510
of the Slavic-speaking
population in it.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:21.110
And after the Tito-Stalin
split in '48,

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:25.710
Greeks of Greek ethnicity
were shifted

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.970
under different political
circumstances

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.540
to other eastern block countries.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.360
Then we have the Soviet Union,
where a lot of political elites

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.820
of the Greek communist
party and some

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.630
of their family members
were stationed.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:47.850
As for Czech Republic, which
becomes the third strongest group

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.770
in this chart, they were
mostly children coming.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:54.860
Only within half a year,

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.050
4,000 children were
pushed to Czechoslovakia.

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.290
As I said, mostly Bohemia
and Moravia.

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.300
And elderly people.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.860
Why? Because of the
medical care they needed.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:13.100
So it was decided that the
social system and medical system

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:17.810
in Czechoslovakia is on the
level that it can absorb

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.100
and help this group of population.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:24.640
So if we speak of the elderly
population, we are discussing now

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.610
as being the most endangered
group in this time.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:35.260
It was a strategically
structured way to put children

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.920
and where you could
put elderly people.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:46.020
What did happen in this time?

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:53.220
Nearly 13,000 refugees by the
time are put in Czechoslovakia.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.720
It's very interesting to
see that they were scattered

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:03.060
in about 24 towns and
villages around Czechoslovakia.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.230
And in a form they were
very close to each other,

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.190
at least at the beginning.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:18.900
The main purpose to put them
in northern Moravia, this part.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.610
And I give you also
the map of Europe just

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:26.180
to give you more general
picture of where

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:30.770
to put Czech Republic on a map.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:35.270
They were put into those villages
first because they were welcomed

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.180
after the explosion
of German population.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:42.060
But as you could see in
Michel's presentation,

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.500
German population was
settled around the borders

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.820
and also in some other cities.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:55.070
But it had to remain
secret, isolated and safe.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:55:03.240 position:56%
So if you want to push refugees in a
part of a country which is isolated,

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.930
it's a mountainous area rule.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:13.190
Which is now without a basic, very
significant group of population.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.800
Which is safe because of
the neighboring Poland,

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:21.810
not like Western Germany or what
became Western Germany, or Austria.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.870
Which can remain secret.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:29.340
The basic idea was also that
this population should work

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.110
in similar conditions as
they worked in Greece,

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:36.940
which was a peasantry
and working as farmers.

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.500
But this was very soon
viewed as impossible.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:48.440
Because at that time the forestry
and the farms, nationalized farms

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:54.840
in Czechoslovakia, which at
that point after the coup de tat

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.600
in February '48, became a
part of the eastern block.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.910
Those are very much industrialized

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:07.300
and had a very good industrial
base already from the 19th century.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:13.170
So very soon the refugees realize
that they can earn a better living

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.680
if they go to the industrial
centers, which were in some

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.620
of the major towns in this
district which was also in Brno.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.510
So you can see this spot here.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:29.580
And later on, especially as
they started their education

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.910
at universities, et cetera.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:37.400
Many of them moved to
the capital of Prague.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.060
We can see at this point
that the integration

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:46.880
of the refugees wasn't really
a straightforward process.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.150
And that's what can connect
us with today's situation.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.780
It's not a straightforward process.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.750
It was rather a gradual process

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.860
which took several years
and many decisions.

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.040
And you have to see the loyalties

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:04.790
of the Greek communist party,
which was exterminated.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.850
Because in Greece it was
already forbidden ever since 1947

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:16.380
and remained forbidden until
the fall of Greek Junta in '74.

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:23.210
So all this period in Greek history
used to be called, and in Greek law

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:28.890
as well, used to be called the
period of the permanent civil war.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:34.960
So imagine that even in the
fixed Cold War you have a country

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.180
in the south of Europe and
you could certainly compare it

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.900
with Spain or with Portugal.

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:44.560
You have a country where
you have permanent Civil War

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.600
with legal instruments up to '74.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:56.470
And we have to keep that in mind
when thinking about this division.

00:57:56.470 --> 00:58:04.030
So once the refugees
arrive to Czechoslovakia,

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.560
I already mentioned
it wasn't an easy way.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:13.930
It was a very nice experience
lecturing at one of the schools

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:19.350
in the Czech Republic where I was
giving a similar lecture to kids

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.120
who were about 10 years old.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:26.330 position:56%
And they had the idea and these
kids were surely travelling by train

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:29.090
or by cars or even by airplanes.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.000
No, they went on foot.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.730
So they were crossing the border

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.670
on foot towards Albania
and towards Bulgaria.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:41.160
And from over there, they ended
up going through the Dardanelles

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:45.350
and through Black Sea
to Soviet Union.

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:49.150
Or they made crossing
through the Mediterranean Sea

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:52.600
through to Gibraltar,
around Great Britain

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.390
where sometimes the ships
were heavily attacked.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:59:01.750
Up to Poland, to Gdansk and then
through Poland to Czechoslovakia.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:06.460
So you can see the many
trajectories where the blue files,

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.780
the yellow files, and that
would be this direction.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.150
Then from Yugoslavia they
were exposed then to Hungary

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:18.300
and later came some of
them to Czechoslovakia.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:22.860
The other darts we can see here,
that's another difficult story.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:28.630
Because many of the families ended
up divided in different countries.

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:33.220
And it took one more decade
to reunite the families.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.030
So you have to imagine
children, some children,

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:39.350
living in children's homes
because they were not orphans.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:41.950
It was not an orphanage.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.680
Without their parents, being
in a different country.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:49.450
Or maybe being in the very same
country, but they were deprived,

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:52.470
all of them, all who
came to Czechoslovakia,

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:57.740
to stay with their families
until they reached the age of 14

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:02.890
when they started studies
or started to work.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:08.800
So they were institutionalized,
compulsory in these student homes.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.390
Where they were experiencing
a double education

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:15.570
and in fact a double
indoctrination as well

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:20.510
from the Czech communist party and
an education from Czech teachers.

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:25.540
But also the Greek communist
party and the education

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.530
of the very same thing
from the Greek teachers

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.610
or Slavic-speaking
teachers from Greece.

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:36.210
So you can see that this
patchwork was working

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:42.350
and that the state agreed
through Soviet Union and Moscow

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.710
with Greek communist party and
Czechoslovak communist party

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:50.980
in educating those refugees
in both of the languages.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.280
What happened?

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:59.350
They achieved to make a very
strong feeling of patriotism.

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.580
They made them bilingual,
all of them.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:06.550
And they made them to know
histories of both of the countries,

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.960
even if of course shaped in a way

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.730
as history was shaped
during the Cold War.

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:19.790
But it seems that this process was
a very successful one because most

01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:24.780
of the children, and we don't
have a psychologist telling them,

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.060
very good results usually
with children who went

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.250
through orphanages
or children's homes.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:35.660
These children were able to
create their own families,

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:38.900
were very successful
in their new positions.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.750
And most of them, at least the
statistics are saying 80% of them,

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:47.680
finished their university degree,
mostly in technical schools,

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.940
medical schools or
pedagogic schools.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.780
Of course the policy
was playing with that.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:01.140
But I just want to give you a basic
picture of what was happening.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.190
The composition, as I already
mentioned, in Czechoslovakia,

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:07.310
was as you see on the chart.

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:14.090
And I would only like to
highlight some of the usual myths.

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:18.390
And one of the myths is
that it was only communists

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.490
who were coming to those countries.

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:27.330
So if you have the number of 13,000
refugees coming to Czechoslovakia,

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:33.780
only 1,000-2,000 of them,
depending on the time period,

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.060 position:56%
were members of the communist party.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.220 position:56%
And later on of course there was the
growing of the second generation,

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.720
which also counts into
these 1,000-2,000 members

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.390
of communist party.

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:49.980
The other one is the composition
of Greeks and Slavophones

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.950
or Slavomacedonians, but also other
small groups who defined themselves

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:59.630
as Turks or Armans or kind

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:04.270
of Romanian-speaking
population of Greece.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:08.420
And as I already mentioned,
many of them brought children

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.930
and youngsters under the age of 13.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:14.260
Which of course leads to the fact

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:18.250
that from this group only a
very small number was able

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.670
to work immediately
because they were not

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.080
at the age of being sent to work.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.070
And Czechoslovakia was
trying to educate them first.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:31.760
And then we have those
elderly people how are send

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.700
to health institutions
and being helped socially.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.340
So the social program
around all this emigration

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:46.540 position:56%
and about all this emigration was a
very expensive one for 13,000 people

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:49.230
in only about three year's period.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:04:00.460 position:56%
You can see that the ripple creation
took a long time and it can erupt

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.790
in all the periods of the Cold War.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:11.130
So the first group went
back to Greece in fall '54,

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:17.980 position:56%
which was the time after the death
of Stalin, where the first agreement

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.640
between Greece and
Czechoslovakia was signed.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.080
After that, you could
apply only individually.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:30.780
And if you see that the numbers
are dropping very significantly,

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:37.250 position:56%
in the '60's when the policy changed
once again and became more relaxed,

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:40.040 position:56%
bigger number of people is going in.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.190
We have here the Greek Junta
where nearly nobody was going back

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:48.470 position:56%
because of course people were
scared of persecution back in Greece

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.610
and they had reason for that.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:59.870
After the laws in '74 and later
on in '80-81, with the new rule

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:08.310
of the socialist party of Greece,
[inaudible], many refugees decided

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:13.670
to return back because of
the rules which were issued.

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:19.410
Which outlawed the possibility
to punish them for taking place

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:22.330
in a Greek Civil War resistance.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:26.870
Just to wrap up, we still do have

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:32.340
about 3,000 Greeks
living in Czechoslovakia.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:38.090
And what is very significant is the
positive picture they are making

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:39.520
in Czech society.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.150
Greece of course, as with
many other countries,

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:46.480
became the destination
of summer holidays.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.270
But it also is renowned for
its ancient history, et cetera.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.140
But also in a country itself,

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:58.500
it's the former Greek Civil War
refugees running Greek restaurants,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:03.880
having Greek shops,
who are now the aim

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.910
of the visit of the
Czech population.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:10.500
Greek dancing groups do have
more Czechs that are dancing

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.990
in them than Greeks today.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:19.240
So you can see the intermingling of
these groups was very significant

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.570
and didn't really need to
assimilate the population

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.010
which is so often discussed.

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:30.980
If a country will accept refugees,
do we assimilate them successfully?

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:36.760
And I do claim the success is to
live with them successfully and not

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.920
to assimilate them, because
we all can gain from that.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.050
It doesn't matter if they have
a Czech national identity,

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:53.180
as you can see, or a Stephanos who
is claiming that he was born Greek

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:56.850
and he will die Greek even if
he never, ever travelled again

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.860
to Greece after he
came to Czechoslovakia.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.540
And it's not a big distance.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.250
It's two hours by plane and
it's not that expensive either.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:10.150
But he doesn't want to
destroy his picture of Greece.

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:13.600
He wants to remain
Greek in Czechoslovakia.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.350
And this is in my opinion
the message we have to spread

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:21.580
to today's society as well.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.880 position:56%
If you have the chance to read in
Czech or Greek, you will get a story

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.620
of all of those, their
identities, their political views,

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:35.610
their life in Czechoslovakia,
either in Greek or in Czech.

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:40.240
Unfortunately not in English, but I
hope to sum it up one day at least

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.280
in an article that you can
have for all of you on that.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.510
Thank you very much
for your attention.

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:53.580
[ Applause ]

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.850
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: We have
time for a few questions

01:07:55.850 --> 01:08:01.330
if anybody has a question
for any one of the speakers.

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:02.630
Yes?

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:07.920
&gt;&gt; I actually have an ethical
question to Dr. Frankl.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:11.180
But I also have a question
for all three of you.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.840
First of all, when you were
talking about the 1938 exile,

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.240
how did that timing
with the Anschluss

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:25.950 position:56%
with other things motivate people
to run into that in that time frame?

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:29.570
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Do you want
to come up to the microphone?

01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:34.020
And we'll have to repeat part
of the question for the webcast.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:42.080
So if you come up and
repeat part of the question.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.410
&gt;&gt; Michel Frankl: Okay.

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:48.730
Thank you for the question
about the -- this one, here?

01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:54.680
Basically about the series
of events and the timeframe

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.130
and how this motivated
people to leave.

01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:02.340
I must say I've skipped
most of the fact simply

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:09.120
because of the time
that I had for the talk.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.500
Let me just go one step back.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:20.250
And it is a pre-story from 1933.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:24.220
In terms of closed borders and
refugees, it also has a history

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:28.370
at the turn of 1937 and
1938 when the Czechoslovaks

01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:33.800
for the first time sealed the
borders for Romanian refugees.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.480
It was a short period when Romani
was governed by pro-fascist

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.640
and very anti-Semitic government.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.470
And Czechoslovak officials fear

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.210
that the country will
be flooded very soon

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:49.120
with Jewish and communist refugees.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.880
It was the same category
for them anyway.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.230
And it is interesting
from the point of view

01:09:56.230 --> 01:10:02.040
that there were actually no
refugees coming right now.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.070
It was the image of the
imminent refugee danger,

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:08.830
rather than a reality
to which they reacted.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:13.960
Some weeks later, just a couple
of weeks later, March 1938,

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.550
when the Nazi Anschluss of
Austria, this is the moment

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:19.740
when real refugees are coming.

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.960
And they have to come very quickly.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.750
Since a lot of people were
hoping that all those --

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:32.180
Austria 1930's was a
large anti-Semitic state

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.080
and quite an oppressive state.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.020
It was not that dangerous
to live there.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.410
They would think [inaudible].

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:45.530
But also in the crisis which ended
up by the Nazi takeover of Austria.

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:49.070
A lot of these people
were opponents of Nazism.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:52.620
They were hoping to stay until the
referendum, which was scheduled

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.170
to be just some days afterward.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.790
So people like Burman and others
were staying till the last moment.

01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:59.900
And then they were fleeing.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:04.940
One thing that I haven't mentioned
and should have mentioned is

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:10.410
that a lot of them are not
fleeing by their own decision,

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:11.960
but they were simply expelled.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.380
Especially if these refugees did
not have Austrian citizenship.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:23.220
This is the case of a lot of people
who fled in the first World War.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.300
There were a lot of Jews who
fled in the first World War

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.650
from Galicia especially
and stayed in Vienna.

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:32.030
But they were never naturalized.

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:39.270
So there is yet another group of
Jews who were expelled from Austria

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:42.120
or fleeing, and those are
Jews with Polish citizenship

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.030
who are being basically channeled
through Czechoslovakia to Poland.

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:48.940
And in Poland this leads to
a revision of citizenship.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.410
This revision of citizenship
will mean

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:56.950
that Polish Jews living abroad
won't keep their Polish passports,

01:11:56.950 --> 01:12:00.280
or these Polish passports wouldn't
allow them to come back to Poland.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:05.090
This led to the expulsion of
Polish Jews from Germany at the end

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:09.180
of October 1978, something
I haven't mentioned at all.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.190
And this is an event
which is also connected

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:16.440
to this history of
the Kristallnacht.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.360
Perhaps a couple of words
about Czechoslovakia.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.430
As you have seen I have
largely skipped facts

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:30.420
about the post-Munich refugees
simply because it's a huge topic.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.780
But we need to take into
account that this is one

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:39.350 position:56%
of the most extensive bases of
refugees in Czechoslovakian history.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:43.010
Basically comparable only
to the first World War.

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:49.340
It can be somewhere around say the
end of 1938 some 200,000 who escape

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.540
after the Munich Agreement
or before,

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.800
during and after the
Munich Agreement.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.260
And after the Kristallnacht
from the border areas.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.820
Most of them are Czechs.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:05.980 position:56%
But among them there are probably
some 20,000 Jews and 20,000 Germans.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.740
So I don't know if that answered.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.550
And these events are connected.

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:13.260
There's a chain of events.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:17.290
&gt;&gt; The second question is a
personal question for all three.

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:22.370
Do you all three have family
histories that went through this,

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:26.410
that motivated you
to study this area?

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:30.500
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Repeat
the question please.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.890
&gt;&gt; Michel Frankl: The
question is whether the three

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.560
of us speakers have personal
histories, family histories

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.200
that would motivate us
to deal with this topic.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.810
But in my case, my family histories
are connected to the Holocaust

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:52.930
and partially also these
are refugee histories.

01:13:52.930 --> 01:13:56.100
But I'm not sure that
this motivated me

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.920
to specifically look
into this topic.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.010
I started to deal with the
history of anti-Semitism

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:06.780
when I was searching for
a topic for my BA thesis.

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.710
And I discovered that the
topic, which I'm not going

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:12.260
to describe here, is
largely undescribed

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.740
and unanalyzed in the
historiography.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.860
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Katerina?

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.870
&gt;&gt; Katerina Kralova: Well
you will be surprised.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:26.190
I have no other connection
than academic connection.

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.570
And connection with my older years,

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.610
which I spent in Greece
traveling for my research.

01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:36.800
I have no Greek family background.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:43.140
My research started
mainly with my Ph. D thesis

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:47.180
on Greek-German relations
and a shade of Nazi past.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:51.130
And I was always asked if
I have a Greek background.

01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:56.240
And I was always pushed
that I should do something

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.290
about Greeks living
in Czechoslovakia.

01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:05.580
And it was a big task and it was
a marvelous task and I did it.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.130 position:56%
But there is no personal connection.

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:13.570
In fact, my grandmother
too, who is still among us,

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:17.260
which I am very happy for,
she is a Holocaust survivor.

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:22.200
So again, there are tragic
experiences in the family,

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.650
but none of them is
related to Greece.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:29.770
But it's an amazing
topic to be researched.

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.840
&gt;&gt; Amy Kaslow: Mine
will be very brief.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.590
The short answer is no.

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:42.080
But a fierce determination to
learn and once you learn the plight

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.640
of one people, it's irresistible
to learn that of others.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.370
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: We have
time for one more question.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:53.260
&gt;&gt; My question is for
you, Dr. Kralova.

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:58.210
I was happy to hear how
integrated the refugees were

01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:00.090
who came in the '40's.

01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:05.100 position:56%
And I know refugees that come to the
United States, they have the ability

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.070
to become American citizens
without too much trouble.

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:11.700
At the end you said
most of the dancers,

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.830
the Greek dancers, are Czech.

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:17.870
So why is it that after 70
years they're still identified

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.370
as Czech if they never left?

01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:23.730
Are they Greek citizens?

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:26.990
Or how does that work exactly?

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:32.420
Or do they still live in Greek
enclaves in the Czech Republic?

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.090
&gt;&gt; Katerina Kralova: Well
the question would be

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:42.500
about citizenship reflecting
the Czech and Greek identities

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.150
in Czech Republic nowadays.

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:52.530
And how these people
achieve their acculturation

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:55.230
and adaptation in a society.

01:16:55.230 --> 01:17:00.230
Of course I had 20 minutes and
I had to skip so many things.

01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:03.200
So of course it was
not always ideal.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.180 position:56%
And of course we have
mentionings, especially in archives.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:13.830
Never, ever did it come
up in oral testimony,

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.650
which was very interesting.

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:18.350
If we asked directly we
were a mixed up group.

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:23.680
So it was not only Czechs who
were interviewing the Greek Civil

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.090
War refugees.

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:28.370
So we could say, you know,

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:34.820
if you speak with a Greek Civil War
refugee maybe you will be more open

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.500
about that experience you
experienced in the country.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.170
It never really came
up in the interviews

01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:46.820
which for me was very
interesting and I didn't expect it.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.300
However, in the archives,
and we have to admit

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:56.360
that recording interviews
five years ago, six years ago,

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.460
we couldn't reach to all the first
generation of people who were

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.010
at adult age or elderly when
they came to Czechoslovakia.

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:05.810
Maybe we would get another picture

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:09.400
if we had done the
recording 20 years earlier.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.100
In archives we can trace.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.920
There was a certain xenophobia in
the beginning, but it was overcome.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.420
Now to the question of citizenship,
that's a very interesting question.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.150
Czechoslovakia in the time

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:28.550
of the Cold War didn't
allow anybody in Greece.

01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:33.520
It was very complicated to the
law against those who were put

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:39.890
in the group of communists,
and who therefore could lose

01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:44.030
or would lose their citizenship
once they leave the country

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.030
because of political reasons.

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:47.330
There were other groups.

01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:52.660
It was very interesting what
defines you as being Greek,

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.130
which was the Greek
orthodoxy and the language.

01:18:56.130 --> 01:19:00.810
Greece until nowadays doesn't
acknowledge national minorities,

01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:04.070
only religious minorities,
the traditional one.

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.490
So if you were Jewish,
if you were Muslim,

01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:08.360
then you were a religious minority

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.480
but you won't be a Jew
as a national minority.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:19.530
You won't be a Turk as a
national minority and so on.

01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:23.760
So this is one of the
frames back to Greece.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:28.600
And in Czechoslovakia you were not
allowed to have double citizenship.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.060
So in this situation people
had to make the decision,

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:40.850
"Do I take a Czech citizenship
and then will be more vulnerable

01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.730
to losing my Greek citizenship

01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:45.890
and maybe never have the
opportunity to go back?"

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.460
Because Greeks see me
as a Czech citizen.

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.720
Therefore I won't be able to
apply for my Greek properties

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.950
and everything I lost
because of the war.

01:19:55.950 --> 01:20:00.560
So this was a very difficult thing.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.370
In fact, until the end of the
Cold War, only several thousand

01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:13.830
in all the years applied for
-- several hundred, sorry,

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:16.450
applied for Czech citizenship.

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:23.630
So virtually nobody of this group
of the primary 12,000-plus people.

01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:25.650
But the second generation more

01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:29.630
and more did not have
a Czech citizenship.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:33.220
It was complicated, especially once
they were able to cross the border

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.810
and so forth because they didn't
have proper documentation.

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:40.320
So travelling for the first time
back to Greece they had a kind

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.020
of paper issued that they
can cross the borders,

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:47.260
but nobody really knew what
does it mean, et cetera.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.580
So this was a complicated
situation of citizenship.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.650
On the other hand, we have to move
ourselves back to the Cold War.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:00.360
Crossing borders was not
an easy task back then.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.610
So you mainly and for most remained
in the country where you lived in.

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.280
So you didn't really
have the feeling, "Oh,

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.520
I can't go to neighboring Austria
because I don't have passport."

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.820
You couldn't go anyway.

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.970
So this is something we have to
understand and to base limits

01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:23.680
of globalized society where the
passport is a very important thing.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.170
Back then it was approached
in a different way.

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:29.470
So this is an important thing.

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:33.300
Speaking about Greek
dancers, it's interesting

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:38.780
because the Greek dancers
are mostly being the first --

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.890
not anymore -- they vary.

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:44.300
Second and third generation,
many of them.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.810
But of course open
to the whole society.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:54.320
Locally there is a lot of
dancing being done on a more

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.980
or less professional level.

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:04.180
So they are still Greek dancers,
second and third generation,

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:07.310
who are even doing all
their costumes by their hand

01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:09.570
as they did back in
the Cold War et cetera.

01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:13.740
And who are travelling
to Greek dance festivals.

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.820
Then the group is mostly Greek.

01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:21.710
But doing it as a hobby in your
leisure time, the group changes.

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:25.350
And of course because as I said,
remember in all the republic,

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.350
and we have 13 communities now.

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:31.800
So it's scattered in a little
country of 11 million people.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.920
You have 3,000 of Greeks who
are still that distinguished,

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.330
which is very interesting.

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:47.520
And they attach to those
activities the majority population.

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.120

&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Thank
you all for coming.

01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:56.540
If you want to come up informally
in a little bit and speak with them

01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:57.990
and answer the rest
of your questions.

01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:59.980
I'm sorry, we've run out of time.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.280
But thank you very much.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.590
And I'm going to thank the
speakers and the Embassy very much.

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:06.510
Thank you.
