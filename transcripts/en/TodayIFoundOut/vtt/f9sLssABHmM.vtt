Mark 
Twain and His Curious Aquarium

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.070
On February 12, 1908, Clemens said, “I suppose
we are all collectors…

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.869
As for me, I collect pets: young girls — girls
from ten to sixteen years old; girls who are

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.029
pretty and sweet and naive and innocent — dear
young creatures to whom life is a perfect

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.270
joy and to whom it has brought no wounds,
no bitterness, and few tears.”

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.300
Okay, so it isn’t actually as creepy as
it initially sounds and in some ways is kind

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.480
of sweet, but Samuel Clemens did love to entertain
young girls.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870
Towards the end of Clemens’ life, he suffered
quite a lot of hardship.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.190
His daughter, Susy, died in 1896 and his wife,
Olivia, passed away in 1904, followed by a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.300
second daughter, Jean, in 1909.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.530
Clemens fell into a depression in the early
1900s and noted that while he had reached

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.420
the grandfather stage of life, he had no grandchildren
to keep him company.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.370
He therefore went about befriending young
girls who he treated as surrogate granddaughters.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.310
The girls in question were the daughters of
couples who ran in his same social circle.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.890
He often met them on boats carting him back
and forth to England or Bermuda, as was the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.650
case with Helen Allen.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.020
Allen was just twelve years old when Clemens
stayed with her family in Bermuda.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.890
Her father was the American Vice-Council in
Bermuda; her grandmother had known Clemens’

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.470
wife as a child.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.110
Clemens said Allen was “perfect in character,
lovely in disposition, and a captivator at

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.170
sight”- everything that Clemens wanted in
his collection of young girls.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.430
The group of girls were called “Angel Fish”
or “the Aquarium Club.”

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.730
The name is derived from the fish that Clemens
first saw in Bermuda.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.360
He decided on that name because the angelfish
“is the most beautiful fish that swims.”

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.210
Clemens would buy angelfish pins in Bermuda
and present them to each of his girls.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.710
Out of a dozen or so original pins, at least
one is still in existence.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.130
It currently resides in the Mark Twain Library
in Redding, Connecticut.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.930
So what exactly did a man in his late seventies
do with a bunch of teenaged girls?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.900
All manner of innocent, grandfatherly things.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.140
Clemens invited the girls to concerts, the
theatre, and to his own house for card games,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.250
billiards, and reading.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.510
While in Bermuda, several of his Angel Fish
had fun riding in a donkey-pulled cart with

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.510
him.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.270
Clemens initially called his estate “Innocence
at Home” in honour of “his girls.”

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.770
He kept in touch with them by exchanging letters
when they couldn’t visit, but always kept

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.430
a room available and hoped to have an Angel
Fish “in it as often as Providence will

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.430
permit.”

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.870
Before you get too much of a “Michael Jackson”
vibe, it should be noted that the girls were

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.590
always accompanied by a chaperone; the room
for the Angel Fish even had two beds to accommodate

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.390
a mother or guardian along with a girl.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.700
Besides the room, Clemens’ house also had
a billiard room which was refashioned into

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.090
a sort of shrine to the Angel Fish.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.380
Above the door was a sign that said “the
Aquarium” and inside the walls were lined

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.110
with framed photos of each of the Aquarium
Club’s members.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.640
As innocent as it all was, if some celebrity
tried to do that today, the press would have

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.540
a field day with it, insinuating all manner
of disgusting things, whether there was any

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.610
evidence of such acts or not.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.670
In his day, it wasn’t really much of a scandal,
though Clemens’ remaining daughter, Clara,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.590
didn’t appreciate the behavior, perhaps
being a tad jealous.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.110
When she returned to her father’s home from
a stint in Europe to find that he had collected

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.870
a group of young girls to entertain, she made
her father change the name of his house to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.150
“Stormfield” and stopped the household
staff from saving letters from the Angel Fish.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.250
(Today the full collection of every surviving
letter can be read in Mark Twain’s Aquarium:

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.800
The Samuel Clemens-Angelfish Correspondence.)

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.540
The presence of chaperones probably should
have put Clara’s mind at ease, but the letters

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.730
Clemens wrote to his girls would definitely
raise some eyebrows today.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.099
Shortly after Dorothy Harvey’s fourteenth
birthday, he wrote to tell her “I wish I

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.200
could have those free-gratis-for-nothing-voyages-&amp;-nothing-to-do-but-look-at-you
every day.”

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.480
To Dorothy Quick, just eleven years old, he
wrote after one of her visits, “I went to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.370
bed as soon as you departed, there being nothing
left to live for after that, &amp; all the sunshine

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.370
gone.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.819
How do you suppose I am going to get along
without you?”

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.940
The letters showed his love and devotion to
his girls and the enjoyment he experienced

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.190
in spending time with them, but today parents
would likely have used these letters as evidence

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.280
in civil lawsuits.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280
:-)

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.169
Despite this, only one relationship ever looked
to be somewhat improper, and that wasn’t

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.050
with one of his Angel Fish; further, the inappropriate
overtures didn’t come from Clemens.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.449
The girl was Gertrude Natkin.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.849
He met her when she was 15 and he was 70 in
1905.

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.800
The two exchanged letters and Natkin developed
a “school girl crush” on Clemens and went

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.380
somewhat overboard in expressing her affection
for him through her letters.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.139
Clemens became concerned about this and distanced
himself from her- his letters growing more

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.840
and more infrequent, because he didn’t want
to gain a reputation for impropriety nor encourage

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.430
her affections, perhaps proving that he saw
his Angel Fish as nothing more than granddaughters.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.309
Certainly, at the time, an adult male courting
a 15 year old girl wouldn’t have raised

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.370
eyebrows, particularly if the suitor was well-to-do
and not too old.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.909
But at 70, it would have been a scandal even
in that time period.

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.999
Clemens died on April 21, 1910 of a heart
attack, just a few years after establishing

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.449
the Aquarium Club for his Angel Fish.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.389
All in all, there were around a dozen members
of the club who visited Clemens regularly

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.941
until his death, but his enthusiasm for the
club waned in the last year of his life; he

00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:34.389
complained that his girls were growing up
too fast, complained about their boyfriends,

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.229
and cut off one girl when she turned sixteen.

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.409
In the end, his fondness for them primarily
lying in their innocence, as something of

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.300
a breath of fresh air in a cynical world,
waned as they gradually lost that defining

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.279
feature of children.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.110
Twains love of innocence and apparent adoration
of little girls in a parent or grandfatherly

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.900
sense, is somewhat mirrored in another famous
writer, Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), who

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.339
used to take a few little girls out for day
trips to play games and tell stories to them.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.020
One of the little girls was Alice Liddell,
who helped inspire “Alice’s Adventures

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.710
Under Ground” which became “Alice’s
Adventures in Wonderland”.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.909
She begged him to write the story down for
her that he’d come up with while they were

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.909
adventuring, and the result was his most celebrated
work.

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.840
Samuel Clemens was born in 1835, a year in
which Halley’s Comet could be seen.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.440
He once predicted that he’d die in a Halley’s
Comet year, and he did—just one day after

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:58.680
the comet could be seen 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:34.829
from Earth in 1910.
