00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:03.100
JAMES GRIME: There are people
out there who want to change

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.280
the way that you count.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.290
They want to change the world so
that we stop counting using

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.710
10 symbols and start counting
using 12 symbols.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.430
I love them.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.030
I think these guys are great.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.740
Let's talk about what
we know so far.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.390
So, the way we count is
the decimal system.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.980
It uses 10 symbols.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.340
So, let's just write those
out, first of all.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
0, 1, 2, 8, 9.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680
Once we get to this point, we
start to have to make our

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.900
numbers using combinations of
the symbols we've already got.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.610
12, 13, 14, 22, 23.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.980
Now, if we had been born with
six fingers on each hand, then

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.880
we would have 12 fingers, and
maybe we would have started

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.480
using something called the
dozenal system where it's

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.880
based on 12 symbols.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.890
And there are some people out
there who think this is the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.640
system we should be using.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.970
They think we should have six
fingers on each hand.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
They're disappointed we don't
have six fingers on each hand,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.520
because they think it's a much
easier way to count.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
So first of all, if we're going
to use 12 symbols, I

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.840
need two extra.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.380
Let's have a look at
what they suggest.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.160
For 10, we we're going to
have a symbol like this.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.570
That's called dek.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.830
And for 11, we're going to have
a symbol like this, which

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.960
is called el.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.320
So now it reads 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, dek, el.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.520
This would be 12.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.110
In fact, they say do.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.200
So this is do, do 1, do 2, do 3,
do 4, do 5, do 6, do 7, do

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.010
8, do 9, do dek, and do el.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.260
So, do el would be
12 and 11 more.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.180
So that's 23, and then
you keep counting.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.370
2 do is 24, so 2 do.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.640
Two do 1, 2 do 3, 2
do 4, and so on.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.030
Just like decimal
system, really.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.539
It's the exact same idea.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.410
There's no difference between
the dozenal system and the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.270
decimal system.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.015
That would be 3 do, this
would be 4 do.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:21.650
You keep going and you would get
9 do, then you would get

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.240
dek do, el do, and then
you'd get do do.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.020
do do.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.320
12 12s.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.570
12 12s, that's 144,
12 12s, or gross.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.400
So if we write that out, 12 12s
will be written like this.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.850
It's 144, or gross, or gro
So that would be a gro.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.440
Something like this
would be a mo.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.700
So if we take this year, it's
2012, which is a good year to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.850
pick, since we were
talking about 12.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.290
So if we took the year 2012,
in the dozenal system, it's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.360
written like this.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.470
That is mo gro el 8.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.190
That's the current year if
you count in base 12.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.900
Now, there is a reason
why these guys want

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.480
to count this way.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.690
Because they say it's going to
make arithmetic much easier.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.340
I want to make this clear.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.750
For serious maths, this system
would not make any difference.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
But for day to day life, for
your regular shopping, these

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.350
guys reckon that this 12 system
would make life much

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.450
easier because of the number
of factors that 12 has.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.520
So 10 has--

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.780
let's see.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.830
How many factors does it have?

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.050
It has 1.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.420
10 has 2, 5, and 10 itself.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.130
But 12 has much more factors.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.870
It has 1, it has 2, it has
3, it has 4, it has 6,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.470
and it has 12 itself.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.620
The reason this is useful is
it will make calculations

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.290
using thirds and quarters
much easier

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.220
than they are in decimal.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.830
Let's do something like
a 4 times table.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.420
If we did that in decimal,
it would look like this.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.480
OK, it's 4, and then 2 times 4
is 8, 3 times 4 is 12, 4 times

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.630
4 is 16, 5 times 4 is 20.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.100
If we did it with the dozenal
system, then it would have 4,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.120
and we would have 8, then we
would have do, which is their

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.510
word for 12.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:40.686
Then we would have do 4, do
8, 2 do, 2 do 4, 2 do 8,

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:42.670
3 do, and so on.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.510
This pattern is a much easier
pattern to teach children.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.550
4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.100
The patterns are much
easier to see.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.410
But the real strength of it is
when you start dividing.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.040
If we wanted something like 1/3,
you know in decimal that

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.500
this is 0.3333, it goes on
forever, which is fairly ugly.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.460
But in the dozenal system, it
suddenly becomes really nice.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.700
If I want to write 1/3,
that'd be 4 out of do.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.760
4/12 is 1/3.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.070
4 out of do, which
is equal to 0.4.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.580
1/3 written in this
system is 0.4.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.230
It's not something that
goes on forever.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.080
That's the sort of thing
that decimal does.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.150
It's horrible.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.290
In dozenal, it doesn't happen.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.330
Let's do something else.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.360
Let's do a quarter.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.350
A quarter of 12, a quarter of
do, is 3 out of do, which

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.820
would be 0.3.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.450
1/2 would be 6 out of
do, which is 0.6.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.230
If you want to do 1/6, that
would be 2 out of

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.050
do, which is 0.2.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.450
Suddenly, all these become
much simpler.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.300
You can see now why
they like it.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.400
Suddenly, all those horrible
things that happen in decimal

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.410
don't happen in dozenal.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.310
If we had been born with six
fingers on each hand and this

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.850
is the system we have learnt,
and then I came to you and

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.370
said, no, I've got an idea,
let's not use base 12, let's

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.270
use base 10, you would
laugh in my face.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.960
Why would you use base 10?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.220
It's not as good.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.090
Now, naturally, we actually
count in twelves, and

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.330
historically, weights and
measures were in twelves.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.310
So you would have
feet and inches.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.780
12 inches to a foot.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.440
And currency was counted in
twelves as well, because it

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.170
was naturally made dividing by
half, dividing by thirds, and

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.560
dividing by quarters
and sixths.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.080
Much more easy and much more
practical, and that's the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.130
system we had.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.830
Then in the French Revolution,
the French got obsessed with

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.180
decimalizing everything.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.510
They wanted to make weights and
measures easier to use, so

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.320
they wanted to decimalize it,
divide it into 100 because we

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.170
use the decimal system.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.070
Now, they had a choice.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.170
They could have decimalized
everything, or they could have

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.410
changed the way we counted
from 10 to 12.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.090
If they had done that, they
could have kept all the

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.580
weights and measures the same
and all the calculations would

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.170
have been as easy to do
in dozenal as they

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.350
are today in decimal.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.850
Now, they chose to make things
metric and keep the system.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.000
Maybe they made the
wrong choice.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.700
In fact, in the French
Revolution, they went so mad

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.240
with decimalization that they
had a decimal week, they had a

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.960
decimal calendar, and a
decimal clock as well.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.060
They did that for a few years.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.820
Didn't take off.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.550
BRADY HARAN: What would pi be?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.490
Would pi be the same?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.460
JAMES GRIME: So, if we're
talking about serious maths,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.200
something like pi, it would look
a lot different, and it

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.770
would involve these dek symbols
and el symbols.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.460
And if we look at it, it looks
weird and unusual.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.190
But if you were born with this
system, it would be fine.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.350
It would be normal.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.780
There's no significant
difference in the mathematics.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.880
The real difference this would
make would be to just your

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.090
regular life.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.870
It might make arithmetic easier
for children as well.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.820
BRADY HARAN: But the one thing,
I guess, people are

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.850
going to say is, when you're
very small and learning about

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.280
numbers, your fingers and your
hands are a really useful

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.090
learning aid.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.575
You'd be taking that away from
children right at the start.

00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:35.299
JAMES GRIME: Well, to answer
that, there are some cultures

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.980
that still use base 12.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.679
And what they do is
they count on the

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.549
segments of your fingers.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:47.360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, dek, el, do.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.370
Just as easy to use.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.180
MATT PARKER: How many
hours do you want?

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.580
So the next one, let's say we
did 3 to the power of, to the

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.400
power of, arrow, arrow, arrow,
or whatever you want

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.800
to call this, 3.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.420
That is equivalent to 3 to the
double to the double to the 3.
