00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.970
This actually isn't really a question. It's more of a comment. Yeah.

2
00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.280
I kind of turned it into a question, I guess. Yeah.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.440
You responded to the comment. Yeah, sure. Anyway,

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.130
just want to say quick. Thanks.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.480
I struggle with the daily grind trading days for dollars,

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.970
but you helped me make it happen. Yeah, and my comment was like, okay,

7
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:23.560
well thank you. I guess

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.700
because I hope at the same time that you're grinding,

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.480
that you're trading, that you're,

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.660
I hope that you're not trading days for dollars long term because long term,

11
00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:38.350
that's a losing proposition, right?

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.850
If you're grinding and it's not doing something you want to do,

13
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.440
if it's a grind that you can't embrace,

14
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.230
then you've got to find a way out of that. Right? You got to fight. You can't,

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.501
Trey,

16
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:56.680
you don't want to trade days for dollars because dollars don't mean anything.

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.280
Days is all you got. So you gotta find a way.

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.320
Now, this does not mean you need to be rash about it.

19
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.950
This doesn't mean tomorrow you walk in and I'm not doing this job anymore.

20
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:11.020
I'm out and now you're broke. No,

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.490
don't be rash and don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

22
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.870
But do come up with a longterm plan about what you want to do,

23
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.670
how you want to do it, where you want to do it.

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.010
And this might take one year or two years or five years,

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.210
it might take five years to get to where you want to be. That's okay.

26
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.800
That's fine. It's,

27
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.910
it's actually kind of cool when you're grinding right now cause you know there's

28
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.060
something that you're working towards in the long run that's actually awesome.

29
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.590
So, but, but you gotta have an exit strategy.

30
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.710
You got to have an exit strategy.

31
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.350
You've got to plan and figure out how much money it's going to take and what are

32
00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:51.670
you going to do? You're going to work two jobs.

33
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.370
I'm going to save all my money right now. I'm going to invest here.

34
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.530
Then pay off my mortgage. Whatever it is you're going to do

35
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
so that you can get yourself into a position where you actually enjoy doing what

36
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.450
you're doing. That's what you want.

37
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.540
And the one other cool thing about this, like,

38
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.110
like I say, man, it's cool to grind, man. That's what we're here to do.

39
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.270
You're here doing stuff right?

40
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.780
If you're not doing anything well then what are you doing?

41
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.040
So the other thing that's cool though about grinding and working is,

42
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.810
is that when you get that freedom right, that you work hard for,

43
00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:30.040
it's going to be so much more worth it.

44
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.360
That discipline that you put into place to get to that freedom that you want,

45
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.790
it makes that freedom so much more worth it. So I appreciate it.

46
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.600
I'm glad you're grinding. I'm glad you're grinding hard,

47
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.170
but don't just make that trade. It's not a square trade days for dollars,

48
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.080
not a square trade. Get it back under your control. And we've had,

49
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.460
I've actually had some really cool feedback on the podcast of people that have

50
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.420
hit me up and said, hey, I, you told me to plan an exit strategy.

51
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.960
I wish I could find a guy said, you told me to plan an exit strategy. He's like,

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.950
that was whatever, nine months ago I saved my money. I just did this.

53
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.370
Now I'm in another business. I'm kicking ass. Thank you. Right? Yeah.

54
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.960
So it can be done. It's one of the things about cool about being a human being.

55
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.550
You've got free will. You can make stuff happen to go make it happen.
