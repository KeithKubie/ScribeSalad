Hope you had a lot of fun working
with the Pirate Fleet app.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.020
In a short amount of time we saw just
how much you can affect an application

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.230
by writing a few lines of code.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.380
And it was real good practice.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.810
In the real world,
you'll make many different projects.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.300
And many times you won't
be the original author.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.470
But that's okay.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
Sometimes it's best to start
with something that works.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840
And make small changes as you learn.
