So, I think you understand enough now to be able to modify the server to do

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.637
different things for different requests. And so, I want you to do for this quiz

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:11.824
is change the server without modifying the LuckySearch class. So, that if the

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.143
request that comes in is for /about, a response with a message, This is my

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.659
udacious project, instead of responding with a search result. For all other

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.376
requests, it should do the same thing it does now, respond with the result of

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:25.093
LuckySearch.
