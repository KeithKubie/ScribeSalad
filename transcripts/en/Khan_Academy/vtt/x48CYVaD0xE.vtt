00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.160
- [Voiceover] Let's figure out
what 2.211 divided by 6.7 is.

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.248
So the first thing I like to do is,

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:09.906
I don't like to divide by a decimal.

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:13.342
So I'm going to multiply 6.7,

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.769
I'm going to multiply 6.7 by 10,

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.167
which is essentially
just taking this decimal

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.038
and moving it one space to the right.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.442
Well I can't just do that to the 6.7,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.837
I also have to do that to the 2.21.

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:28.400
So let me move its decimal

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.128
one space to the right.

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:34.112
And so now I can rewrite the problem.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:35.494
I can rewrite it as

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.164
22,

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:38.943
22 point,

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:42.253
22.11

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:43.746
divided by,

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:44.976
divided by,

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:46.553
instead of writing it as 6.7

00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:48.813
I can now write it as 67.

00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:51.896
67, let me do it in that same color.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:54.088
I can now write it as 67.

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:55.613
I could write a decimal right over here

00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:56.861
but that's not going to change the fact

00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.660
that this is just now the whole number 67.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.121
And so now I'm ready to
do some long division

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:03.939
now that I'm dividing by a whole number.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.976
You might say, "Wait, I still
have a decimal over here,"

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:06.974
but that's okay

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.354
and you're going to see that in a second.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.038
So let's try to do some long division.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.291
So we're going to take,

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:16.102
we're going to take 22.11

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:17.910
or 22 and 11 hundredths,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.152
and we are going to divide,

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:20.754
let me write that a little bit bigger

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:22.774
just so we have some space.

00:01:22.774 --> 00:01:27.026
22.11,

00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:29.770
and we are going to divide that by...

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.617
We are going to divide that by 67.

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:35.820
67.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.023
Alright, let's do some long division now.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:39.539
And actually, before we even do that,

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.304
I like to keep track of my decimal.

00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:42.860
So my decimal is over here,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.204
I'm going to write my
decimal right over here

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.458
in the answer.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.281
And when you're doing these
long division problems

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:50.580
it's really important
to write things neatly

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.379
and keep things in nice columns

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:53.679
and keep track of your place value

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.479
because if you don't write
things in neat columns

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.137
then frankly you'll probably
lose track of your place value.

00:01:58.137 --> 00:01:59.159
But let's do this.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.280
So 67 goes into 2 zero
times, so let's move on.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.461
67 goes into 22 zero times.

00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:10.242
67 goes into 221.

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:12.363
So let's think about that a little bit.

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:14.579
This is pretty close to 70,

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.428
70 times 3 would be 210.

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:20.508
So this looks like maybe three times,

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:22.423
three times seems about right.

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:24.849
So let's try, let's put a 3 up here.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.290
3 times 7 is 21,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.740
carry the 2,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.574
3 times 6 is 18, plus 2 is 20,

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:35.564
is 20.

00:02:35.564 --> 00:02:38.537
So we get 201 and the difference between

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:42.312
221 and 201 is going to be...

00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:44.723
Well you just get a 0
here, you get a 2 here,

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.860
then you get a 0 here, I
don't have to write it.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.916
It's 20.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:52.408
So 3 was right, if 3 times
67 were higher than 221

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:53.826
then we'd be in trouble.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:57.863
And then if 3 times 67 were
lower but it was so low

00:02:57.863 --> 00:03:00.962
that when you subtracted you
got a number higher than 67

00:03:00.962 --> 00:03:02.302
then that means you could have thrown in

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.820
more 67s in there, but
this number's just right.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.624
It's lower but our remainder is less than,

00:03:08.624 --> 00:03:12.063
is less than 67, so let's keep going.

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:14.617
So now we can bring down,

00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:17.477
we can bring down the 1

00:03:17.477 --> 00:03:19.568
and we see 67 goes into 201,

00:03:19.568 --> 00:03:20.793
well we just figured that out.

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:24.695
67 goes into 201 three times, three times.

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:27.678
3 times 7 is one, carry the 2,

00:03:27.678 --> 00:03:28.723
gotta make sure we don't...

00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:30.824
Well, if we're doing the
same problem as we did before

00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:34.257
but it's good to not have
the previous 2 there,

00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:36.002
sometimes you might want to erase it.

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:39.449
Then you have 3 times
6 is 18 plus 2 is 20.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.435
And now you subtract, and we are done

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.581
because we have no remainder

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:48.185
and there's nothing
here left to bring down.

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:49.550
And so

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.754
22.11 divided by 67 is...

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:55.075
And we can throw a 0 here
just for good measure.

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:57.757
It's 0.33.

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:02.598
0.33, this is equal to 0.33.

00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:06.786
Or this is equal to 0.33.

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:08.026
And we're done.
