00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.230
Determine the six
trigonometric ratios

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.420
for angle A in the
right triangle below.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
So this right over here is
angle A, it's at vertex A.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.650
And to help me remember
the definitions of the trig

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.620
ratios-- and these are human
constructed definitions that

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.790
have ended up being very,
very useful for analyzing

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.070
a whole series of
things in the world.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.030
To help me remember them, I
use the words soh cah toa.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.260
Let me write that down.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.610
Soh cah toa.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.360
Sometimes you can think
of it as one word,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.800
but it's really the three parts
that define at least three

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.060
of the trig functions for you.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.518
And then we can
get the other three

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:44.550
by looking at the first three.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.940
So soh tells us that sine of an
angle-- in this case it's sine

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.030
of A-- so sine of A is equal
to the opposite, that's the O,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.010
over the hypotenuse.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.379
Well in this context, what is
the opposite side to angle A?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
Well, we go across the triangle,
it opens up onto side BC.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.500
It has length 12.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.130
So that is the opposite side.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.260
So, this is going
to be equal to 12.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.830
And what's the hypotenuse?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.950
Well, the hypotenuse is the
longest side of the triangle.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.390
It's opposite the
90 degree angle.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.580
And so we go opposite
the 90 degree angle,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.270
longest side is side AB.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.350
It has length 13.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.610
So this right over
here is the hypotenuse.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.870
So, the sine of A is 12/13.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.270
Now let's go to cah.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.950
Cah defines cosine for us.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.340
It tells us that cosine of
an angle-- in this case,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.600
cosine of A-- is equal
to the adjacent side

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.490
to the angle over
the hypotenuse.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.970
So, what's the adjacent
side to angle A?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.074
Well, if we look
at angle A, there

00:01:58.074 --> 00:01:59.490
are two sides that
are next to it.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.930
One of them is the hypotenuse.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.410
The other one has length 5.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.800
The adjacent one is side CA.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200
So it's 5.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.729
And what is the hypotenuse?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.320
Well, we've already
figure that out.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.736
The hypotenuse is
right over here,

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:14.190
it's opposite the
90 degree angle.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.023
It's the longest side
of the right triangle.

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:17.480
It has length 13.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.565
So the cosine of A is 5/13.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:21.000
And let me label this.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
This right over here
is the adjacent side.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.720
And this is all
specific to angle A.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.150
The hypotenuse would be the
same regardless of what angle

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.120
you pick, but the
opposite and the adjacent

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.710
is dependent on
the angle that we

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.620
choose in the right triangle.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.560
Now let's go to toa.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.590
Toa defines tangent for us.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.050
It tells us that the
tangent of an angle

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:50.020
is equal to the opposite
side over the adjacent side.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.560
So given this definition,
what is the tangent of A?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.350
Well, the opposite side,
we already figured out,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.380
has length 12.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.560
And the adjacent side,
we already figure out,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.940
has length 5.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.720
So the tangent of A, which
is opposite over adjacent,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.250
is 12/5.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.850
Now, we'll go the to the
other three trig ratios, which

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.479
you could think of
as the reciprocals

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.520
of these right over here.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.760
But I'll define it.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320
So first you have cosecant.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.440
And cosecant, it's always
a little bit unintuitive

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.840
why cosecant is the
reciprocal of sine of A,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.320
even though it starts
with a co like cosine.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.000
But, cosecant is the
reciprocal of the sine of A.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.190
So sine of A is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.570
Cosecant of A is
hypotenuse over opposite.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.690
And so what's the hypotenuse
over the opposite?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.230
Well, the hypotenuse is 13
and the opposite side is 12.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.920
And notice that 13/12 is
the reciprocal of 12/13.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.006
Now, secant of A
is the reciprocal.

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.880
So instead of being
adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.950
which we got from the
cah part of soh cah toa,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.880
it's hypotenuse over adjacent.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.880
So what is the secant of A?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.470
Well, the hypotenuse, we've
figured out multiple times

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.220
already, is 13.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.415
And what is the adjacent side?

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.070
It's 5.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.270
So it's 13/5, which
is, once again,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.130
the reciprocal of the
cosine of A, 5/13.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.790
Finally, let's
get the cotangent.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.880
And the cotangent is the
reciprocal of tangent of A.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.720
Instead of being
opposite over adjacent,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.560
it is adjacent over opposite.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.180
So what is the cotangent of A?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.510
Well, we've figured
out the adjacent side

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.060
multiple times for
angle A. It's length 5.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.690
And the opposite side
to angle A is 12.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.480
So it's 5/12, which is,
once again, the reciprocal

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.420
of the tangent of
A, which is 12/5.
