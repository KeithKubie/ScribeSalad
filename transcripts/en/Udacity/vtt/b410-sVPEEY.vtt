00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.450
The concept of bad smells. What are bad smells? Well, we

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.700
mentioned earlier that refactoring is typically applied when there is something

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.130
that does not look right, does not feel right in the

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.260
code. And that's exactly what bad smells are. Bad smells, or

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.320
code smells if you wish, are symptoms in the code of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.868
a program that might indicate deeper problems. So there might be

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:21.775
parts of my system, classes in my systems, that just don't

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.309
smell right, and it feels like there's, there might be something wrong

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.010
with them. And if you are an experienced developer just like Brad,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.320
you'll be able to figure out there is something wrong with the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.950
classes. You'll be able to smell that there's something wrong and you'll

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.880
do something about it. And I want to mention one more, just to make

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.270
sure that we're all on the same page here. That these bad

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.070
smells are usually not bugs and don't prevent the program from functioning. They

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.190
however indicate weaknesses in the design of the system that might cause

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.480
problems during maintenance. In other words,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.440
they might make the code less maintainable,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.650
harder to understand, and so on. Just like refactorings,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.610
there's also many possible different bad smells. So what

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.160
I'm providing here is just a possible list of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.190
some very common bad smells. And you can find plenty

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.349
of information on this online. So what I want

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.910
to do next is just to cover before finishing the

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.700
lesson a few of those to show you some

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.140
examples of smells and what you can do about them.
