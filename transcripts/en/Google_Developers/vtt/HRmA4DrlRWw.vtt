00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.933
Don: Obrigado por ter vindo.

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.933
Este é o painel da Venture Capital

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.700
e começamos com este [indistinct].

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.667
E tenho tres pessoas destacadas aquí

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:22.067
para responder às nossas perguntas.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:27.233
Espero ter um pouco de tempo no final
para voces fazerem umas perguntas

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.400
e para as painelistas responderem.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.433
Vou fazer isso um pouquinho diferente.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.300
Vou fazer as perguntas em inglês,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.667
mas vão responder em português

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:45.400
para que voces entendam melhor
o que vão dizer.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.200
Bem, para mim vai ser um desafio

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.300
porque não falo português, 
mas está bom.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.800
É melhor assim.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.033
Vamos começar com as apresentações.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.133
Se cada um de voces pode se apresentar --

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.200
dois minutos -- o que é que você faz.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.100
Alex: Well, my name is Alex Tabor.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.500
I'm Brazilian, 
but I grew up overseas,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.400
That's why my accent is strange.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.500
I grew up in Asia, India,
Pakistan, Indonesia, [inaudible].

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.600
I studied in California, 
Los Angeles, the United States.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.933
I graduated in 2003.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:33.167
I came to Brazil to [inaudible]
to begin [inaudible]

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:38.167
we solved internet systems problems
for large companies

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.100
in the United States and in England

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.900
and then we worked for a business
called Power Media;

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.500
that had outside power [inaudible] or
[inaudible] that was real big at the time

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.733
and we were growing with
the wave of social networks.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:03.867
We raised the investment of [?FJ],

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.500
one of the biggest Venture Capital 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.467
businesses in the United States [inaudible].

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:13.300
And we left there... I learned a lot there

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.133
[inaudible], architecture, scalable
software, email-delivered billing.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:24.167
All of the parts of the internet 
came out of there. And with 

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.000
a friend of mine, Júlio Vasconcelos,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.200
we decided to set up an internet company
for the domestic market

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.533
here in Brazil.
We tested out several ideas.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:41.067
We developed some pilot programs
to check whether the idea was viable,

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:46.500
and we ended up making Fisherbun
that grew a lot in 7 months.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.667
We now have 200 employees.

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:58.567
... one of the biggest websites here in Brazil
now [inaudible] is growing quickly.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.267
Eric: My name is Eric Archer.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:04.100
I'm one of the founding partners 
of Monacir Capital,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.433
It's a Venture Capital business
in the beginning stages.

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:12.800
We focus on investments for businesses
that are starting in the consumer sectors

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.333
of the internet

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:18.867
consumer services using the internet,

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:21.733
and educational technologies.

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:24.700
We focus on these two sectors.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.433
We founded [Monacir] in 2005.

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:30.200
We began to invest at the end of 2006.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.000
Now we have a portfolio
of 10 investments;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.433
and we believe that we are in 
an exciting time in Brazil: 

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:46.900
the creation of new businesses
in venture capital.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.767
My background:

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:51.433
I worked at [inaudible] for a while,
in the 15th Strategic Advisory

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:55.533
here in Brazil and in the U.S. 
then I worked at General Atlantic,

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:59.100
which is a venture capital 
and private equity business...

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.233
it does both.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:03.267
While I worked there
I did both things.

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:06.633
I also had [inaudible]
several businesses invested

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.733
in the internet, ETrade, Priceline

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:12.633
[inaudible] at the time [inaudible]
first assistance.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:15.867
And it was there at General Atlantic
working in the U.S.

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:18.400
that I realized that what I wanted 
to do was initial stages,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.933
venture capital, initial stages
are two very different markets.

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:23.433
they are [investment] businesses

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:29.533
that are beginning to invest 
in already-established [inaudible].

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:31.867
The opportunity that we see 
here today.

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:33.767
then I came back to Brazil.

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:38.467
my partner and I, Fabrício,
created Monacir

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:42.867
and since then, I've been doing [inaudible].

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.733
Humberto: Good afternoon. My
name is Humberto Matsuda.

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:49.800
I'm a partner in Performing Investments

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.900
a venture capital firm

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.233
that has almost two [inaudible]
to connect to businesses,

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:58.267
with [inaudible] connect bigger

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:00.900
and all the activity I am responsible for
investments

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.767
and small businesses and medium-
sized businesses

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.900
and start-ups,
uh,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.167
Our main characteristic is that 
we don't invest in only 

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:12.100
very small businesses,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.767
lots of times still on paper or an idea

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:17.967
but we help cultivate and
build the business. This is a 

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:19.967
model where we begin a business

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:21.667
independently from investments;

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:26.267
and it can be any business 
to create a business model.

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.033
To shape its product,

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:31.967
identify the principle characteristics
of the business

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:35.167
it wants to develop,
what it wants to have the future.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:38.933
Help design the business plan
and at the same time

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.600
if the business manages to aquire
these characteristics,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.633
we invest up to $5 million reais 
in each business.

00:05:46.633 --> 00:05:50.133
Our focus in investing today
isn't limited to 

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:51.333
information;

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.667
but we also invest
in biotechnology

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.600
nanotechnology, medical applications

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.267
infra-[inaudible] technology, and we've
done a lot of interactive

00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:04.600
and creative work with businesses.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.767
We prefer to 

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:10.733
[inaudible] is always the time
that a business is going to define

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:13.400
what it will do,
how it wants to work

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.167
so in that sense, we have 
an actionable [inaudible] moment.

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:20.033
We help build the business,

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:23.600
and at the same time 
provide financial resources

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.200
and a series of services to help
the business grow, from lawyers

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.367
accountants [ ] business marketing,
public relations...

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:32.333
And, once successful,

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:38.767
later even working to find investors

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:44.667
and consequently strengthening 
the project long before

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.867
it begins [inaudible].

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:51.800
Don: Está bom. Tenho
ums fones de ouvido aquí

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.233
para que eu possa entender
o que dizem desde o descanso.

00:06:56.233 --> 00:07:01.933
Eric, antes falamos de 
empreendedores diferentes.

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:08.533
Então o empresário de alto impacto e
o com um negócio tipo estilo de vida.

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:10.433
Você pode explicar o que quer dizer?

00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:15.167
Quais são as diferenças e
quais voce aconselha?

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.733
Eric: We talked about...

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:20.333
before this panel,

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:24.433
when we talked a little about
types of entrepreneurs,

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:27.067
because when you talk about
entrepreneurs,

00:07:27.067 --> 00:07:28.367
we talk a lot in Brazil

00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:30.533
that the leading [inaudible] entrepreneurs,

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.367
entrepreneurs want 
to be entrepreneurs

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:36.333
the beginning of an interesting cycle
where people are very [inaudible]

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:39.333
to be entrepreneurs as a viable
alternative on this road,

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.367
that never was, never happened in Brazil.

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:44.000
And that's a plus,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.300
the venture capital industry will only 
exist if we have good entrepreneurs.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.467
so our chat revolved around
those questions

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:56.000
we say entrepreneurs
like it was an umbrella.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.733
Something like... like all entrepreneurs
are the same kind.

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:02.367
And the work at Venture Capital-

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:06.500
our work in looking for 
investment opportunities-

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.233
is to look for the right teams
the right coaches,

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:12.000
and to do that we have to

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.133
we use our perspective with
respect to kinds of entrepreneurs

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.133
segments of entrepreneurs.

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:22.333
and it's very important that here we have
different entrepreneurs this time

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:24.767
... thinking about ...

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:27.400
you always would complain about
that type of entrepreneur [inaudible].

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400
Because, depending on the type
of entrepreneur that you are,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.333
you'll work and build
a certain kind of business

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.100
and that business can be compatible
with a Venture Capital investment

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.467
or not.

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:44.400
That first generic segment 
of lifestyle and high impact ones:

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.900
there's no problem with the 
entrepreneur interested in lifestyle,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.133
or entrepreneurs interested in
a high-impact lifestyle.

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:55.133
It's neither right nor wrong;
they're just two different things.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:58.267
An entrepreneur working on
lifestyle doesn't necessarily

00:08:58.267 --> 00:08:59.767
want to change the world;

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:04.600
he wants to have a good business
that offers a high-quality product 

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.500
or service that grows;

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.833
but he doesn't necessarily want 
to create a million-dollar business.

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:16.000
He'll be happy if it earns 
10 or 20 million and gets a

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.567
a good profit return 
for the partners

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:23.000
and he won't necessarily have
that truly personal incentive 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.533
to grow the business

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:27.333
to make the business grow.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:27.767
But it's interesting.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.233
We have to... I think there are great
entrepreneurs of that kind

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:33.467
in Brazil; they [inaudible]
their [inaudible].

00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:37.033
Now, an entrepreneur 
that Venture Capital is looking for

00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:39.833
is a high-impact entrepreneur,

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:42.633
an entrepreneur that
wants to revolutionize the market.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.867
He wants to build a great business

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.600
and structurally change the market,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.967
how the market works.

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:54.667
[inaudible] change through its product,
 or even its impact 

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:58.300
on millions of people's lives

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.300
and create a very large business.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.800
Because Venture Capital's risk
the investor

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.100
the extra finance that's invested 
in this initial stage 

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.900
has to be balanced against 
a disproportional return.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.133
That risk is disproportional.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.533
And then what happens?

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:16.900
The high impact entrepreneur,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.800
is the one who will align himself
with the venture capital investor.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.167
And that alignment of the business,
at its foundation, if you analyze

00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:25.933
the businesses that work out....

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:29.000
with the entrepreneur-investor
relationship...

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.233
are businesses where
that alignment is very close.

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:35.800
Where the investors and entrepreneurs

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.067
think the same way,
with the same objectives.

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:41.467
That want to build the same thing,

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:44.400
and get out of the investment
at the same time.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.567
So both sides -

00:10:46.567 --> 00:10:49.967
this is an important message -
we here,

00:10:49.967 --> 00:10:52.433
Humberto talked about this, too-

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:54.967
but when we talk
with teams

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:56.667
and meet entrepreneurs
you have to understand

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:57.800
spending time with them

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.567
to see if it makes sense
to do some kind of investment.

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:02.933
The same thing is important
on the part of the entrepreneur

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:07.067
because he...
he also does his own job

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.733
to find out if this is the kind of investor

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:11.900
that wants for his business
that is really everything

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.167
and it's a [inaudible] road.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:20.567
Don: Então, Humberto, você investe
nos empresários de estágio inicial? 

00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:25.300
É claro para eles que quando você
começa que estarão num negócio

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.000
ou num negócio de lifestyle?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.033
Você ajuda eles?

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.900
Humberto: In reality, no
one day, we

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.900
in spite of the fact that Eric posed
that question very well...

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.033
in practice, it's very difficult

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:42.900
to separate those two characteristics
talking with someone for 5 minutes.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.467
In the process of analysis,
we focus mainly 

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:51.167
on the people involved.

00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:52.100
Eric and I, both, 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.467
we won't... we'll avoid investing

00:11:55.467 --> 00:12:00.367
in projects where the people involved
don't have those qualities,

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:04.633
that drive to create something
really revolutionary...

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:10.200
but simply talking about
the essence of one or the other

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.333
is much easier than clearly
identifying those qualities in people.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.200
Because lots of times

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.333
the entrepreneur himself doesn't know

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:23.433
what kind of entrepreneur he is.
And the analysis of the market,

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:24.633
the analysis of its potential,

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:31.500
making projections, are ways to evaluate
those matters that border on art.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.700
They aren't necessarily
exact sciences.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.033
So when we begin
to work with a company

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:39.867
we have to see some potential,

00:12:39.867 --> 00:12:41.967
but not necessarily 
that that business is going to 

00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:45.800
be successful, or reach a degree of
certainty that that's possible;

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.867
and that's why we begin
to work with businesses

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.900
even before knowing 
if we are going to invest in them.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.033
When a business attains 
these qualities

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:55.800
that's when Performa's funds invest.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.067
But if a business doesn't attain
those qualities,

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:01.200
it's also not necessarily
a problem.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.167
That just means that while it doesn't have
all the qualities we're looking for,

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:09.067
the investement, per se,
won't happen.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:13.167
So from the perspecitve
of the practice of what we do,

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.800
we try to work with a business
for the longest time possible

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.900
and available, because

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.133
the truth is that 
our scarcest resource is time.

00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:23.867
So we have to optimize

00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:26.733
and allocate this time 
in an efficient way.

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:31.067
We end up having to take care of 
building the business

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:34.133
building up the credit
that the fund wants to invest...

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:37.233
in a way that it will acquire
those qualities.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.533
If the company can't do that,

00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:42.700
that also doesn't mean that
it's a bad business.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.967
It only means that there's a disconnect
between Venture Capital's business

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:48.900
and that company's business.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.067
If there's that disconnect,
it's an example of what

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:53.533
Eric talked about, a lack of alignment.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.167
And that's the worst scenario
for any type of investment...

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:57.133
to get out there,

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:59.067
after money was put into the company,

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:01.433
after we've spent a lot of time
one, two...

00:14:01.433 --> 00:14:03.467
three years working together,

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.633
and to discover that 
we don't want the same thing.

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.267
That's the surest factor
for an unsuccessful investment.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.300
Don: Então, Alex, você já foi
empreendedor algumas vezes.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.100
Foram seus primeiros esforços
os que diríamos

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.900
mais pequenos, ou um tipo lifestyle
e depois, de mais alto impacto?

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:30.333
É possível ser um empreendedor
lifestyle e de alto impacto ao mesmo tempo?

00:14:30.867 --> 00:14:33.267
Alex: Yes! I think that it all
depends on the opportunity.

00:14:33.267 --> 00:14:36.000
And I also... if you find a good idea
to follow up on,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.333
to develop,
to make it grow quickly,

00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:43.600
you go after it and make it happen.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.033
When I started
I didn't have experience.

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:49.600
I didn't know enough to 
manage taking care of all the aspects

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.067
of an internet network.

00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:56.900
So I began first with costing
and I learned several things, platform

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.733
and software, 
working on a team.

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:02.933
These things are important,

00:15:02.933 --> 00:15:07.633
but for a web business today
there are complicated things

00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:11.133
and it's good to examine deeply
a little before

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.167
starting a business - in the field.

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:16.633
I mentioned email,
delivery building...

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:21.433
It's very complicated if you don't know
how to scale your software...

00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:24.367
to be able to double, 
and double, and double

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:27.100
many times without having to 
rebuild everything.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.533
It's difficult to grow
at a fast pace.

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:35.800
My second experience
was not as an entrepreneur

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.067
who started a company.

00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:39.500
I joined one that already
had 50 employees.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.167
I helped with the venture around
but I...

00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:45.600
the best thing about my participation
in that company...

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.767
was that I managed to work with
infrastructure, software, and email.

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:52.967
All of those parts -

00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:55.067
in order to be ready when I left

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:58.033
to begin my company,

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:02.233
to be ready to anticipate
and prepare for everything,

00:16:02.233 --> 00:16:06.000
for all those problems I'd face

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.867
So that's why it's important
to first educate yourself well

00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:15.833
and later join with someone
who is good at sales, marketing.

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.033
With only 2 people --

00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:21.067
you can even have 3, if you call in
another technical friend.

00:16:21.067 --> 00:16:24.967
If you manage to develop
a low-cost pilot program

00:16:24.967 --> 00:16:28.133
you can really bank on 
a business like that

00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:33.100
on the internet these days it's 
very cheap to start a new product

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.133
to create a new product.

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:37.133
So I think the best thing
is to sit there,

00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:40.233
and develop something tangible 
that brings results;

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:45.067
and that you can measure its impact
and see that it can really grow a lot,

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.700
and that's when you should
go there and look for capital

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.933
to hire more people and
buy advertising.

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:54.233
Build up more infrastructure

00:16:54.233 --> 00:16:56.867
if, at that time, you've proven
your set-up

00:16:56.867 --> 00:17:01.633
you should go get the money
to invest in it, and make...

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.867
and make it grow as fast as possible.

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:11.367
Don: Então nos Estados Unidos, os
startups tem um sócio técnico

00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:15.400
e um sócio de negócios ou marketing.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.233
Então você é um sócio técnico,

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:20.867
Como encontrou seu sócio de negócios?

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:25.500
Ou, para o pessoal da audiencia
que provavelment são técnicos

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.300
como encontram outro sócio
para trabalhar junto com eles?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.433
Alex: Well, it's very easy.

00:17:31.433 --> 00:17:33.867
You're sitting on a plane
there's a guy sitting next to you,

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:36.667
and you talk to him
ha ha ha.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.233
That's how I met Júlio
ha ha ha

00:17:39.233 --> 00:17:42.333
I never talk with anyone on planes
but in that case...

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:44.667
by chance 
we began to chat

00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:47.133
and he grew up in 
many places, like I did.

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.600
We were studying at Stanford
with several of 

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.033
my childhood friends.

00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:54.167
We got to be friends
and kept talking.

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.167
So the first tip is this

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.033
talk to the guy next to you
ha ha ha.

00:17:58.033 --> 00:18:00.100
on the plane. But speaking seriously,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.967
a way to make contacts
through the...

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:08.267
the faculty is a great place
to make them.

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:09.733
Also at work.

00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:13.000
Thre are people in the same company
who have other qualities,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.433
you get along well with them
and that's very important.

00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:17.933
One thing is to find the right person

00:18:17.933 --> 00:18:20.933
another is that you have to
get along with each other.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:23.800
Because you're going spend long nights

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.133
working every day together
for many months. 

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:30.233
So you have to be
not only a competent person

00:18:30.233 --> 00:18:35.767
but you have to 
get along well together.

00:18:37.067 --> 00:18:41.067
Don: Vamos dizer que tenho uma
ideia ótima para um negócio.

00:18:41.067 --> 00:18:42.533
Como vou encontrar você?

00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:45.133
Como você sabe aonde estou?

00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.967
Ou como vou chegar para você?

00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:55.267
Eric: That's a matter of...

00:18:55.267 --> 00:19:00.467
It's really important to understand that
there are many more opportunities

00:19:00.467 --> 00:19:04.000
or ther are many more
entrepreneurs looking for funding

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.700
looking for funding

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.667
than
mainly in Brazil

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:11.167
than companies looking
to invest.

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:13.433
I think it's a rule
anywhere.

00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:20.333
The Venture Capital business has to
be very efficient with their time.

00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:25.033
The only resource we have
is time, is time on the team.

00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:28.000
So we have to 
shoot on target.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.167
And go after opportunities
that make sense.

00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:36.167
We'd love to meet as many
entrepreneurs as possible,

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:37.267
but if we stop and say, 

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:40.833
no, let's put
an ad in a newspaper

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:41.667
put up a website

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:46.467
take all 
business plans

00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:48.233
that doesn't work for us.

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:52.167
So,
we specifically

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:54.033
have a very proactive strategy

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:58.467
of going after businesses
that we think

00:19:58.467 --> 00:19:59.467
are interesting.

00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:02.167
We keep our eyes open
we stay tuned in to the market

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.433
to maket sectors
that we like.

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:07.800
We follow the movements
in those market sectors.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.333
and we try to meet with
business entrepreneurs

00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:13.133
that we see potential in

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:17.000
soon thereafter. I think that the art
of Venture Capital is that you go after it;

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.167
you are proactive.

00:20:19.167 --> 00:20:22.500
Because if you stay in the office
and say I'm going to hold or

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.033
have meetings with 
500 entrepreneurs each month

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.833
that's not how you'll find
the best opportunities.

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:30.200
We tend to,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.267
our strategy is 
is not, let's say,

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.733
low-profile

00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:42.267
of us not being
really exposed.

00:20:42.267 --> 00:20:43.233
Because we understand

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:45.933
that entrepreneurs have
few alternatives in Brazil.

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:47.033
So we go after them.

00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:49.100
A typical case is the case of Bobox,

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.800
which is one of the businesses
in our portfolio

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.100
we met Botox at 
TechCrunch in 2007.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.433
Marco Gomes' project came out of it

00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:57.733
It was the first Brazilian company -

00:20:57.733 --> 00:20:59.967
maybe it was the second -
I can never remember...

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.733
but I think it was the first company,

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:04.400
or Brazilian project, that
came out of TechCrunch.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.233
We'd already been following TechCrunch

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:08.100
When we saw 
what came out of that company,

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.533
it was a little like
who are these guys?

00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:10.600
Let's get to know them.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.100
We called, it was a project
that Marco Gomes

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.467
and his partner at the time
were working off-hours on.

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:18.367
We followed up, talked,
we liked them a lot,

00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:20.400
and we made the investment.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.033
We're extra happy
with that investment.

00:21:22.033 --> 00:21:26.233
That was a very typical example
of what we like to do.

00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:26.933
With the message,

00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:29.733
I'd say, to an entrepreneur

00:21:29.733 --> 00:21:33.567
who wants to talk to
Venture Capital, really,

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:36.200
the best route is 
to do good work.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.800
Today, entry costs

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.700
the cost for you to set up
a product is low

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.833
on the internet, I'm saying -

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:45.067
There are other sectors
where it's different.

00:21:45.067 --> 00:21:46.967
But to do good work,

00:21:46.967 --> 00:21:50.133
To put your company in place
or to set up your product

00:21:50.133 --> 00:21:55.333
to get working
you'll attract the attention of

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:57.033
of the Venture Capitals -

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:58.333
if you do good work.

00:21:58.333 --> 00:21:59.367
That's the best way.

00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:02.067
Or through a qualified network
that you know,

00:22:02.067 --> 00:22:04.167
or that someone can point you to.

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.967
Normally, cold calls -

00:22:06.967 --> 00:22:09.000
Calls to try 
to demonstrate something

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.233
without one of these two things

00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:13.533
there's a lot less efficiency
on both sides.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.433
Don: Então, Humberto,
você trabalha com as fases iniciais

00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:19.400
das empresas.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.900
Como é que você encontra eles
ou eles encontram você?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.133
Humberto: In our case, it was

00:22:26.133 --> 00:22:28.867
from the point of view 
of financing, specifically

00:22:28.867 --> 00:22:32.367
it's very much like the way 
Monarchis works.

00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:35.000
But before the financing,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.033
there's the process 
of structuring the business

00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:40.000
so that we can invest.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.067
So at that point
at that point specifically,

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:47.967
it's obviously difficult for us
to identify a project

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.400
when it's still on paper

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.300
when it's an idea
or just a PowerPoint.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.433
What do we do then?

00:22:54.433 --> 00:22:56.500
We try to respond,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.800
listen to as many initiatives
as possible 

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.133
that come into contact
with us in the following way.

00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:06.000
We get our bearings and beg
for the love of God

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.300
that the entrepreneurs
know a little bit more

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.533
about the investors
they want to talk to.

00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:14.933
If you know the kind of investor
you need

00:23:14.933 --> 00:23:16.900
what kind of investor you want

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.500
right away you begin 
to see the differences between

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.400
funding X and funding Y, 
the management, and so on.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.500
Understanding if...

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.500
if you first need an investment fund
or an angel investor

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.600
will really make your life easier.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.400
So, I'm going to change
the question a bit,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.467
and answer this way.

00:23:35.467 --> 00:23:38.267
What can I do to raise
the money I want?

00:23:38.267 --> 00:23:39.933
Well, first you have to
have an idea,

00:23:39.933 --> 00:23:42.733
a viable project,
something interesting.

00:23:42.733 --> 00:23:46.633
Second, you have to know
what kind of money you want.

00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:49.033
The characteristics of funding
like Performer

00:23:49.033 --> 00:23:52.367
or like Monacir
is really specific.

00:23:52.367 --> 00:23:54.500
You're going to talk to
another managing group

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.800
that will probably be looking 
at different things

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.567
at different markets

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:00.433
at different-sized companies.

00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:01.067
Don't you think?

00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:04.167
But there are some things
that every investor looks for:

00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:06.067
things like scalability,

00:24:06.067 --> 00:24:08.567
a very good team of entrepreneurs

00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:11.567
a market big and relevant enough

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:14.367
so that we can be sure
that it will grow a lot

00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:17.500
and it'll be a good way 
to make a lot of money.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.600
At the end of the day, we invest in
what we're looking to invest in.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.100
That is, we have 
an investment theory

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.700
we look for opportunities that fit into
that investment theory.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:34.767
So if your company or project fits into
our investment theory,

00:24:34.767 --> 00:24:38.100
you're going to have to find a way
to get in touch with us.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.733
It's events like these

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:42.567
you can look for me at the exit
and pick up a card.

00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:45.033
You can look for 
business plan competions

00:24:45.033 --> 00:24:47.833
so you can show up where 
we're always looking

00:24:47.833 --> 00:24:50.100
always trying to participate.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.267
And clearly, there's 
a whole universe

00:24:52.267 --> 00:24:55.767
of universities where there's always

00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:58.567
a group of people
working with incubators

00:24:58.567 --> 00:25:01.400
in the process of setting up companies-

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.900
lots of times entrepreneur workgroups
to create companies.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.567
And we're always looking
and searching.

00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:13.667
So if you don't know anyone directly
related to us

00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:16.933
or if you project still
isn't ready to be...

00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:21.233
to be visible where we'll see it
on the internet, in the media,

00:25:21.233 --> 00:25:22.867
or some place like that,

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:24.600
you're going to have to try 
to talk to us.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.433
And then you'll have to have 
a well-built arguement

00:25:28.433 --> 00:25:30.800
a minimum plan of action.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.333
I'm not saying a 
complete business plan;

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:37.567
It's that you have a document where
you can explain to me what you want,

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:38.733
what you have

00:25:38.733 --> 00:25:40.867
and what you hope to get.

00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:46.667
And bring this
in a way that

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:48.700
it's attractive to the investor.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.367
the art of Levit Peach.

00:25:50.367 --> 00:25:52.067
You have to know how
to sell your product

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:54.467
even when 
it's not yet ready.

00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:57.300
If you aren't able 
to make the sales pitch,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.700
it's going to be real difficult to get
someone's attention. Like Eric said

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.833
in the traditional channels
of passive reception

00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:06.500
we get hundreds

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.600
thousands of projects all the time.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.267
And if you can't quickly demonstrate
that there's a difference,

00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:13.200
that there's a different opportunity,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.000
unfortunately, we're not going to
have time to read a lot of things -

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.900
and realize this at the end of day.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.600
Bom, temos mais 10 minutos

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.767
e gostaría que vocês fizessem
perguntas se tiverem.

00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:30.033
Tem um microfone aquí.

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:31.767
Não consigo ver muito bem,

00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:35.433
então vou dar o microfone para
uma pessoa para fazer a pergunta.

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:36.000
Aonde quiser.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.100
Tem um aquí na frente

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.133
Alô?

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:42.467
Está bom. Use o meu.

00:26:43.967 --> 00:26:46.567
Da audiência #1: Devo perguntar 
em inglês ou em português?

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:47.400
Dom: Inglês!

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.600
Que?
Não, português é melhor.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.867
audience #1: OK.

00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:55.100
About exporting a project 
the the internet to gain visibility

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.867
to eventually prove a concept,

00:26:57.867 --> 00:27:00.867
How can we deal with the fact
that exporting

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:02.300
the project and proving the concept

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.333
elevates the risk of a business
being copied tremendously,

00:27:07.333 --> 00:27:10.900
due to the fact of sometimes being 
very different from what exists?

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.500
Humberto: Oh! There are two things
there we have to separate...

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.467
one thing is when you have an idea.

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:19.000
The other is when you already 
have a business.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.300
When your company--

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.500
already structured--

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.833
is working,

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.633
it's going to make noise on the internet.

00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.267
That's the kind of visibility we have

00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:29.967
when we're investing 
in an early-stage setup;

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:32.100
in other words, the business
has begun to work,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.333
it's still not perfect,

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:35.633
sometimes the product isn't rounded out

00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:39.233
but there's already a very clear 
business opportunity.

00:27:39.233 --> 00:27:43.267
It's another thing when
you're there on a project,

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:46.500
working on an idea,
getting a team together;

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.000
and then it's much more complicated
without a doubt.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.367
It's one thing having a project run,

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:52.100
you've already put your foot to the ground

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.233
you've started up your work model

00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:59.333
the whole market is watching
the work of a business

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:02.900
that makes it much easier 
to finally protect that risk.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.333
There's a natural competition
in any market,

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:08.200
but there's already some work
developing,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.733
you're already exercising your
competitive will,

00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:14.067
your first mover's advantage
for example.

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:16.400
When you are still 
in the development stage,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.633
obviously, you're not going to be
announcing to everyone,

00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:21.500
Look, I've got an idea
I don't know how I'm going to do it,

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.100
but I want to capitalize on it.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.200
So what can you do then?

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.733
If you structure it first,
develop that idea

00:28:28.733 --> 00:28:32.167
and then find a way to contact --

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:36.233
if you need, in effect, 
money before --

00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:38.300
in other words,
you need an investor.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.900
Now, probably, if you are not
at that stage,

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.700
you'll need an investor

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.333
or the money that you need
to make it happen;

00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:49.467
you could probably raise it
from your family

00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:53.200
from your friends or, eventually, 
an angel investor.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.367
They're very different models, aren't they?

00:28:55.367 --> 00:29:00.633
Alex: So our website launches 
new copy every day.

00:29:00.633 --> 00:29:04.033
Literally, every day something else
hits the airwaves.

00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:06.867
And we've benefitted a lot
by being first movers.

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:08.900
We've gotten
a lot of visibility.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.033
It would take millions of reais
for to get that kind of visibility.

00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:15.733
So, first pull your team together.

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:17.433
You and one or two people.

00:29:17.433 --> 00:29:20.267
Get something working
something that's worth putting there.

00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:23.400
Someone is going to put money into it
because it's working

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.267
and there it is

00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:26.900
it's a good team, 
people will invest.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.967
They'll be interested in it.

00:29:27.967 --> 00:29:30.433
Then you run
as fast as you can

00:29:30.433 --> 00:29:32.867
don't stop when night falls

00:29:32.867 --> 00:29:36.400
don't sleep, keep on going
7 days a week. Don't stop.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.967
Then you'll start contracting, too.

00:29:37.967 --> 00:29:40.767
You have to grab
the best people at the start,

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:44.333
because as you grow, you have to
establish a very good ethic

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:50.133
a very high level of professionalism
that we're always after

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:53.900
and, please, we're contracting
all levels of developers

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.600
with experience in DBA, infrastructure.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.433
Send your resumé
to carreiras@[fisherbano],

00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:02.867
because we're very interested
and we're contracting lots of people.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.000
Eric: Let me finish up quickly.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.133
I think there's something
very important.

00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:13.400
Ideas are a commodity.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.433
What's important is execution.

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:19.300
An idea is good,
it gives you a little advantage.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.100
But like Alex said,
you're going to have to make it happen.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.267
You always have to improve it.

00:30:24.267 --> 00:30:27.400
And, on the internet,
the more innovative your idea,

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.600
you can be sure

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.267
that nobody will copy it

00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:33.000
if you can't prove 
that it's a business model. Nobody

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.733
wants to copy a business
that's not yet proven

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:38.500
You have some time at the start
the more innovative you are.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.267
The more you've copied
an existing concept,

00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:45.167
the more competition you'll have.

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:46.933
you have to be confident in yourself,

00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:50.400
and put together a team 
that has the skills,

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.467
the necessary abilities
to make it happen well.

00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:55.833
And doing that
I mean its execution.

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:58.267
In the same way,

00:30:58.267 --> 00:31:00.867
capital is also a commodity,
money is a commodity.

00:31:00.867 --> 00:31:02.300
You have to see what comes with it,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.900
what kind of investor
you're bringing to your business.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.433
Ideas are also a business.
Lots of people come thinking

00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:10.433
that the idea is everything.

00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:12.933
No, an idea is the starting point.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.633
Don: Outra pergunta aí.

00:31:14.633 --> 00:31:15.700
audiencia #2: Here in the back.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.633
I wanted to ask

00:31:18.633 --> 00:31:21.667
that's not talking
if there's a forum

00:31:21.667 --> 00:31:24.033
even if it's something 
to your neighbor on a plane,

00:31:24.033 --> 00:31:28.367
that's in other countries
that doesn't exist in Brazil,

00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:29.133
I've always the problem,
for entrepreneurs to meet each other.

00:31:29.133 --> 00:31:31.767
of finding a partner
for example,

00:31:31.767 --> 00:31:34.900
so I'm not working all night
like I've done for two years,

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.833
programming by myself and saying
I can't take it anymore.

00:31:37.833 --> 00:31:40.367
I'm only going to work 8 hours a day;
that's enough.

00:31:40.367 --> 00:31:42.567
If that exists in some other country,

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.967
and if here in Brazil, 
there's something like that

00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:46.500
so that entrepreneurs can 
meet each other.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.767
exchange sketches and say
let's join forces...

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:51.567
three or four people
and work on a project?

00:31:53.867 --> 00:31:54.367
Humberto: Look...

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:58.667
something organized, 
you won't find.

00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:02.200
We, at Performer,
are starting to set up

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.200
a product to address
just that kind of problem.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.400
It's not a Performer investment fund.
It's really

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.833
a new division of Performer
where we're trying

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:19.933
to resolve this kind of problem for
those business that want to get started.

00:32:19.933 --> 00:32:23.400
If it's bringing a business partner
to someone who's technical,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.933
or an technical entrepreneur
with the opposite.

00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:29.667
So in the same way that
we'll find a short while

00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:33.200
to attract those entrepreneurs
who have a more technical profile,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.233
we'll also try to attract entrepreneurs

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:38.167
with a more commercial profile, 
more business-like

00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:41.967
to try to do some matchmaking
and see if it turns out to be

00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:44.500
an investment opportunity
for Performer.

00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:46.767
Don: Outra pergunta?

00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:50.467
audiencia #3: Humberto spoke
about significant markets.

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:59.633
I'd like to know which markets today
are important to developing software.

00:32:59.633 --> 00:33:01.333
Eric: Who are you asking?

00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:05.967
Humberto: Everyone, os dois.
Oh, good.

00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:10.200
You really have two types of judgements
to make, don't you?

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.600
Significant

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.067
you can think that in the future
it'll be an interesting business,

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:17.300
there'll be a lot of money,

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.000
or you can think about
what giant problems exist

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.433
that nobody's solved, can't you?

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.467
I think that I'd give you
advice along these lines

00:33:24.467 --> 00:33:27.800
so that you can measure it,
evaluate it.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.133
Don't think only about technology itself.

00:33:31.133 --> 00:33:34.300
Try to imagine the problem
that you want to solve

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.733
and calculate the pain that this problem
causes for your audience.

00:33:38.733 --> 00:33:41.367
You want to deliver a solution
to that problem.

00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:42.733
How much is that worth?

00:33:42.733 --> 00:33:46.200
Understanding how much trouble 
that problem is for your client

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.100
will give you an idea
of how much you can earn

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.233
fixing that problem for him.

00:33:52.433 --> 00:33:55.500
Eric: 
We have to remember,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.700
we have to make
good choices

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.200
in the maketplace, don't we?

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.800
Going back to the topic I spoke of earlier

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.000
that investors are looking for
businesses that can be large,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.900
so they have to operate
in big markets.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.267
So you have to think

00:34:08.267 --> 00:34:11.767
choose that marketplace well.

00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:16.300
Given that in Brazil you sometimes
see an idea overseas that's interesting

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.833
but it's an idea
that's tucked within a sector

00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:20.800
but that overseas sector
is very big;

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.367
For example, 
the U.S. economy is big;

00:34:22.367 --> 00:34:24.567
it's a business that has
an international reach.

00:34:24.567 --> 00:34:27.267
And when you apply that
the corresponding market in Brazil,

00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:30.700
the market...
the crux of that idea

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.100
ends up being very small 
and you'll never grow a big company.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.100
Now, you can also bet
on a trend.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.500
The risk is higher
and you can say

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.767
Look, this market doesn't exist today,

00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:40.700
but it will exist, and

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:44.000
the money will have to 
transfer from somewhere.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.500
You have to understand that dynamic.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.000
But it's important to look
not only at the product,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.700
not only at the user.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.933
Sometimes you have a business
that resolves a user's problem

00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:56.033
but doesn't have
as much economic value.

00:34:56.033 --> 00:35:02.333
That's when your business knowledge
your vision, trend analysis

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:06.700
comes into play;
both strategies.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.567
I think that entrepreneurs

00:35:07.567 --> 00:35:10.767
have a strong feeling for,
a strong intuition about these things.

00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:14.367
But you have to have that ability
on your team.

00:35:15.067 --> 00:35:16.133
Don: Temos tempo para mais uma?

00:35:16.133 --> 00:35:17.800
Mais uma pergunta.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.167
audiencia #4: Good evening.
My name is Luis Fernando.

00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:21.867
My question is that 

00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:24.967
sometimes I see a lot of people 
who want to open a business

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:28.067
but they already 
have a job.

00:35:28.067 --> 00:35:33.167
And mostly they end up
working all day and night

00:35:33.167 --> 00:35:36.000
to not leave or let go of 
their current job

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.067
because of the risk.

00:35:37.067 --> 00:35:40.933
Because opening a business 
is a risky thing, too, and the question is

00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:44.133
do you think that
that's a winning strategy

00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:47.400
or do you think that someone
should go in with head bowed,

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.533
resign their job, and dedicate 
themselves only to that?

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:53.800
Alex: I think you have to live
just like that...

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.200
Your life has to be
that business.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.700
Now, to get there
to test things out,

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.067
you can do things after work

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:07.767
you can test things out and see 
how that business will be for you.

00:36:07.767 --> 00:36:10.700
But as soon as you've decided,
that you've seen potential,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.767
you should resign and invest
100 percent in it.

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:15.933
Eric: OK, wrapping up!

00:36:15.933 --> 00:36:17.033
We, for example,

00:36:17.033 --> 00:36:19.500
don't ever consider a situation where

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.300
investing or analyzing
investment in an idea

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.067
that's part-time
for an entrepreneur.

00:36:25.067 --> 00:36:28.167
We only believe in it 
when the entrepreneur's there 100%

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:32.733
of the time, totally
dedicated to it.

00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:33.367
That's fundamental.

00:36:33.367 --> 00:36:35.533
Like Alex said
it's possible to test it out.

00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:38.767
But you'd be surprised 
how many times we've seen

00:36:38.767 --> 00:36:41.000
proposals and ideas

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.233
from groups that want to 
set up a business and still keep

00:36:43.233 --> 00:36:45.067
to control the risk
it doesn't exist.

00:36:45.067 --> 00:36:47.400
I mean,
if the entrepreneur takes a risk,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.500
Venture Capital takes the risk.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.200
He's talking about risk,
a controlled risk,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.733
a conscious risk

00:36:52.733 --> 00:36:55.067
but high risk
high return.

00:36:55.767 --> 00:36:58.900
Humberto: At the end of the day,
if you're afraid of doing it,

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.833
I'm going to be even more afraid.

00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:03.367
Now if you believe that you have

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:04.933
that it has to turn out right,

00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:06.833
I can believe that, too.

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:09.467
So, if you don't give me that guarantee

00:37:09.467 --> 00:37:13.433
that you believe in it, 
that it's going to turn out right,

00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:13.933
I'm going to say, Look,

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:16.300
come back when you're sure.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.767
Don: Está bom.
Bem, acabou o tempo.

00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:24.800
Mas estaremos aquí, lá fora, por
uma meia hora ou uma hora.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.267
Vem falar com a gente.

00:37:26.267 --> 00:37:29.300
Muito obrigado por ter vindo
e ter escutado tudo.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.133
Obrigado.

00:37:30.133 --> 00:37:35.400
[Aplausos.]
00:37:35.400,00:00:00.000
