00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:14.759
Soft robotics is a program that we've
been working on in the lab for a little

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.730
bit over a year now and what we've done
is to basically

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.179
looks to nature for inspiration
specifically organisms

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:30.160
octopi and squid, soft organisms with
the idea that these robots would have

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.230
advantages in terms of manipulation,
maneuverability, fabrications, cost, over

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.500
the traditional heart robots that most
people are familiar with one of the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.079
remarkable things that they can do
is they can actually change their

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.830
color and appearance and they do this
to

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.670
signal one another, to blend in with their
environment. We again drew on the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.570
these organisms as inspiration and
decided

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.590
that it was actually a pretty

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.080
logical evolution to try and include
some of these aspects and our robots. We

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450
think that they could be very useful for
surgeons. We're also interested in the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.460
idea that we can use to display aspect
of our work by being able to change

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.680
colors to be bright or even to glow in
the dark that could actually guy our rescue

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.690
workers  to a specific location, like a
survivor or something along those lines.
