00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Ah, the holidays,
time of cheer and joy.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.300
And aggressive
driving and road rage.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.116
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.770
Everyone, I'm Lacy.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm Tres, and the
holidays are stressful.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.870
A study by State Farm Insurance
surveyed 1,000 drivers

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.377
and found that the
holidays suck for driving.

00:00:20.377 --> 00:00:22.210
According to the results,
aggressive driving

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.030
spikes during the holidays
with 64% of second drivers

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.581
experiencing aggressive
driving six times or more

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.330
during the season.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.270
Plus, almost half admit
they drive like jerks too.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.700
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.560
says that aggressive driving
means improper lane changing,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.900
tailgating, speeding.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.830
And though cutting
people off, being a dick,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.246
and trying to steal
parking spaces

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:48.730
were not in their metrics, they
did show up in the surveys,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.525
as well as not
using turn signals.

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.380
If you think about
it, of course it's

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.900
super rude to cut someone off.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.560
But I also get
irrationally mad about it.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.616
I'm like, are you
kidding me [BLEEP]?

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:00.125
What the [BLEEP] are you doing?

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.060
And I'm not alone.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.940
90% of drivers admit to
seeing red on the road.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.200
Yea, and psychologists note that
aggressive driving is portrayed

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.500
in movies and films as
exciting, so like lane changes

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.004
that are really fast and
acceleration and car chases.

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.420
This causes people to get into
heightened emotional states

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.230
when we're driving.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.499
And experts goes as far as
to say as we're actually

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.540
emotionally impaired when
we're behind the wheel.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.030
There's a lot
going on around us.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.830
And there's a lot of
stress in operating

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.710
these kind of giant machine.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.980
And AAA says humans
are territorial.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.824
So we think of cars
as our territory.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:31.990
And we want to protect them.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.990
So we'll take it personally
when someone starts frontin'.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.650
Psychologists also
agree that cars

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.550
are kind of an
extension of our ego.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.300
Which makes sense.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.370
When I'm alone in a car,
it's an extension of me,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.410
and it gives me the
all important control.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.000
So during the holidays,
it's even more pronounced,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.580
presents to buy,
parties to attend,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.400
travel to book, food
prepared, guests

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.560
to deal with, family,
friends, vacation time, work.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.000
It's a lot to deal with.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.460
So that sense of control
plus our everyday stressors

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.360
can cause rapid
release of anger when

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.770
something unexpected happens.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.070
It's just a car man.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.160
But some personalities
do gravitate

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.330
toward road aggression.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.750
And even a disorder
affecting 7.3% of adults

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.060
called intermittent
explosive disorder,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.630
which sounds exactly
like what is.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.700
Studies show that's
humans crave violence,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.910
and when we're emotionally
impaired and driving,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.760
our more irrational
mind can react

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.870
to these crazy
situations, which does not

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.490
seem promising for us Lacy.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.470
Other than self
driving cars, I'm

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.920
not sure what we're going to do.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.630
Take a tip from
the professionals.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.700
They advise road ragers
to get enough sleep,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.760
don't listen to
aggressive music.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.479
Keep in mind everyone
makes mistakes, even you.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.270
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.535
You're perfect in every
way, except when you aren't.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:35.287
So play nice.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.620
And when someone's aggressive,
don't take it personally.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.500
Let it go.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.854
And ignore it.

00:02:39.854 --> 00:02:41.270
I give people a
thumbs up actually

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.770
on the road, and a big old
smile when they're jerks.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.090
