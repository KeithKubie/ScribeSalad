00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.540
Why do people rage on twitter?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.120
For the same reasons you scream death at that
little old lady for driving five under the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.540
speed limit, and play different music at your
party than you would at home alone.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:23.619
As General George S. Patton said, "If everyone
is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.289
Humans are social, we're pack animals.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.380
But sometimes our pack overwhelms our sense
of individuality and we end up doing things

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.620
because other people are doing them -- psychologists
call this herd mentality.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.940
It describes a tendency to follow, even when
following leads to terrible results -- think

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.180
riots after sporting events, runs on banks,
the salem witch trials, jumping off a bridge

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.100
if all your friends did it, et cetera.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.140
Recently, a lion was killed by a Minnesota
dentist, and people freaked; like FREAKED.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.790
The dentist's Yelp and Facebook pages were
overrun with hate comments, protestors stood

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.600
outside his practice, and law enforcement
stepped in to help the man who, as of this

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.410
writing, has gone into hiding.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.750
The thing is, regardless of how the lion was
killed -- the circumstances of which are being

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.240
investigated -- and regardless of how people
feel about big game hunting… why is he being

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.250
attacked by strangers?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.790
The herd mentality has roots in social pressure.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.490
We all want to be accepted, and in times of
stress that pressure is even more powerful.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.720
When people join crowds they lose a sense
of individualism; causing lowered inhibitions

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.979
and restraints.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.200
Studies show people in a crowd feel less guilt,
experiences less judgement and feel more support

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.640
from their fellow de-individualized mob members.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.710
Peer pressure is a type of herd mentality,
so is a riot or pitchfork-wielding mob; but

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.530
highly positive events like concerts and sporting
events are herds too!

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.810
I mean, it’s unlikely you'd chant, shout
and sing for a stranger's athletic prowess

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.240
unless others were doing it too.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.450
Herd pressure is so powerful, we all likely
listen to different music alone in our cars

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.290
than we do when we're trying to belong to
a group.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.791
But speaking of cars, there's a strange thing
that happens when humans enter a car; they

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.600
become deindividualized.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.940
Basically, they lose their sense of self…
similar to being in a mob.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.650
This is why road rage happens and people yell
horrible things when they feel even a twinge

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.310
of annoyance.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.900
They aren't acting like their normal selves
because they're not themselves at all.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.860
This sense of deindividualization is powerful,
but fragile.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.920
Studies by the American Automobile Association
(AAA) found people in convertibles don't exhibit

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.489
the same rage as those with tinted windows.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.160
Deindividualization was summed up nicely by
19th century psychologist Gustave Le Bon,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.200
“In a crowd … a man descends several rungs
in the ladder of civilization.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.280
Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual;
in a crowd, he is a barbarian.”

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.330
To bring it all back, people using computers
are deindividualized and are still susceptible

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.550
to herd mentality and something called positive
herding.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.020
The journal Science found that once a few
people click LIKE on something, other people

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.020
will click LIKE too.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.120
They called this, "positive herding."

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.000
According to their findings positive herding
can drive 25 percent more LIKES on a post.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.800
People don't even know what the post is!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.300
It doesn't matter!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.650
We recognize the popularity of the thing,
and want to be on the bandwagon.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.050
And according to another study from the University
of Sussex, joining this bandwagon makes people

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.980
feel empowered because they're part of a greater
whole.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.379
Thanks to the global nature of the internet,
this is a mob that anyone can be a part of,

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.379
from anywhere.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.360
And when you extend mass social pressure,
deindividualization and herd mentality to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.280
the internet, things spin out of control fast.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.550
And that's where our dentist is living now.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.880
The reason people are so crazed isn't necessarily
because they actually care -- though 5 percent

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.269
of them probably do based on the research
-- 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.530
but instead because they're following an intense
need for social belonging, and feel deindividualized

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.890
enough that they'll not experience guilt when
direct terrible and offensive language at

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.890
a stranger!

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.430
It's like road rage, but via twitter, facebook,
yelp, and wherever else.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.100
If you're worried that you might be part of
the problem -- think critically.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.690
Stop and wonder if your comment will ADD something
to the discussion or if it's just to feel

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.959
like you belong.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.139
If you're not adding a solution, or a new
perspective, or a piece of important information,

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.990
then perhaps you're just jumping on the rage
dogpile…

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.990
What do you think?

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.460
Have you ever raged and regretted it?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.690
Share your experiences with me in the comments.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.250
Also, if you want to know more about big game
hunting and whether it can be GOOD for conservation,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.310
check out this video I did when Kendall Jones
was caught being proud of her trophy last

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:55.150
year.
