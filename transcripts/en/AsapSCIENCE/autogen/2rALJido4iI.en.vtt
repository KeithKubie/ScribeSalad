There's no denying that human babies are cute
- but even other species tend to have adorable

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.339
infants. So why has science conditioned us
to find babies so precious? Is there something

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.469
specific that triggers our urge to hold and
squeeze them?

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.790
Interestingly, studies have found that macaque
monkeys pay little attention to newborn faces,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.090
leading researchers to believe that the 'cute
feeling' may be an entirely human trait. Unlike

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.320
many other species, once born, human babies
are completely dependent on their parents

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.720
for survival. As a result, humans have adapted
to find certain traits aesthetically pleasing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
and downright adorable, in effort to increase
interaction, care and protection from parents.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.660
This in turn enhances offspring survival,
and perpetuates our species. But what exactly

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.829
makes something seem 'cute'?

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.030
Known as Baby Schema, scientists have come
up with a set of tested traits that make something

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.239
appear cute. These include a large rounded
head relative to the body, large eyes below

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.280
the midline of the face, protruding cheeks,
a big forehead, round body and soft surfaces.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.860
Awwwh! And no doubt, our species is born with
fully grow large eyes, almost full sized brains,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.490
soft skin, big cheeks and round bodies.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.770
In fact, in tests where baby photos are manipulated
to have more baby schema traits - whether

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.310
they're human babies or dogs and cats, for
example - they are rated as cuter, and participants

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.360
felt a stronger motivation to take care of
these babies. Even when the front of cars

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.960
were altered in accordance to the baby schema
- like making the headlights become larger

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.869
to mimic big eyes - participants experienced
a more positive response.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.580
It turns out, it's all in our head. When viewing
babies with enhanced baby schema proportions,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.030
the mesocorticolimbic system of our brain
is activated. These parts of the brain enhance

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.200
the anticipation of a reward, and can lead
to a sense of enjoyment, motivation to care

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.330
for something and the urge to cuddle or hold
an object.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.560
But what about things that...aren't...so cute?
In fact, some creatures are downright ugly?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.229
So what does science have to say about these?
Our friends at Earth Unplugged have answered

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.979

animals - so click on the screen, or on the
