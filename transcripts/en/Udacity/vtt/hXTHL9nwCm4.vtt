00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.850
Let me show you something with my car.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.190
You know how sometimes you walk up to the trunk

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.820
and your hands are full, well here's how you do it.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.536
&gt;&gt; That's really cool.

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:19.810
&gt;&gt; want to try?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.541
&gt;&gt; Can I try? [SOUND]

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.041
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.290
were you kicking something?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.760
&gt;&gt; How do you think it works?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.780
&gt;&gt; Is there a particular place?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.430
&gt;&gt; Mm. So what do you think is going on?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, oh, there it goes.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.670
&gt;&gt; So what did you do?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.510
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what I did.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.480
&gt;&gt; You think you could do it again?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.540
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Let's see.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what's-

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.580
&gt;&gt; I don't know what I did.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.999
&gt;&gt; So what's your conceptual model of what's going on?

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:45.760
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe there's a sensor there, and I have to,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.130
&gt;&gt; Somewhere.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, somewhere under there. It looks like.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.340
&gt;&gt; You know,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.180
this is a really good example, if you like,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.170
it's a good example of a bad example of crossing

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.270
the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.590
The gulf of execution. Well I'm suppose to kick or

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.440
something, but where and how? How fast, or do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.980
I kick or just wave my foot? And the gulf

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.270
of execution, well I did it and nothing happened.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.820
Now what am I suppose to do? Really good example

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.780
of bad design.
