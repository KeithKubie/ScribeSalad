(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.750
- I'm Waldo Martin, Professor
of History here at Cal

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.440
and a member of the Jefferson
Memorial Lectures Committee.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.112
We're pleased, along with
the Graduate Council,

00:01:05.112 --> 00:01:08.440
to present Professor Nell Irvin Painter

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.056
this year's speaker in the Jefferson

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:14.515
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:18.543
The Jefferson Memorial Lecture Series

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:23.340
was established in 1944 through a bequest

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.330
from Elizabeth Bonestell and her husband,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.750
Cutler L. Bonestell.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.520
A prominent San Francisco couple,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.470
the Bonestell's cared deeply for history

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.131
and had hoped that the lectures
would encourage students,

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:44.000
faculty, scholars, and
those in the community

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.300
to study the legacy of Thomas Jefferson

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300
and to explore values inherent
in American democracy.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.310
Past lecturers, Ambassador
Jean Kirkpatrick,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.313
Senator Alan Simpson, this is a text,

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:07.313
Representative Thomas
Foley, Walter LaFeber,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.780
Archibald Cox, have delivered
Jefferson Memorial Lectures

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.780
on early American history,
about Jefferson himself

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.063
and on American institutions
and policies in politics,

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.633
economics, education, and law.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.350
Personally, I am honored
and humbled to introduce

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.680
Professor Painter,
Edwards Professor Emeritus

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.360
of Princeton University.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.570
Professor Painter is one
of the most important

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.670
and influential historians of our time.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.570
Her list of distinguished publications,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.630
academic and scholarly awards,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.950
and honorary degrees dazzles.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.340
As a scholar and public intellectual,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.660
Professor Painter has helped
transform how we think

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.660
and write about 19th and
20th century US history.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.260
Her wide ranging and stimulating body

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.280
of historical scholarship has ranged

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.280
across African American
history, Southern history,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.054
working class history, women's history,

00:03:30.054 --> 00:03:34.460
cultural history, social history,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.060
and for good measure,
intellectual history.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.030
Her scholarly range is stunning.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.890
Her scholarship itself is exemplary.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.680
Because of her powerful
work, we now see 19th century

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.670
black immigrants, black
working class radicals

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.670
and communists, the late
19th and early 20th century,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.740
sojourner truth, enslaved
women, and yes, white people

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.730
in fresh and revealing ways.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.730
Those of us who make it
a point to read her work,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.440
including her strikingly
perceptive essays,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440
articles, and reviews delight
in her historical sensibility,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.270
her erudition, her rigor, her insight,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.400
and her inviting prose.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.450
Those of us who know Nell personally

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.330
marvel at the commitment to teaching

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.590
and to the training of future
historians and scholars.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.670
Both of these have earmarked
her path-breaking career,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.880
a career that took her to the University

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.200
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.023
and the University of
Pennsylvania, before Princeton.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.916
Many of her former graduate
students have gone on

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:01.916
to illustrious scholarly
careers in their own rite.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.140
Nell's mentorship is not only
exceptional, but legendary.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.450
A genuinely cool and deeply humane person,

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.860
Nell has modeled intellectual generosity,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.023
graciousness, and rigor.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.130
At critical points in the careers

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.546
of many historians, like myself,

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:31.400
Nell has provided not
only verbal encouragement

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.600
and sage advice, but she has also provided

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.600
substantive and helpful
criticism, necessary criticism.

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:46.470
For that, her mentorship
and the inspiring example

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.550
of her work and her career,
we are all indebted.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.429
Nell Irvin Painter, as
they say where I come from,

00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:00.363
a proud and brilliant black
woman pointed the way.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.970
Today, having retired
from her Princeton gig,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.110
Nell Irvin Painter is reinventing herself,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.240
becoming an exciting visual artist,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.170
sporting a 2009 BFA from Rutgers

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.170
and a 2011 MFA from the Rhode
Island School of Design.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.150
With her BA in anthropology from Berkeley,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.640
her MA in African History from UCLA,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.000
and her PhD in American
History from Harvard,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.420
she knows a thing or
two about credentials.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.350
Not bad, as my down
home friends would say,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.300
for a true home girl,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.300
a graduate from Oakland Tech's
gifted and talented program.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.240
This afternoon, Professor
Painter will be speaking on

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.240
and illustrating why white
people are called Caucasian.

00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.092
Nell.

00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:04.259
(audience applauding)

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.933
- [Nell] Thank you.

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:07.934
Thanks, Waldo.

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:10.451
That was terrific.
- Thank you.

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:15.451
- Thank you, sir.
(audience applauding)

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.550
Well, thank you so much, Waldo.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.910
It is really lovely,
it's wonderful to be back

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.751
in the Bay area.

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:26.330
I haven't been here since last year.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.410
My father, who's now
94, who spent his career

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.870
in Lewis Hall was the Chief
Technician of Chemistry,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.240
last year came to New Jersey,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.623
so we haven't been coming back
as often as we did before.

00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:45.470
I wanna thank the
Jefferson Lecture Committee

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.590
for bringing me here from Newark

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.370
and for giving me the
chance to talk to you

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.493
and see old friends and some new friends.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.410
So, this afternoon, my
talk has three sections.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.570
One is an autobiographical
section, fairly short.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.293
I wanna tell you something
about my process.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.130
The second part is the
actual body of the lecture

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.653
with the illustrations, which
I made especially for you.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.710
And then, the last section is very brief.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.710
It has just one image, which
the Georgian National Museum

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.753
very kindly let me use without
making me pay for permission.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:34.110
So, the question of why are
white people called Caucasian

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.910
lies at the foundation of my 2010 book,

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.280
The History of White People.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.130
People ask me, why did
you write that book?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.110
I said, I wanted to understand why

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.120
white people are called Caucasian.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.820
I started working during the Chechnya wars

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.470
of the late 20th century and I thought,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.080
why are American white
people called Chechens.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.570
And so, the book came out of that.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.500
So, the book took many hundreds of pages.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.940
It's a very visual book 'cause I wrote it

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.553
while I was in art school,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.930
but it's fundamentally a history book

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.600
rooted in an archive of words.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.110
Its research came out of the
Princeton University Library

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.850
and I actually dedicated the book

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.943
to the Princeton University Library.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.300
In the book, Johann Friedrich
Blumenbach, 1752 to 1840,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.600
who plays a central role
in the question I'm asking

00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:42.283
also has nearly an entire chapter,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.400
but his role in my presentation
to you this evening,

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:51.850
he is really somewhat smaller

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.340
and that has to do with my process

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.520
of putting together this talk.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.090
So, as Professor Martin told you,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.660
I spent five years in
Art School at Rutgers

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.720
and at the Rhode Island School of Design

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.660
and there I learned to see,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.220
to really, really see, and the
process of making an image,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.120
whether you make it with
your hand, which I do,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.360
or you make it with your
computer, which I also do,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.603
and the images that I'm going
to show you this afternoon

00:10:25.603 --> 00:10:29.130
are digital images that
I made in my computer,

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.012
but whether you do it
one way or the other,

00:10:32.012 --> 00:10:37.012
manually or digitally, you
have to fill the space.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.370
That means seeing into all that space

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.270
and that process profoundly
altered what I could see

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.960
in what I had written, actually,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.880
and what I had already
studied to write a book.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.880
So for instance, the skulls
now occupy a much more

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.950
important place than before
because I looked at them

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.240
and I looked for them
with an artist's eye,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.870
not simply looking for words.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.870
So, the artifacts that reached science,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.170
I now see as particular
artifacts belonging

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.140
to particular people and
that reached to science

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.363
through the hands of particular people.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.500
So, my image-centered approach
has the great advantage

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.500
of embodying, not just
quoting or analyzing;

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.882
scientific utterance,
embodying scientific utterance,

00:11:43.882 --> 00:11:48.230
because usually in historical writing,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.450
the people who entomb scientific truth,

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.980
they remain relatively unknown.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.730
Usually you can't see them,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.640
you can't see what they're wearing,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.380
you can't see how they stand,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.943
you can't see their jewelry, for instance,

00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:09.251
but in today's lecture, written
and produced by an artist

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.531
as well, an historian,
I hope to make you see

00:12:15.531 --> 00:12:19.490
as many people in this story as possible

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.490
into real people in actual places

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.550
and particular circumstances,
even those whose destiny

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:34.000
was to appear as parts of a taxonomy,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.440
as type de ceci, type de cela

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.943
as types of millions of people, really.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.060
They turn out to be particular individuals

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.910
whose intimate experiences place them

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.883
in the path of science.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.420
So, that's my
autobiographical introduction

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.330
telling you about my
process and how my process

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.051
influenced what I'm
going to show you today.

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:09.730
So, my topic, the question
why are white people

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.220
called Caucasian is a
pretty simple question

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.120
and it's crossed a lot of people's minds.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.713
It's crossed more people's minds
than have actually said it.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.890
How many of you have wondered about that?

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.022
Put your hand up if you...

00:13:25.022 --> 00:13:26.590
Okay.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.850
How many of you have said it out loud,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.470
have actually said to somebody,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.690
why are white people called Caucasian?

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.303
So, many fewer.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.823
So, this has come up
pretty often this year.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.000
Here's a general question,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.223
why are white people called Caucasian?

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.723
And here's the question for 2013.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.230
Now, where exactly is the Caucasus

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.023
or is it are the Caucasus?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.800
Look for the red Google
marker between the Black

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.930
and the Caspian Seas,
that shows you the place

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.400
we're looking for or the
places we're looking for

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.483
and they're right on the
border near Europe and Asia.

00:14:19.956 --> 00:14:24.240
Now, anthropologists have
known what Caucasians look like

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.630
in terms of taxonomy, type de Caucasus

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.610
or something like that, and these images

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.343
come from William Z Ripley's
Races of Europe, 1899,

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:43.830
which was the bible of race thinking

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.730
in the early 20th century,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.240
was the bible for the
federal government in the era

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.010
of closing down immigration from southern

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.770
and eastern Europe,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.590
so those people standing
behind my Brooklyn revelers,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.123
those people are or were Caucasians.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.453
Now, a word on naming.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.711
In both the popular literature
and the scientific literature

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:16.470
the names of the people and
the places slide around,

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.223
so we talk about Caucasian,
we talk about Circassian,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.110
we talk about Georgian, and those terms

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.110
function almost interchangeably
outside of Russia,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.420
but in the historical period,

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.270
that is before the 20th century,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.376
before the late 20th century,

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:45.280
those people were synonyms
of the most beautiful

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.563
people in the world;

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.730
and if you ask Georgians,
that is from the Republic

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.490
of Georgia, if you ask them now,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.860
is it true Georgians are
the most beautiful people

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.693
in the world?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.163
What do they say?

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.120
Yes.
(audience laughing)

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.850
I haven't met Circassians
and I haven't met people

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.770
from the Caucasus who
themselves Caucasians,

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.743
so I don't know their answer.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.773
Within Russian, however,
Caucasians are the subject

00:16:18.773 --> 00:16:23.090
of negative stereotype
and, as a young American

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.823
living in Moscow explains
in this snippet of a video.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.630
- Well basically, what I wanna talk about

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.270
is what is the deal with
the Caucasians in Moscow?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.470
And I'm not like a racist
person or anything,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.310
especially 'cause I'm black.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.100
Like, how am I gonna be racist in Russia

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.420
about other people?

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.253
But it's not even that.

00:16:45.253 --> 00:16:47.980
I mean, like, all right, let me explain.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.360
There's always a huge group of them

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.970
and it's like, they don't
socialize with the Russians there.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.350
It's hard to explain.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.093
Like, I have a great Caucasian friend.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.420
He lives in Russia.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.610
Sorry, I forgot what countries he's from.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.220
He's probably watching
this video right now,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.530
but yo, it's early in the morning,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.580
I was drinking last night,
I'm sure George understands;

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.110
but I have a great friend
named George, he's Caucasian

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.950
and he doesn't even like the
average Caucasian in Russia.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.600
Now, from what I hear from people

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.350
is that they're dangerous,
they carry knives,

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.380
they carry guns and all this stuff

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.600
and maybe that is and maybe that isn't,

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.330
but I just wanna know that deal

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.830
'cause apparently, from
what I hear from a number

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.670
of Russian people that
Caucasians are disliked more

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.190
than blacks in Russia, like African black,

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.820
and I'm like holy crap, you know.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.870
They're hated more than us?

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.169
I didn't think that was possible.

00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:41.060
(audience laughing)

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.543
- The view from Moscow.

00:17:44.858 --> 00:17:49.858
Now, in February 2014, the winter Olympics

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.140
will begin in Sochi,
which is the black series

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.120
or in the western Caucasus

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.020
and you are going to be
hearing more about Sochi

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.993
this afternoon and also in February.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.250
Meanwhile, back in the United States,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.886
scientific literature freely
employs the word Caucasian

00:18:11.886 --> 00:18:16.020
as a term taken for granted
to mean white people

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.500
or non-black people or
non-people of color.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.180
So, it's a word that's still circulating

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.993
and it still circulates
because it still circulates.

00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:32.510
It has a place in American jurisprudence.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.210
For instance, Judge
Anthony Kennedy's opinion

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.430
for the Supreme Court of the United States

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.350
in Fisher versus University
of Texas at Austin

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.760
in June of this year.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.630
Kennedy mentioned without
pausing that the petitioner,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.697
that is Abigail Noel
Fisher, who is Caucasian.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.850
Kennedy's statement prompted
a New York Times reporter

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.130
to ask, has Caucasian lost its meaning?

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.553
And this article was on
the sixth of July, 2013.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.010
I'm actually quoted in it.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.370
The reporter, Shaila
Dewan, notes in her piece

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.730
and this is her quote:

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.730
in 1889, the editors of the
Oxford English Dictionary

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.440
noted that the term Caucasian

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.373
had been practically discarded.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.230
1889.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.980
She continues: but they spoke too soon.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.200
Blumenbach's authority had given the word

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.200
a pseudo-scientific sheen
that preserved its appeal.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.060
Even now, the word gives
discussions of race

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.060
a weird technocratic gravitas,
as when the police insist

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.253
that you step out of your
vehicle instead of your car.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.870
There is a short answer to my question.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.823
Short, but opaque.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.980
In the late 18th century
Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.030
an 18th century German
scholar assigned the name

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.600
to people living in western Europe

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.390
to the River Ob in
Russia to northern Africa

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.920
and to India, called them Caucasians.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.983
So, large group of people.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.520
Blumenbach enjoyed a scholarly reputation

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.120
that gave his designation enormous heft

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.443
and it got picked up very quickly.

00:20:42.443 --> 00:20:46.430
Although the term Caucasian
now has many synonyms,

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:51.010
including white, it
retains a certain currency

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.990
by dent of repetition.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.593
So, the short answer
is that skull, you see.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.890
The fuller and longer
answer is complicated

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.160
and it entails the history
of scholarly exchange,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.070
Russian Imperialism, and
notions of human beauty.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.863
So, the short answer first.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.040
Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.120
the father of physical anthropology,

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.124
the father of scientific anthropology,

00:21:23.124 --> 00:21:27.190
call the people in Europe over to India,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.654
well into Russia and
north Africa Caucasians

00:21:31.654 --> 00:21:36.654
because they were the most
beautiful in the world

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.830
and here you have Blumenbach and the skull

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.530
that inspired the designation

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.440
and Blumenbach says, also
for the determination

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.220
of the really most
beautiful form of skull,

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.100
which in my beautiful typical head

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.940
of a young Georgian
female always of itself

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.913
attracts every eye,
however little observant.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.433
So, the author of De Generis
Humani Varietate Nativa,

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.770
written in Latin, Blumenbach had 82 skulls

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:23.030
and this made him an
expert in human taxonomy.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.380
He made a fivefold designation
taxonomy of human types,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.153
he called them varieties,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.310
and he arranged them from left to right.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.800
Now, this is now a
hierarchical arrangement.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.270
Some of you may know
Stephen J Gould's book,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.150
The Mismeasure of Man.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.580
Do you know that book?

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.413
Yeah.

00:22:46.413 --> 00:22:51.370
So, Gould shows a triangle
with the Caucasian skull

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.270
at the top.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.910
That's not the way Blumenbach laid it out.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.320
Blumenbach was a believer
in the unity of mankind.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.240
He was a black bibliophile in the sense

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.660
that he collected books by black authors.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.860
He really believed in
the unity of mankind.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.810
So, he arranged the skulls
according to difference.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:21.050
So, at the two ends were the
Mongolian and the African

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.450
and he thought of them as the extremes.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.530
In the middle is the beautiful one.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.530
It's the gorgeous median
and that's the Caucasian.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.703
And then, the ones beside the Caucasian

00:23:38.703 --> 00:23:43.010
are the American and the Malay

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.383
because he thought those
were the intermediate races.

00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:54.021
In short, Blumenbach's
most beautiful skull,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.100
the one in the middle, gave
this large group of people,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.370
which we can call white people
but includes many others,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.883
the name Caucasian.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.030
Now, a fuller answer.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.540
We need to look at Russian Imperialism

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.540
and English Imperialism,
scholarly networks and slavery.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.340
Slavery, which gave rise to
the figure of the Odalisque,

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.140
that is the beautiful, white slave girl

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.580
as a figure of quintessential beauty.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.600
So, this is about beauty
not only of skulls,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.260
but also of slave girls,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.110
but whose skulls were
these and how did they get

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.993
to Blumenbach in Germany?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.570
The skull that made white people Caucasian

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.570
was a gift of Georg
von Asch, 1729 to 1807,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.390
a Russian of German
background who had studied

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.670
at Blumenbach's Gottingen University

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.370
and Asch was considered
one of the great fathers

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:12.010
of the Gottingen Library
and all their collections.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.813
So, one of the five skulls embodied

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:17.740
Blumenbach's human varieties...

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.750
I'm sorry, of those five skulls,

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.100
two of them came from Asch-.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.530
Asch also sent skulls and
books and all sorts of things.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:32.523
So, here we have Asch giving
the skull to Gottingen.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.133
Now, Asch gave lots of
skulls to Blumenbach.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:45.060
Of the 82, something like
20 or 25 came from Asch-.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.373
Who was this man?

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.950
He had some nice clothes.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.263
That's one thing we know.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.540
He was a medical doctor who served

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.700
in Catherine the Great's armies

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:04.480
when Catherine the Great
launched Imperialism

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.333
at the expense of the Ottoman
Empire and others, as well.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.020
She was a Russian of German background,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.453
as many of the aristocratic Russians were,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.653
and Asch- served her Imperial designs.

00:26:26.768 --> 00:26:28.685
In the 1780s and 1790s,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.023
Catherine was taking over the Caucasus.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.937
She began with Georgia as a
protectorate of Russia in 1783

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.943
and remember, the beautiful
skulls was from Georgia.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.120
The Russian conquest of
the Caucasus took a century

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.180
and entailed ethnic cleansing and genocide

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.440
and to this day, every
time Russian power falters,

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.533
Caucasians make a break for independence.

00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:06.439
So, two of Blumenbach's
five skulls from Asch-.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.910
Two of Blumenbach's five
skull scame from a wealthy

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.910
and influential, ultimately
knighted English naturalist

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:23.490
named Joseph Banks, 1743-1820.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.340
Banks had taken part in
Captain Cooke's first voyage

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:33.340
to the south seas in the 1760s, early 70s,

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:36.390
and actually, for California.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.010
You probably all think
that eucalyptus are native

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.283
to California, right?

00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:42.050
- [audience] No.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.020
- Where do they come from?

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.972
- Australia.
- And who brought them there?

00:27:45.972 --> 00:27:48.303
(multiple responses)
Banks.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.980
I mean, he didn't bring them here,

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.230
but Banks was one of those
people who saw things

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.020
that would be useful in one place

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.010
and said, why don't you
take them somewhere else?

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.057
So, we can thank Banks
for eucalyptus and acacia.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.720
He was a very wealthy young man

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.574
and as a young man, he
corresponded with Linnaeus,

00:28:14.574 --> 00:28:19.400
the father of taxonomy,
and he actually employed

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:24.400
one of Linnaeus's students as
his personal little Linnaeus.

00:28:25.594 --> 00:28:29.690
So, he headed the Royal
Society for many years

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:34.690
and he sent Blumenbach the
skulls that Blumenbach labeled

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.060
American and Malay.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.630
The Malay one was from Tahiti

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:47.630
and Banks sent his men in the bounty

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.280
over to Tahiti to dig up breadfruit.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.810
He said breadfruit would
be a very useful thing

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.283
to have in Saint Vincent in the Caribbean.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.630
Good thing to eat, cheap.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.300
So, he sent his men out
to dig up the breadfruit.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.860
They spent months and
months and months doing that

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.140
and during that time, they made liaisons

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:17.140
with local women and one of
the reasons for the mutiny

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.840
on the bounty was having to leave Tahiti

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.183
to go to Saint Vincent
with the breadfruit.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.040
So, Banks was also a connoisseur of skulls

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.040
and he sent the American
skull and the Malay skull,

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.733
so now we've accounted for
four of the five skulls.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.480
The fifth skull, which
was labeled Ethiopian,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.340
came from a professor at
the University of Utrecht

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.810
in the Netherlands and
I have not been able

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:58.100
to identify him beyond the
name that Blumenbach gave

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:02.210
and spelled it Steph-Jo-Van-Guntz.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:06.428
Can't find him, but we know
that the skull is female

00:30:06.428 --> 00:30:09.483
and that he called it Ethiopian.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.360
Blumenbach did not provide the names

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.110
of four of his five skulls.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:22.150
He called them typical skulls,
but he kept careful records,

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.820
careful enough that the
individuals begin to emerge

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.550
if we look more closely and
bring together the images

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.803
and the words.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.893
So, the Mongolian skull is
the only skull with a name.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.384
It's called Mongolian.

00:30:43.384 --> 00:30:45.390
Blumenbach calls it Mongolian,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.693
but we know that the owner
of it lived in Siberia.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.643
This is one of Asch's skulls.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:01.090
The Ethiopian we know
was the common-law wife

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.210
of a man who brought her
from west Africa from Africa

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.740
to the Netherlands and,
considering the traffic,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.870
probably she was from Ghana,
what we now call Ghana,

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.870
and we know that she died in
Amsterdam in her 28th year.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.650
The American lived in the
Caribbean island of Saint Vincent

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.110
and this is the Saint Vincent where Banks

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:37.340
had close friends, including
the head of the royal garden,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:42.340
so we know that the Carib
chief's bones were dug up

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.543
for Banks and then, sent to Blumenbach.

00:31:50.392 --> 00:31:55.392
And then, the skull labeled
Malay belonged to a Tahitian,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.750
most likely one of the
wives or girlfriends

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.100
of the sailors whom Banks had sent

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.343
to dig up breadfruit trees.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.253
The one in the middle, the Caucasian,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.400
a Georgian woman, very young
by the look of her teeth.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.550
Do any of you know what
used to happen to women

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.570
when they became pregnant?

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.003
What happened to their teeth?

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.640
Lots of cavities and fewer teeth.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.610
So, before the age of
fluoride and good dentists,

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.710
when women got pregnant, they
very often lost their teeth.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.120
This woman has all her teeth.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.120
This is a very young woman who's fate

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.933
was exceedingly unhappy.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.810
A young Georgian female, after
her venereal sudden death,

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:03.110
send to the Theatrum
Anatomicum for legal obduction.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.780
That is to say, after she
died of venereal disease,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:11.630
a scientist boiled her down
and sent her skull to Asch

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.423
and Asch sent it to
Gottingen to Blumenbach.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.120
The Georgian's death through sex

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.350
and Blumenbach's linking
of Caucasians with beauty

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.230
belongs to a longer tradition.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.890
I don't know when the tradition started,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.660
I know it goes back to the
17th century in western Europe,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:39.660
I suspect it may be of
Ottoman or Iranian beginnings.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.965
Now, remember Blumenbach's
hymn to the beauty

00:33:44.965 --> 00:33:47.103
of his Georgian skull?

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.980
Really, the most beautiful form of skull

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.840
in which my beautiful typical head

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.543
of a young Georgian female.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.490
In this regard, Blumenbach
joined a tradition

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.870
dating back to the 17th century

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.870
that called Caucasians,
Circassians, or Georgians

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.100
the most beautiful people in the world

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.489
and this, at least in
that part of the world,

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:17.863
is a tradition that lives on.

00:34:19.263 --> 00:34:22.513
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.033
Nice looking people, huh?

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.317
And young.

00:34:58.317 --> 00:35:01.470
(audience laughing)

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.890
One of the earliest Europeans to attempt

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.890
to categorize people by body
type was Francois Bernier,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:14.230
1625 to 1688, a French
physician and traveler

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.330
who became the personal
physician of the Mughal Emperor

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.313
of India for 12 years.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.300
In the image that I've made
for you, Bernier sits down

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.930
below there by the bush under his more

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:31.423
illustrious compatriot, Jean Chardin.

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:38.290
Bernier's 1684 publication
Nouvelle Division de la Terre

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.840
par les Différentes Espèces
ou Races Qui L'Habitent

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.940
is considered the first
post-classical classification

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.410
of humans into distinct races.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.720
In Nouvelle Division de
la Terre, he had referred

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.720
to the beauty of
Circassian women as assumed

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.540
by all the travelers.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.523
All the travelers.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.686
In a 1667 letter from Shiraz, Persia,

00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:15.410
Bernier describe the
burning of widows in India.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.610
At this point in his career,
he was evidently going around

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.340
watching widows being
burned because he described

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.960
several of the burnings:
older ones, younger ones,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.290
and so forth, and at one
burning he was together

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.890
with Jean Chardin, who was another

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.420
illustrious French traveler who
was also a jewelry merchant.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.850
It was Chardin's description
of beautiful Georgians

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.553
that Blumenbach quoted
in his book as proof

00:36:44.553 --> 00:36:47.810
that Circassian beauty or Georgian beauty

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.803
was agreed upon by scientists.

00:36:52.277 --> 00:36:55.230
Chardin's Journal du
Voyage du Chevalier Chardin

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.372
en Perse et aux Indes
Orientales par la Mer Noire

00:36:58.372 --> 00:37:03.372
et par la Colchide, 1689,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.480
this book is the authority
that Blumenbach refers to

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.233
when he speaks about Georgian beauty.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.800
For Chardin, the blood of
Georgia is the most beautiful

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:24.650
in the Orient and I would
have to say in the world,

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.550
for I have never noticed
an ugly face of either sex

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.180
in this country and some
are downright angelic.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.030
Nature has endowed most
of the women with graces

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.480
not to be seen in any other place.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.210
I have to say it is
impossible to look at them

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.290
without falling in love with them

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.200
and this is a quote from Chardin

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:56.530
and Chardin is together
with contemporary Georgians,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:01.530
that is Georgians of our
time and also the most famous

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.423
Georgian of the 20th
century, Joseph Stalin.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.400
Now, by the time Blumenbach
wrote in the late 18th century,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.080
Chardin's view was commonplace

00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:22.145
and the world's most illustrious
philosopher, Immanuel Kant,

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.263
agrees with Chardin and with Blumenbach.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.147
In observations on the
feeling of the beautiful

00:38:31.147 --> 00:38:34.433
and the sublime of 1763,

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.150
Kant says, Circassian and Georgian maidens

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.560
have always been
considered extremely pretty

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.430
by all Europeans who
travel through their lands

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.960
and Kant goes on to repeat something

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.960
that appears over and over and over again

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.490
in this literature, that the Caucasians,

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.640
the Georgians, the Circassians
sell their children,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.140
particularly their girls to the Turks

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.770
and to the Arabs and
the Persians for reasons

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.180
of what we would call eugenics,

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.700
that is to beautify the race,

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.370
and then Kant and all the
others slime the Turks

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.167
by saying they really needs in.

00:39:23.167 --> 00:39:24.250
(gasps from the audience)

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.083
Exactly.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.393
Now, much better known in
the English speaking world

00:39:31.393 --> 00:39:35.090
was a traveler and Cambridge professor

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:39.860
named Edward Daniel Clarke, 1769 to 1822.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:45.740
Clarke wrote Travels in
Various Countries of Europe,

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.220
Asia, and Africa, first published in 1810,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.178
but republished and revised
and republished and revised,

00:39:52.178 --> 00:39:55.850
republished in the United States, as well.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.250
So, Clarke was a much
better known authority

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:04.520
in the United States
on this issue than Kant

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:09.520
or Chardin or Bernier;
and for Clarke, again,

00:40:12.147 --> 00:40:17.147
as an eye witness, he also
testified that the women

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.703
of the Caucasus are the
most beautiful in the world.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.890
He was a tutor in Jesus College
in Cambridge University,

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.710
a member of the Academy
of Sciences in Berlin,

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.000
and the Cambridge Philosophical Society,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.840
and many other learned
societies that formed

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.940
an important scholarly network.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.940
So, in Clarke's work, the
notion of Circassian beauty

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:49.583
or of Georgian beauty
is taken for granted.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.453
Now, what is this lady?

00:40:55.130 --> 00:41:00.130
This is 1850s, a Circassian
beauty in the United States.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.760
This is Barnum's American Museum

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.690
and in the 1850s and 60s,
Barnum showed several women

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:18.690
all with afros as Circassian beauties,

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.440
the most beautiful women in the world

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:25.440
and for American audiences,
examples of white purity.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.370
Now, why the headdress or why the hair?

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.640
I mean, we know why the hair.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.592
She had hair like this
and she let it grow.

00:41:38.592 --> 00:41:39.425
(audience laughing)

00:41:39.425 --> 00:41:43.523
But, why was this
associated with Circassians?

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.210
This is the headdress
of Circassian warriors,

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:55.210
so the woman in New York,
her hair echos the headdress.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.030
Now, over and over
again in the authorities

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:08.170
I've mentioned to you,
the idea of the beauty

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:11.230
of Caucasians is linked with the idea

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.770
of the slavery of Caucasians.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.240
So, before the Atlantic slave trade

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.810
to the western hemisphere shaped our ideas

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.800
about what slave trades are all about,

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.790
there was a slave trade
from this part of the world,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:33.790
that is the Caucasus,
Ukraine, Crimea, and so forth,

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:39.030
and that trade goes back
before the reaches of time.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.427
This is Herodotus.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:49.143
Herodotus writing in the fifth century BC,

00:42:49.143 --> 00:42:54.143
writing about the enumeration
of taxes and tributes

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.603
paid to the Persian kingdom,

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.940
collected from the lands it had controlled

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.503
and the lands even far
away in the distance.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.730
He said that a voluntary
contribution was taken

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.830
by the Colchians, that is the Georgians,

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:16.080
and the neighboring tribes
between them and the Caucasus

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.780
and it consisted of,
and still consists of,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.860
that is in the fifth century BC,

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.473
every fourth year 100 boys and 100 girls.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:35.860
This was before Herodotus could even see

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.760
the beginnings of it.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.610
I should add Herodotus
also mentioned the tribute

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.180
from the southern most part of the edges

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.270
of the Persian world
and that was for people

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:53.270
called Ethiopians and what
they owed was gold and ivory.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.163
People were not mentioned.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.700
So, the Black Sea slave
trade was the slave trade

00:44:07.253 --> 00:44:11.480
in the western world
until the 15th century

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.590
when the Ottomans captured Constantinople

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.050
and cut the Black Sea
off from western Europe.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:22.570
At that point, 15th century,
the Atlantic slave trade

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.403
becomes the western slave trade.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.880
So, let's go back to Jean
Chardin for a moment.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.880
His famous words of
1689 actually described

00:44:35.492 --> 00:44:40.492
a familiar experience in
the Black Sea in the 1660s.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:46.783
This was Chardin, who
was in the cameo there.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.960
Chardin was actually on a
voyage to India to buy jewelry,

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.160
but he couldn't go his
usual way, the southern way,

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.650
so he went through the
Caucasus, which he hated.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:00.483
He hated it.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:06.370
But in the Black Sea area,
he describes a situation

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:11.542
where he was on a boat
with captives, with slaves,

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:15.873
and he talks about one
particular woman who was 25

00:45:15.873 --> 00:45:20.090
with a smooth, even, lily white complexion

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:22.760
and admirably beautiful features.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.760
I have never before seen such
beautifully rounded breasts.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.744
That beautiful woman
inspired overall sensations

00:45:31.744 --> 00:45:34.333
of desire and compassion.

00:45:35.935 --> 00:45:40.935
Now, it turned out that on
that voyage and on that boat

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.810
was a Greek trader and Greeks handled

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:48.143
that long-standing Black Sea slave trade.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.303
So, Chardin tells us what people cost.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.430
He says in crowns.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.770
I have translated it into pounds,

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.713
so you can get a sense of
what we're talking about.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:09.550
Pretty girls aged 13 to 18
went for about 60 pounds,

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.563
plainer girls for less,

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.633
women went for about 36 pounds,

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:24.310
children from nine to 12 pounds,

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:29.310
men aged 25 to 40 for about 45 pounds,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.223
those older, only about
24 pounds to 30 pounds.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.540
The Greek merchant whose room was next

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.430
to Chardin's on the boat
bought that beautiful woman

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:50.243
with the baby at her
breast for about 36 pounds.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:57.530
Daniel Edward Clarke, our Cambridge don,

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.080
also located Circassian
beauty, or Caucasian beauty,

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.163
in the enslaved.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.380
The Circassians frequently
sell their children

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.670
to strangers, particularly to Persians

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.270
and Turkish Seraglios.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:16.223
The most beautiful prisoners
of both sexes go there.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.160
He speaks of one particular
Circassian female

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.930
who was 14, who was conscious
of her great beauty,

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.809
who feared her parents would sell her

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:31.883
according to the custom of the country.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.650
How much?

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:39.650
The women selling generally
from 25 to 30 rubles a piece,

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.253
somewhat less than the price of a horse.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.400
The beautiful young slave
girl became a figure

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.693
and she had a name, Odalisque.

00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:59.260
She combines the powerful
notions of beauty,

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.750
sex, and slavery.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.090
In American and European art,

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.630
in the 19th century particularly,

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.580
she looks like the white girl next door,

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.423
but she is a slave, so you
can do with her as you will.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.590
Ingres, Jerome, Powers,
and Matisse specialized

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.733
in Odalisque paintings.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.330
The figure of the
Odalisque faded from memory

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:36.330
as the Black Sea slave trade
ended in the late 19th century

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:39.860
and the Atlantic slave
trade overshadowed that

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.153
from the Black Sea.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.580
Today, the word slavery
invariably leads to people

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.600
of African descent.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.310
Americans seldom associate
the word Odalisque

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:56.033
with slavery in the Americas
and, parenthetically,

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.800
today many American painters
use Odalisque figures,

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.880
Mickalene Thomas for
instance, has done a series

00:49:09.809 --> 00:49:11.410
of what she calls American Odalisque,

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:15.000
but the phrase and the
figure of the Odalisque

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.210
has lost its association with slavery

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.760
and now, in American art
history and in contemporary

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.800
American art, Odalisque simply refers

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.623
to a beautiful woman, usually unclothed.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.240
Now, in North and South American history,

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:40.240
the Odalisque-like figure
appears in the guise

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.703
of the beautiful quadroon,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.450
in Uncle Tom's Cabin, for instance,

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:51.450
Eliza and her son, Harriet
Beecher Stowe's work.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.973
The Caucasus and Russian Imperialism,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.650
although the Odalisque
association of Caucasian beauty

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:06.620
and white slavery has
slipped out of memory,

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:11.000
the Caucasus continues
as a region and revolt

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.513
against Russian control.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.120
Caucasians have not forgotten
the ethnic cleansing

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:23.120
they suffered in their 100
Years War against Russians,

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.940
which cost at least half
a million Caucasian lives

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:34.980
and you will see part of this
in part of the recent video,

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.160
which mentions the slaughter of Caucasians

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.303
in A Place Called Sochi.

00:50:43.104 --> 00:50:47.187
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.630
Whenever Russian power
has seemed threatened,

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:39.113
the Caucasian borderland has pulled away.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:44.230
After the second World War,
Joseph Stalin exiled millions

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:47.460
of Circassians to Dagestan and Kazakhstan,

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.280
places that came up in the story

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.563
of the Boston Bombers last spring.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.650
As the Soviet Union broke apart,

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.599
Chechnya struck out for independence

00:51:58.599 --> 00:52:03.599
and, more recently in 2008,
Georgia and Russia played a part

00:52:05.368 --> 00:52:09.363
in US policy discussions.

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:17.040
In conclusion, Caucasian is only one term

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.850
for people of European descent.

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.931
The word used depends on the context

00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:26.150
and the route taken as its opposite,

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:31.010
who's speaking to whom, when,
where, and for what purpose?

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:34.660
The use value of Caucasian
depends on its use,

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.053
not on any basis in biological fact.

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.540
The term Caucasian for white people

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.960
grows from three main roots.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.540
One root lies in the
history of Imperialism,

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.600
especially the Russian
campaigns of Catherine the Great

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.687
and her army, and the German
trained medical doctor,

00:52:54.687 --> 00:52:59.483
Jorg von Asch, who sent so
many specimens to Blumenbach.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.790
British Imperialism also played its part

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.163
in the person of Joseph Banks.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:11.310
One root lies in notions of beauty,

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:14.633
Caucasians as the most
beautiful people in the world.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:21.070
And one root lies in
the idea and the ideal

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:25.850
of enslaved women as especially beautiful,

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.043
as in the Odalisque.

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.080
Yes, the term Caucasian for
people of European descent

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:38.080
is not only outmoded, it
is always been contingent.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.600
It didn't work in pre-Holocaust Europe

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.670
where divisions were drawn
between gentiles and Jews

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.670
and Jews were racialized,

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.263
even though they were of European descent.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:54.240
It didn't work in
societies like the Balkans

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.430
where religion divided people.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.810
So, you can use it if you want,

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:04.760
but understand that it's only
as scientific as its use.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.850
When researchers start using Caucasian

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.110
to mean white Americans,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.890
the term will no longer be recognized.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.363
Now, a coda.

00:54:17.068 --> 00:54:22.068
On Thursday the 17th of October, 2013,

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.450
the New York Times ran a front page story

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:30.450
entitled Skull Fossil Suggests
Simpler Human Lineage,

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.743
illustrated by skull five,

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:41.053
another sensational Georgian skull.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.950
Dmanisi, Georgia, the
skull was one point eight

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.703
million years old.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:52.370
This skull was found
along with four others,

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:55.640
a group find unusual in archeology.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.910
Usually, skulls are found alone,

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.750
leading anthropologists to
classify each different one

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:06.733
as a different species.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:11.770
Each single skull usually
became the embodiment

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.616
of a different group of humans,

00:55:13.616 --> 00:55:18.440
as was in the case with
Blumenbach's five skulls.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.110
Each of his individual skulls,
the skulls of girlfriends

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:28.110
or victims of sexual
assault became the figure

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.993
for an entire classification of people.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.630
The group of skulls recently
found in Georgia, however,

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:42.320
is leading to a reverse conclusion.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:46.520
Even though skull five and
each of the other skulls

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.960
look different from one another,

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:53.283
they're all taken to
belong to the same group.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:59.150
The point of skull five's
story is that ancient skulls,

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:03.520
yes, differ from one another
not because they belong

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.840
to different hominid species
as previously assumed,

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.123
but because they belonged
to different individuals.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:17.199
Even people who had been dead
for more than a million years

00:56:17.199 --> 00:56:20.503
were individuals, not species.

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:24.340
So, here we come full
circle from Blumenbach's

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.540
18th century skulls, notably his beautiful

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.393
female skull from Georgia,

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.700
Blumenbach's skulls had
belonged to individuals,

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.505
but he classified them as racial types.

00:56:37.505 --> 00:56:42.505
In October 2013,
anthropologists finally realized

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:46.150
that each individual is singular,

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:51.150
that each skull's owner
has its own life history.

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.086
Thank you.

00:56:53.086 --> 00:56:56.253
(audience applauding)

00:57:02.094 --> 00:57:05.594
(upbeat electronic music)
