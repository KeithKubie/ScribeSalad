00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.920
What's up, I'm Destin, this is Smarter Every Day. You've probably heard of 23andme. It's one of these companies

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.029
where you spit in the tube and you mail it off and they do DNA testing and give you ancestry and health data.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.510
Well, here's the deal

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.929
They approached me and asked me if I would make a video on Smarter Every Day about them, and what they do

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.760
But there's a problem with that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.820
I'm really

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.840
fascinated with this technology like I think this is the future of medicine. Imagine a doctor walking into your room opening a chart and saying

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.260
"Oh well

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.979
I can't give you this drug because you're genetically predisposed to a negative reaction"

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.569
That is the future of medicine so I really believe this is important however

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.329
 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.920
I can't do an ad

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.149
for something this important and have you the viewer think that I'm just shilling for a company and saying what they want me to say

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.599
because they're giving me money, so I set up the following terms. I said, look,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
I'll do this video if, number one, I get to ask any question

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
I want of anybody and I get to say whatever I want as long as it's true

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.529
And they said yes to that and number two I want access to the labs with my camera

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
And I want to be able to ask the scientist questions, and they said yes to that and that never happens !

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.159
That's awesome. And number three

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.169
I told them I actually wanted them to sponsor the video

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.210
Which they did so to their credit, 23andMe is sponsoring a transparent video

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.229
which is a little scary for them because they have no idea what I'm gonna say. So here we go,

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.949
Let's do this. When you get the kit. It's pretty clear how this exchange works.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.119
I give up genetic material, and I get health and ancestry data back, but that's scary

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.979
I don't know what they're gonna do with my sample

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.129
I don't know exactly what I'm giving up. When I ask people on Twitter, everybody cited privacy concerns, so just for a second

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.079
let's pretend that we can't trust this company we need to go to an independent third-party

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.890
expert that knows exactly what type of information we're giving up when we spit in a tube and mail it to 23andMe

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.140
So when a lot of people think about, Huntsville, Alabama,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.899
they think about the space industry like the Saturn 5, right ?

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.359
But what you didn't know if you get on Google Maps and go to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.449
601 Genome Way, you're gonna see a double helix

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.049
you can see from space. That is this place.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.820
No joke. Huntsville,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.860
Alabama is home to one of the largest DNA

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.270
sequencing centers in the entire world and it's in my hometown like I see these people at PTA meetings. The HudsonAlpha Institute for

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.319
Biotechnology is where Dr. Neil Lamb, a PhD in human genetics works.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.720
We're go in here and learn about DNA sequencing. Hey, are you Neil ?
NEIL&gt;&gt; I am

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.220
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm Destin. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.069
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you, yeah
NEIL&gt;&gt; Welcome to HudsonAlpha

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.950
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Chris nice to meet you guys

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.980
Hey, how you guys doing, you doing all right? 
NEIL&gt;&gt; Welcome to the Institute. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. This is fancy.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.910
NEIL&gt;&gt; Is this your first time here ?
DESTIN&gt;&gt; No actually I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.859
upload stuff to the YouTube channel here because you have the fastest internet connection in the city

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.809
Did you know I did that? 
NEIL&gt;&gt; So we're headed to the genome sequencing center

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.530
which is the all of the sequencing machines that we have at HudsonAlpha.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.940
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Ok, so these are the sequencers right full-blown DNA sequencing. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; These are DNA sequencers

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.869
This is really the heart of HudsonAlpha. These machines are designed to take an individual or an organism to sequence

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.600
it's broken up into small pieces and the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.470
sequence A's T's C's G's... 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; for the entire genome? 
NEIL&gt;&gt; for the entire genome.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Like how much data are we talking there, in bytes?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.470
NEIL&gt;&gt; So the raw data that comes out of this machine is about 80 gigabytes of information for one human genome.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.839
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, this explains why the fastest internet node in the city is it HudsonAlpha. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; That is correct

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.350
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Does 23andMe have like a bank of machines like this ?
NEIL&gt;&gt; 23andMe uses a completely different technology for genotyping

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So what's the difference in genotyping and

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.729
full-blown DNA sequencing ?
NEIL&gt;&gt; So to answer that question let me show you another illustration. This is a representation of your

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.660
genome. There's a hundred notebooks on the bookshelf, and I want you to imagine that each of those notebooks, has

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.459
5000 double-sided pages full of nothing but

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220
DNA sequence. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Adenine, cytosine,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.190
thymine and guanine. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; Exactly right so you've got two copies that copy you inherited from your mom and the copy you inherited from your dad.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.799
So this is a representation of one of those two copies the amount of information that you're gonna get from

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.169
23andMe is not all three billion bits of information.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.499
Instead, it's more like about

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.150
90 pages.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Really? Now, what's the difference in genotyping and just doing a DNA sequence, what's the difference in those two things?

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.579
NEIL&gt;&gt; Right, in DNA sequencing, I'm reading through every single letter in your genome. With genotyping,

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.789
I'm going to a specific place, and I'm saying at this one site, what do you have? And with genotyping I'm doing that...

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520
well for 23andMe they're doing that at about

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.740
600,000 sites across your genome.
DESTIN&gt;&gt;  So it's not like you're giving away your entire DNA sequence when you do something like this. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; That's right

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.889
You're only giving away a tiny fraction of your genetic information when you do something like 23andMe.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.800
Got it this it's not your entire sequence

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.499
I thought it was I thought they were gonna be Destin clones walking the streets

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.840
But if you do the math it's only 0.02% of your sequence. That's a game-changer

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.520
They should like put that on the website or something.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.530
Okay, was at this point that I was invited to an education summit headquarters in Mountain View,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.519
California. My wife, who's really smart when it comes to genetics, insisted that she take my place for reasons, I'll let her explain

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.929
TARA&gt;&gt; I am a medical professional as someone who's done

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.420
genetic research in the past and wanted to know if it would benefit you guys there were if it would harm you guys

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.189
So I'm here !
DESTIN&gt;&gt; This part is super cute to me because she doesn't like to be on camera that much

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.970
But I asked her to vlog just a little bit

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.080
She went and talked to professors and researchers from all over the country

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.009
And they discussed the different benefits and risks of doing this type of testing both on the individual level and its overall implications for society

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.759
The main thing she learned is that the optional questions are the key. When people answer the question scientists can start to figure out what

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.599
genotypes affect what traits. We decided, as a family, that we want to contribute to the overall genetic body of knowledge

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.680
because that's going to help

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.290
society in the future. Okay, after you decide to spit you were about to send your genetic information

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.860
off to a third party. Kind of scary... so a set up an email address

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.990
Specifically to do the kit

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.030
and it's pretty interesting because there's no return address so really the only indicator for which tube is mine

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.339
is this 14 digit code. I spit in the tube, you're smart, you can figure that part out and you write down that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.800
14 digit code on the tube and link that to the email address and that goes to 23andMe headquarters.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.400
The kit however, does not go to 23andMe headquarters

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.389
it goes to LabCorp, a completely different company after doing some research

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:35.919
I discovered that 23andMe has isolated themselves physically from the samples. LabCorp has samples and numbers

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.720
23andMe has

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.579
email addresses and numbers I decided to spit in this thing and then chase it out to

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.459
California to see what happens when it hits the door of the lab.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.410
This is the first time LabCorp allowed someone like me into the lab with a camera

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.290
I was introduced to the lab manager Amanda Douglas and was told I could film anything and ask any question I wanted

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900
AMANDA&gt;&gt; So we're at the National Genetic Institute

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.549
DESTIN&gt;&gt; National Genetics Institute okay.
AMANDA&gt;&gt; It's a subsidiary of LabCorp.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.219
DESTIN&gt;&gt; No way is that the FedEx guy that brings brings the stuff in? What's up, man?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.350
Do you bring all the samples here?
FedEx Guy&gt;&gt; Yes I do.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you man. This is way more behind the scenes than I thought it was gonna be

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.800
AMANDA&gt;&gt; This is a small batch so we open them by hand but with larger batches there's a conveyor belt

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.740
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Really?
AMANDA&gt;&gt; And that will cut them open

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.850
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And so you open them and you... Oh! He's actually got the sample, okay, so what's your name man?
LONNIE&gt;&gt; Lonnie.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Lonnie, I'm Destin, man

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.850
Nice to meet you.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:45.559
All right, so we got our spit in the system now what?

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:47.559
AMANDA&gt;&gt; Alright, so now that the spit is in the system, we'll know...

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.949
ok, let's go ahead and test the ones that are ready to test and then they'll move on to the lab.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Is that where we're going now?
AMANDA&gt;&gt; That's where we're going now.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.909
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Sweet. These are all specimens here. So Lonnie has done his thing, we come in here, and we're ready to extract the DNA.
AMANDA&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.849
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay
AMANDA&gt;&gt; So we'll go on here

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.120
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Oh, this is so rad... Oh god !

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.239
This is like from the future. What are you guys doing? 
LAB TECHNICIAN&gt;&gt; I'm currently uncapping

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.329
specimen sample, to be able to put them into the

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.700
Tecan which will then take a little small amount of this into the 96-well plate.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:35.029
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, so these machines are autonomously taking the samples out of the specimen tube that people mailed in and then it's

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:38.149
Automatically putting those into the 96-well plate. That's what we're doing

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:45.439
Got it. Okay, so this is the first time where we no longer have humans touching it, and we're moving towards machine automated process.
LAB TECHNICIAN&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.099
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Is that it? I would high-five you, but you get gloves on. I

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.589
spent the entire day with Amanda learning the whole process and basically it works like this. First

00:08:54.589 --> 00:09:01.759
they isolate the DNA and then they amplify it by allowing it to replicate and then the magic happens. This chip is the secret to

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.779
genotyping. Basically they take the DNA, and they unzip the double helix

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:11.329
which leaves you with one side of a ladder rung they then put this unzipped DNA onto the chip

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.420
which has

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.940
thousands of artificial DNA probes on it these probes are basically long stretches of DNA that match known parts of the human genome

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.040
So when a ladder comes along and gets beside the probe it's a perfect match and will bind to it

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.539
Since this stretch of DNA is a known sequence you can then read the next base pair

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.099
That's hanging off of the probe and that's the specific information for that base pair

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:40.790
They do this by a fluorescent marker that they'll put on the chips which reacts to different kinds of light these specific locations are chosen

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:46.279
because they're associated with something interesting like a disease risk or a physical trait this fancy machine

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.890
illuminates the chips and takes a picture, which tells you what letter you have at that particular DNA snip

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.900
Or single nucleotide polymorphism, and that's it. That's how the data is captured the next thing

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.589
I wanted to know is what happens after your sample is tested. On the website,

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:04.549
you could choose to allow lab core to keep the sample on long-term storage for future testing or

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.249
You can check a box and tell them to destroy it

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.509
I asked Amanda if she would show me this because a lot of people want to know if they check that box

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.909
It's actually gonna happen. Amanda has agreed to show me the process. It's really exciting I'm told.
AMANDA&gt;&gt; Oh

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.080
Yeah, you're in for an

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.790
excitement here, so

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.200
we take a box of

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:28.879
120 samples that we've scanned and said "this sample is to be discarded", the customer does not want to store it long-term

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:35.239
So once they're ready to be discarded. We'll take the samples and throw them in to the trash

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:38.269
And we simply toss them into the trash

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.060
pour the whole box in the trash.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:50.089
DESTIN&gt;&gt; That's it? 
AMANDA&gt;&gt; That's it 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And then what happens to it? Like you I really expect you that you're hiding the samples somewhere, right?

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.970
You're gonna do something crazy with them, right?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.500
AMANDA&gt;&gt; We just throw them away.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And they go and they are destroyed at a

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.520
biomedical waste facility.
AMANDA&gt;&gt; That's right
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So we're kind of goofing around here

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.869
but it is important, so she showed me the entire process the samples are consolidated

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.909
They're kept under lock and key, and they're picked up daily

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.690
It's legit. So I am satisfied with the process obviously

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.789
23andMe knew I would be satisfied or they wouldn't have allowed me to do this, but it was really fun to anyway

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:22.190
I really enjoyed the ancestry data a lot more than I thought I would I elected to talk to my dad about it

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:27.409
We had a really good discussion, and we actually learned things about our family together. The health stuff is interesting though.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.410
It is your responsibility to

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.669
understand what those results mean and to get a better handle on this I decided to go talk to Dr. Lamb

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:42.140
again the unbiased third party at HudsonAlpha.
NEIL&gt;&gt; I found the information really fascinating it gave me some insight into myself

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.229
But I'm... I have a background in human genetics

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:51.020
That's my PhD so I got all the nuances I understood what that means and what that

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.979
doesn't mean 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is even if someone does

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:01.670
23andMe and they get that information about their own body, it's important to go the next step and understand

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.459
what you're learning about your body?

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.470
That's what you're saying.
NEIL&gt;&gt; and to bring your medical doctor into those conversations and to make sure that your doctor

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.669
understands the nuances of genetics as well. They're a piece of information

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.430
and you've got to make sure you understand what that piece can and can't tell you and in a lot of cases you have the

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.119
Decision you can make the decision do I want to even know this information?

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.190
Or do I want to not look at that part of my report.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Got it okay and to be clear

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.989
Neil has nothing to do with 23andMe.
NEIL&gt;&gt; That's correct, 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's an unbiased third-party opinion

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.780
Thank you for that. 
NEIL&gt;&gt; My pleasure.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.430
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, in summary. I was concerned about privacy. I went to the lab

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.109
I am no longer concerned about privacy. They've got a good handle on that. You were concerned about the data

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:48.149
the benefits outweighing the risks do you feel like it does?
TARA&gt;&gt; I do feel like the information is helpful for

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:54.149
Society as a whole as well as the individual 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, and there's three things you said you wanted to bring up

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:59.639
TARA&gt;&gt; I did. One, I want you to realise  that just because report says that you have a marker

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.140
It doesn't mean you're gonna get that means like you're more or less likely to have that trait. Number two

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.940
only gather the information that you think you can handle so if you think hey

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.480
I'm not sure

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.420
I want to know that then then wait. 
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Some people only do the ancestry thing because they don't want to know those health risks

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.729
TARA&gt;&gt; Right and three you need to realize that it's a family affair. I mean once you find out your data

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:23.070
You're it's really your family's data

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.029
So you may have to make decisions on whether you should share that information with your

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.430
Mother and father or brother and sister or whether you shouldn't.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; If this is something you want to do you can go to

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.739
23andme.com/smarter, get a tube spit in it send it off and get your data back if you want to do that

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:44.370
feel free to if not no big deal Thank you to 23andMe for actually letting us more or less investigate their company and

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:49.739
being so transparent that was pretty cool. Nobody's ever gone into the lab like that before you think it's a good thing

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:55.260
TARA&gt;&gt; I think it's a fun thing yeah. DESTIN&gt;&gt; Anyway, I'm Destin you getting smarter every day. It's my wife Tara

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.120
That's it. Have a good one

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.370
Bye. No private or health information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:09.510
I am gonna try to vlog for the first time. I'm not comfortable on camera, so this should be pretty interesting.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.160
Even in the

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.480
screen and it's not if I guess oh, I keep looking at the screen you are going to I keep looking at the screen

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.790
I'm not good at this

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.829
Okay next
