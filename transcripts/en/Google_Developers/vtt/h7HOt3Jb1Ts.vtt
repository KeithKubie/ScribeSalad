[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
Eric, welcome to "Coffee

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.466
With a Googler."

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.960
Tell us all about yourself.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.710
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.170
So I've been at Google for--

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.680
wow, like a decade now,
mostly working on the web

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.180
until about three
years ago when I

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.340
helped start the
Flutter project, which

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.870
is now what I work on.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.570
And I've been writing
code most of that time.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.520
Although a couple of
years into Flutter,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.770
I switched from
coding all day to now

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.430
I lead the engineering team.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.263
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
what's it like changing

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:34.530
from coding all day to being
an engineering manager?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.070
Remembering that our audience
are primarily developers, so--

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.970
ERIC SEIDEL: It's been
a wild ride, mostly

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.820
because Flutter
has been exploding,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.670
usage inside and
now outside Google.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.540
And that's been fun.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.584
And it's fun to just help
people get stuff done.

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:49.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
you've had a background

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.610
in a lot of web and
particularly in rendering.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.390
And how has that helped
you with building Flutter?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.140
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.870
So I've worked on rendering
systems for 10, 15 years now--

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.030
again, mostly on the web.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
And that's how we ended up
starting Flutter, is that we--

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710
I feel like that's
where my leverage is.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
like that expression--

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.694
where my leverage is.

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:13.860
I have to remember that one.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.610
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.160
We just wanted to do
something better for Mobile.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: How
did Flutter start?

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.450
ERIC SEIDEL: Well,
that's a bit of a story.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.760
LAURENCE MORONEY:
My favorite kind.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.950
ERIC SEIDEL: So I used
to work on Chrome.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.850
And I was on the Chrome
team at the time.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.560
And we were working with
some hard problems trying

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.230
to get certain parts of the web
to really be nice and smooth.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.510
And for whatever reason,
we did this experiment

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.290
for a couple of weeks
where we decided

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.410
it was going to be OK to break
compatibility with the web.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.690
And we--

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thankfully
it was only an experiment.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.220
ERIC SEIDEL: Oh,
just an experiment.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.720
But with that
restriction removed,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.320
we started removing things,
all these old compatibility

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.180
supports for all
these obscure websites

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.786
that the vast majority
of us never go to.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Or maybe
they don't even exist anymore,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.457
because it evolves rapidly.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.040
ERIC SEIDEL: And we
just kept removing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.310
and removing and removing.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.160
And at the end of
a couple weeks,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.659
we ran our benchmarks again.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.700
And obviously, this wasn't
quite the web anymore.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.300
It couldn't render all the web.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.560
But it was 20 times faster
on some of the benchmarks

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.550
we cared about.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.340
And we were like,
there's something here.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.600
And so we kept digging.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.460
And from that, we started.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.910
And it probably took us
about another year of digging

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.370
before we realized we just need
to write a whole new thing.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.911
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's like
now-- tell me what Flutter is.

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:33.024
What is it all about?

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:34.440
There's a lot of
misunderstandings

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.648
and misconceptions, and I
know I've had many of them.

00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:39.600
So assume I know nothing, which
is a pretty safe assumption.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.340
So tell me about Flutter.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.494
What is it?

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.910
ERIC SEIDEL: Flutter is a way
to write for iOS and Android

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.650
from a single codebase.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.370
And we try to make
that fast and easy.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.010
And we make a bunch of choices
in that space to try and do

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.900
some awesome things there.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.070
For example, we--

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.570
Flutter is a full stack.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.290
We talk all the way
down to the GPU and CPU.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.670
We talk straight
to the hardware.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.370
We made a bunch of choices
early on around making

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.462
custom very easy.

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:10.920
So we have a very
layered approach.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.014
You can take as little
or as much as you want.

00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:14.430
And then finally,
the third thing,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.520
we have a bunch of
investment in tooling.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.800
So that's part of how we
make development fast.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.960
We have things like
a developer cycle

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.919
that's less than a second.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Tell me about that.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.210
Less than a second from--

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.390
so when I save my code
to actually running it?

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.240
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah,
running on the device.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.170
LAURENCE MORONEY:
How does that work?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.700
ERIC SEIDEL: Well,
so obviously, we

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.770
have to use the iOS
and Android tools

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.240
to get the code onto the
device in the first place.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.590
But once it's there, then
you just edit your code,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.400
and you hit Save.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.440
And we have this thing
called Hot Reload

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.680
where we inject the new code
into the running Flutter

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.890
system.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.795
And it just updates.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:50.920
You don't restart your app.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.544
You don't change your
place in the app.

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:53.705
The code just changes.

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:54.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.800
I've been a mobile
developer for a while,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.630
so building on various
mobile platforms.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.930
And it's always like,
compile, deploy, wait

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.760
for it to boot up,
wait for it to execute,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.860
wait for the debugger to
start only to find out I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.020
left out a semicolon
or something like that.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.020
So that can be minutes in
some cases with some images.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.570
So by cutting that to a
second, what kind of things

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.900
are you seeing, the impact
that has on developers?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.829
ERIC SEIDEL: Oh, it's
totally changed the way

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.720
we see people develop inside
Google, those who use Flutter.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.520
Some teams we've
seen just literally

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.050
sit with our designers.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.521
And they talk about
painting their app to life.

00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:30.270
We have-- one of our
founding principles--

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see
Bob Ross as you say that.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.840
ERIC SEIDEL: Totally.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.410
Lots of little treats.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.200
But you watch these
teams, and again,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.580
they just hot reload,
hot reload, hot reload,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.140
and their app comes to life.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.435
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.560
That kind of iteration is
made possible by the fact

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.097
that you have Dart as
the programming language?

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:52.680
Is that right?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.763
ERIC SEIDEL: That's right.

00:04:53.763 --> 00:04:55.770
We do use a programming
language that

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.620
hasn't seen a lot of
usage outside Google yet

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.670
but actually gets quite a
bit of usage inside Google,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.210
and that's called Dart.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.480
And we're the first
mobile adaptation of Dart.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.520
And Dart gives us things
like this hot reload.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
one of the confusions

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.551
that I often hear,
particularly when we say, hey,

00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.400
we have a platform for
building for multiple devices,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.840
is that it's a thin veneer
over a web platform.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.799
But Flutter is something
very different, right?

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:19.798
ERIC SEIDEL: Not at all.

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:20.540
That's right.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.830
So Flutter, again, we go
straight to the metal.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.220
We have a custom runtime that
we've built from the ground up.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.870
And we use some best
in breed technologies

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.870
from the rest of Google.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.119
We use Skia, which is this
rendering technology that's

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.884
used in Chrome and Android
and a few other places.

00:05:35.884 --> 00:05:38.300
And we use the text rendering
system, or parts of the text

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.110
rendering system, from Android.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.155
And then we also use, of
course, Dart, the start runtime.

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what does
a Flutter application look like?

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.616
I assume I'm not compiling
a .app or a .apk.

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.490
So what will it look
like if I'm going to iOS

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.650
or going to Android?

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.600
ERIC SEIDEL: So
actually, you are.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.110
So a flutter application
is just an iOS app or just

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.210
an Android app.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.130
Flutter provides, actually,
a view, a Flutter view.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.650
And most people use
those full screen.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.230
And then we paint every single
pixel you see on the screen.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.960
But you can use Flutter
view alongside all the rest

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.540
of your Android views
or your iOS views.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.550
So yeah, you retain
full control.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.420
And you can write as much
Java, or as much Kotlin,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.620
or as much Swift, or
as much Objective C

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.050
in the rest of your application
and then share as much

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.534
as you want between
with Flutter.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: So even
if I have an existing app,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.230
I can start then improving
that using Flutter?

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.570
So it doesn't have to be--

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.570
ERIC SEIDEL: You don't
have to start Greenfield.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.490
And one of the things I noticed
when I was browsing the Flutter

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.100
website is that there's a whole
bunch of controls as well.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.780
So these look--
and I was wondering

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.200
if that leads to maybe some
web confusion because they're

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.420
very web-like controls that you
can have as add-ons to Flutter.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.139
ERIC SEIDEL: So some of that
comes from the inspiration

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:49.680
from the web.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.360
So a lot of my team
started on the web.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.068
I used to work on the
web for many years.

00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:55.579
Our current tech lead, for
example, wrote the HTML5 spec.

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:57.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: Your tech
lead wrote the HTML script?

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.770
OK.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.770
ERIC SEIDEL: There's some
deep roots in the web.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Definitely.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.980
ERIC SEIDEL: But yeah, so we
do share some of the same nouns

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.750
and verbs, as the web does.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.430
We have something
called flexbox.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.740
And so it should feel
very familiar to people

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.790
coming from the web,
but it is not the web.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.605
The technology core
is not the web.

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:16.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it really
feels like a best of both.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.122
ERIC SEIDEL: We hope so.

00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:19.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
say I'm a developer,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.310
and I'm either a mobile web
developer building native apps

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.210
in iOS, Objective-C, Swift, or
in Android in Java [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.610
or maybe I'm a mobile
web developer--

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.890
what advice would you give
me in how to get started

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.350
and how to get productive
really quickly with Flutter?

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.310
ERIC SEIDEL: Sure.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.160
So obviously, all our
docs start at flutter.io.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.450
That's our domain.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.210
But there's also a ton of
YouTube content out there,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.169
people doing tutorials.

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:44.876
LAURENCE MORONEY: One
of the other things

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:46.587
was I know you've just
released the beta.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:47.670
ERIC SEIDEL: That's right.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.100
Just this last week,
we announced beta

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.930
at Mobile World Congress.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.740
We're now starting
to ship regular betas

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.610
that we've vetted
further so they're

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.350
nice and stable for your usage.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.349
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.890
And even though you've been an
alpha and just gone into beta,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.140
I know lots of people have been
using Flutter, and lots of apps

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.520
have been built with Flutter.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.110
Do you have any
particular favorites?

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.901
ERIC SEIDEL: So the
biggest name that folks

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.980
know is the Hamilton for
the "Hamilton" musical.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.590
That app was written
in Flutter last year.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm a
total fan of that musical.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.220
I'm going to start
singing it in a moment

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.428
now that you've mentioned it.

00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:20.040
I have songs going
around in my head.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.330
ERIC SEIDEL: And Google
has released a few apps,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.060
and there's a few
more on the way.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.337
And the community, again,
is just starting to explode.

00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:28.170
We've seen hundreds of
apps already launched

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.721
at the Play Store, and
again, lots more [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:32.220
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, I know you've

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.572
had some really fun
scenarios of things

00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:36.030
that people have
done with Flutter.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.730
I've heard of-- what
was it, some designers

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.100
taking a look at award-winning
designs and then redoing them?

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.350
ERIC SEIDEL: So I know the
story you're talking about.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.430
But yeah, one of the fun
things that we see with Flutter

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.280
is that we have, as
a founding principle,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.650
that you should never have
to say no to your designer.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.270
You should be able to do
anything the phone can do,

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.370
anything your designer
might want to envision.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.200
And so we see
people testing this.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.840
And they go to these
design websites,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.330
and they find the winning
design of that day

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.100
or the winning
design of that month.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.199
And they're like, can
I do that in Flutter.

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:10.740
And most of these designs have
never been done before-- never

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.510
been implented for iOS,
never been for Android,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.593
and they do it on Flutter.

00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:16.150
And one person in
particular in Spain--

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.917
Serge, Serge [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:19.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: Not our Serge?

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.540
ERIC SEIDEL: Not our Serge.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.550
And did a tutorial series
where he took one of these,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.350
and he built it up.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.250
And it's just neat to see
people doing that kind of thing.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.208
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.540
So again, if I want to get
started, it's flutter.io?

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.170
ERIC SEIDEL: That's right.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: And the
beta is now available.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.730
So even if you're
a developer who's

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.502
played with Flutter
before, and maybe it

00:09:37.502 --> 00:09:39.210
wasn't for me because
it was in an alpha,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.477
you get to try the beta.

00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:41.560
ERIC SEIDEL: That's right.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.726
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
flutter.io, download the tools,

00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:44.700
and get started.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.270
Cool.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.186
Well, thank you, Eric.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:47.500
It's been a lot of fun.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500
And thanks, everybody,
for watching this episode

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.490
of "Coffee With a Googler."

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.530
If you have any
questions for me,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.270
or if you have any
questions for Eric,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.140
and if you want to know more
about Flutter, please just

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.515
leave them in the
comments below.

00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:58.280
Thank you so much.
