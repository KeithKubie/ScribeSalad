00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's see if there's a way
to make a risk free profit.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.300
And let me just tell you
right from the get go,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.039
there's usually not
many ways to make

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.500
a risk free profit in the world.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.110
So this is very theoretical.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.232
If the spot price for
gold was $1,000-- so

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:16.440
the spot price literally
just means the market price.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.460
If you were to buy or sell gold
today and actually exchange

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.270
hands, then you
would pay or sell

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.690
the gold for $1,000 per ounce.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.480
And let's also say that the
one year forward settlement

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230
price is $1,200 per ounce.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.770
So if you want to buy
gold one year from now,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.110
you could agree right
now to buy it for $1,200.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.170
Or if you want to sell
gold one year from now,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.280
you could agree right
now to sell it for $1,200

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.410
by entering into a forward,
or futures, contract.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.240
And just the other details, the
interest rate to borrow money

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.960
is 10%, and the carrying cost of
gold is $50 per ounce per year.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
And the carrying cost means,
if I had an ounce of gold,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.730
and I wanted to hold
it responsibly-- I

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.820
wanted to store it, maybe
someplace in a safe at a bank,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.040
and I wanted to insure
it in case it got stolen,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.430
or in case someone lost
it-- that would cost me

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.690
$50 per ounce per year.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.660
So that's what we
mean by carrying cost.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.410
Let's say you could
also invest money risk

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.451
free in this type of a
market-- I've just made up

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.690
these numbers-- for 5% a year.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.530
So, how could you
make the money?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.460
We're assuming you
start with nothing.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.780
So you could literally
just borrow $1,000,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.000
and then you use that
to buy an ounce of gold

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.255
in the spot market, and you also
agree to sell it in the future.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.990
So you enter into
that forward contract.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.015
Let me write this way-- enter
into forward as the seller.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.560
So, on the spot market
you are the buyer,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.900
and on the forward
market, one year from now,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.330
you agree to be the seller.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.320
So, let's just think about
how this is going to play out.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.570
So over the course of the
year, you will have some costs.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.760
You will have to pay the
interest on this $1,000.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.920
That's 10%.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.970
So you're going to
pay $100 in interest.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.190
And you're going to pay the
carrying cost, $50 per ounce.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.490
So $50 carrying cost.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.420
And so, when we end
up a year from now,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:46.782
you will sell the gold $1,200.

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:48.490
And you know you can
do that, because you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.810
entered into the
forward agreement.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:04.070
And then you can pay back the
$1,000 loan plus $100 interest.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.820
And let's say you have
to pay the carrying

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.620
cost at the end of
the year to the bank.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.890
So plus the $50 carrying cost.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.590
So how much did we profit?

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.510
Well, we get $1,200, and
we have to pay back $1,150.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.350
So $1,200 minus $1,000
minus $100 minus $50,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.590
we make a profit of $50.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.200
So the big takeaway here is
that these type of things

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
normally don't exist.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.670
If they did, people would
do it all day and all night.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.720
And this price would
go up, because everyone

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.520
would want to buy on
spot, and this price

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.220
would go down because
everyone would

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.160
want to sell in
the futures market.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.300
Everyone would want
to do this right here.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.100
So the appropriate price
is, this price, based

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.730
on these numbers
right here should not

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.910
be any higher than $1,150.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.980
So, the correct
market price here,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.290
if we didn't want
to risk free profit

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.790
or essentially what the
arbitragers would make

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.360
happen by taking
advantage of this,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.000
it would eventually
go to $1,150.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.970
So it's essentially
the spot price

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.580
plus the cost to borrow
money at that spot

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.062
price plus the carrying cost.

00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:13.520
So that's essentially
what would be

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.760
the rational price for
the futures contract,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.340
or the forward settlement price.
