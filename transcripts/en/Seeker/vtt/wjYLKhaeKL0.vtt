00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.300
If you think about it, DNA is basically nature’s
hard drive.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.410
You are the result of a three-dimensional
computer program, written in tiny compounds

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.660
wound up inside the nucleus of all your cells.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.980
It’s a set of instructions, coded and saved
that our bodies write and read to build proteins,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.910
construct cells, and perform thousands of
other tasks.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.910
Genetic engineering is basically us trying
to hack our own hard drives, and we’re learning

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.779
more about the possibilities of accomplishing
this every day.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.770
But, way back in 1964, a Soviet Physicist
named Mikhail Neiman concocted the idea that

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.010
we could use the compact, efficient, storage
system of DNA to store not nature’s code

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.940
but whatever we wanted!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.030
So far, we’ve been able to decypher parts
of nature’s DNA programming… a gene here,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.270
a few lines of the code there.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.060
We haven’t decoded all of this yet, but
scientists do understand how the storage system

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
works now.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.260
Meaning, we’re real close to putting whatever
pictures or files we want into DNA-storage.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.780
I know that sounds crazy, and it is.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.590
But it’s possible.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.750
In 2013 scientists proved they could write
computer data into synthetic DNA with 0 errors!

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.360
There’s a lot there, so let’s unpack that.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.909
First: They had to teach the computer to speak
DNA…

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.990
Machine language is binary, zeros and ones,
while DNA is A, T, G, and C. I emailed with

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.070
Bill Peck, CTO of Twist Bioscience (they make
synthetic DNA).

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.840
And he explained how they convert from binary
to DNA code.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.909
Basically, like anything in tech these days,
they use an algorithm.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.920
The nice thing is, even though DNA only pairs
A with T and G with C -- these letters can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.409
also be reversed, AT and TA are different
-- this means the data is more dense; there’s

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.300
more data in less space!

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.869
The algorithm does all that translation for
them.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.000
Then they had to create a piece of DNA that
reflected the computer data.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.549
It’s the same DNA that you’d find in your
cells, but they made it in a lab.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.450
Peck described it as “similar to stacking
four colors of Lego bricks into segments.”

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.280
Yes, it really is that simple.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.130
To get the data back out of the DNA, scientists
would sequence it just like they would with

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.620
any other piece of DNA that showed up in a
lab.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.979
And the whole reason they want to do this
in the first place is they can put a LOT of

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.569
data into a tiny space.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.810
With a bit of chemistry and a bit of computer
engineering, this synthetic DNA can store

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.709
data for say -- a trip to Mars, or for long-term
storage of any kind!

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.740
Stretched out, the DNA molecule can be three
meters long, but wound up, it’s tiny.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.320
This alone makes it an ideal long-term storage
system.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.040
But on top of that, hard drives, CDs, flash
drives or tape backups (commonly used by major

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.650
data centers) all need special climate-controlled
facilities, with constant maintenance.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.879
Meanwhile, DNA can survive with minimal effort
under a rock for millennia.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.650
A paper in Science showed a single gram of
DNA can store 215 petabytes of data.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.080
The equivalent to all the space in 420,000
of the most expensive MacBooks on the market.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.140
But Peck believes the upper limit is higher.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
One.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.140
Zettabyte.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.140
That is a LOT of data.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.950
It’s 1.1 trillion gigabytes.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.700
All the internet traffic in the whole world
in 2016 added up to 1.1 zettabytes.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.500
If you filled the iPhone 7 with that data,
you’d need 8.6 billion iPhones.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.239
Stacked together like dominos, they would
go around the planet 1.5 times.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.180
This could theoretically fit in ONE GRAM of
DNA.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.360
The problem is, DNA storage is just too expensive,
and takes too long right now.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.299
But while in 2013 they could encode a few
hundred kilobytes, now in 2017 we’re talking

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.299
zettabytes.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.790
Someday, the molecules that make up all life
as we know it, could be storing backups of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.310
the cat videos and tweets and snaps that you
definitely didn’t save.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.890
Or storing all vital human knowledge in case
of… well, pick your favorite apocalypse.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.459
