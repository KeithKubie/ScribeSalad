00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Weâ€™ve just seen that acceleration somehow depends on force and mass.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're going to design an experiment to figure out how.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First I want to find out how does acceleration relate to force.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Maybe a is proportional to the force.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Maybe it's proportional to 1/F.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Or maybe it's proportional to the force squared or something else. I just don't know yet.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But we can figure it out with an experiment.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this experiment, we're going to take a 10 kg cart--that's its mass--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and we're going to apply differing forces on it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're then going to time how long it takes to go 10 m,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and using some of our motion equations that we learned in the last unit,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we're going to figure out the acceleration.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Once we get enough data, we can see how acceleration depends on force.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For the first one in the experiment, we'll push with a force of 10 Newtons,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and this is a new unit, but it's the unit we use to measure force,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and of course named after Isaac Newton.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We find that it takes a time of 4.47 sec.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, what must the acceleration have been?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You may want to use this equation,

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and remember that the cart is starting from rest. Enter your answer here.
