00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.944
You're the realm's greatest mathematician,

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:13.348
but ever since you criticized 
the Emperor's tax laws,

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:15.249
you've been locked in the dungeon

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.198
with only a marker to count the days.

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:21.358
But one day, you're suddenly brought
before the Emperor

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:24.149
who looks even angrier than usual.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.938
One of his twelve governors has been
convicted of paying his taxes

00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:29.945
with a counterfeit coin

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:33.239
which has already made its way
into the treasury.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.160
As the kingdom's greatest mathematician,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.930
you've been granted a chance to earn
your freedom by identifying the fake.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.099
Before you are the twelve identical
looking coins and a balance scale.

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:50.300
You know that the false coin
will be very slightly lighter or heavier

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.868
than the rest.

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:54.489
But the Emperor's not a patient man.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.979
You may only use the scale three times

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.640
before you'll be thrown back 
into the dungeon.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.829
You look around for anything else
you can use,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.650
but there's nothing in the room -

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.681
just the coins,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.921
the scale,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.952
and your trusty marker.

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:11.317
How do you identify the counterfeit?

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:14.379
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:15.849
Answer in: 3

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.350
Answer in: 2

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.107
Answer in: 1

00:01:19.107 --> 00:01:23.309
Obviously you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others,

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:25.941
so you'll have to weigh several coins
at the same time

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:29.070
by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.648
then narrowing down 
where the false coin is.

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:37.361
Start by dividing the twelve coins
into three equal piles of four.

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:42.201
Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:47.212
If the two sides balance,
all eight coins on the scale are real,

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:50.392
and the fake must be among 
the remaining four.

00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:52.672
So how do you keep track of these results?

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:54.660
That's where the marker comes in.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.170
Mark the eight authentic coins
with a zero.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.822
Now, take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:07.333
If they balance, the remaining 
unmarked coin must be the fake.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:12.181
If they don't, draw a plus on the three
unmarked coins if they're heavier

00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.152
or a minus if they're lighter.

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:19.662
Now, take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other.

00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:22.701
If they balance, the third coin is fake.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:24.612
Otherwise, look at their marks.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:28.553
If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the imposter.

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:31.753
If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one.

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:36.232
But what if the first two piles you weigh
don't balance?

00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:39.082
Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:42.974
and those on the lighter side 
with a minus.

00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:46.173
You can also mark the remaining four coins
with zeros

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:51.524
since you know the fake one
is already somewhere on the scale.

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.414
Now, you'll need to think strategically

00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:58.475
so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more weighings.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:01.944
To do this, you'll need 
to reassemble the piles.

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:04.786
One method is to replace 
three of the plus coins

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:07.113
with three of the minus coins,

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:10.953
and replace those 
with three of the zero coins.

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:13.423
&gt;From here, you have three possibilities.

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:17.475
If the previously heavier side of
the scale is still heavier,

00:03:17.475 --> 00:03:20.725
that means either the remaining
plus coin on that side

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:22.826
is actually the heavier one,

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:25.756
or the remaining
minus coin on the lighter side

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:28.235
is actually the lighter one.

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:31.915
Choose either one of them, and weigh
it against one of the regular coins

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.735
to see which is true.

00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:36.466
If the previously heavier side
became lighter,

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.236
that means one of the three minus
coins you moved

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:41.507
is actually the lighter one.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:43.706
Weigh two of them against each other.

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:46.666
If they balance, the third is counterfeit.

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:49.765
If not, the lighter one is.

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:53.596
Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution,

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:56.546
then one of the three plus coins
you removed

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:58.526
must be the heavier one.

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:00.527
Weigh two of them against each other.

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:03.588
If they balance, the third one is fake.

00:04:03.588 --> 00:04:07.068
If not, then it's the heavier one.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:10.076
The Emperor nods approvingly
at your finding,

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:13.476
and the counterfeiting Lord
takes your place in the dungeon.
