00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.302
- I wanted to map my
experience as an improviser

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:08.307
becoming Trump to the movie
Tootsie and just do a tootsie

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.811
and have me teaching
improve, open the same way

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.647
as Tootsie. You gotta
work and you gotta do this

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.683
and then I can't job and
the I wear the orange wig

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.153
which is just like tootsie,
she's got read hair

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.321
and then just do the beats of it

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:25.658
and then reveal myself like
the republican convention.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.660
- Oh man that still could happen

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.662
- I think it would be a
great special idea now

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.597
we've put it out on a comedy
central

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.166
affiliated radio program

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.235
- Yes, there all listening,
or at least pretending to

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.104
- Now it has to happen, exactly

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:41.040
(rock music)

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.376
- I had something happen
to me this weekend

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.944
that I just want to
celebrate before we get

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:47.380
into anything else, is
that I left my purse

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.182
in a cab yesterday.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.350
It was devastating.

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:56.189
But I mean, I always say
because I practice meditation,

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.758
I didn't freak out. I really
think that's the reason

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.927
that I don't, because
generally I would just go

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.696
Oh my god, you're such
fucking idiot, yell at myself

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.899
and my passport was in there,

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.035
and that's my only for of
identification

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.904
because I dropped my ID on the
street

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:16.209
and I got to my apartment
and I'm getting ready to go,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.112
Andrew and I were coming
back from Philadelphia

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.482
we took the train, train to
a cab, cab to my apartment,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.118
got out, and we're up in my
apartment.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.221
I'm there for an hour before
I realize my purse is gone

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.057
- How are you paying for
stuff, did you just a wallet

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.492
or something also?

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.661
- I took my keys out of my
bag while I was on the train,

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.431
because I was like I just
want these on my person

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.733
I don't know, I probably saw it
coming.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.402
I feel like I've set
myself up to lose my purse,

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.571
because I was able to get in my
apartment,

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.773
- Some part of your mind
- Knew

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:51.144
- And also, like, some
part of your mind both knew

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.080
- But also was like "I'm leaving
this"

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.515
- Yes!

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.749
That's the interesting thing

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.252
- Yes what did I want to leave
in that think, I don't know

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.088
because here's the thing
I get in my apartment

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.258
and honestly once I
realize I lost my purse

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.827
I'm like the only thing
I really need in there

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.429
is my passport, eventually,
but not until I need

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:13.599
to travel next which could
be for a couple weeks

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:17.003
and I've lost my ID before on a
trip

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.505
and it's a little bit of a
hassle,

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:22.775
but you can get through
security at the airport.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.010
But then,

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.280
so I go online and I file the
reports,

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:32.218
and it's Sunday so you can't
get someone on the phone

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.686
and I was just like that's fine

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.055
- Were you certain at this
point that it was in a cab

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:37.890
- Yeah because I remembered

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:41.194
- [Tom] Because you knew
you had it on the train

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.062
- Is it gone?
- Stay tuned

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:46.866
- So I've remembered, I was
really taking myself through

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:47.867
the steps

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.136
- Stay tuned I'm going
to tell you right now

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.339
- Yeah stay tuned, at the end
of the sentence you will know,

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:57.343
that I got my bag back
and we'll be right back.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.481
So I remember, yeah you just
start trying to remember

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:05.251
the last time, you felt it or
held it.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:07.753
and I definitely didn't
leave it on the train

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.055
- [Tom] (mumbles)

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.558
- And I was, It's definitely
in the cab and then,

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.595
Andrew was at my apartment, at
the time,

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.063
we were about to go to lunch,

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.397
so I was like, where's my purse?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.066
I gotta grab it because my
wallet-

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.567
and I was like "oh no"

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.836
and he was freaking out a
little bit more than I was,

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.339
I was like it's fine, I
can pay for things with-

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.508
I have a bunch of cash, just
from, just a

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:32.245
drawer of cash- I shouldn't say
that.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.747
- Yeah, yeah...and
where do you live again?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.882
(laughter)

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.218
- I had enough cash to get me by
and then

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.687
I also, you can just pay
for things electronically.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.856
- [Tom] Yeah like on your phone
and stuff.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.125
- I use my CVS app to pay for
things, I...

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:47.460
You can use ApplePay.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.528
- Yeah

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.097
- Starbucks, like the
things I buy are all app.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.365
- Based anyway.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.468
- Yeah, Postmates? I
don't know when I even pay

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.069
for things with a credit card
anymore.

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.138
- That's true, Seamless
is just a thing where

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.374
I'm like, just food comes
when I press this button.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.776
- It's amazing, I used it
for the first time last week

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:04.944
and I was like, oh my god this
works.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.078
- For the first time!

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.213
- Like on my phone, on my
phone for the first time.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.048
I have used Seamless a
couple of times before...

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:10.816
- On like a personal computer?

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.151
- Yeah I usually get it on a
computer.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:13.386
- On like an old Dell?

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.553
- Yeah, yeah

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:15.655
(laughter)

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:18.090
- I unload an old Dell,
that guy that pops out of

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.326
the box, dude you're getting
some food.

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.295
- You know the Dell dude
is a Proud Boy, right?

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.229
- Is that right!

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.063
- No

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:24.897
(laughter)

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.965
- Dude I would've totally bought
it,

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:27.466
you could've said that
he is dead or a Proud Boy

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.736
I would've been like
yeah that makes sense.

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:34.106
- But I, I called, I was
really just like, oh well

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.176
this is life, things could
be so much worse than

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.912
losing your stupid purse
like, who cares, I was like

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:42.248
let's just go to lunch I
filled all the things and

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.084
because there is, and
oh, I didn't know this

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:49.322
you go "lost item cab",
google that, sends you to a

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.258
website, you file a report
and then they make you pay

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.092
30 dollars

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:53.926
- That's a scam.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.294
- To place your ad

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.462
- That's a scam.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:59.298
I almost did the same
thing for Nintendo switch

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:01.334
and people were like, don't do
this.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.836
- I did because I'm like
whatever

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.372
and I can pay electronically,
I don't even need my

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:07.940
purse to pay for this loss.

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.975
- Too convenient not to spend
the money.

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:11.610
- You're placing an ad where?

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:12.611
I don't even understand.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:13.545
- [Tom] Exactly

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.448
- I was so angry, not because I
had to pay

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.850
the 30 dollars but people
who lose their shit

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:20.953
like, no one has 30, and
then they make you pay

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.889
to get something back-
it's just ridiculous.

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.726
Couldn't get someone on the
phone, and it almost nice

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.362
because then I would've been
on hold and I wouldn't have

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.330
been able to go to lunch
which is kind of nice

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:32.965
when you're like, well I've
done all that I could do

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.800
I am powerless, yes, exactly.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.471
And, so then I went to
lunch and I felt really

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.572
fine about it

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:45.344
and I went back home hours
later and I'm getting no emails,

00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:48.247
I called a bunch of different
places and they give you

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.752
the cab company and I called
them, it doesn't matter.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:56.756
I had resigned myself to like,
losing my purse and sending

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.025
my, Jen, our producer and
my assistant on like a

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:03.095
wild goose chase to
obtain me some kind of ID

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:06.165
which I don't even know
how I begin to do that.

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:09.335
And then I get a call
from like a weird number

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.936
and I pick it up and I'm like,
yes!

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.506
And its like hey Nikki this
is Ron from the DC Improv

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.441
which I will be at next weekend.

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:16.642
- Yes queen.

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.913
- This guy calls me from the
DC Improv and press falling

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:23.182
because says DC Improv
and I'm like oh its gonna,

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:24.383
its not my purse.

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:25.451
- Yes

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:28.087
- And he goes, Nikki, its
Ron from the DC Improv,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.855
where is your purse hon.

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:32.358
And I'm like, that's a creepy
way to just say that you

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.794
know someone has my purse, just
tell me,

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.530
- Do you know where your kid is?

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.366
- Just when people kind
of like, shame you about

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.537
the thing that, like, so
where is your purse Nikki?

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.706
And kind of like a, are
we doing a treasure hunt?

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:50.042
Just be not, just tell me what
you know.

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:53.379
So I know, I don't know, do you
know?

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:56.382
And he's like, I do
know, someone called me.

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.416
And I'm like-

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:58.250
- What?

00:06:58.283 --> 00:06:59.652
- Why would they have called
you?

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.055
So, some guy finds my purse
in the cab, he was the

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:06.258
second passenger after I
had gotten out of the cab

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.561
to get in, so someone
just sat next to my purse

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.896
and was like "eh I'm not even
gonna tell the cab driver"

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:11.764
- Yeah

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.801
- What kind of person
just gets in and doesn't,

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.671
first of all take any
money or anything, like,

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.072
just leaves it.

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:21.974
- Yeah I would at least
take money and leave.

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:24.743
- I mean you take something and
leave it.

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:27.146
- I feel like all of
you are probably in some

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.815
hidden camera show about
morality or some shit.

00:07:29.848 --> 00:07:31.417
- Oh that's interesting, yeah.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.285
- That would be great, I would
be like,

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:35.354
yeah I don't give a fuck.

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:36.188
(laughter)

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:37.356
- Do I still get the money?

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.024
- I won't sign the release
and all you got is a

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:40.092
blurred face.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:41.861
- Yeah and I get the cash.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.463
- Yeah...well I, and
this is the benefit of

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:47.766
a just terrible purse, like
just a terrible looking.

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:50.169
It just, I use a tote
bag that I got from H&amp;M

00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:52.505
that they give you to put
your clothes in they leave.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.341
Like instead of plastic they
give you a reusable bag,

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.511
that's what I use as my purse
because I just don't care.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.679
And so I think someone was
probably like

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:03.616
this is a bag of trash,
which it looks like that too

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.285
with a wallet in it, but
there is so much trash inside.

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:09.555
And the guy, I guess the
guy got in and he riffled

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:13.726
through it, I had a lot
of different things,

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.028
- Oh yeah but you didn't
have a phone in there.

00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:16.996
- [Nikki] No phone, no.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.164
- So how did he contact you.

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.165
- So I think he opened my
passport, he opened a check

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.301
I have from the weekend working
in Philly,

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.670
he found out it was, he googled
me,

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:27.973
went to my website, saw that
the next place I would be

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:28.974
was the DC Improv

00:08:29.007 --> 00:08:29.842
- Wow

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:32.811
- [Nikki] A lot of different
ways to get in touch

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:34.012
with me...well...

00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:37.149
- Or you can just walk in to
any comedy club in New York

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:39.652
- DM me, oh yeah, there
is that old thing of like,

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.654
well I don't have any of
my New York dates listed

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:44.189
on my website so I don't,
but yes, it is easy

00:08:44.222 --> 00:08:47.059
we've established that is
very easy to murder me.

00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:49.995
If you wanted to murder me,
or any stand up comedian.

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:51.864
- Any comedian, we're just
putting our information

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:52.698
out there.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:53.832
- Just go to my website-

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.669
- But also appearing in
public constantly, at any time

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:57.770
someone could murder you.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:01.840
- And there is no like,
metal detectors walking into

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.610
a show, like anyone could
come murder me any night.

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:06.579
- Yeah we need metal detectors.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:09.748
- And it'll be weird to play
this someday when it happens

00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:11.183
and be like, she predicted it.

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.852
I just like to get ahead of
things.

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:17.523
But, and then music
starts, and then she died.

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:18.624
(laughter)

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:21.427
I can see how it's all going
to be edited down later,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.029
Jen have fun with that.

00:09:24.062 --> 00:09:26.933
But my post to you
miss...whatever.

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:32.771
So they guy, I get the guy's
number from the DC Improv

00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:36.041
guy, I call him and he's
like, he was so funny, he goes

00:09:36.074 --> 00:09:38.377
yeah I opened your purse and
I realized, this girl's day

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.213
is going to be ruined in 6
different ways because she

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:43.549
doesn't have this bag,
because I had weed in there,

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.819
I had a check, I had
eyedrops, I had, I had so many

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.822
things that I looked
at the bag to be like,

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.991
what would you thing of this
person

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:52.959
- That so funny.

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.094
- You would just think
it's a trash person.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.830
- Such a chronic weed habit she
needs eyedrops on the ready.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:01.333
- I really do, I keep
those things all the time.

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:02.234
- I know I do.

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:03.936
- Do you smoke weed?

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:04.937
- Yeah

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.904
- You do!

00:10:05.937 --> 00:10:07.640
- You're busted this is a cop
broadcast.

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.274
- This is a cop broadcast!

00:10:09.307 --> 00:10:10.142
- Oh man

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:15.080
I got busted in Ludlow, and
had PBA card and got off

00:10:15.113 --> 00:10:16.415
and got my weed handed back to
me.

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:17.416
- Wow that's tight

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.251
- Wait, we gotta get to
that after the break,

00:10:19.284 --> 00:10:21.086
all I wanna say is thank
you to Bryan because

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:25.090
he, I called Bryan, I get
Bryan's number and he is like,

00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:28.827
he said that he had heard
some Tom Segura bit where

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.031
he was like, it was
really weird because I,

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.667
Tom Segura has this bit
about, you know you found

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.669
someone's walled and he was
just hoping that it would

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:38.203
be someone famous, or
someone and it was just some

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:41.106
normal dude and didn't
matter and he was like,

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:43.676
you know and the I opened
yours and it was like

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.511
a famous comedian, and
it felt nice that he

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:48.213
thought I was famous or
whatever but he, he came to

00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:51.617
my apartment on his day off
and, from the Upper West side,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.119
he was like, no I'll come
to you and brought it to me

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:56.655
I tried to give him 100
dollars, he wouldn't take it,

00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:59.792
I said, he dropped that he
had a girlfriend very quickly

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.227
- Ahh just say was he hot, this
could've been a love story.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.463
- Which I was like damn
this could've been so good.

00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.465
He was adorable and I was
like, can I do anything

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:07.900
and he was like my fiance and I

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.668
will come to a show sometime.

00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:12.538
- Yeah right, great, thanks
Bryan.

00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:17.142
- Bryan just let me give
you money, but he wouldn't

00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:19.211
accept the money, I got
my purse back and I just,

00:11:19.244 --> 00:11:22.681
it was just so nice, it
just, I needed that yesterday

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:26.485
so badly. I just spend a
lot of time on Instagram

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.854
reading, that's where I get my
news

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:31.156
- Yeah, I do it with the Twitter
moments.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.825
- Your news is pictures.

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.327
- I know and Twitter moment,
and Reddit, just like,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.330
being said about the world
and like, we're never

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:41.200
going to respect animals or
the planet and I was just like

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.870
everyone is trash, and then
Bryan brings me my bag of

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:47.573
trash back, and I really
screamed down the street

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:51.443
I needed you today Bryan,
I was so, it just made me

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:52.745
feel so good.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.280
But I do feel like if you're
spending enough money,

00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:58.784
if you take cabs in the city
you are probably well off

00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:01.453
enough to now steal from a
purse.

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.689
- It's funny I thought that
about the airport though,

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:06.191
I thought, well if you're
at the airport, you're not

00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:08.026
going to steal something, you've
already

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.762
gotten to the airport.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:13.866
- I leave my bag all the time
unattended, but your switch,

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.767
you left it

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.468
- And then somebody took it
though

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:17.636
- At the airport?

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:18.837
- [Tom] Yeah.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.472
- I mean I get that, that free
entertainment in the plane

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:21.640
- That's a good point, damn.

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.542
- I agree I don't, I
don't think there is a

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:24.443
difference between-

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:25.711
- Did you steal my fucking
switch?

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:27.646
- Yeah, I do I'm the switch.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.748
- If you're name would've
been on it, you would've

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:31.717
gotten it back, I don't, but
if I find something, like,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.987
there was a sweater at TSA
that was just hanging on,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.057
like, someone had lost a
sweater left it at TSA,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.828
and it was hanging there on
the sign, waiting for a girl

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:44.563
to come back and get, and I just
knew-

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:46.565
- You can't play MarioKart on a
sweater.

00:12:46.598 --> 00:12:47.733
- That's a good point.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.635
- But I just knew no one
was coming back for this,

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:51.336
that this sweater was going to
end up in the lost and found

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:54.306
it was a cute sweater, I'm
going to take it, so that's

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:56.675
kind of like the switch
thing, like how am I gonna get

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:57.909
this back to this guy.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:00.245
- Yeah that's a good point,
I mean, I did, I did the same

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:02.648
the thing you did where I
looked in all that stuff

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.083
where you file the report
and that how I found out that

00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:06.852
that was a scam, the 30 dollar
thing.

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:09.254
Because I had called the
airport and they were like,

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:11.857
yeah if somebody turns it in,
we have it but nobody did.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.159
- I couldn't be bothered,
if I lost something ,

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:15.761
I would be like, I'm not, I do
not,

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.429
I cannot file any paperwork.

00:13:17.462 --> 00:13:19.298
- It was only because I
was half way through Zelda

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.000
- Oh my god Sarah Silverman
is waving to us and

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.535
that just made my morning.

00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:26.972
- Sarah and I are just
tracking each other today.

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.775
- I know she's, she is not
coming here I don't know

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:34.446
how we didn't get her but,
they have a busy morning

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.115
but, I can just do her right
now;

00:13:37.148 --> 00:13:41.453
"Hey Nikki, it's so good
to be here, you're so funny

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:43.388
and I really look up to you,

00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:45.324
oh is the other way around?
Nevermind"

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.960
(laughter)

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.396
(rock music)
