across all these scenarios alright let's
dive into code so first of all we need

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720
dive into code so first of all we need
 

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.690

suddenly your app needs to go across the
 

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.020
suddenly your app needs to go across the
network to download all those songs and

so not only is this a bad experience

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:20.510
so not only is this a bad experience

the common pitfalls or mistakes that
 

00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:56.330
the common pitfalls or mistakes that
people tend to make so in this example

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340
people tend to make so in this example
 

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.389
people tend to make so in this example
here and we have a media app that can

00:23:59.389 --> 00:23:59.399
here and we have a media app that can
 

00:23:59.399 --> 00:24:01.490
here and we have a media app that can
play radio and a separate state

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500
play radio and a separate state
 

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.860
play radio and a separate state
separates it down into local radio and

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:03.870
separates it down into local radio and
 

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.299
separates it down into local radio and
further breaks it down into different

further breaks it down into different
 

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:09.169
further breaks it down into different
genres like jazz or pop or other types

of music in this case the user has to
 

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.879
of music in this case the user has to
click at least three times before they

00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:13.889
click at least three times before they
 

00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:16.129
click at least three times before they
can reach the first playable item so

00:24:16.129 --> 00:24:16.139
can reach the first playable item so
 

00:24:16.139 --> 00:24:17.509
can reach the first playable item so
this deep nest thing is actually not

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:17.519
this deep nest thing is actually not
 

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:19.399
this deep nest thing is actually not
very good because you can imagine again

00:24:19.399 --> 00:24:19.409
very good because you can imagine again
 

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:21.289

they can do anything so again in this
case you should really try to surface

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:27.690

so what does this mean for the app

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620
so what does this mean for the app
 

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.549
so what does this mean for the app
developers well this means is you should

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559
developers well this means is you should
 

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.499
developers well this means is you should
not shrunk a your content trees

00:24:57.499 --> 00:24:57.509
not shrunk a your content trees
 

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:00.769
not shrunk a your content trees
prematurely in this example the user has

00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:00.779
prematurely in this example the user has

prematurely in this example the user has
finally gone to the jazz section and

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:02.610
finally gone to the jazz section and
 

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.430
finally gone to the jazz section and
there's actually just two stations

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440
there's actually just two stations
 

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.310
there's actually just two stations
because everything else got cut off so

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320
because everything else got cut off so
 

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.510
because everything else got cut off so
let's try not to do that

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520
 
 

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.700
 
so the last thing i want to talk about

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:14.710
so the last thing i want to talk about
 

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.789
so the last thing i want to talk about
content browser it's if your data is

00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799
content browser it's if your data is
 

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:20.139
content browser it's if your data is
dynamic so for example you're a media

00:25:20.139 --> 00:25:20.149
dynamic so for example you're a media
 

00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:22.120
dynamic so for example you're a media

now that we talked about media browsing

00:25:41.889 --> 00:25:41.899
now that we talked about media browsing
 

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:44.560
now that we talked about media browsing
let's take a look at media session so

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:44.570
let's take a look at media session so
 

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.620
let's take a look at media session so
the media session serves two purposes

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:46.630
the media session serves two purposes
 

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.200
the media session serves two purposes
first it lets you update send updates to

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:50.210
first it lets you update send updates to
 

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.810
first it lets you update send updates to
us about playback States or metadata

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:52.820
us about playback States or metadata
 

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.620
us about playback States or metadata
changes also allows us to remote control

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:56.630
changes also allows us to remote control
 

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:02.169
changes also allows us to remote control
playback inside your media app so here

00:26:02.169 --> 00:26:02.179
playback inside your media app so here
 

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:04.019
playback inside your media app so here
we have our Media Browser service again

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:04.029
we have our Media Browser service again
 

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.310
we have our Media Browser service again
this time let's take a look at the

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320
this time let's take a look at the
 

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.610
this time let's take a look at the
oncreate method inside of on create we

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:09.620
oncreate method inside of on create we
 

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.950
oncreate method inside of on create we
instantiate a media session object and

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960
instantiate a media session object and
 

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.769
instantiate a media session object and
the first thing that we do is we take

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:14.779
the first thing that we do is we take
 

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:16.659
the first thing that we do is we take
its to a session token and we set it as

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:16.669
its to a session token and we set it as
 

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:18.340
its to a session token and we set it as
the session token for the Media Browser

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.350
the session token for the Media Browser
 

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.919
the session token for the Media Browser
service now this is important because

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:20.929
service now this is important because
 

00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:22.720
service now this is important because
when Android auto connects through your

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:22.730
when Android auto connects through your
 

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.460
when Android auto connects through your
media app the first thing it does is

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:24.470
media app the first thing it does is
 

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.169
media app the first thing it does is
they retrieves this session token and

00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:26.179
they retrieves this session token and
 

00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:28.750
they retrieves this session token and
creates a Media Browser media controller

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760
creates a Media Browser media controller
 

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.850
creates a Media Browser media controller
object which is then used to control

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:30.860
object which is then used to control
 

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:36.730
object which is then used to control
playback and receive updates also there

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:36.740
playback and receive updates also there
 

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.710
playback and receive updates also there
is the media session callback which we

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720
is the media session callback which we
 

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.510
is the media session callback which we
use to handle a playback event which you

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520
use to handle a playback event which you
 

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.060
use to handle a playback event which you
will implement to handle playback events

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.070
will implement to handle playback events
 

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.889
will implement to handle playback events
from Android auto we'll take a closer

00:26:44.889 --> 00:26:44.899
from Android auto we'll take a closer
 

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:47.399
from Android auto we'll take a closer
look at this in the next slide and

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:47.409
look at this in the next slide and
 

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:50.370
look at this in the next slide and
finally remember when everything is done

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:50.380
finally remember when everything is done
 

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.350
finally remember when everything is done
release the media session this frees up

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360
release the media session this frees up
 

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.510
release the media session this frees up
any system resources and actually tells

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520
any system resources and actually tells
 

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.919
any system resources and actually tells
Android auto that you're finished play

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:56.929
Android auto that you're finished play
 

00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:59.260
Android auto that you're finished play
so we can clean up any leftover UI

00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.270
so we can clean up any leftover UI
 

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.830
so we can clean up any leftover UI
elements

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840
 
 

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.169
 
all right so here's our sample media

00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179
all right so here's our sample media
 

00:27:06.179 --> 00:27:08.930
all right so here's our sample media
session callback so the methods here

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940
session callback so the methods here
 

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.360
session callback so the methods here
allow the callback object to handle

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:11.370
allow the callback object to handle
 

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.029
allow the callback object to handle
various playback events you overwrite

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039
various playback events you overwrite
 

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:16.130
various playback events you overwrite
them as you need so for example if your

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140
them as you need so for example if your
 

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.210
them as you need so for example if your
app is a streaming radio app and then

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220
app is a streaming radio app and then
 

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.070
app is a streaming radio app and then
maybe you don't need the on script to

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080
maybe you don't need the on script to
 

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.390
maybe you don't need the on script to
Next button because that doesn't make

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400
Next button because that doesn't make
 

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.430
Next button because that doesn't make
any sense so in that case you can simply

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440
any sense so in that case you can simply
 

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.000
any sense so in that case you can simply
leave that as the default implementation

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.010
leave that as the default implementation
 

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.310
leave that as the default implementation
now in the case of a on play or on

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
now in the case of a on play or on
 

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.919
now in the case of a on play or on
resume you should check if your media

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:33.929
resume you should check if your media
 

00:27:33.929 --> 00:27:36.200
resume you should check if your media
session is active if your media session

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.210
session is active if your media session
 

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.510
session is active if your media session
is not active set it to active and this

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520
is not active set it to active and this
 

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.830
is not active set it to active and this
tells Android auto that you're in fact

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840
tells Android auto that you're in fact
 

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.659
tells Android auto that you're in fact
playing and that we can surface your

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:41.669
playing and that we can surface your
 

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:44.240

we want to talk about here is the on

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:49.230
we want to talk about here is the on
 

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.100
we want to talk about here is the on
play from media ID so this method is

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:52.110
play from media ID so this method is
 

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.110
play from media ID so this method is
invoked when a user goes through the

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120
invoked when a user goes through the

children call so you can imagine the

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620
children call so you can imagine the
 

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.799
children call so you can imagine the
media ID should be unique and it should

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:12.809
media ID should be unique and it should
 

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:14.480
media ID should be unique and it should
be persisted so you can find the right

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:14.490
be persisted so you can find the right
 

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.480
be persisted so you can find the right
song to play when the user clicks on it

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:17.490
song to play when the user clicks on it
 

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:23.570
song to play when the user clicks on it
I note about voice support so if you

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580
I note about voice support so if you
 

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.029
I note about voice support so if you
want your app to support command through

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039
want your app to support command through
 

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.720
want your app to support command through
voice like play jazz on my media app

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:28.730
voice like play jazz on my media app
 

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.700
voice like play jazz on my media app
you'll first need to specify intent

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:31.710
you'll first need to specify intent
 

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.159
you'll first need to specify intent
filter inside your manifest file this

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:34.169
filter inside your manifest file this
 

00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:35.990
filter inside your manifest file this
basically tells us that you are able to

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000
basically tells us that you are able to
 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.659
basically tells us that you are able to
handle playback from search so when the

00:28:38.659 --> 00:28:38.669
handle playback from search so when the
 

00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:40.970
handle playback from search so when the
user issues the actual command we'll

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980
user issues the actual command we'll
 

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.159
user issues the actual command we'll
launch your app and the on play from

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:43.169
launch your app and the on play from
 

00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:46.220
launch your app and the on play from
search call will be invoked now you will

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.230
search call will be invoked now you will
 

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.620
search call will be invoked now you will
be passed through the query and a set of

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:48.630
be passed through the query and a set of
 

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.860
be passed through the query and a set of
extras so if the query first of all is

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:51.870
extras so if the query first of all is
 

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.320
extras so if the query first of all is
empty you should still try to play

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:54.330
empty you should still try to play
 

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.120
empty you should still try to play
something back because this tells the

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.130
something back because this tells the
 

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.740
something back because this tells the
user that your app is responsive and

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:57.750
user that your app is responsive and
 

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.250
user that your app is responsive and
that their action has taken place now if

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260
that their action has taken place now if
 

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.510
that their action has taken place now if
they query is valid

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520
they query is valid
 

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.570
they query is valid
you can try to parse the query yourself

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580
you can try to parse the query yourself
 

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.100
you can try to parse the query yourself
or you can listen inside the extras and

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.110
or you can listen inside the extras and
 

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.840
or you can listen inside the extras and
will pass your information such as title

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:08.850
will pass your information such as title
 

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.220
will pass your information such as title
album or artist name

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.230
album or artist name
 

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.649
album or artist name
and finally if you can't actually find

00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:13.659
and finally if you can't actually find
 

00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:15.930
and finally if you can't actually find
this on that's okay just showing error

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:15.940
this on that's okay just showing error
 

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.659
this on that's okay just showing error
again this is to tell the user that your

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:18.669
again this is to tell the user that your
 

00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:24.419
again this is to tell the user that your
app is responsive so now let's look at

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:24.429
app is responsive so now let's look at
 

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.310
app is responsive so now let's look at
some of the updates that your apps can

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320
some of the updates that your apps can
 

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.680
some of the updates that your apps can
send over to Android auto first of all

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:28.690
send over to Android auto first of all
 

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.960
send over to Android auto first of all
there's the metadata object this

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:30.970
there's the metadata object this
 

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.509
there's the metadata object this
contains things like title artist or

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519
contains things like title artist or
 

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:36.210
contains things like title artist or
album art and let's focus a little on

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:36.220
album art and let's focus a little on
 

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.549
album art and let's focus a little on
album art here as you saw earlier in the

the interesting part that we care about

00:38:33.509 --> 00:38:33.519
the interesting part that we care about
 

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:36.239
the interesting part that we care about
here is where we extend it with an a car

00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:36.249
here is where we extend it with an a car
 

00:38:36.249 --> 00:38:41.789
here is where we extend it with an a car
extender object one tip that I want to

00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:41.799
extender object one tip that I want to
 

00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:45.449
extender object one tip that I want to
to pass on is if your app is actually

00:38:45.449 --> 00:38:45.459
to pass on is if your app is actually
 

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:48.749
to pass on is if your app is actually
checking to see if Android auto is

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:48.759
checking to see if Android auto is
 

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:50.939
checking to see if Android auto is
present before extending the

00:38:50.939 --> 00:38:50.949
present before extending the
 

00:38:50.949 --> 00:38:52.890
present before extending the
notification we're recommending we

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:52.900
notification we're recommending we
 

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.839
notification we're recommending we
recommend not checking for the existence

00:38:54.839 --> 00:38:54.849
recommend not checking for the existence
 

00:38:54.849 --> 00:38:57.329
recommend not checking for the existence
of the Android auto package since that's

00:38:57.329 --> 00:38:57.339
of the Android auto package since that's
 

00:38:57.339 --> 00:38:59.910
of the Android auto package since that's
not very reliable instead you can use

00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920
not very reliable instead you can use
 

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.459
not very reliable instead you can use
the UI mode manager and see if Android

00:39:02.459 --> 00:39:02.469
the UI mode manager and see if Android
 

00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:07.620
the UI mode manager and see if Android
auto is running car mode so let's look

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:07.630
auto is running car mode so let's look
 

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.919
auto is running car mode so let's look
at the unread conversation object first

00:39:10.919 --> 00:39:10.929
at the unread conversation object first
 

00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:12.359
at the unread conversation object first
I think will be useful to define some

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:12.369
I think will be useful to define some
 

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:15.839
I think will be useful to define some
definitions so a message is essentially

00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:15.849
definitions so a message is essentially
 

00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:18.539
definitions so a message is essentially
just a short length of text that allows

00:39:18.539 --> 00:39:18.549
just a short length of text that allows
 

00:39:18.549 --> 00:39:20.459
just a short length of text that allows
Android auto that Android auto will read

00:39:20.459 --> 00:39:20.469
Android auto that Android auto will read
 

00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:23.519
Android auto that Android auto will read
out to the user it's best to not make

00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:23.529
out to the user it's best to not make
 

00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:26.609
out to the user it's best to not make
these messages too long a conversation

00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:26.619
these messages too long a conversation
 

00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:28.410
these messages too long a conversation
essentially is a collection of messages

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:28.420
essentially is a collection of messages
 

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.059
essentially is a collection of messages
that are grouped together in some way

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:30.069
that are grouped together in some way
 

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:33.269
that are grouped together in some way
and typically messages between user and

00:39:33.269 --> 00:39:33.279
and typically messages between user and
 

00:39:33.279 --> 00:39:39.419
and typically messages between user and
another person will be a conversation so

00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:39.429
another person will be a conversation so
 

00:39:39.429 --> 00:39:41.009
another person will be a conversation so
with that an emetic conversation is

00:39:41.009 --> 00:39:41.019
with that an emetic conversation is
 

00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:43.109
with that an emetic conversation is
actually just a set of unread messages

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119
actually just a set of unread messages
 

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:45.989
actually just a set of unread messages
for a particular conversation okay so

00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:45.999
for a particular conversation okay so
 

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:47.999
for a particular conversation okay so
what goes inside this conversation this

00:39:47.999 --> 00:39:48.009
what goes inside this conversation this
 

00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:50.219
what goes inside this conversation this
unread conversation you can pass any

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:50.229
unread conversation you can pass any
 

00:39:50.229 --> 00:39:52.289
unread conversation you can pass any
conversation name this is the text that

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:52.299
conversation name this is the text that
 

00:39:52.299 --> 00:39:54.660
conversation name this is the text that
gets appeared that gets presented to the

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:54.670
gets appeared that gets presented to the
 

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.489
gets appeared that gets presented to the
user when Android auto presents an

00:39:56.489 --> 00:39:56.499
user when Android auto presents an
 

00:39:56.499 --> 00:40:00.120
user when Android auto presents an
unread a message obviously you pass in

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.130
unread a message obviously you pass in
 

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.910
unread a message obviously you pass in
the actual messages there might be more

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920
the actual messages there might be more
 

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.969
the actual messages there might be more
than one and in this case when you set

00:40:05.969 --> 00:40:05.979
than one and in this case when you set
 

00:40:05.979 --> 00:40:09.059
than one and in this case when you set
the timestamp for these messages include

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:09.069
the timestamp for these messages include
 

00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:10.620
the timestamp for these messages include
the time stamped for

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:10.630
the time stamped for
 

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:15.569
the time stamped for
the most recent message and there are

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:15.579
the most recent message and there are
 

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.759
the most recent message and there are
two remaining ones the red pending

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440
messages also please do think about how
 

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.849

this works for group chats we recommend

00:40:44.849 --> 00:40:44.859
this works for group chats we recommend
 

00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:47.249
this works for group chats we recommend
actually just testing out the flow and

00:40:47.249 --> 00:40:47.259
actually just testing out the flow and
 

00:40:47.259 --> 00:40:49.499
actually just testing out the flow and
seeing if when the user is reading back

00:40:49.499 --> 00:40:49.509
seeing if when the user is reading back
 

00:40:49.509 --> 00:40:51.690
seeing if when the user is reading back
the message if it's an actual as it's a

the message if it's an actual as it's a
good user experience alright okay so the

00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:58.299
good user experience alright okay so the
 

00:40:58.299 --> 00:41:00.569
good user experience alright okay so the
