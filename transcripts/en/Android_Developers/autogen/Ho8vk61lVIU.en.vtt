hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.470
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.060
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animations and today I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
graphics and animations and today I
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.530
graphics and animations and today I
wanted to talk a little bit about window

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
wanted to talk a little bit about window
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.709
wanted to talk a little bit about window
animations in another show that we did

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
animations in another show that we did
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.510
animations in another show that we did
we saw a little bit about view

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
we saw a little bit about view
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.510
we saw a little bit about view
animations which are the animation API

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
animations which are the animation API
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460
animations which are the animation API
is that you can use for releases prior

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
is that you can use for releases prior
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.370
is that you can use for releases prior
to 3.0 there's a more complete animation

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
to 3.0 there's a more complete animation
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.550
to 3.0 there's a more complete animation
system starting with 3.0 but if you're

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
system starting with 3.0 but if you're
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259
system starting with 3.0 but if you're
doing window animations you still want

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
doing window animations you still want
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.290
doing window animations you still want
to use the animation resource files of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
to use the animation resource files of
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940
to use the animation resource files of
the older API so we'll see how to use

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
the older API so we'll see how to use
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580
the older API so we'll see how to use
those today to get to grinds kinds of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
those today to get to grinds kinds of
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380
those today to get to grinds kinds of
transitions between activities and sub

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
transitions between activities and sub
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110
transitions between activities and sub
activities in your activity so let's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
activities in your activity so let's
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910
activities in your activity so let's
take a look at a demo I call this demo

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
take a look at a demo I call this demo
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.330
take a look at a demo I call this demo
window animations and you'll see a few

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
window animations and you'll see a few
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.830
window animations and you'll see a few
buttons and then a little bit map down

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
buttons and then a little bit map down
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.319
buttons and then a little bit map down
at the bottom and each of the buttons

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
at the bottom and each of the buttons
 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.369
at the bottom and each of the buttons
enables a different type of window

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
enables a different type of window
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680
enables a different type of window
transition as it goes between the main

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
transition as it goes between the main
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.350
transition as it goes between the main
activity and the sub activity so default

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
activity and the sub activity so default
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.819
activity and the sub activity so default
animations you just get whatever the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
animations you just get whatever the
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349
animations you just get whatever the
system provides you which is the the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
system provides you which is the the
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.150
system provides you which is the the
scale fade at least on the current

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
scale fade at least on the current
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189
scale fade at least on the current
platform it's the scale fader activity

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
platform it's the scale fader activity
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719
platform it's the scale fader activity
so we scale and fade and we scale and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
so we scale and fade and we scale and
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730
so we scale and fade and we scale and
fade out that's the default you can do

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
fade out that's the default you can do
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350
fade out that's the default you can do
translate animations so you can provide

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
translate animations so you can provide
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.620
translate animations so you can provide
a custom animation of any type that you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
a custom animation of any type that you
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750
a custom animation of any type that you
specify using the view animation system

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
specify using the view animation system
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
specify using the view animation system
in this case we're going to slide things

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
in this case we're going to slide things
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320
in this case we're going to slide things
in and out so the translate animations

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
in and out so the translate animations
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940
in and out so the translate animations
slides in the new activity slides out

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
slides in the new activity slides out
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310
slides in the new activity slides out
the old activity and then when you back

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
the old activity and then when you back
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740
the old activity and then when you back
out we get sort of the reverse thing

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
out we get sort of the reverse thing
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.090
out we get sort of the reverse thing
which is actually a separate animation

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
which is actually a separate animation
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620
which is actually a separate animation
as we'll see in the code in a minute

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
as we'll see in the code in a minute
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810
as we'll see in the code in a minute
scale animations is a new capability

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
scale animations is a new capability
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240
scale animations is a new capability
that came online in jelly bean where you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
that came online in jelly bean where you
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280
that came online in jelly bean where you
can actually specify a sub rectangle to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
can actually specify a sub rectangle to
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140
can actually specify a sub rectangle to
launch the new activity from and it'll

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
launch the new activity from and it'll
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210
launch the new activity from and it'll
scale up from that point so it'll start

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
scale up from that point so it'll start
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.840
scale up from that point so it'll start
out at the the view the the visuals that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
out at the the view the the visuals that
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340
out at the the view the the visuals that
it's going to have when it's running in

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
it's going to have when it's running in
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719
it's going to have when it's running in
the fullscreen and then it'll simply

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
the fullscreen and then it'll simply
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730
the fullscreen and then it'll simply
scale that up over time so scale

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
scale that up over time so scale
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.639
scale that up over time so scale
animation launches that window from the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
animation launches that window from the
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.899
animation launches that window from the
location that I gave it which is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
location that I gave it which is
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.280
location that I gave it which is
relative to that button that we clicked

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
relative to that button that we clicked
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.980
relative to that button that we clicked
on now you'll notice that although we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
on now you'll notice that although we
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260
on now you'll notice that although we
scale into the activity there we still

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
scale into the activity there we still
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.459
scale into the activity there we still
get some defaults or non scaling

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469
get some defaults or non scaling
 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.600
get some defaults or non scaling
animations when we back out of it and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
animations when we back out of it and
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.160
animations when we back out of it and
this is a limitation the current system

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
this is a limitation the current system
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.350
this is a limitation the current system
where we can't scale back out of it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
where we can't scale back out of it
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.749
where we can't scale back out of it
instead we can just use the the prior

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
instead we can just use the the prior
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.210
instead we can just use the the prior
way of you know translation or

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220
way of you know translation or
 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.950
way of you know translation or
scale fate or whatever other kind of

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960
scale fate or whatever other kind of
 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.660
scale fate or whatever other kind of
animation that you want and then finally

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
animation that you want and then finally
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.370
animation that you want and then finally
we have the bitmap at the bottom which

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
we have the bitmap at the bottom which
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.630
we have the bitmap at the bottom which
is another variation of the scale

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
is another variation of the scale
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790
is another variation of the scale
animation we can we can specify not only

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
animation we can we can specify not only
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.830
animation we can we can specify not only
the sub rectangle the scale from but

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
the sub rectangle the scale from but
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.750
the sub rectangle the scale from but
also the bitmap to start from in this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
also the bitmap to start from in this
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.250
also the bitmap to start from in this
case I took a screenshot of what the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
case I took a screenshot of what the
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.080
case I took a screenshot of what the
activity was going to look like and I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
activity was going to look like and I
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.730
activity was going to look like and I
saved it a smaller size and we're simply

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740
saved it a smaller size and we're simply
 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.650
saved it a smaller size and we're simply
going to scale up from that one into the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660
going to scale up from that one into the
 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.410
going to scale up from that one into the
larger one so we can see that we get

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
larger one so we can see that we get
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.050
larger one so we can see that we get
exactly the same kind of view scaling up

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
exactly the same kind of view scaling up
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.210
exactly the same kind of view scaling up
into the larger activity now what that's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
into the larger activity now what that's
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.620
into the larger activity now what that's
hiding is that we're actually cross

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630
hiding is that we're actually cross
 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.300
hiding is that we're actually cross
fading from one representation to the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
fading from one representation to the
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130
fading from one representation to the
other so it starts out at the smaller

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
other so it starts out at the smaller
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.199
other so it starts out at the smaller
bitmap and then as it scales up it also

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
bitmap and then as it scales up it also
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.730
bitmap and then as it scales up it also
cross fades to the fullscreen

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
cross fades to the fullscreen
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.110
cross fades to the fullscreen
representation of the sub activity so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
representation of the sub activity so
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.610
representation of the sub activity so
that's the demo but the more interesting

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
that's the demo but the more interesting
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.230
that's the demo but the more interesting
part is the actual code how does this

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240
part is the actual code how does this
 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.330
part is the actual code how does this
stuff work so we can take a look at this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
stuff work so we can take a look at this
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.830
stuff work so we can take a look at this
class I've defined called window

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
class I've defined called window
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.110
class I've defined called window
animations and in here we have the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
animations and in here we have the
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820
animations and in here we have the
buttons that we saw on the screen and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
buttons that we saw on the screen and
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.020
buttons that we saw on the screen and
then we have an image view that holds

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
then we have an image view that holds
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.360
then we have an image view that holds
that bitmap and as you click on each of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
that bitmap and as you click on each of
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.890
that bitmap and as you click on each of
the buttons you get a different kind of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900
the buttons you get a different kind of
 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.270
the buttons you get a different kind of
effect depending on what we were trying

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
effect depending on what we were trying
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190
effect depending on what we were trying
to do with window animations the default

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
to do with window animations the default
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.710
to do with window animations the default
button just uses the system behavior so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
button just uses the system behavior so
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.540
button just uses the system behavior so
when you click on that it launches this

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
when you click on that it launches this
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.030
when you click on that it launches this
sub activity let's take a quick look at

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
sub activity let's take a quick look at
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.190
sub activity let's take a quick look at
sub activity not much going on there

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200
sub activity not much going on there
 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.890
sub activity not much going on there
it's just a sub activity it only exists

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
it's just a sub activity it only exists
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.979
it's just a sub activity it only exists
to provide something for us to look at

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
to provide something for us to look at
 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.690
to provide something for us to look at
when we transition to the sub activity

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
when we transition to the sub activity
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.000
when we transition to the sub activity
all right so all it does is launch the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
all right so all it does is launch the
 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.740
all right so all it does is launch the
sub activity and then the system itself

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
sub activity and then the system itself
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.140
sub activity and then the system itself
just takes care of doing the translation

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
just takes care of doing the translation
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.479
just takes care of doing the translation
the default scale fade transition that

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
the default scale fade transition that
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.640
the default scale fade transition that
it normally has the translate button the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650
it normally has the translate button the
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.199
it normally has the translate button the
second button down did a custom

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
second button down did a custom
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.240
second button down did a custom
animation where we slid the new activity

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250
animation where we slid the new activity
 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.949
animation where we slid the new activity
and slid the old activity out and then

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
and slid the old activity out and then
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.920
and slid the old activity out and then
on the way back out we slid to the right

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
on the way back out we slid to the right
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.870
on the way back out we slid to the right
instead sort of a nice reversing

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
instead sort of a nice reversing
 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.430
instead sort of a nice reversing
behavior gets kind of an indication of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
behavior gets kind of an indication of
 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.590
behavior gets kind of an indication of
the flow of the application in and out

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600
the flow of the application in and out
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.009
the flow of the application in and out
of the sub activity so here we launched

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019
of the sub activity so here we launched
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.600
of the sub activity so here we launched
a different sub activity which we call

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610
a different sub activity which we call
 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.130
a different sub activity which we call
animated sub activity and I'll show you

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
animated sub activity and I'll show you
 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.320
animated sub activity and I'll show you
in a second why we were using not just

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330
in a second why we were using not just
 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.030
in a second why we were using not just
the regular sub activity and then we

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
the regular sub activity and then we
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.990
the regular sub activity and then we
created a bundle and activity options

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000
created a bundle and activity options
 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.240
created a bundle and activity options
bundle and said okay well here's this

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250
bundle and said okay well here's this
 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.350
bundle and said okay well here's this
custom animation that we're creating and

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360
custom animation that we're creating and
 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.310
custom animation that we're creating and
we're going to load in a couple of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
we're going to load in a couple of
 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.990
we're going to load in a couple of
resources here so we can take a look at

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
resources here so we can take a look at
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.440
resources here so we can take a look at
those in our resources folder in the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450
those in our resources folder in the
 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.110
those in our resources folder in the
Anam directory we have a slide in left

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
Anam directory we have a slide in left
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.020
Anam directory we have a slide in left
resource which is a translate animation

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030
resource which is a translate animation
 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180
resource which is a translate animation
that's going to slide in and have the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
that's going to slide in and have the
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.730
that's going to slide in and have the
duration

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740
duration
 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.439
duration
capabilities specified in it so we're

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449
capabilities specified in it so we're
 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.510
capabilities specified in it so we're
going to start at from X Delta so we're

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520
going to start at from X Delta so we're
 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.740
going to start at from X Delta so we're
basically getting to start off the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750
basically getting to start off the
 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.330
basically getting to start off the
screen on a percent of the width of my

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340
screen on a percent of the width of my
 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.800
screen on a percent of the width of my
parent and then we're going to slide

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810
parent and then we're going to slide
 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.749
parent and then we're going to slide
into an X Delta zero so we're going to

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
into an X Delta zero so we're going to
 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.089
into an X Delta zero so we're going to
start out there and then slide in over a

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099
start out there and then slide in over a
 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.820
start out there and then slide in over a
duration of 500 milliseconds go back we

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830
duration of 500 milliseconds go back we
 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.140
duration of 500 milliseconds go back we
can take away the other animation we're

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150
can take away the other animation we're
 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.670
can take away the other animation we're
specifying so that was for the new

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680
specifying so that was for the new
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.770
specifying so that was for the new
activity coming in and then slide out

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
activity coming in and then slide out
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.580
activity coming in and then slide out
left was for the activity going out

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590
left was for the activity going out
 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.309
left was for the activity going out
slide out left we can see here and then

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319
slide out left we can see here and then
 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.409
slide out left we can see here and then
this one starts from an X Delta zero so

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419
this one starts from an X Delta zero so
 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.240
this one starts from an X Delta zero so
basically where that activity is now and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
basically where that activity is now and
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.950
basically where that activity is now and
it's going to slide out to half the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960
it's going to slide out to half the
 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.719
it's going to slide out to half the
width of the parent out over 500

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729
width of the parent out over 500
 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.279
width of the parent out over 500
milliseconds so it'd be sort of a

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289
milliseconds so it'd be sort of a
 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.749
milliseconds so it'd be sort of a
parallax effect they're actually going

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759
parallax effect they're actually going
 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.700
parallax effect they're actually going
at a different rate it's not just moving

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
at a different rate it's not just moving
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.619
at a different rate it's not just moving
together in lockstep but instead one is

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629
together in lockstep but instead one is
 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.270
together in lockstep but instead one is
moving in faster than the other is going

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
moving in faster than the other is going
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.219
moving in faster than the other is going
out kind of a nice effect there now the

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229
out kind of a nice effect there now the
 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.990
out kind of a nice effect there now the
reason we had an animated sub activity

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000
reason we had an animated sub activity
 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.300
reason we had an animated sub activity
there is because the transitions that we

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
there is because the transitions that we
 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.100
there is because the transitions that we
specify here for the window animations

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
specify here for the window animations
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.110
specify here for the window animations
only control what happens when we go

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120
only control what happens when we go
 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.119
only control what happens when we go
into the sub activity but what if we

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129
into the sub activity but what if we
 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.140
into the sub activity but what if we
actually want to have a custom

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
actually want to have a custom
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.790
actually want to have a custom
transition coming back out of that

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800
transition coming back out of that
 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.550
transition coming back out of that
activity as well well for that we need a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560
activity as well well for that we need a
 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320
activity as well well for that we need a
little bit of code in the sub activity

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330
little bit of code in the sub activity
 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.300
little bit of code in the sub activity
so instead of using the normal subject

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310
so instead of using the normal subject
 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.159
so instead of using the normal subject
if 'ti with no behavior specified in we

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169
if 'ti with no behavior specified in we
 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.559
if 'ti with no behavior specified in we
have this animated sub activity and here

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569
have this animated sub activity and here
 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.499
have this animated sub activity and here
we override the finish method call super

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509
we override the finish method call super
 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.480
we override the finish method call super
and then override pending transition

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490
and then override pending transition
 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.219
and then override pending transition
then we specify different transitions

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229
then we specify different transitions
 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.320
then we specify different transitions
which we don't need to go in and look at

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330
which we don't need to go in and look at
 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.309
which we don't need to go in and look at
the code it's fairly straightforward

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319
the code it's fairly straightforward
 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.709
the code it's fairly straightforward
basically we're sliding the sub activity

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719
basically we're sliding the sub activity
 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.089
basically we're sliding the sub activity
out to the right and then sliding the

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099
out to the right and then sliding the
 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.730
out to the right and then sliding the
the main activity in to the right as

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740
the main activity in to the right as
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.830
the main activity in to the right as
well sort of the reverse from the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840
well sort of the reverse from the
 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.230
well sort of the reverse from the
transition we did to begin with okay so

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240
transition we did to begin with okay so
 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.850
transition we did to begin with okay so
now we can go back and look at the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860
now we can go back and look at the
 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.350
now we can go back and look at the
original code and see the more

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360
original code and see the more
 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.640
original code and see the more
interesting stuff what's going on with

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650
interesting stuff what's going on with
 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.999
interesting stuff what's going on with
those thumbnail scaling animations

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009
those thumbnail scaling animations
 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.580
those thumbnail scaling animations
instead again we use activity options

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590
instead again we use activity options
 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.680
instead again we use activity options
this is the one where we scaled up from

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690
this is the one where we scaled up from
 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.300
this is the one where we scaled up from
the button itself and we basically give

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310
the button itself and we basically give
 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.559
the button itself and we basically give
it the rectangle that it's going to

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569
it the rectangle that it's going to
 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.200
it the rectangle that it's going to
scale from but for the content that it's

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210
scale from but for the content that it's
 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.089
scale from but for the content that it's
actually going to scale on the screen it

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099
actually going to scale on the screen it
 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:15.649
actually going to scale on the screen it
uses the content of the full screen

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659
uses the content of the full screen
 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.059
uses the content of the full screen
activity itself so we don't need to

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069
activity itself so we don't need to
 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.709
activity itself so we don't need to
specify anything else there we just say

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719
specify anything else there we just say
 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:20.540
specify anything else there we just say
where do you start from and how large

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
where do you start from and how large
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.950
where do you start from and how large
are you and then it takes care of all

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960
are you and then it takes care of all
 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.439
are you and then it takes care of all
the rest of scaling that thing in

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449
the rest of scaling that thing in
 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.529
the rest of scaling that thing in
overtime and finally on the last one

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539
overtime and finally on the last one
 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.269
overtime and finally on the last one
when we're actually scaling in from a

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279
when we're actually scaling in from a
 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.129
when we're actually scaling in from a
thumbnail we not only give it the

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139
thumbnail we not only give it the
 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.200
thumbnail we not only give it the
location that is going to scale from but

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210
location that is going to scale from but
 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.670
location that is going to scale from but
we also give it the bitmap that it's

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680
we also give it the bitmap that it's
 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.899
we also give it the bitmap that it's
going to use so it's going to start with

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909
going to use so it's going to start with
 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.050
going to use so it's going to start with
that rep

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060
that rep
 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.590
that rep
and then scale-up and fade into

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600
and then scale-up and fade into
 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.240
and then scale-up and fade into
crossfade into the the full screen

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
crossfade into the the full screen
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.940
crossfade into the the full screen
activity that you're going into so here

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950
activity that you're going into so here
 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.330
activity that you're going into so here
we create this bitmap we're actually

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340
we create this bitmap we're actually
 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.860
we create this bitmap we're actually
just loading a bitmap this is the

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870
just loading a bitmap this is the
 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.540
just loading a bitmap this is the
screenshot that I took earlier and saved

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550
screenshot that I took earlier and saved
 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.200
screenshot that I took earlier and saved
as a drawable and then we create some

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210
as a drawable and then we create some
 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.850
as a drawable and then we create some
activity options with the appropriate

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860
activity options with the appropriate
 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.580
activity options with the appropriate
parameters and start the activity and

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590
parameters and start the activity and
 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.950
parameters and start the activity and
then the window animation just uses that

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960
then the window animation just uses that
 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.310
then the window animation just uses that
bundle to run the appropriate animation

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320
bundle to run the appropriate animation
 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.230
bundle to run the appropriate animation
so these are window animations they're

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240
so these are window animations they're
 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.060
so these are window animations they're
useful for giving a custom look to your

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070
useful for giving a custom look to your
 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.060
useful for giving a custom look to your
app application your activities it's

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070
app application your activities it's
 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.490
app application your activities it's
important to point out that you can do

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
important to point out that you can do
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.080
important to point out that you can do
this for sub activities it's a little

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090
this for sub activities it's a little
 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.460
this for sub activities it's a little
trickier to do it for main activities

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470
trickier to do it for main activities
 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.790
trickier to do it for main activities
and the general advice is don't it's

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800
and the general advice is don't it's
 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.110
and the general advice is don't it's
kind of nice for the users to have a

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120
kind of nice for the users to have a
 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.000
kind of nice for the users to have a
consistent experience across the device

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010
consistent experience across the device
 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.610
consistent experience across the device
as they're using the main UI and part of

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620
as they're using the main UI and part of
 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.219
as they're using the main UI and part of
that is getting consistent transition

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:29.229
that is getting consistent transition
 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:30.930
that is getting consistent transition
behaviors as they launch activities now

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940
behaviors as they launch activities now
 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.580
behaviors as they launch activities now
once they're in your activity that's

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590
once they're in your activity that's
 

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.440
once they're in your activity that's
custom experience that's that's totally

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.450
custom experience that's that's totally
 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.820
custom experience that's that's totally
understandable how you might want to

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
understandable how you might want to
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.620
understandable how you might want to
customize that according to what your

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:37.630
customize that according to what your
 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.110
customize that according to what your
application needs to do but as far as

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120
application needs to do but as far as
 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.370
application needs to do but as far as
going between activities are just

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380
going between activities are just
 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.840
going between activities are just
launching it from the launcher screen

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850
launching it from the launcher screen
 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.969
launching it from the launcher screen
it's kind of nice to let the the default

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979
it's kind of nice to let the the default
 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.760
it's kind of nice to let the the default
system behavior still stay intact and

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770
system behavior still stay intact and
 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.000
system behavior still stay intact and
use the custom window animations for the

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.010
use the custom window animations for the
 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.370
use the custom window animations for the
activity transitions actually within

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:53.380
activity transitions actually within
 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.660
activity transitions actually within
your activities thanks for tuning in
