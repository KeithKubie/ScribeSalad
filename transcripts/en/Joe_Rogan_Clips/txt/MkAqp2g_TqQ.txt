Speaker 1:          00:00          What will happen? The Joe Rogan experience. How did Sanchez figure out how to do Moitai different than anybody? Ah, man, he's so interesting. What is quick switches of the feet and like, even the way he throws kicks is yet Skyler like a little different flavor. Everything. He don't think he can help it. You know what I mean? There's just something about the guy's character. A just like his, his fighting is him. Right. You know, like he's just, he's kind of outgoing, like just a weird funky guy and it makes sense that he fights like that. You know what I mean? It's not like he's just like seriously stern guy, but then goes out there and fights all crazy. Like he seems like his fighting is definitely an expression of himself. He's so good, man. Yeah, he's so good. I, I like watching him just warm up sneakers on outside sweat and throwing elbows and knees and Sherry think he's a bad motherfucker man.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And he's, you know, he's not young now. I think he's in his forties is he? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Can we look, help hold sanitize 38 38 Oh, he's getting there. It's getting there. But meanwhile I was in his prime still find people up all the times a month, multiple times a month. Have fight. Good luck. Yeah. Shows this and like dynamite. It's Instagram was awesome man and he's got these great videos of him warming up and you watch him, him, his movement man. It's like wow, that guy's, he's something special. It takes a lot of fucking energy to move around the way he does too. Yeah, I'm sure he still shows up to the gym every single day too. I'm sure like holding pads for foreigners and all that stuff. I stopped by Y'all cow Jim. He wasn't there but I hear like there is, I look at that again. Mother fucking man right there. He just posted a video the other day where this crazy wig go to CP. If I have video of him. There it is right there. Look at this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Even how he throw this cake. It's different. It's so different. Yeah. Like he doesn't really like turn all of his upper body like a lot of the ones I've seen, right. He's, he's a volume guy, but he knocks guys out with one shot to catch it. It, yeah. It just instinctual, you know, like he didn't even think about it. Didn't even flinch. He's so jacked up swipe. It's interesting when you think of how many different people are doing it and that this one guy stands out. I love outliers man. So that's one thing that I learned compared to like watching boy tie in the states and then going there at the amount of kicks and knees at their throwing. Mm. I'm looking at fighting like, okay, like what does the next punch going to happen? These guys throwing kick after kick after kick for five rounds.

Speaker 1:          02:34          I was like, okay, I'm, I'm definitely not kicking enough so I got to start kicking. Mm. So I, they like being in Thailand definitely helped me to learn the importance of KCI. So we were talking about the shoot box style Hotville Cordero who is obs? Absolutely one of the best striking coaches on the planet. It's funny that he's such a nice guy and he trained the most murderous crew. Angry, Brasilia ambulation. Pharaoh could not be nicer. Good. They had Anderson Silva, they, ed Vandelay and Vandelay Shogun digitally look at that photo and, okay, I'll fail. Show. Good. Yeah, dude, that's a, that's a fucking teams have another one. It's got like Pele. Everybody. Yeah, that's right. I said pay like too. They were so the guy who taught more time, Michael Costa, he was, he was from that same, that same group. I really am to this day, do not understand why more ties. Not more popular. I've never understood it.
