displayed to an external monitor this is
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.979
displayed to an external monitor this is
really where the biggest difference

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
really where the biggest difference
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.430
really where the biggest difference

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340
window resizing and multi windows going
to be used a lot more often and you have

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
to be used a lot more often and you have
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.650
to be used a lot more often and you have
new first class input methods such as

screen base window management is
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.420
screen base window management is
probably the biggest place where we see

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
probably the biggest place where we see

and then we're gonna talk a little bit

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
and then we're gonna talk a little bit
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.340
and then we're gonna talk a little bit

Google to make sure that you're able to
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.070
Google to make sure that you're able to
actually develop for these platforms and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080
actually develop for these platforms and
 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.730
actually develop for these platforms and
bring it into your actual cycle so

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740
bring it into your actual cycle so
 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.010

think about if drag and drop kind of
 

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.590

the biggest things that we've seen that

the biggest things that we've seen that
 

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.120
the biggest things that we've seen that
users have have loved on some of the

users have have loved on some of the
 

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.680
users have have loved on some of the
apps that we've worked with is the

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.690
apps that we've worked with is the
 

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.020
apps that we've worked with is the
ability to have keyboard shortcuts and

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.030
ability to have keyboard shortcuts and
 

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.790
ability to have keyboard shortcuts and
keyboard navigation so that if they're

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800
keyboard navigation so that if they're
 

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.380
keyboard navigation so that if they're
heavy power users or there's things that

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:06.390
heavy power users or there's things that
 

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.110
heavy power users or there's things that
people do often they're able to do these

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120
people do often they're able to do these
 

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.760
people do often they're able to do these
things faster get in and out of the app

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:10.770
things faster get in and out of the app
 

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.410
things faster get in and out of the app
get what they need to get done as as

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420
get what they need to get done as as
 

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.730
get what they need to get done as as
quick as possible so this is great in

this and moving on to tooling

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880
this and moving on to tooling

this and moving on to tooling
you know it'd be awful if I came up here

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920
you know it'd be awful if I came up here
 

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.410
you know it'd be awful if I came up here
and talked about kind of you should do

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:25.420
and talked about kind of you should do
 

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.210
and talked about kind of you should do
all these things yet there's no tools

all these things yet there's no tools
 

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.870
all these things yet there's no tools
from us to make this possible

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880
from us to make this possible
 

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.430
from us to make this possible
most of the tooling devices that we do

most of the tooling devices that we do
 

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.380
most of the tooling devices that we do
have our tooling examples that we do

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.390
have our tooling examples that we do

platform and then B it's also kind of
 

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.250

the most all-in-one platform that we

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:41.260
the most all-in-one platform that we
 

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.070
the most all-in-one platform that we
have most devices ship with a keyboard

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.080
have most devices ship with a keyboard
 

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.620
have most devices ship with a keyboard
and trackpad some don't even have a

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:48.850
touchscreen and then it has one of the
 

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.690
touchscreen and then it has one of the
more complex resizing strategies so it's

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:51.700
more complex resizing strategies so it's
 

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.310
more complex resizing strategies so it's
kind of the best all-in-one platform to

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320
kind of the best all-in-one platform to
 

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.330
kind of the best all-in-one platform to
test on we're working on bringing some

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:58.270
USB so you can actually bring the
 

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.330
USB so you can actually bring the
devices into the same kind of

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:00.340
devices into the same kind of
 

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.500
devices into the same kind of
development cycle that you do with

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:01.510
development cycle that you do with
 

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.350

be over Wi-Fi but we hope to bring more

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:06.940
be over Wi-Fi but we hope to bring more
 

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.840
be over Wi-Fi but we hope to bring more
and more or more more devices to this

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:09.850
and more or more more devices to this
 

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.140
and more or more more devices to this
feature but the easiest way really is

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.150
feature but the easiest way really is
 

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.990
feature but the easiest way really is
just to run Android studio and Chrome OS

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000
just to run Android studio and Chrome OS
 

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.790

this is available currently on the pixel

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800
this is available currently on the pixel
 

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.230
this is available currently on the pixel
book in preview and we're hoping to

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240
book in preview and we're hoping to
 

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.640
book in preview and we're hoping to
bring it to more devices in the future

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.650
bring it to more devices in the future
 

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.280
bring it to more devices in the future
and we do have this set up at the

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.290
and we do have this set up at the
 

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.980
and we do have this set up at the
Android and Chrome OS tables as well as

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:25.990
Android and Chrome OS tables as well as
 

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.990
Android and Chrome OS tables as well as
the Android studio table being able to

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000
the Android studio table being able to
 

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.300
the Android studio table being able to
just kind of build the app and deploy it

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:30.310
just kind of build the app and deploy it
 

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.180

development cycles substantially easier

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.110
development cycles substantially easier
 

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.800
development cycles substantially easier
