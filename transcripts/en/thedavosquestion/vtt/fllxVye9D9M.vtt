00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt;Philip Jennings: Hi, You Tube. My name is
Philip Jennings. I am the general secretary

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.010
of Union Global Union, the world's largest
trade union.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.370
The Davos conference is about to finish in
five minutes time and I thought it would be

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.190
a time to reflect on how do you judge the
success of this event in terms of working

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.070
people around the world? We represent working
people around the world. So I just thought

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.610
as a message to Claus and to Tony Blair, the
chairperson a message to them about how they

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.990
judge the success of this year through our
eyes.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.610
First of all, we witnessed this week a financial
a mini financial meltdown and a kind of Davos

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.660
bounce. We've also had the world's biggest
banking fraud in France.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:00.350
So therefore, first criteria: financial regulation.
Are the people here prepared to give financial

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.250
regulators the tools to ensure that the financial
wreckage that we've seen this week is brought

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.960
to an end? This is not business as usual.
If these things aren't changed then we consider

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.799
this Davos as being a damn ____.
Secondly, there's been a great deal of discussion

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.049
about poverty. Therefore, I'd like to suggest
that in one year's time we look at the share

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.109
of wages and the wealth produced by our nations
and then we can judge as to whether wages

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.490
have increased their share in national wealth
or not.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.850
Most people here have been talking about poverty
reduction. Let's see if that is going to make

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.469
a difference in people's pocketbooks.
Another big theme in poverty reduction is

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.969
to give people decent work and jobs. Let's
look in one years' time and see if the number

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.609
of jobs has increased or the number of jobs
has decreased.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.069
There's been a huge discussion here about
global citizenship, i.e., making businesses

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.840
good corporate citizens and they are going
to behave ethically and socially and so forth.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.549
So let's see if multi-national companies are
prepared to sign a global agreement with global

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.940
unions like uni. There are 65 in the world
today. I would like to think with all the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.680
great intentions expressed that by this time
next year we will have 100 global agreements

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.349
in place with trade unions around the world.
Private equity is here. We've brought them

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.520
out of the shadows and I'd like to see that
in the world of private equity they also begin

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.829
to pass the global citizenship test.
We've talked about poverty and health and

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.620
climate change. Let's see if carbon emissions
can actually be reduced during the course

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.129
of the next year.
When it comes to the great societal questions

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.730
of ill health and underdevelopment let's see
if the league table of the application of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.329
the millennium development goals has actually
improved.

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.689
Bono made an appeal. Let's see if Bono's appeal
is actually being met.

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.890
Finally, a target that we have in the global
union movement and all of civil society is

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.469
that this is the 60th anniversary of the human
rights' declaration. We want people around

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:15.090
the world to stand up. We want to break the
Guinness Book of Records which is 43 million

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.790
people stood up last year for their rights.
This year we want 45 million people to stand

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.430
up for their rights.
So there we have it. A checklist for Claus,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.790
a checklist for Tony Blair and the executive
board. I sincerely hope we make progress in

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.769
each of these areas, and if we do, I can assure
you the world will be a better place.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.599
Thank you, You Tube. Over and out.
