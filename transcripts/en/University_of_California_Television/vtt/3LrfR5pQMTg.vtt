00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:12.529
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical age.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.029
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:21.842
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.925
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.307
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.390
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.140
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:37.575
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:39.658
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:43.780
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
of the past.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:48.509
CARTA brings together experts

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:51.389
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:54.222
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:59.046
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.629
of humans like you.

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.466
- Dobzhansky said that
nothing in biology makes sense

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:49.637
except in the light of evolution.

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.692
However, John Coffin said,

00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:54.485
"Although no biological
explanation makes sense

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.121
"except in the light of evolution,

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.675
"it does not follow that all
evolutionary explanations

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:00.758
"make sense."

00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:03.841
So take everything you heard today,

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.009
including what I said,
with a grain of salt.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.314
Another important point
when it comes to humans,

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.087
as Dobzhansky himself said,

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:13.716
"Human evolution cannot be understood

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.615
"as a purely biological process,

00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:17.137
"nor can it be adequately described

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.907
"as a history of culture.

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:21.257
"It is the interaction
of biology and culture."

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:24.592
What we would now call
gene culture co-evolution.

00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:26.687
"There exists a feedback
between biological

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:28.996
"and cultural processes."

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:31.630
At the end of the day, we're
still talking about humans

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.213
as part of biology.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.046
Nikko Tinbergen suggested
that any biological entity

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:40.350
should ask how does it function,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.276
how did it evolve, how
did the entity develop,

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:45.578
how does it develop during a lifetime,

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:47.014
and what are the proximate causes

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:49.975
that regulate its behavior?

00:02:49.975 --> 00:02:53.353
So we can ask the same
questions about human

00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:55.618
and nonhuman awareness of
death and understanding

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:57.451
of personal mortality.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:00.597
Because of lack of time,
I'm not going to give you

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.114
my opinions on it.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:03.972
Just think about these questions

00:03:03.972 --> 00:03:07.266
and whether they have been answered today.

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.145
The CARTA questions
are, are humans unusual

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:11.788
in aspects of these features?

00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:12.943
I think we are.

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:16.041
The question is a lot
more we need to learn.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.040
When did these unusual aspects
appear in human evolution?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.362
Again, we left a lot of
questions unanswered.

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:25.421
And finally, what is the impact

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.437
on the current human condition?

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:30.151
At CARTA, we tend to focus
on the origins of humans

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:33.773
and where we came from and
tend to not spend a lot of time

00:03:33.773 --> 00:03:36.738
about how it impacts us directly.

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:39.166
Obviously, we're very interested in that.

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:43.900
I'd like to point out that
Ingrid Benirschke-Perkins

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.871
has been in contact with
several organizations relevant

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.418
to death awareness and mortality.

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:52.051
Here's a list of academic
and research organizations

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:55.510
as well as general and public
outreach organizations.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.240
These are all very active groups

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.121
and some of them are actually
represented here today

00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:03.954
who have spread the word
about this symposium.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:06.906
I encourage you to get involved in this

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:10.568
because I think we all need
to not only face this problem

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:12.462
but also talk about it freely,

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:16.545
both from the evolutionary
perspective as well as

00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.959
the practical perspective.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.181
With that, I'm going to
start up the question

00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:24.131
and answer session, and
Nick is going to lead

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.677
the first session.

00:04:25.677 --> 00:04:28.189
I need to get questions
for the second session,

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.426
if there are any.

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:32.054
I'm going to quickly go through them.

00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:34.233
Nick's up next, I think.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.733
- How do children of atheists get to know,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.139
what do they learn about death?

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.990
It's obviously a rather
difficult issue to research

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.908
in the United States because
there aren't enough of them.

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:49.418
But around the world, there
are, of course, parents

00:04:49.418 --> 00:04:51.644
who do not believe in the afterlife

00:04:51.644 --> 00:04:53.740
or any religious interpretation.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.747
Has any study been done
of those sorts of families

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:01.409
and whether they, even
possibly, actually invent

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.712
the afterlife for themselves.

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:04.545
Paul?

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:06.343
- I'm afraid the short answer

00:05:06.343 --> 00:05:08.030
to that particularly interesting question

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.427
is that we don't know.

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:12.393
The research has not been conducted.

00:05:12.393 --> 00:05:14.448
Although it would be
fair to say, of course,

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:17.902
that any child growing up
with an atheistic family,

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:20.735
certainly in the United States,

00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:22.590
or Western Europe or Scandinavia,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.467
where atheism is more
frequent, may not be exposed

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:28.769
exclusively to atheistic assumptions

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:30.936
about the nature of death.

00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:34.621
They will hear other voices

00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.341
and so a more complex
answer to the question

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.801
is how do children sift these
various, competing voices

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.301
which they are likely to hear?

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:47.838
One other point, which
is that there are places,

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.103
particularly contemporary China,

00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:53.244
where the dominant view, at least,

00:05:53.244 --> 00:05:58.134
there's no institutionally
or government sanctioned

00:05:58.134 --> 00:06:01.345
afterlife beliefs, and so
research there would be

00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:04.012
obviously worthwhile conducting.

00:06:08.265 --> 00:06:12.182
- Question for either
Dr. Biro or Dr. Marzluff.

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:15.670
Let's give it to Dr. Marzluff.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.053
What do we know about
the reaction of a dog

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:21.803
to the death of its
human caregiver or owner?

00:06:23.075 --> 00:06:24.796
Of course, we're all familiar, I'm sure,

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:28.629
with stories about
Greyfriars Bobby and so on.

00:06:30.632 --> 00:06:33.632
Dora, you come up and answer it too.

00:06:34.964 --> 00:06:36.857
- Sorry, I think I spoke to the lady

00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:40.727
who asked this question during the break.

00:06:40.727 --> 00:06:45.577
There are some very interesting
anecdotal stories about

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:49.744
dogs essentially mourning
the death of their owners.

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:52.864
I'm currently on sabbatical in Japan

00:06:52.864 --> 00:06:55.874
and Japan has one of these
very, very famous stories.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.457
Many of you will probably know.

00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:03.046
A dog owner who used to take
his dog to the train station

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:06.180
every day for I can't
remember how many years,

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.496
and would leave him there, go off to work,

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:08.815
and then come back in the evening,

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:10.915
and the dog would be there at the station,

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:14.372
waiting for him every single day.

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:17.255
When the owner passed away
without the dog's knowledge,

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:18.822
I guess, in the sense
that the dog wasn't there

00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:20.881
when the owner died,

00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:23.928
the dog continued to turn
up at the train station

00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:28.582
daily for I think 19 years
or something like that.

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:31.667
There is now a statue to this
dog at that train station

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:32.500
in Tokyo.

00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:36.237
I think anecdotally at least, we've got

00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:39.320
some extremely striking cases of dogs

00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:44.154
with very, very strong bonds

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:47.119
to their human owners keeping
those strong bonds going

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:48.619
even beyond death.

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.958
- Jack, another one for you.

00:07:56.295 --> 00:07:59.671
The questioner says in
London, she saw crows

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:02.588
attacking and killing another crow.

00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:06.596
Can you comment on that, and
how they can at the same time

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:08.980
be fascinated by the death of an animal,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.980
but also bring it about?

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:14.828
- There have been lots of
documentations of crows

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:19.057
killing other crows and
ravens killing ravens.

00:08:19.057 --> 00:08:21.780
There might be several
motivations for that.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.688
Some of them just involve
with territorial excursion,

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:27.954
going in the wrong territory
and being attacked.

00:08:27.954 --> 00:08:31.745
Once a victim is basically helpless,

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:34.630
others pile in on that
and kill that animal.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.108
It's pretty routine.

00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:40.024
I had seen it myself when
a bird was hit by a car

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:41.381
and it was wounded and fluttering around.

00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:44.546
Other crows killed that individual.

00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:46.606
These sorts of things happen.

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:50.190
It might be somewhat misdirected
behavior in that case.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.909
But there is a very
interesting study from Austria

00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:57.363
where ravens were socially
punishing each other

00:08:57.363 --> 00:09:00.121
for social transgressions.

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.960
They would break the other
raven's wing in that respect.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.804
So they didn't kill it, but
they functionally killed it,

00:09:05.804 --> 00:09:08.108
rendering it unable to fly.

00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:10.621
That one was harder to explain

00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.038
as kind of a misdirected bit of behavior.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.405
- Another question for Paul.

00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:22.425
Dora Biro discussed whether
or not it's a good idea

00:09:22.425 --> 00:09:26.089
to let animals in zoos
be exposed to the death

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:28.506
of their cellmates, zoomates.

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:35.565
Does Dr. Harris think
it would be a good idea

00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:38.120
for humans to be exposed to the death,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.868
directly exposed to the
death of children or family

00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:45.535
in a way which doesn't
happen generally now?

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:49.945
- Yes, I'm very reluctant to
draw prescriptive conclusions

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:53.282
from the modest research base we have.

00:09:53.282 --> 00:09:56.502
I guess what we do know
is that around the world,

00:09:56.502 --> 00:09:59.429
children very dramatically
in the extended exposure

00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:03.596
to death, so for example,
it would be nice to hear

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.427
from Rita, if I can identify her,

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:13.211
who will tell you about the
role that children are ascribed

00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:15.802
both prior to death and
immediately thereafter

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:16.969
in Madagascar.

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:22.672
- Yeah, so if you followed
the description I gave

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:26.873
of the funerals, I did
mention the children.

00:10:26.873 --> 00:10:29.551
But you should imagine at the gathering,

00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:32.884
especially when the meals are happening,

00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:37.080
as people arrive at the village,

00:10:39.193 --> 00:10:42.487
newcomers tend to go into the house

00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:45.528
and they will see the deceased
person for the first time.

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:49.528
There are these eruptions
of wailing and crying.

00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:54.633
The kids who are basically
there to hang out

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.018
and eat the food and play,

00:10:57.018 --> 00:10:59.117
you kind of have these
movements of gathering

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.950
and they try to evade.

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:06.114
I guess attracted and
scared by what's going on,

00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:09.899
so you would only see them
hanging from the windows

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.623
and trying to peer into the house

00:11:11.623 --> 00:11:15.456
to witness both the kind
of display of emotion

00:11:16.985 --> 00:11:21.152
and through that, also, to get
a close view of the deceased,

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:26.755
which the corpse is laid in the house,

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:29.889
and they're in this kitchenette.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.976
It's a very powerful experience,

00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.476
which is paired up with a very

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.884
hands-on experience of animal death,

00:11:40.884 --> 00:11:43.603
so children are playing with animals,

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:48.133
literally playing with animals
and kind of inspecting them

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:51.744
quite inquisitively by
pulling bits to say,

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.798
"Oh, it's not moving anymore.

00:11:53.798 --> 00:11:55.073
"It's dead."

00:11:55.073 --> 00:11:59.106
There is this experience of
animal death and human death

00:11:59.106 --> 00:12:02.282
which is much more available than it is

00:12:02.282 --> 00:12:03.699
in our societies.

00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:07.107
And then there are these
very dramatic moments

00:12:07.107 --> 00:12:11.274
for some children, so if
a mother or a father dies,

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:16.251
I'm not sure about siblings,
but certainly we've seen it

00:12:16.251 --> 00:12:20.418
with parents, children are
kind of, just before the coffin

00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:25.571
gets closed to be taken
away to the cemetery,

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:31.292
the children are taken
and kind of forced to

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.763
face the face of the deceased.

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:35.287
They're kind of put on top of the coffin

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:39.492
and they're told, look,
this is your mother,

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:43.274
she's dead, never again utter her name.

00:12:43.274 --> 00:12:45.044
There is a taboo.

00:12:45.044 --> 00:12:49.209
You can refer to the mother
but you shouldn't use the name

00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:50.901
with which she was known.

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:53.898
There's this very
dramatic separation moment

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:57.847
of face-to-face with
the body of the parent.

00:12:57.847 --> 00:13:02.837
So anyway, yeah, it's a
very available experience,

00:13:02.837 --> 00:13:06.837
which I think is integrated
in both, Paul hinted

00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:12.354
in his talk, suggested
in his talk that children

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:16.550
pick up the notion that there is something

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.375
that survives after death
after they have consolidated

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:22.557
the biological understanding of death,

00:13:22.557 --> 00:13:25.681
and that came through
in Madagascar as well,

00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:27.197
in the research we've done together.

00:13:27.197 --> 00:13:30.244
It seems that, though
logically it doesn't have to be

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:34.856
that way, it seems that
before children can understand

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:38.776
the ancestors, these people
who have arrived at the place

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.051
where they are, as I described them,

00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.689
they kind have to put together
the biological understanding

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:46.856
of this dead body and what that means.

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:53.335
- Question about how facial
expressions in mammals

00:13:53.335 --> 00:13:55.969
fit into your revised model of fear.

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:58.850
I think what this could be about,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.017
you've talked about these
subconscious limbic reactions

00:14:05.063 --> 00:14:08.896
which can produce flight
and escape and so on.

00:14:10.328 --> 00:14:14.495
But they can also produce
frightened, fearful faces.

00:14:15.514 --> 00:14:18.399
That's obviously not to
do with escaping anything.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:22.025
What do you see as the
role of facial expressions

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:25.727
associated with fear, yes, you, Joe,

00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:29.312
and why is it we find
these so easy to read

00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:32.610
across species, and could other species

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.027
read them across species too?

00:14:35.991 --> 00:14:39.777
- I think this is a good
example of the conflation

00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:43.234
that we have between
innate behavior patterns

00:14:43.234 --> 00:14:45.582
and subjective experiences.

00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:48.795
So the expression on a
face is not controlled

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:51.185
by the same system in
the brain that gives rise

00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:53.602
to the subjective experience.

00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:59.364
I think those have to be kept separate.

00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:01.617
What was the followup?

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:04.753
- [Nicholas] Whether there's
cross species recognition.

00:15:04.753 --> 00:15:05.985
- Right, first of all you asked

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:07.714
about the universality of it.

00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:09.964
But that's been questioned.

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:13.762
If you show people these pictures

00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:17.093
and give them multiple choice
answers to select from,

00:15:17.093 --> 00:15:18.817
they're more accurate than if they have to

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:23.385
spontaneously generate,
it's fear, anger, whatever.

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:27.507
That doesn't mean that there
aren't certain recognizable

00:15:27.507 --> 00:15:31.663
expressions around the world,
because obviously there are

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:32.735
to some extent.

00:15:32.735 --> 00:15:34.876
Again, these are innate
patterns that are different

00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:36.933
from the experiences that people have.

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:40.023
So these patterns, some of
them can be obviously conserved

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.957
across other primates and people,

00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:44.969
even dogs in certain mouth movements.

00:15:44.969 --> 00:15:47.694
There's nothing magical about that.

00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:49.877
Those are just behaviors
that have been wired in

00:15:49.877 --> 00:15:52.353
because of their signal
value and their ability

00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:55.436
to direct behaviors of other animals.

00:15:58.117 --> 00:15:59.799
So I think it's just
important that we separate

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:02.691
the experiences, subjective experiences,

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:05.656
that we interpret to go with these faces,

00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:08.366
because sometimes they do
and sometimes they don't.

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:12.533
Expressions are not 100%
reliable way of judging

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.720
exactly what's on someone's mind.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.420
- What do you think function
of expressing fear is?

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.770
Obviously you don't really want your enemy

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.990
to know how you're feeling, do you?

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.157
- Well, I would call it
expressing responses to threats

00:16:32.315 --> 00:16:34.315
rather than fear itself.

00:16:36.684 --> 00:16:39.318
I think that's one of
those just so stories.

00:16:39.318 --> 00:16:42.401
We don't know why exactly we do this.

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:48.791
It may be signaling for conspecifics.

00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:51.300
If you're expressing
some response to danger,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.717
other like kinds can use that

00:16:54.686 --> 00:16:58.853
as a signal to stay away and
perhaps extend their life.

00:17:01.406 --> 00:17:04.329
- Most of the matter in
the universe we cannot see

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.537
or characterize, and
we understand so little

00:17:07.537 --> 00:17:09.561
of the origins of consciousness.

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.441
Is it not, therefore,
foolish to dismiss concepts

00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:16.108
we currently consider
magical or religious--

00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:26.482
Sorry, in practicum, we conclude--

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:33.976
I think the message is,
should you be considering

00:17:33.976 --> 00:17:36.526
some alternative kind of explanations

00:17:36.526 --> 00:17:40.693
for our reality denial and
religious beliefs and so on,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.503
because actually, they may not
just be defense mechanisms,

00:17:45.503 --> 00:17:49.588
they may get closer to the
truth of the world we live in.

00:17:49.588 --> 00:17:50.421
Where's Ajit?

00:17:50.421 --> 00:17:51.588
There you are.

00:17:54.118 --> 00:17:57.039
- I don't have a specific
answer except to say

00:17:57.039 --> 00:18:00.210
that I just presented
one possible explanation

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.679
for a lot of phenomena,

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:04.384
but you can see that today,

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:06.031
we've raised a lot more questions

00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.483
than answers, so I don't think
it just bespeaks the notion

00:18:09.483 --> 00:18:13.687
that this whole area
needs a lot more research.

00:18:13.687 --> 00:18:16.687
I'd just keep my mind open about it.

00:18:17.724 --> 00:18:19.078
- I think we've run the
gamut with these questions.

00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:20.190
Should we go to yours?

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.023
- OK.

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:27.446
All right, so many of the
questions are very personal

00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:31.960
and lengthy and hard to deal
with in a general audience,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.346
so those who had the
very personal questions

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.569
should probably approach
the specific speaker

00:18:36.569 --> 00:18:38.569
if they have a question.

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:42.203
A question to Sheldon.

00:18:42.203 --> 00:18:44.410
Comment on the field of neuroethology,

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.024
study of the brain during
religious experience.

00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:52.107
And perhaps comment on
the near-death experience.

00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:58.527
- I'm not equipped on the
neuroethology part of the question

00:18:58.527 --> 00:18:59.527
to weigh in.

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:05.338
There is a body of literature
that I'm vaguely aware of

00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:08.753
that shows that a particular
part of one's brain

00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:12.920
lights up in the context of
any religious experience,

00:19:15.786 --> 00:19:17.119
broadly defined.

00:19:18.546 --> 00:19:21.388
Interesting and perhaps important,

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:24.144
but I'm literally not
sufficiently familiar

00:19:24.144 --> 00:19:26.477
or have the skills to judge.

00:19:27.476 --> 00:19:29.643
Near death experiences are

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.920
also complex and difficult.

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:40.948
We are, I am, in conjunction
with a graduate student

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:43.587
at the University of Padua in Italy,

00:19:43.587 --> 00:19:48.524
Simone Bianco, we're
studying people that have had

00:19:48.524 --> 00:19:50.745
near-death experiences

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:54.912
and we're thinking about
them as natural phenomena,

00:19:57.213 --> 00:20:00.055
which just means we're
agnostic with regard

00:20:00.055 --> 00:20:02.483
to what's actually happening.

00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:06.650
Our interest is just the
psychological consequences

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.434
of having had those experiences.

00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:13.484
We're trying to assemble a
large enough group of people

00:20:13.484 --> 00:20:16.693
around the world to have
had near death experiences,

00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:19.832
and we're comparing them
with a matched control group

00:20:19.832 --> 00:20:24.036
of folks who have not to see
what happens in our experiments

00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:28.686
when they're subliminally
primed to be reminded

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:30.324
of their mortality.

00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:33.160
If you ask folks that have
had near death experiences

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.767
to comment on what has
happened to them thereafter,

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:40.606
they fairly consistently
say that these are

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:44.472
transformative experiences
and that for the most part,

00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:47.305
they're no longer afraid of dying.

00:20:50.397 --> 00:20:53.111
I'll get back to you if we come back again

00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.041
in a year or two, I'll let you know.

00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:57.469
Or please do write me
if anybody's interested,

00:20:57.469 --> 00:21:00.424
and I'll let you know the
outcome of that research.

00:21:00.424 --> 00:21:02.810
- One more question.
- Sure.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.407
- Another question to Sheldon.

00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:06.506
If increased awareness
of inevitability of death

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:10.134
and our mortality exacerbate
individual and societal

00:21:10.134 --> 00:21:14.500
maladaptive behaviors,
how do we move toward

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.417
an acceptance of death?

00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:24.508
- (laughs) To be silly
at the end of a long day,

00:21:24.508 --> 00:21:27.022
if I could answer that question,

00:21:27.022 --> 00:21:29.122
I would be chugging rum out of a coconut

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:32.705
with my Nobel Prize on
the beach someplace.

00:21:34.066 --> 00:21:37.110
What I would say, these
are great questions,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.934
what I would say, I do
believe this is important.

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:44.563
We need to distinguish between

00:21:44.563 --> 00:21:48.239
the relatively fleeting reminders of death

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:50.540
that we use in our studies.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.052
So somebody standing in
front of a funeral parlor,

00:21:53.052 --> 00:21:57.219
somebody where we blast the
word death subliminally,

00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:01.702
they're not even aware
that that has happened.

00:22:01.702 --> 00:22:05.901
That's very different than a
sustained and very conscious

00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:08.946
contemplation of one's mortality

00:22:08.946 --> 00:22:12.525
that a lot of religious and
philosophical traditions

00:22:12.525 --> 00:22:13.608
are advising.

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:16.558
The Tibetan Book of the Dead,

00:22:16.558 --> 00:22:19.810
or the medieval monks
that work with a skull

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.977
on their desks, or anybody
who's had enough free time

00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:29.112
and read Heidegger's Being and Time.

00:22:29.112 --> 00:22:30.472
It's taken me a lifetime.

00:22:30.472 --> 00:22:33.222
That's surely more than fleeting.

00:22:34.714 --> 00:22:38.864
I suspect, and I think this gets back to

00:22:38.864 --> 00:22:43.019
something that Nick said
at the end of his talk,

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:45.201
and some of the other folks have also,

00:22:45.201 --> 00:22:47.451
and that's culture matters.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.183
As a grotesque
overgeneralization, we in the West

00:22:54.455 --> 00:22:58.898
live in a culture where
we go to great lengths

00:22:58.898 --> 00:23:01.398
to kind of bury death anxiety.

00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:05.808
It's not death anxiety per se

00:23:05.808 --> 00:23:09.840
we would argue that produces
pernicious outcomes.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.239
It's when we psychologically
speaking, try and banish it

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:16.542
and bury it underneath
the psychological bushes

00:23:16.542 --> 00:23:20.125
that it comes back to
bear malignant fruit.

00:23:21.324 --> 00:23:25.978
Ajit had a list of
organizations up on the screen,

00:23:25.978 --> 00:23:28.908
and many of them, such as the Death Cafe,

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:31.378
I think are well intentioned efforts

00:23:31.378 --> 00:23:35.128
to provide very public
spaces so that people,

00:23:36.785 --> 00:23:39.512
generally in a secular society,

00:23:39.512 --> 00:23:42.391
can start to have open
and candid conversations.

00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:45.308
I think that would be a good start.

00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:50.106
- Related to that,

00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.278
to Colin Renfrew, if Western
society were to continue

00:23:55.278 --> 00:23:58.033
in a most secular path,
rejecting the concept

00:23:58.033 --> 00:24:02.523
of an afterlife and the
immortality of the soul,

00:24:02.523 --> 00:24:06.690
could we expect a decline in
death and mourning rituals?

00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:11.423
- I think not necessarily so.

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:15.173
Ritual is something
which doesn't necessarily

00:24:16.075 --> 00:24:18.786
depend, I suppose it always
depends to some extent,

00:24:18.786 --> 00:24:19.934
on a worldview.

00:24:19.934 --> 00:24:24.101
But it doesn't depend on a
worldview which involves belief

00:24:26.194 --> 00:24:29.861
in a deity or a divinity
or in an afterlife.

00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:33.684
I think it's the case,
as indeed we've seen,

00:24:33.684 --> 00:24:36.601
we've talked of these early burials

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:41.766
in the upper Paleolithic period,

00:24:41.766 --> 00:24:44.777
which were clearly seriously undertaken

00:24:44.777 --> 00:24:47.079
and very carefully undertaken.

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:50.943
At that time, of course,
it's very difficult

00:24:50.943 --> 00:24:53.709
to talk about the development of religion

00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:57.547
in prehistoric times, when
we don't have written texts,

00:24:57.547 --> 00:25:00.262
and in those very early times,

00:25:00.262 --> 00:25:03.187
we don't have any way of denying

00:25:03.187 --> 00:25:05.039
that there may have
been religious beliefs.

00:25:05.039 --> 00:25:08.087
But we certainly don't
have any iconography

00:25:08.087 --> 00:25:11.587
that would promote a notion that there was

00:25:15.706 --> 00:25:17.929
a specific divinity.

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:21.472
It would be too long an
aside to go on to talk about

00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:23.900
what I think are probably
the erroneous ideas

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.979
of a great earth mother in
upper Paleolithic times.

00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:31.896
But clearly, as we've
heard so well documented,

00:25:33.589 --> 00:25:35.756
death does engender regret

00:25:39.562 --> 00:25:44.174
in those living and mourning
in those that remain.

00:25:44.174 --> 00:25:46.561
There, we've had very
interesting narratives

00:25:46.561 --> 00:25:49.561
about how the ceremonies of mourning

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.333
are not always focused
on regret of the passing

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:59.864
of the deceased person,
but have very active life

00:25:59.864 --> 00:26:02.418
in the remaining community.

00:26:02.418 --> 00:26:06.585
I think it's appropriate, and
I think for an agnostic person

00:26:08.968 --> 00:26:13.956
it is appropriate to note that
passing of a deceased person,

00:26:13.956 --> 00:26:17.050
a friend or someone who is much admired.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.133
So I think the commemoration of the dead

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.800
does not need to be based on any

00:26:25.687 --> 00:26:29.854
sincere or sophisticated
religious belief systems.

00:26:30.878 --> 00:26:32.609
I don't know if that answers--

00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:33.692
Brief answer.

00:26:36.814 --> 00:26:38.481
- Question for Nick.

00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:41.791
Could we not equally consider suicide

00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:44.262
as a positive selection mechanism

00:26:44.262 --> 00:26:46.679
against diseases of evolution

00:26:48.338 --> 00:26:51.136
and disadvantageous states of mind?

00:26:51.136 --> 00:26:54.424
In other words, could have
suicide have been selected for

00:26:54.424 --> 00:26:57.757
rather than a failure to select against?

00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:05.310
- I think you could make a case

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.096
that some suicides, if
they were undertaken

00:27:09.096 --> 00:27:11.527
with that kind of motive,

00:27:11.527 --> 00:27:16.022
could have been selected
for, to take yourself

00:27:16.022 --> 00:27:18.783
out of society when you're sick

00:27:18.783 --> 00:27:20.616
or a burden on others.

00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:26.604
Would actually end up increasing,

00:27:27.521 --> 00:27:30.854
it can be a eugenic mechanism of a sort.

00:27:32.424 --> 00:27:36.462
There's no evidence that
animals do anything like that,

00:27:36.462 --> 00:27:38.517
which suggests that we're
not likely to find it

00:27:38.517 --> 00:27:40.376
in humans unless it's
a highly rationalized,

00:27:40.376 --> 00:27:42.685
intellectual response.

00:27:42.685 --> 00:27:45.855
We do know plenty of
examples, interesting enough,

00:27:45.855 --> 00:27:49.105
of altruistic suicide rather like that.

00:27:50.048 --> 00:27:51.692
The wonderful example I wish I'd had time

00:27:51.692 --> 00:27:54.830
to show the pictures of it to you,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.785
was a village in Derbyshire, in England,

00:27:58.785 --> 00:28:02.452
which in 1666, when the
great plague struck,

00:28:03.936 --> 00:28:06.899
it arrived in this
village through some fleas

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:11.310
on a bed of cloth which
had been delivered there.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.751
The villagers realized
immediately the danger

00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:14.151
they were in.

00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:16.296
Their response wasn't to leave,

00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:18.680
it was to quarantine the village.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.464
They basically made the
decision, no one will leave,

00:28:22.464 --> 00:28:26.583
no one will come on, and food and things

00:28:26.583 --> 00:28:29.090
were passed across
through a kind of barrier

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.250
which didn't allow any
spread of the disease.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.963
In that village of the 600
people originally there,

00:28:35.963 --> 00:28:36.796
400 died.

00:28:38.102 --> 00:28:40.822
By doing that, they very likely saved

00:28:40.822 --> 00:28:44.413
an awful lot of lives of others outside.

00:28:44.413 --> 00:28:46.711
Of course, unrelated,

00:28:46.711 --> 00:28:48.438
this is a very high level of selection.

00:28:48.438 --> 00:28:50.948
If something like that
was seen to be beneficial

00:28:50.948 --> 00:28:52.281
to human genome.

00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:58.697
I think yes, the answer
is there are possibilities

00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:02.864
that removing ourself could
have positive effects.

00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:07.279
I don't think you could
make any case like that

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.709
for by far the majority of suicides,

00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:13.876
which, as I said, seem to
be largely self-interested,

00:29:14.823 --> 00:29:19.111
though I maybe think that's a
hard word to use about them.

00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:21.374
They are self-euthanasia.

00:29:21.374 --> 00:29:25.988
People are trying to
mend their own inner life

00:29:25.988 --> 00:29:27.405
there, in a word.

00:29:30.762 --> 00:29:32.525
- It's an appropriate followup.

00:29:32.525 --> 00:29:35.530
Could not egoistic suicide be selected for

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.286
since it would remove from the gene pool

00:29:38.286 --> 00:29:40.674
young people suffering from mental illness

00:29:40.674 --> 00:29:43.804
such as depression prior to reproduction?

00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:46.606
Increased suicide in
young depressed people

00:29:46.606 --> 00:29:49.701
who have a more realistic grasp of studies

00:29:49.701 --> 00:29:53.782
showed that non-depressed people
have a more optimistic view

00:29:53.782 --> 00:29:56.623
of reality, whereas depressed people

00:29:56.623 --> 00:29:59.050
actually have better grasp of reality.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.601
In other words, so-called
depressive realism.

00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:04.116
I almost could have written
that question myself.

00:30:04.116 --> 00:30:04.949
I didn't.

00:30:07.212 --> 00:30:10.710
- Yes, firstly on this
issue of mental illness,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.142
it's hugely exaggerated
the extent to which

00:30:13.142 --> 00:30:16.277
suicide is related to mental illness.

00:30:16.277 --> 00:30:19.777
It's commonly said in the
West that 90% of suicides

00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:22.939
have got major depressive illness.

00:30:22.939 --> 00:30:26.315
This is based on so-called
psychological autopsies,

00:30:26.315 --> 00:30:27.797
when you ask after someone's died,

00:30:27.797 --> 00:30:29.938
you ask their friends and family and so on

00:30:29.938 --> 00:30:32.740
what signs of it did you see?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.080
It's of course, the evidence
you get back from that

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.930
can be hugely biased.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.287
Once somebody's killed themselves,

00:30:39.287 --> 00:30:42.329
in retrospect, of course you
can find all sorts of reasons

00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:45.210
why you might have thought
it was going to happen.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.933
My more important point
is that the statistics

00:30:47.933 --> 00:30:51.600
of 90% are only for Europe and America.

00:30:52.924 --> 00:30:55.684
Across the rest of the world,
India, China, whatever,

00:30:55.684 --> 00:30:59.558
you find the rates of
illness, of mental illness

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:02.609
associated with suicide way, way down.

00:31:02.609 --> 00:31:04.629
By far, the majority, there's a big review

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:08.050
in science recently, have no identifiable

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.300
psychiatric mental illness.

00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:15.137
The people in Palawan, I
mentioned Charles McDonald's study

00:31:15.137 --> 00:31:20.045
of this area of villages that
have very high suicide rates.

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:21.769
They've recently done a further study

00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:25.098
in which they did psychological
autopsies on them.

00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:29.705
They found that there was
almost not noticeable evidence

00:31:29.705 --> 00:31:31.205
of mental illness.

00:31:36.614 --> 00:31:39.329
In one or two, agoraphobia
was apparently present

00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:42.829
in some of them, but no major issue

00:31:42.829 --> 00:31:46.204
which would have been wise
to remove from the population

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:49.537
by letting these people kill themselves.

00:31:51.553 --> 00:31:54.519
I think that's the wrong
way to think about it.

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:57.478
Of course, if you think in eugenic terms,

00:31:57.478 --> 00:32:00.770
we're going to ask whether
it would have been better

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.199
for the species if these
people hadn't lived,

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:06.199
but I think in the particular cases,

00:32:07.315 --> 00:32:11.482
there are cases where people
who are seriously malformed

00:32:12.915 --> 00:32:17.359
or ill can volunteer not
to reproduce, for example,

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:19.609
which is a kind of suicide.

00:32:21.025 --> 00:32:22.797
That's not always a free
decision which they make,

00:32:22.797 --> 00:32:25.140
but certainly in some
cases, there are people

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.277
who won't reproduce because they know

00:32:28.277 --> 00:32:31.689
that they'd be passing on
faulty genes to their children

00:32:31.689 --> 00:32:34.202
and that's a bit like
what you're talking about.

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:36.631
That is a way in which,
not exactly suicide,

00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:40.830
but denial of your contribution
to the next generation

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.163
could actually benefit the human genome.

00:32:46.924 --> 00:32:48.815
- Just putting on my medical hat,

00:32:48.815 --> 00:32:52.893
I would suggest, we may
not exactly agree on this,

00:32:52.893 --> 00:32:55.283
I would suggest that in all societies,

00:32:55.283 --> 00:32:57.226
there's a baseline rate of suicide

00:32:57.226 --> 00:33:00.272
that's associated with
major depressive disorder,

00:33:00.272 --> 00:33:03.823
which is greatly upticked
when there are activities

00:33:03.823 --> 00:33:05.990
of various kinds going on.

00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:08.806
We're coming close to the end,

00:33:08.806 --> 00:33:10.781
so the final question somebody asked

00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:14.781
which is a good one, is
to each of the speakers.

00:33:16.637 --> 00:33:19.858
What is the next big question
that the upcoming generation

00:33:19.858 --> 00:33:24.025
of researchers should seek to
answer in our study of death?

00:33:27.481 --> 00:33:28.969
We just have enough
time for each one of you

00:33:28.969 --> 00:33:30.719
to come and give one.

00:33:32.683 --> 00:33:34.790
- I've just been speaking,
so someone else first.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.970
- Somebody come forward.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.840
If you could have wave a magic
wand and have as much money

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.090
as you want, which experiment would do?

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.428
- I need a glass of wine before I come up

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:53.515
with an experiment, but I do think

00:33:53.515 --> 00:33:55.404
what these series of talks

00:33:55.404 --> 00:33:58.901
have illustrated for me is a sort of,

00:33:58.901 --> 00:34:01.295
not a schism, that's too strong a word,

00:34:01.295 --> 00:34:03.559
but some of us have talked quite a lot

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:08.453
about the awareness of
one's own personal mortality

00:34:08.453 --> 00:34:11.586
and the terror or whatever that evokes.

00:34:11.586 --> 00:34:14.636
Others of us, on the other
hand, have thought about

00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:17.386
death with respect to loved ones,

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:23.040
those that we lose, and how
we cope with their status

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.588
within the broader social fabric.

00:34:26.588 --> 00:34:30.755
So it does seem to me that we
researchers, investigators,

00:34:32.686 --> 00:34:35.934
might have a longer
conversation about the extent

00:34:35.934 --> 00:34:38.319
to which those two lines of investigation

00:34:38.319 --> 00:34:40.291
should be brought together, or whether one

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:42.391
is much more important than the other.

00:34:42.391 --> 00:34:46.558
In the question of the day, or
the afternoon, I should say,

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:50.873
we did seem to be talking to some extent

00:34:50.873 --> 00:34:52.706
about distinct themes.

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:59.076
- Anyone else with a
paradigm for the future?

00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:03.895
- I'll offer a quick note.

00:35:03.895 --> 00:35:07.106
I think animals are
much more aware of death

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:09.081
than some people think.

00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:11.516
Getting at that better, to
understand the connection,

00:35:11.516 --> 00:35:15.100
I think the gradient
between how humans view it

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.954
and how animals view
it, there's a lot more

00:35:16.954 --> 00:35:19.630
that can be done there.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:24.612
- I'd just like to say how
much more we have to learn

00:35:24.612 --> 00:35:27.529
about beliefs in life and in death,

00:35:29.255 --> 00:35:33.790
specifically in early
times, in prehistoric times,

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.621
and how rich the data is,
and how important it is

00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:40.870
that the archeological
data is treated properly,

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.859
that is to say, it's excavated
in a way which reveals

00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:48.689
its context, so that
we learn something more

00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:51.939
about the beliefs of past world systems

00:35:52.975 --> 00:35:56.101
and how easily this is destroyed

00:35:56.101 --> 00:36:00.101
by either unscrupulous
or careless developments,

00:36:01.736 --> 00:36:06.685
but in particular, by
collectors who pay good money

00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:09.891
to have artworks from the past

00:36:09.891 --> 00:36:13.187
which are ripped from
their archeological context

00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:16.320
and all information is thereby lost.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.564
The record of the past
is a diminishing record,

00:36:20.564 --> 00:36:24.472
and it's diminished in a very negative way

00:36:24.472 --> 00:36:28.095
if people, private
collectors or indeed museums,

00:36:28.095 --> 00:36:32.262
pay money to essentially,
in order to have objects

00:36:33.536 --> 00:36:36.870
displayed in their museum
without proper context,

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:40.073
they are in fact destroying our hope

00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:43.815
of understanding the world's
archeological heritage.

00:36:43.815 --> 00:36:44.648
Thank you.

00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:50.111
- Now I think I'll hand
over to Pascal Gagneux,

00:36:50.111 --> 00:36:54.111
the associate director
has some closing remarks.

00:36:58.731 --> 00:36:59.965
- I'd like to thank all of you,

00:36:59.965 --> 00:37:03.138
especially the speakers,
for an amazing lineup

00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:06.347
of talks, and the audience, those here,

00:37:06.347 --> 00:37:09.958
those online, across the
city and across the world.

00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:14.697
It's very hard not to be
touched by this topic.

00:37:14.697 --> 00:37:17.994
Please remember that, while
alive, you can be kind.

00:37:17.994 --> 00:37:19.637
That stops at some point.

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.360
Thank you very much and
have a wonderful evening.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.277
