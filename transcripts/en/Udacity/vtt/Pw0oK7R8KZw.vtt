00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.665
On the tablet, there's a bug 
where if you select an item

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:05.512
near the bottom of the list 
and then you rotate the device,

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:07.898
the selected item is 
no longer scrolled into view.

00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:09.674
You have to manually 
scroll the list.

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:12.270
That means we should store
the position of the selected item

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.430
in the SavedInstanceState Bundle.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.230
If the app is killed, 
when it's restored,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.153
we should read the position 
back from the Bundle.

00:00:18.153 --> 00:00:20.186
If the list isn't populated at that time,

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.630
then we should wait 
for the onLoadFinished callback

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.094
to use a position to scroll
to the selected item.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.810
Check these boxes when you're done.
