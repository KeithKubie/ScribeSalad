00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.069

could tell I lost the respect to my

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.289
could tell I lost the respect to my
co-workers even if I secretly did think

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299
co-workers even if I secretly did think
 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.040
co-workers even if I secretly did think
they're go we can still hear you bro

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.030
they're go we can still hear you bro
