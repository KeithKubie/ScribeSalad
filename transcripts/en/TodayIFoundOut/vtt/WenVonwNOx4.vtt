00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.880
Working retail, waiting tables, standing in
line at the amusement park or just shopping

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.800
with mom, anyone who’s ever been stuck on
their feet for a long time more or less standing

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.140
still knows that it’s much more tiring than
walking the equivalent amount of time.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.590
But why?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.930
First, when you stand, your legs aren’t
resting, even beyond just supporting your

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.930
weight.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.430
Instead, your body sways very slightly.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.540
To keep you upright, a few muscles, particularly
those in your calves, are constantly working,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.910
making very small adjustments that you probably
aren’t consciously aware of.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.470
On the other hand, when you walk, the burden
is distributed across more muscle groups.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.710
Muscles swinging the arms help propel them,
core muscles keep you stable, butt muscles

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
complete your stride, and the legs of both
the calves and the thighs are employed.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.140
Second, when you’re standing still, each
foot and leg supports about half of the body’s

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.390
weight, but neither ever gets a rest.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.770
On the other hand, when walking, each time
a foot is raised the muscles formerly helping

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.750
to balance you get a little break as does
the bottom of your foot.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.770
While only a small break each instance, this
totals to about half the time being in more

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
or less a resting state other than the muscles
required to lift your foot off the ground.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.360
Third, when you stand, the blood and lymph
fluids pool in your feet, calves and ankles,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.520
because your heart cannot efficiently pump
the blood all the way up from your feet by

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
itself.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.370
This is why if you stand in one place for
long periods, you might notice that your feet

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.410
and lower legs swell a little.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.310
Because the heart isn’t up to performing
this task efficiently, it relies in part on

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.900
muscle contractions that occur when you walk
and move about.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.160
As David J Tibbs in Varicose Veins and Related
Disorders, states,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.350
Only the peripheral pumping mechanism (musculovenous
pumping) can cause full venous flow against

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.350
gravity.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.360
This forceful pumping action is brought about
when multiple veins are compressed by contraction

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.540
of surrounding skeletal muscle.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.349
The valves direct the blood heartwards and
prevent it from falling back again.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.470
Thus, by this simple arrangement, the harder
the muscles work, the more vigorously is the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.730
massive flow of blood generated by this activity
returned towards the heart.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.920
Thus, when you stand in one place, your muscles
are receiving less oxygen and other such things

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.690
they need to operate at peak efficiency compared
to when you walk around.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.950
Fourth, when you stand, the entire load of
your body rests on the same place – the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.680
underside of your feet, and particularly on
the balls and heels.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.319
Beyond one side getting the aforementioned
break about half the time, when you walk,

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.210
different parts of your feet bear the load
at different times.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.150
Fifth, standing is sometimes much more boring
than walking, particularly if you are at work

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.640
with nothing mentally engaging to do (or watching
your mom shop…).

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.239
With nothing to occupy your mind, it can wander
to how tired you are and how much your feet

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.239
hurt.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.019
On the other hand, when walking, your brain
will be more occupied since you must constantly

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.489
assess the situation and avoid obstacles.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.239
Thus, standing may also seem even more tiring
because you are just more aware of how your

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.340
legs and feet are feeling.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.579
Sixth, if you walk fast enough (or jog), your
body will release neurochemicals that make

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.909
you feel better, including adrenaline that
pumps the heart faster, providing more oxygen

00:03:21.909 --> 00:04:22.860
to the muscles and brain, as well as endorphins
that improve mood.
