00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.521
it turns out the value of X would be 84 when Y is &amp;amp; and Z is 1. Nice work if you

00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.378
figured that one out. We know the values for X1, Y1, and Z1 so we plug those in

00:00:10.378 --> 00:00:15.690
here. We are looking for the X value when Y is 7 and Z is 1, so we plug in 7 and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.278
1 in these positions. We can think of these numbers as being the second case

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:26.768
We're looking for x 2, which is x, and we know the second y value is 7, and the

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:32.030
second z value is 1. We use these lists to make our substitution. We simplify

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.474
this right hand side to get 5 42nds. Next we multiply both sides of the equation

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:42.378
by the LCD, 42x. Essentially, this is the same as cross-multiplying. So we get

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:48.972
5x on the right and 420 on the left. We divide both sides by 5 to get x is equal

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:49.492
to 84.
