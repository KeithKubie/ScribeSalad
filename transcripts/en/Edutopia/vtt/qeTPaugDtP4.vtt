00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:03.806
I think of authentic
assessment as my ability

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:06.616
to teach each student
where they actually are.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.776
I'm Sarah Kaufman.

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:12.946
I teach sixth grade humanities
at School of the Future.

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:15.446
In order to know where they
actually are, I have to be able

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.576
to assess them really specifically
and in a variety of ways

00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:20.976
that are appropriate
for that student,

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.336
so that what I'm doing is every day
giving that child an environment

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:27.486
where they're challenged, where they
feel good about what they're learning

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.366
and they feel like they're learning.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:33.056
&gt;&gt;What's been amazing to
watch in Sarah's class

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.966
as a sixth grade teacher is also,
she just is extremely rigorous

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:39.986
in what she demands from the kids.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.396
And so her class really
has high standards.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:45.926
&gt;&gt;A lot of that work started
with myself when I would think

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.826
about reading and I would do
Post-Its while I read to figure

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:53.076
out what I was actually
asking the students to do.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:56.786
And that led me to really break down
the skill work into smaller pieces

00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:00.266
so that I could manage it,
because if I don't do that,

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.916
my brain can't focus.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:07.286
So then, what I do is assess the
kids on skills on a continuum.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:10.546
So like what we saw this
morning was I collected a bunch

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:12.086
of the kids' work on Friday.

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:13.296
I'd seen their reading labs.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.276
I'd seen Post-Its that they'd been
making while they were reading

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.426
that were observing, inferring, you
know, visualizing and summarizing.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.846
I took that work, I compared it
to data I had already collected

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:27.726
on the students by, you
know, taking a Post-It,

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.426
comparing it on this continuum.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:32.996
And then I looked over the
whole class and I thought

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:38.226
about who needs what work where,
and then used that to make groups.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:40.216
And then because I
made that continuum,

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:43.016
I could then pull the lessons
that each group needed,

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:44.716
so that eventually all

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.746
of that becomes high
level, analytical thinking.

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:50.376
&gt;&gt;We always work in groups,
whether it's working off

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.106
of writing or working off Post-Its.

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.246
Like even today, in class, you
guys saw how we were working

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.126
in Post-It groups.

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.036
It really helps, 'cause
you have someone to talk to

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:01.126
and they share their ideas,
or you can take off theirs,

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:03.986
and you can have positive
feedback and help a lot.

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:05.596
&gt;&gt;My name's Eamon McCormick.

00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:07.646
I'm a sixth grader student
at School of the Future.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.516
&gt;&gt;I started with kids that
were struggling more and

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.796
or had a more difficult
task because of it.

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.966
So that was the first
table I went to.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.766
And at that table, I knew that they
would need more upfront instruction,

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.786
because it was a harder
skill for them.

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:27.376
So then I could start there, but by
the time I got to the third table,

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:30.556
all of those kids had
already done one Post-It.

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:33.696
So with the nice thing about
that was, it allowed me to first,

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:37.066
before I even talked to the kids,
knowing that those kids were stronger

00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:38.606
in that work, I could then look

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.446
and see what they had done
before even speaking to them.

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:43.786
Giving them multiple opportunities

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.386
to practice really allowed me
while I was going round the class

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.646
to maybe change the plan as needed.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.356
I try to structure a
lot of time that way,

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:53.086
so that they have a
little practice first,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:57.196
and then I can assess
it as qui-- if possible.

00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:59.506
&gt;&gt;It's really great to just think
about what we've been reading,

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:02.026
and it just lets you like
recap and not forget anything

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:04.366
and find the real purpose
of what's going on.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:07.526
And it lets you like get the
true meaning out of the book.

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:09.586
&gt;&gt;Eamon is a really strong student.

00:03:09.586 --> 00:03:12.066
You know, in class
today, he was talking

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.086
about how he was really
struggling to feel

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:17.186
like he could find depth
there in his thinking process.

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:19.946
And it was like, "Well, what
if we observe characters

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:21.606
across books and in patterns?

00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.796
Like what are we seeing over
and over and over again,

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.886
and we use that as the basis
of your observation work?

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:28.216
What does that free up?"

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:31.256
So even though he's very bright
and like, you know, very capable,

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:32.866
he's still eleven, you know.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:36.316
And like there's still things
that he need to work on.

00:03:36.556 --> 00:03:38.976
I do as much as I can
to make him feel

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:42.216
like he's got something
new to try that day.

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:46.026
&gt;&gt;In eight minutes is when you're
going to have a break to talk

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:50.646
to a partner, to tell them, "What are
you going to write on your Post-It

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.326
that matches the work at your table?"

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:54.216
&gt;&gt;She's an amazing
sixth grade teacher,

00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:57.156
because she really pushes the
reading, she pushes the volume

00:03:57.156 --> 00:03:59.046
of writing and reading
her class is amazing.

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.766
I think it's made such a difference
in the tone that like has come on--

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:05.236
off of the kids after they leave
here to seventh and eighth.

00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:08.866
Like it establishes that tone that
we were reader and writers in here

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.386
and continues that a lot
from elementary school,

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:12.916
but really takes it
to the next level.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.196
&gt;&gt;I've seen a lot of success
as a teacher with kids

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:18.126
who are really, really struggling.

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:22.536
And they're so relieved that
someone finally validated the fact

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:25.286
that they are working really
hard and it doesn't make sense.

00:04:25.286 --> 00:04:28.546
And then you can say, "Great,
let's work on making it less hard,

00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:29.966
and like, here's how
we're gonna do it."

00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:33.386
And as long as I think you
have a plan, kids feel okay.

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:34.786
It's when you just
sorta like, "Yeah,"

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:37.766
and then you don't have a plan for
them, that they really struggle.

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:39.986
But when you have a plan
and they go, "Oh, great,

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:41.026
you've thought about this.

00:04:41.136 --> 00:04:42.136
You care about me.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.456
You know what I need.

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:45.456
You're gonna help me."

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:47.906
And then they can just
allow themselves

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:49.656
to do the work that they need to do.
