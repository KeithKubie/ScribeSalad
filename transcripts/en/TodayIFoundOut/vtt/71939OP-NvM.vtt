00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.090
It was once widely reported that water-immersion
wrinkling was the result of osmosis.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.990
Water being pulled into dead skin cells (keratin)
on our epidermis would cause them to swell.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
The swollen outer layer of skin, still tightly
attached to the layers beneath, would then

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.440
wrinkle due to the increased surface area.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.960
A quick Google search will show you this idea
is still widely circulated, even by some otherwise

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.489
reputable sources.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.650
While it might have some minor role, we now
know osmosis resulting in skin swelling is

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.730
not the main cause of finger wrinkling for
several reasons.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.040
The first is that only fingers, toes and the
bottoms of your feet tend to wrinkle when

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.040
wet.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.910
If osmosis was the reason, all parts of your
skin would wrinkle in response to wetness.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.250
Some have suggested it’s because the outer
layer of the skin is the thickest in these

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.129
areas, as such, would be more subject to swelling
and wrinkling.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.430
The problem is that measurements have shown
a decrease in finger volume when wrinkled,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.950
not an increase, as would be the case if swelling
was the cause.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.210
The most damning evidence that osmosis is
not the cause of finger wrinkling is that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.860
if you cut the sympathetic nerve fibers (those
that respond to your fight or flight response)

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.150
to a person’s fingers, they will no longer
wrinkle in water.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.960
For those who don’t want to let go of an
osmosis mediated answer, never fear.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.030
Water diffusing into our porous skin is thought
to cause the reaction by our sympathetic nervous

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.750
system, leading to vasoconstriction.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.710
It’s the vasoconstriction that is the cause
of wrinkling digits.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.200
In the 1930s, Dr.’s T. Lewis and GW Pickering,
noticed patients with damaged median nerves

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.079
(one of the main nerves in your arms that
can affect the movement and sensation in the

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.259
hands) did not have their skin wrinkle in
areas connected to that nerve.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.020
Since this observation, there have been several
studies that have confirmed vasoconstriction

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.399
as the main cause of water-immersion wrinkling.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.380
The debate among researchers is exactly how
the sympathetic nervous system gets stimulated

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.549
by water.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.399
The two leading theories revolve around electrolyte
imbalances in your epidermis, and an overproduction

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.780
of sweat by your sweat glands.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780
Several studies looking at using finger wrinkling
as a test for how well your sympathetic nerves

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.780
are functioning in your limbs, have cited
electrolyte imbalances as the most likely

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.780
cause of an increased fight-or-flight response
to your extremities.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.870
When water diffuses into the many sweat ducts
of your hands and feet, the increased water

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.910
volume creates an abnormal balance of electrolytes
like sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.640
chloride, and bicarbonate.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.790
They state:

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.129
Altered epidermal electrolyte homeostasis
would lead to a change in membrane stability

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.650
of the surrounding dense network of nerve
fibers and trigger increased vasomotor firing

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.370
with subsequent vasoconstriction.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.790
Vasoconstriction, through loss of volume,
leads to negative digit pulp pressure resulting

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.760
in a downward pull on the overlying skin,
which wrinkles as it is distorted.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.450
The degree of wrinkling would directly depend
on the change in digit tip volume and implies

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.230
any process inducing loss of digit volume
will precipitate wrinkling.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.910
Other researchers looking at a cause of the
increased nerve firing have cited an equally

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.300
plausible scenario- overproduction of sweat
by your sweat glands.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.900
Those who posit this cause agree that it’s
your sympathetic nervous system trying to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.810
maintain homeostasis within the epidermis.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.519
However, the cause in their view is a loss
of the surface tension created by sweat droplets

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.879
when outside water is introduced.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.489
Normally your sweat glands at rest produce
sweat at certain pressures.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.459
That droplet is then evaporated depending
on the environment you’re in.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.760
In the water, evaporation is absent.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.019
The result is a sweat droplet that continuously
grows in size.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.621
The researchers calculated all of the pressures
involved and found the total pressure of the

00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:33.130
atmosphere and water, at depths of 10cm, was
767mmHg.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.800
The total pressure exerted on the sweat droplet,
by the sweat gland, was 1260mmHg.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.379
The much higher pressures pushing on your
sweat droplet caused a free-flow of sweat

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.379
from the body.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.870
In response to the excessive loss of sweat,
they concluded:

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.799
To maintain homeostasis, the sympathetic nervous
system triggers a reduction of blood flow

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.970
to the hand, causing the vasoconstriction
and eventual wrinkling of the skin.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.739
Other factors, including the temperature and
tonicity of both the sweat and water, as well

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.470
as the depth of immersion, also influence
the formation of wrinkles.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.960
No matter the exact mechanism causing our
sympathetic nervous system to fire off like

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.959
were being chased by wolves, the result does
give us a gripping advantage in wet conditions.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.080
In 2011, Mark Changizi, an evolutionary neurobiologist,
was the first to propose this idea.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.930
The hypothesis was confirmed by neurobiologists
at Newcastle University in the UK in 2013.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.610
Along with the advantages in wet environments,
they found wrinkled fingers gave no disadvantage

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.690
in dry conditions, suggesting a superiority
in one situation while not diminishing our

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.150
protection in others.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.930
So next time you’re washing dishes, be thankful
that your fingers wrinkle- it gives you a

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:54.650
better grip!
