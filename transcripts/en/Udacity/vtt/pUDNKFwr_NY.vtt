00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.170
While I was an executive and
CEO of large companies.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.260
And what I found is that the investment,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.850
the work with entrepreneurs has
kept me alive, kept me excited.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.750
And so when I left the old role,
I decided that that's what I want to

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.870
do full time and
that's what I've been doing ever since.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.973
A year ago, in attempts to basically
somehow institutionalize my work with

00:00:20.973 --> 00:00:25.395
startups, I've set up in an Exeter here
in the Silicon Valley with two partners,

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:29.496
James Corden and Stan Chenovsky, two
good friends of mine that are very very

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.350
successful entrepreneurs and investors.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.540
And we're now helping young
teams from Israel and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.310
from the United States basically
accelerate their business

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.130
around network effect businesses,
so that's what we focus on.
