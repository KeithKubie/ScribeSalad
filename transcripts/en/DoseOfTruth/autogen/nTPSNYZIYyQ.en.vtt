can get unlucky and trigger a psychotic
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990
can get unlucky and trigger a psychotic
episode and that is not a good thing

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
episode and that is not a good thing
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299

if at all it's not it's not a good plan

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
if at all it's not it's not a good plan
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290
if at all it's not it's not a good plan
and especially not something good to be

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
