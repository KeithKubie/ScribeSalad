me what's so cool and fun about these
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.260
me what's so cool and fun about these
lasers well of course these types of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
lasers well of course these types of
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910
lasers well of course these types of
lasers are the ones that people want to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
lasers are the ones that people want to

brightens up because if you actually
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380
brightens up because if you actually
have one like this and you've played

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
have one like this and you've played
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.390
have one like this and you've played
around your cat will go crazy try to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
around your cat will go crazy try to
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.550
around your cat will go crazy try to
chase this yeah that's a green one yes I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
chase this yeah that's a green one yes I
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.959
chase this yeah that's a green one yes I
have the green one the red one doesn't

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
have the green one the red one doesn't
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.950
have the green one the red one doesn't
matter cat doesn't care

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
matter cat doesn't care
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620
matter cat doesn't care
no that's one I mean the lasers I have

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
no that's one I mean the lasers I have
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630
no that's one I mean the lasers I have
in my lab are more intense and they can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
in my lab are more intense and they can
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459
in my lab are more intense and they can
take one color and turn into rainbow of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
take one color and turn into rainbow of
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440
take one color and turn into rainbow of
colors just in a glass of water it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
colors just in a glass of water it's
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.350
colors just in a glass of water it's
really quite a spectacular thing to see

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
really quite a spectacular thing to see
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420
really quite a spectacular thing to see
yeah again I can imagine it's not a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
yeah again I can imagine it's not a
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.479
yeah again I can imagine it's not a
coincidence that lasers fed the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
coincidence that lasers fed the
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.660
coincidence that lasers fed the
Hollywood with super forces and swards

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
Hollywood with super forces and swards
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.630
Hollywood with super forces and swards
then yes but usually they don't show

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
then yes but usually they don't show
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.959
then yes but usually they don't show
them in the correct way no the correct

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
them in the correct way no the correct
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360
them in the correct way no the correct
way well the thing about lasers is that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
way well the thing about lasers is that
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.709
way well the thing about lasers is that
it goes in a straight line this is why

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
it goes in a straight line this is why
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179
it goes in a straight line this is why
we have smoke in the room if you don't

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
we have smoke in the room if you don't
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520
we have smoke in the room if you don't
have smoke you don't see it and yet they

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
have smoke you don't see it and yet they
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310
have smoke you don't see it and yet they
use lasers like there's some kind of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
use lasers like there's some kind of
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350
use lasers like there's some kind of
sword and a purse there's no like going

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
sword and a purse there's no like going
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.100
sword and a purse there's no like going
sideways it's all going forward you you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
sideways it's all going forward you you
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770
sideways it's all going forward you you
ask your students if they played with

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
ask your students if they played with
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.760
ask your students if they played with
Lego as kids why well I guess because I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
Lego as kids why well I guess because I
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370
Lego as kids why well I guess because I
played with Lego and I think that the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
played with Lego and I think that the
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590
played with Lego and I think that the
building blocks to the lasers the type

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
building blocks to the lasers the type
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.999
building blocks to the lasers the type
of lasers I play with usually have

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
of lasers I play with usually have
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649
of lasers I play with usually have
mirror mounts that are just about hand

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
mirror mounts that are just about hand
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260
mirror mounts that are just about hand
size we have to tweak knobs and very

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
size we have to tweak knobs and very
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359
size we have to tweak knobs and very
carefully until you it's precision and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
carefully until you it's precision and
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.530
carefully until you it's precision and
you have to have the patience but you're

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
you have to have the patience but you're
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539
you have to have the patience but you're
also having building blocks to make the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
also having building blocks to make the
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749
also having building blocks to make the
final laser system hmm so it's like

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
final laser system hmm so it's like
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.340
final laser system hmm so it's like
playing with Lego when you started with

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
playing with Lego when you started with
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.149
playing with Lego when you started with
lasers it was quite a hot topic and is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
lasers it was quite a hot topic and is
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.960
lasers it was quite a hot topic and is
even hotter now where do you think

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970
even hotter now where do you think
 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.359
even hotter now where do you think
lasers will take us what what benefit

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
lasers will take us what what benefit
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340
lasers will take us what what benefit
for mankind can you see in the future

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
for mankind can you see in the future
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440
for mankind can you see in the future
well you know people would say

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
well you know people would say
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.330
well you know people would say
electronics was the technology of the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
electronics was the technology of the
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859
electronics was the technology of the
20th century that's how we got to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
20th century that's how we got to
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.209
20th century that's how we got to
computers and everything else but

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
computers and everything else but
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.399
computers and everything else but
photonics is really going to be the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
photonics is really going to be the
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.440
photonics is really going to be the
technology of the 21st century it's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
technology of the 21st century it's
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.820

already getting there people don't

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
already getting there people don't
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500
already getting there people don't
realize that Google centers have a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
realize that Google centers have a
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.140

million Li

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150
million Li
 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.729
million Li
and every one of them just to get the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739
and every one of them just to get the
 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.530
and every one of them just to get the
data to move around you don't make a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
data to move around you don't make a
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.890
data to move around you don't make a
long-distance phone call without a laser

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
long-distance phone call without a laser
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.059

there's just a myriad you don't go to

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
there's just a myriad you don't go to
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.619
there's just a myriad you don't go to
the grocery store anymore not scan your

groceries using lasers surgeries are

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
groceries using lasers surgeries are
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.369
groceries using lasers surgeries are
being done with lasers they're now

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379
being done with lasers they're now
 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.979
being done with lasers they're now
everywhere and the pulses are getting

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989
everywhere and the pulses are getting
 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.270
everywhere and the pulses are getting
shorter the intense he's always getting

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
shorter the intense he's always getting
 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.210
shorter the intense he's always getting
higher more and more things to be done

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
higher more and more things to be done
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.949
higher more and more things to be done
so we just seen the beginning that's

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
so we just seen the beginning that's
 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.559
so we just seen the beginning that's
right I was like that's right I heard
