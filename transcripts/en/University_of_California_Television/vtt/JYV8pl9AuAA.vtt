00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.306
(soft piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.923
bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.820
aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.253
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.910
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.220
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.473
and how we got here,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.960
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.703
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.799
(lively music)

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.249
(upbeat music)

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.480
- Okay, so in this version
of This Is Your Life,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.210
we are gonna start and we're gonna take it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.970
in order of the speakers.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.180
And so that means, Alyssa, can you come up

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.810
and regale us with some answers? (laughs)

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.800
- Hopefully. (laughs)

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.720
- So one of things you spoke about was

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.660
the problems with meat production

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.757
in terms of the impact
on planetary health.

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:17.520
And so we've got a couple
questions about that.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.147
What about bioengineered
meat for the future?

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.280
Do you think this could help

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.543
both with what it does in terms of saving

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:28.320
the amount of methane produced

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.070
as well as reducing health risks?

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.903
- That's one easy.

00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:34.800
Yes, absolutely, test
tube meat all the way.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.220
I really, I'm a huge fan

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.230
and I teach a lot of this information

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.600
to my graduate students.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.670
We're making unbelievable strides

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970
in terms of actually being able

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.990
to synthetically, laboratory,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.823
produce meat in a laboratory.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:51.670
And a lot of animal rights activists

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.600
are also very pleased with this

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.120
because it is ethically produced meat.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.453
It is sustainable.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.810
I think that we have
some cognitive barriers

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.420
we might need to get past

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.970
in terms of thinking about
growing our hamburgers

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.710
in a petri dish, but it is possible.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.930
So yes, that is actually,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.230
there are big strides being
made in that direction.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.450
- So one of the things that that does

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.356
if you have people
retaining their original,

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:22.833
their (mumbles) desire for meat,

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:26.165
it maintains that whole system.

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.010
I think you envisage, though,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.448
a possibility of a world
without meat eating at all.

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.010
Could you talk about what you think

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.193
the role of vegetarianism and veganism is

00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:38.020
now and for the future?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.853
- I can.

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:41.900
It's a very, (laughs), I try to dance

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.290
very carefully along that line

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.470
but Richard just brought me right over

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.910
to this big debate.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.080
So this is actually a
very contentious debate

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.210
amongst clinicians and nutritionists

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.370
and nutritional anthropologists, actually.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.424
And eaters at large.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:00.283
So I think that there is,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.660
I don't envision a world, personally,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.830
I can talk about myself.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.050
As a nutritional anthropologist,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.090
I don't see a world in which

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.990
we are no longer eating meat,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.230
but I also, I think it's a numbers game.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.730
So the numbers that I
produced were from 2017

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.280
and I think that most of us

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.120
by the demographers' projections

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.690
in terms of what the global population

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.440
will be by 2050, so I do think

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.250
that those projections
with the current state

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.320
of factory farming and
food production in general

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.803
are not sustainable.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:33.800
So I think that we are
making a lot of strides

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.593
in terms of the way that meat is being,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.250
so the way that our animals are being

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.100
treated and fed, and
the way that meat itself

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.933
is being processed.

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.740
And this is actually moving
out of the developing world.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.970
So the US, it's actually pretty good

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.190
internationally speaking

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.810
and we're now doing a lot of work

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.650
in the developing world with small scale

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.950
non-industrial populations

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.940
in terms of how they are
treating their livestock.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.330
so this is a global pattern

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.740
and something that the UN has been putting

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.160
a lot of money and energy into addressing.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.300
In terms of vegetarianism in general,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.220
those numbers are on the
rise globally as well,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.670
so meat eating is going up

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.540
but so are people who,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.420
in the post-industrialized
West in particular

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.520
you have a big shift to
vegetarianism and veganism,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.410
so you see a switch.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.280
So the developing world
is eating more meat

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.530
which is actually the
majority of the world

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.920
in terms of population size,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.980
and those in the post-industrialized West

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.220
are eating more plants.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.600
And this also, in terms of sustainability,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.100
the whole farm-to-table movement

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.890
has really taken off,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.180
and if you're interested there's a lot

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.670
of really interesting information

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.720
available on the internet
about vertical farming

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.920
and about shipping containers

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.190
that are now very popular in big cities

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.490
like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.730
where you have indoor
kind of hydroponic growing

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.780
in these shipping containers

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.680
that are outside in the parking lots

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.400
of these eateries.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.110
So it really is farm-to-table.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.235
They're just micro-farms
in shipping containers.

00:05:58.235 --> 00:05:59.710
(audience laughing)

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.360
- So if you envisage a world

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.150
in which meat eating is greatly reduced,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.123
then what are you doing to,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.853
well, let's say men.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.805
Because...

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:12.250
(laughing)

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.780
Male chimpanzees eat
more meat than females

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.484
and male humans eat more
meat than female humans.

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:22.280
Are you challenging our
evolutionary psychology

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.303
in a major way here?

00:06:24.303 --> 00:06:27.090
And where do you think the
sex difference comes from?

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.923
- Hmm.

00:06:27.923 --> 00:06:30.280
Well first I would like to say, I,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.294
I hope that I am not doing
anything intentionally

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.500
to men or women or anyone.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.810
I think that's a very interesting question

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.260
and one I will try to handle.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.490
Hmm.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.120
I think that the old adage,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.490
you are what you eat, I mean,

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.870
this comes from somewhere, right?

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.440
This is a concept that is
not foreign to any of us

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.740
and I think that humans have a very,

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.340
it's not something we talked about today,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.580
but humans have a very emotional response

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.920
to the food that they eat.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.704
There are also a lot of cultural practices

00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:08.000
and ritual practices that accompany food.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.780
I mean, we didn't talk at all today

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.380
about cuisine or dietary
differences around the world.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.440
So there's a lot more to be said,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.170
and I think that we're trending

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.380
into that part of this with that question.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.000
But I think that particularly,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.440
clearly all the men in this room

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.640
are confident enough in their masculinity

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.190
that I don't think that
it is at all tethered

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.840
to eating meat.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.030
So that is how I will
answer that question.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.187
All the men in my life
don't need to eat meat.

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:41.187
(audience laughing)
(applauding)

00:07:42.155 --> 00:07:43.410
- All right, you can't beat that.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.670
So let's go to something else.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.890
- Thank you! (laughs)

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.723
- Here's a question.

00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:50.700
What do you think of Gary Taubes' work

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.760
suggesting it's refined carbohydrates

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.290
and not dietary fat
that cause the diseases

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.513
you mentioned?

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.140
- I think that's very interesting work,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.160
and if I had been asked,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.380
I have a lot to say about
plant foods as well,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.463
probably more to say about plant foods

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:07.080
than I do about the nutritional
significance of meat.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.810
I do think that refined foods in general

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.280
are highly problematic
for nutritional reasons.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.550
I think a lot of this has to do

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.510
with additives in addition to
just refined carbohydrates.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.330
So I think it's very promising work.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.440
I think it's very interesting,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.412
and I think that we're
asking the same questions.

00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:25.530
What is good for our bodies to eat?

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.410
What are we adapted to eat?

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.570
We're asking the same questions

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.090
we've been asking for decades and decades,

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.860
but our methods are becoming
more elegant and refined.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.170
So I think I'm still waiting

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.430
for more information to come,

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.320
but whoever penned that question,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.760
I'm more than happy to talk to you

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.370
in more detail about some of
that specific work afterward

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.880
because I'm really very interested

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.463
in refined carbs as well.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.640
- So finally, we have a question

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.640
that comes straight out of the
Salk Institute, as it were.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.187
The enzyme for decomposing Neu5Gc,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.675
when did it get lost and why?

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:05.872
And is it there in other meat eaters?

00:09:05.872 --> 00:09:07.010
- Ooh.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.170
Maybe I can ask Ajit Varki to come up

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.000
and answer that question.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.220
So the CMAH gene was lost

00:09:15.486 --> 00:09:17.480
two--
- About two million.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.790
- Approximately two million years ago.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.980
So what we know, that was
a very complicated slide

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.850
and as I said before, I did
my postdoc in Ajit's lab

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.670
but I did a very small portion

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.310
of a very large and important study.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.870
I mostly just did the lyophilizer

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.540
and drove to local dairies

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.700
and got all the dairy to analyze.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.640
But it's a really important study

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.477
and the reason the study is important,

00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:41.430
the reason everything
coming out of the Varki lab

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.750
is really important is because

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.560
as a scientist, I like
many different vectors.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.430
So if you can get evidence
from many different lines,

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.750
okay, all right, now
we're saying something.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.950
And what's really interesting

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.260
about the Neu5Gc case is it doesn't matter

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.280
what lens you're using.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.150
It doesn't matter if you're
using animal modeling.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.050
It doesn't matter if you're looking,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.210
it really doesn't matter.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.210
All the evidence, all the
arrows are pointing to this.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.200
So the evolutionary story,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.890
which I did not say in
my one little slide,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.670
we lost this gene.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.130
So you find Neu5Gc in pretty
much, almost every animal.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.110
You do not find it in us

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.060
other than what we are eating.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.460
So that's where the metabolic
incorporation comes in.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.860
So we lost the ability to synthesize this,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.440
this particular gene, approximately
two million years ago.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.230
So it is very much integral to this story

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.440
of meat eating.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.750
So how and when our
species started eating meat

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.130
and what the metabolic consequences are

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.950
of that consumption, they're important.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.500
So whether it's at the cellular level,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.260
whether you're dealing
with animal modeling,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
whether you're in the Varki lab like I was

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.850
lyophilizing cheese, all of it

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.400
is part of this big story of humans

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.050
and their history of meat eating.

00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:53.123
- Thank you very much, Alyssa.

00:10:53.123 --> 00:10:56.290
(audience applauding)

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.460
Rebecca, are you willing to come

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.360
and answer some questions? (laughs)

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.550
She is shaking her head,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.384
but that's not the way the game works.

00:11:07.384 --> 00:11:09.634
(laughing)

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:13.720
Okay.
- Okay.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.230
- So, (laughs) you're looking nervous.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.285
You're not confident in your masculinity.

00:11:18.285 --> 00:11:19.736
- (laughing) No!

00:11:19.736 --> 00:11:22.060
(audience laughing)

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.013
- Okay, so we have a question

00:11:25.013 --> 00:11:28.010
that actually came in
from the streaming world

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.910
and it is about the female hunters.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.230
So the question is about the age

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.170
and fertility status.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.520
Do they have a special
age and fertility status?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.270
Are they generally older?

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.001
Are they pregnant?

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.020
Any characterization?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.170
- Yeah.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.443
So women hunt throughout their lives.

00:11:48.114 --> 00:11:50.930
When they're girls

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.150
they hunt very small lizards,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.817
little lizards called winyjikiti

00:11:54.817 --> 00:11:55.720
and they're on the rocks

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.530
and you turn over the rocks
and look for the little.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.160
This is specialized kid activity

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.590
hunting for these little lizards.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.130
As they get older, they shift toward

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.060
hunting for the monitor lizards,

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.440
but when women are in their sort of teen

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.750
and reproductive years,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.500
they split their time between
hunting monitor lizards,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.100
hunting winyjikiti in the rocks,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.470
and picking fruit and doing a lot

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.050
of more sedentary activities.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.180
This is because babies are heavy,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.280
and they're slow, and you wanna go hunting

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.610
and you have all these kids with you

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.040
and they complain, it's boring,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.790
they wanna go hunt
winyjikiti in the rocks.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.360
So you hunt with them for a while

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.450
or you hunt for a while,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.270
and then you gotta go back
and do things with the kids.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.220
So when women are younger

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.470
and they're lookin' after the kids more,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.570
they'll be doing less hunting.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.720
And as you become older, indeed,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.500
as a post-menopausal woman,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.473
you become almost a specialized
small-animal hunter.

00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:46.840
- Hunter.
- Hunter.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.580
- Not a specialized small-animal.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.759
- I almost said that, didn't I?

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:52.210
(laughing)
- No, no, that was good.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.500
Okay, all right.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.253
So here's another
question about the women,

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.490
about the ecology of the situation.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.393
The question is, is it possible

00:13:02.393 --> 00:13:05.150
that the willingness of the Martu to share

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.930
is related to the abundance
of the food resource?

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.763
And the observation here

00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:11.130
is that the women in the photos and videos

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.050
looked very well fed,
even maybe overweight.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.410
And so, are they actually consuming

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.150
some refined carbohydrates as well?

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.783
- I would say yes, that that is correct.

00:13:21.763 --> 00:13:24.950
Martu contemporary diet
in the Martu community

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.080
ranges between about 30% and 50%.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.950
This was between 2000 and 2010

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.810
when I was collecting a lot of this data.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.910
Between about 30% to 50% bush food

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.620
and the remainder in the form of food

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.170
that's purchased at a little
shop in the community.

00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:43.290
It's very expensive to
purchase food in the shop

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.430
and people get about, a
very small amount of money

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.830
fortnightly from the Australian government

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.560
which is basically enough

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.510
to supply maybe half the calories.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.690
So they generally end up buying

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.210
a lot of white flour and
making bread out of it,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.830
and that's basically
what people subsist on.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.870
So diet, contemporary diet today

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.680
is actually quite poor in many respects,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.790
so that's why a lot of
ladies are overweight.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.350
Also we have problems with diabetes

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.940
and similar sorts of metabolic issues

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.540
that you find in a lot of
indigenous communities.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.600
- So given that, do
you think it's possible

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.850
that because they are relatively well off

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.130
in that respect, I mean,
from an energy point of view,

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.630
that they're more willing to share?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.820
Or do you think that's something

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.590
that goes back into times when

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.455
they didn't have that resource?

00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:27.250
- So, no, it definitely,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.360
as food becomes less
scarce, people share less.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.560
So when everybody has
equal amounts of food,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.310
food is very abundant, there's
less sharing that goes on.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.090
Sharing becomes more and more critical

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.070
the less food there is,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.820
and there's great efforts made

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.370
to ensure that people who are hungry

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.453
don't go hungry.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.730
- So there's efforts made to ensure

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.750
that people who are
hungry don't go hungry,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.570
but then the opposite also happens?

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.020
That when they have more,
then they make efforts

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.563
to keep it all for themselves?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.753
- No, actually, they don't. (laughing)

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.320
Most of the time, whenever
there's a large harvest

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.220
of something brought in,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.820
it's shared really widely.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.540
Have I just contradicted myself? (laughs)

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.760
- Well, maybe they share
equally at all times,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.010
but it sounded as though you were saying

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.367
they share more when resources are scarce.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.010
- I think that, yeah,

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.360
there's a greater emphasis on ensuring

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.880
the equality of food consumption

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.210
when food is scarce across individuals,

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.570
when there's a lot of asynchrony

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.433
in how much each individual has.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.430
- So that's what we all wanna hear,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.630
that people are nice in that way.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.120
Now here's a specific question

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.170
about the sort of the
utility of the sharing.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.690
Is more protein available to be given

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.242
to nursing mothers?

00:15:49.242 --> 00:15:50.075
- Uh,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.800
I would think.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.390
Actually, I don't know the
answer to that question.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.550
I would think the women
would get it themselves

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.883
if they needed it.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.270
- But--
- But, no.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.900
There's no special favoring.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.470
- There's, I'm pregnant,
give me more food, or,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.303
there's nothing like that?

00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:08.863
- Not that I know of.
- No.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.300
Okay, so here's a slightly wacky question

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.169
to end up with.
- Oh no.

00:16:15.169 --> 00:16:16.117
(audience laughing)

00:16:16.117 --> 00:16:18.130
- Is there any support for the idea

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.340
that female involvement
in hunting and gathering

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.303
has led to modern female shopping?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.343
- Shopping.

00:16:25.343 --> 00:16:28.060
(audience laughing)

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.893
Hm.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.210
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.343
Um,

00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:37.626
no.

00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:41.441
(audience laughing)
(applauding)

00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:46.441
- Thank you so much.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.060
Okay, so those were the humans.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.270
Now let's have the chimps.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.410
And in terms of having the chimps,

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.500
I think it would be great
to have Ian and David

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.560
come up together, because the questions

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.050
are rather similar for the two of them.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.880
And we'll see if they
can do some male bonding

00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:06.230
or illustrate some of the more violent

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.430
propensities of chimpanzees.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.653
- I'm very low-ranking.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.092
- And I'm old and senescent.

00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:16.820
(laughing)

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.900
- Okay, so here's a question

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.765
that's very specific to Ian and or David.

00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:25.350
(laughing)

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:28.750
What is the explanation for why bonobos

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.440
eat and hunt less?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.890
Is it correlated with
female social dominance,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.074
testosterone?

00:17:35.074 --> 00:17:37.950
Bonobos are genetically
closer to homo sapiens

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.380
and may represent
insights into inheritance

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.810
against acquired behaviors.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.600
David, do you want to take
the first shot at that?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.830
- Well, I'll answer the,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.210
not quite the last part of the question.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.810
First, they aren't closer to humans.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.050
Both are equally close to
humans phylogenetically,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:54.943
evolutionarily.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.333
That's a good question,

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:59.220
and I don't think we
really know the answer

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.810
other than to say that,

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.400
first of all, there is a lot of variation,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.500
as Ian pointed out, among
different chimpanzee communities,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.890
not just different populations or chimps

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.133
in different habitats.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.375
So there are chimpanzees who hunt

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:20.309
about as infrequently as bonobos do

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:21.550
as far as we can tell.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.960
But still, a big difference seems to be

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.880
that bonobos rarely hunt monkeys.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.290
And in some places,
there are no observations

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.880
of bonobos hunting monkeys at all.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.080
It's only recently that people

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.290
have started to report some from LuiKotale

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.140
in the DRC, for example,
and one other site now.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.450
And that might have something to do

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.041
with the fact that bonobo males,

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.940
their behavioral repertoire

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.150
and their social strategies

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.940
are quite different from
those of male chimpanzees.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.210
They occasionally form
coalitions with each other

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.300
but they don't form
alliances with each other.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.740
If they do, it's much more likely

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.810
to be with a female than,

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.430
or if they do, it's with
a female, not a male.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.710
And there are differences
in the power balance

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.023
between the sexes,

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:16.610
and it might contribute to simply

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.650
less inclination on the part of males

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.730
to take the risks involved in hunting.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.573
But we don't really know the answer yet.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.530
- I'd like to also add that

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.659
we don't necessarily
wanna equate aggression

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:35.310
with hunting as well.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.230
I see it as hunting monkeys is foraging.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.080
And, I mean, it looks awful to us

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.853
because they're tearing
little monkeys apart,

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.802
but work from Engogo and a little bit

00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:49.150
of the work that I have done

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.760
have demonstrated that
there's some decoupling

00:19:54.448 --> 00:19:57.300
of chimp aggression, testosterone,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.463
and hunting behaviors,
so it's complicated.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.453
- Yeah.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.470
There's actually some very nice data

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.010
that Marissa Sobolewski
collected at Engogo

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.090
showing that when males, male chimpanzees

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.850
go on boundary patrols,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.100
so this is intercommunity aggression,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.240
testosterone levels go up.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.420
And in fact, they go up before males

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.130
set out on a patrol, as if somehow

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.940
they're anticipating doing this.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.630
She didn't find the same
difference with hunting.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.750
So no increase in testosterone

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.023
associated with hunting.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.100
- So you spoke about the differences

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.440
between bonobos and chimps

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.810
in the way that they hunt.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.890
Could you just give a little bit more

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.710
of a description about the
way chimpanzees do hunt?

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.336
For instance, do they go on hunts

00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:48.120
to look for opportunities to find monkeys

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.030
or is it all the result of running

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.540
into monkeys by chance?

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.350
And then when they do run
into monkeys, what happens?

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.564
Ian, do you want to take the first--

00:20:56.564 --> 00:20:58.180
- Sure.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.830
The answer, of course,
because they're chimpanzees,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.020
is that it varies.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.485
And I think that's one of
the big take home messages

00:21:04.485 --> 00:21:06.950
from this symposium is that

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.340
we should move away from talking

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.210
about chimps writ large

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.980
and talk more about chimps
in different communities

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.450
and understanding why we see

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.800
the differences that we do.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.630
So at Tai and at Engogo,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:26.630
the chimps do appear to
go specifically on patrols

00:21:27.384 --> 00:21:30.970
or in search of red colobus monkeys.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.112
They go silent.

00:21:33.112 --> 00:21:35.200
Although they're in the
middle of their territory,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.950
they're making a beeline
for where the monkeys are,

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.750
and they definitely seem
to be searching for them.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.160
At Gombe, Kanyawara, and elsewhere,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.970
it does not seem to be the case.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.410
It's definitely more as though

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.310
they are on, they're
moving from one fruit tree

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.710
to the next, and they
may take a slight detour

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.430
if they hear monkeys

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.810
but it doesn't seem like

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.700
they're really moving
specifically to find them.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.080
Then I can talk about Gombe in particular

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.110
about what happens when a hunt occurs.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.310
It's usually there's
a period of time when,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.024
it's usually the males

00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:15.360
gather together underneath the monkeys

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.710
and they're looking up and
sort of trying to assess.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.700
In my mind, they're trying to assess

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.140
whether or not they're
vulnerable individuals,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.810
the juveniles and infants.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.010
And then one or more individual chimps

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.500
will rush up into the trees

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.130
and chase the monkeys.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.234
It's my impression,

00:22:32.234 --> 00:22:34.940
and also I have data to back this up,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.830
that, at least at Gombe,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.730
it certainly seems to be
every chimp for himself.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.750
There does not seem to be
any kind of coordination,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.140
and it's what we call a
byproduct of mutualism

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.940
in the sense that each individual

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.150
is selfishly trying to get his own monkey

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.590
but in doing so, creates chaos

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.060
and makes it easier
for other guys to hunt.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.300
And we've actually found evidence

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.549
of specific individuals
who are more keen hunters

00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:04.104
who sort of catalyze these hunts.

00:23:04.104 --> 00:23:06.373
I don't know if you wanna add anything.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.513
- Variation, yes.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.640
The majority of red colobus hunts

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.410
that we've seen at Engogo have happened

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.190
during these patrols when the chimpanzees

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.130
seem to look for monkeys to hunt

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.120
and will sometimes go
for a couple of hours

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.340
to try to find some.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.770
And then they may find
some and decide not to hunt

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.640
because the group is too small

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.993
or it's just a bad situation.

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:35.081
And the subject of deferred consumption

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:39.980
came up today with reference to humans

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.780
and earlier hominins carrying

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.410
parts of butchered
carcasses or entire animals

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.700
from one place to another

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.890
and then processing them further

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.870
and consuming them there.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.090
Chimpanzees don't do that,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.590
except on a very small scale

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.060
when they will carry some meat

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.490
away from the immediate
location of a hunt.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.550
But I have seen them wait

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.060
and patiently follow
a group of red colobus

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.030
or simply wait under the monkeys

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.600
for an hour or an hour and a half

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.763
and then the monkeys do something stupid.

00:24:10.763 --> 00:24:11.596
(laughing)

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:13.700
They put themselves in a bad position

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.330
and the chimps are up
and after them like that.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.443
And then also, I would agree,

00:24:19.443 --> 00:24:22.540
it's very difficult to see

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.410
on most occasions whether there is any

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.510
real coordination among
the individuals involved.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.380
Occasionally it's easy.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.820
So, I once remember
seeing Mingus at Engogo

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.370
who was not the best at capturing monkeys

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.750
but he was the least afraid

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.820
of taking on adult male red colobus,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.060
and he went up into a tree

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.620
and got underneath this group of monkeys

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.730
who were stationary above the chimps.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.000
And there were 18 other
adult male chimpanzees

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.090
on the ground below him

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.280
and he sat there for maybe 15, 20 minutes

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.390
waiting for anyone else
to come up to join him,

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.510
and none of them did so eventually

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.440
he came down, and no hunt.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.880
But at other times,
it's just chaos, to us.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.640
But the chimpanzees, as Ian said,

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.290
are at least very good

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.610
at playing off of each other

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.730
and recognizing when someone else

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.940
has done something that puts a monkey

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.850
in a vulnerable position,

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.623
and then making an effort to pick it off.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.970
- Just to change topic
a little bit from this.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.077
You've already spoken about

00:25:30.077 --> 00:25:33.350
your skepticism about
any kind of relationship

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.580
between violence towards members

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.173
of their own species and hunting.

00:25:39.013 --> 00:25:41.480
However, there are a couple
of questions about this.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.330
And let me put it this way,

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.130
to what do you attribute the fact

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.400
that chimpanzees are
both violent and hunters

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.650
while bonobos are not?

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.810
And that in humans,
there's lots of evidence

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.310
showing that there is a relationship

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.970
between hunting and violence?

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.482
So Keith Autobon found that the groups

00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:05.220
in which you had a higher percentage

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.668
of the diet coming from hunting

00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:09.713
were more likely to be involved in war.

00:26:10.784 --> 00:26:12.990
Any explanations for these correlations?

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.610
- Is this a question
coming from the crowd, or--

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.124
- It's coming from...

00:26:16.124 --> 00:26:17.740
(audience laughing)

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.522
- Yeah, uh-huh. (laughing)

00:26:21.522 --> 00:26:24.190
David, you take this one.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.290
- Okay, where do I start?

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.190
We have a limited amount of time here.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.710
Bonobos are not quite as non-violent

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.240
as the popular literature would have it,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.560
but there do seem to be
some real differences

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.820
between bonobos and
chimpanzees on that score.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.880
Bonobos generally are afraid of,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.890
hostile towards neighbors,

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.920
although there are intriguing reports

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.810
of members of presumably
different bonobo communities

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.930
encountering each other
and having peaceful

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.940
and even friendly
interactions with each other,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.493
which would not happen in chimpanzees.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.570
And bonobos are not known to engage

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.760
in chimpanzee patrol-like behavior,

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.870
going to look for opportunities

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.773
to make attacks on neighbors.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.450
And whether that really contributes to,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.200
in itself, to the difference
in hunting frequencies

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.450
and in particular, differences
in the hunting monkeys,

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.940
again, it's a good question

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.290
and it's hard to be certain.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.510
When it comes to the
human ethnographic record,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.600
I happen to be teaching, co-teaching

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.400
a course now with a
couple of my colleagues

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.213
called The Anthropology of War,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.790
and I could probably go on far too long

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.750
about the questions about the variation

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.410
in the reported frequency of warfare

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.858
among historically documented

00:27:47.858 --> 00:27:50.000
hunter-gatherer groups, for example.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.530
But I don't think it's that simple,

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.240
that you can just look
at a few figures and say,

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.030
oh, well, this society hunted more

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.810
than that one and also
they engaged in war more.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.134
In fact, there are some problems

00:28:04.134 --> 00:28:07.420
with the literature on the subject

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.260
of variation in, however we define it,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.010
and I'm begging a big question there

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.293
in the frequency of war
among hunter-gatherers.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.790
- I should just add that with
regard to bonobos hunting,

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.060
we still don't have fundamental data

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.420
on the rate at which they're encountering

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.143
potential prey, so that's
one possible explanation.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.300
- Okay, I'm duly put in my place.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.736
(audience laughing)

00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:39.260
And I'm gonna resort to the final question

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.690
which raises a question
about conservation.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.540
The question is, do indigenous people

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.760
living where chimps hunt primates

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.483
also hunt and eat primates themselves?

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.120
- Certainly around Gombe there is a taboo

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.730
against eating primates,
particularly chimpanzees.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.610
So that's good.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.000
However, we do have problems

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.320
with traps that are set for ungulates

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.297
that chimpanzees will potentially step in

00:29:10.297 --> 00:29:11.320
and get caught.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.690
It's not nearly as big as a problem

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.710
as it is at Kibale, but...

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.260
- When we come to humans,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.240
then we really encounter variation.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.230
And there's tremendous cultural variation

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.286
even in the same parts of Africa

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:30.850
in terms of people's
interest in eating bush meat,

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.970
as it's called.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.820
And in some places, chimpanzees
and gorillas are food,

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.100
and it's been a huge conservation issue

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.380
in parts of Central and West Africa.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.220
In Kibale, for example,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.158
fortunately, at least until recently,

00:29:47.158 --> 00:29:50.520
people living around this national park

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.520
did not regard primates as food.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.010
That has started to change

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.893
initially with baboons,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.700
which cause a lot of problems

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.463
because they raid people's crops.

00:30:01.503 --> 00:30:04.660
And also, they are
legally vermin in Uganda

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.250
so it's not illegal to kill them,

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.360
but unfortunately we do now have

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.070
at least one case and possibly more

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.866
of people going after
chimpanzees to get meat.

00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:18.503
Hopefully that's not going to continue.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.495
- Thank you very much, David and Ian.

00:30:22.495 --> 00:30:25.662
(audience applauding)

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.273
Jill, we welcome you.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.270
Oh, you've got another question?

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.237
You're going to ask me a question, or--

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.689
- I brought my own.
- Okay.

00:30:40.689 --> 00:30:41.860
All right.
(audience laughing)

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.563
Is it a good one?
- I don't know.

00:30:43.563 --> 00:30:45.380
I didn't look at it.
- Okay, all right.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.870
Well, I wanted to start off

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.120
with just a question clarifying some

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.430
of the methodological issues.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.390
If you could observe male and female

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.320
Fongoli chimps equally,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.090
do you think that the
amount of female hunting

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.230
would increase, decrease,
or stay the same?

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.090
- Oh, I think it would
definitely increase.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.580
So, like I said, we
have focal male subjects

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.110
that we follow from when they get up

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.230
in the morning to when
they go to sleep at night.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.600
We're taking data every five minutes.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.450
There are times of the year when we never,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:14.600
they never leave our sight

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.900
'cause we have really great visibility.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.439
The females are there and it's
a very cohesive community,

00:31:20.439 --> 00:31:22.380
so we're rarely without females

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.520
but again, I'm not targeting them.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.090
The thing about the bush baby hunting

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.500
is that it is audible,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.700
and so you can hear the sound of the tool

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.360
hitting into the tree branch.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.640
And so when I hear that, or if I see it,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.150
I abandon my male and I go observe

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.867
whoever is hunting at the time.

00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:43.360
So we've got some good
information on females

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.570
but I think that we're really

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.670
underestimating what they're doing, mm-hm.

00:31:47.998 --> 00:31:50.819
- Okay, so if the females are going

00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:52.581
to be doing even more,

00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:54.110
do you already have a sense

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.560
of the way this is inherited?

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.996
Is there any possibility
that the daughters

00:31:59.996 --> 00:32:03.620
of the mothers who hunt a lot with sticks,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.970
with tools are doing it more themselves?

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.057
- That's a great question,

00:32:07.057 --> 00:32:08.380
and something we're looking at now.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.276
So we have enough data so we can look at

00:32:12.276 --> 00:32:14.570
individuals as they were infant,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.820
juveniles, adolescents,
and now even some adults,

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.540
and look at the behavior of their mother.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.550
So, you know, I would expect

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.793
that these two top high-ranking females

00:32:22.793 --> 00:32:24.575
that hunt a lot might have kids

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.160
that are good hunters as well,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.270
and I would expect to
see some sex differences

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.930
like has been found at
Gombe with termite fishing.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.354
But we're just kind of in the midst

00:32:34.354 --> 00:32:36.393
of analyses right now.

00:32:37.527 --> 00:32:41.410
Just qualitatively, there are
some families, for example.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.956
I didn't mention Lucile, but she's also

00:32:42.956 --> 00:32:44.780
a prominent bush baby hunter

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.260
and her kids seem especially precocious

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.860
in terms of hunting,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.460
and so I would expect to
see some differences there

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.910
but I'm just, you know,
I can't say for sure yet.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.110
- Okay, so meat theft, you said,

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.720
is not very common in the Fongoli chimps.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.490
So there's a question about why that is.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.940
Is it because they all hunt

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.750
and so they're all getting lots of meat?

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:14.180
Or do they all hunt because
theft is relatively rare?

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.500
- I mean, I would kinda say the latter.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.720
Again, it's something
that we're looking at.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.853
I think there's incentive to hunt.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.800
One of the hypotheses that I'm looking at

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.703
is because of that skewed sex ratio,

00:33:28.703 --> 00:33:30.690
it could be that males are tolerant

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.610
as a form of mating strategy.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.413
That's just one of the hypotheses.

00:33:36.008 --> 00:33:38.620
So do they share more with females

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.220
that are in estrus or
with certain females?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.840
I will say that preliminary data

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.350
shows that there's not the support

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.580
for the meat for sex hypotheses.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.570
But that is definitely a
hypotheses we're looking at.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.550
So does this have to do,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.900
can this skewed sex ratio at Fongoli

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.871
explain what I see as male tolerance?

00:33:55.871 --> 00:33:58.714
And again, we find some support for it

00:33:58.714 --> 00:34:00.110
with the preliminary evidence,

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.440
so I expect it to, hopefully, stand up.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.130
Well, not hopefully, but perhaps it will.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.540
But there are a number of different ideas.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.650
I guess one is that,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.980
there do seem to be some trends

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.320
that you see in West African chimps

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.670
where there might be some differences

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.140
compared to East African subspecies

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.210
and so you see these grouping behaviors

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.370
at Tai where you have a lot

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:19.350
of males and females together.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.290
You see the same thing at Gombe.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.640
So that's also something that
we're taking into account.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.773
Or could it be a subspecies difference?

00:34:27.734 --> 00:34:29.174
- With the sharing patterns,

00:34:29.174 --> 00:34:31.179
did you say that they share more

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.424
with unrelated individuals
than their own offspring?

00:34:34.424 --> 00:34:35.257
- They do.

00:34:35.257 --> 00:34:36.585
- Could you say a little
bit more about that?

00:34:36.585 --> 00:34:38.570
That seems like a
particularly odd thing to do.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:39.510
- Sure, yeah.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.460
So yeah, the females obviously
haven't read the literature.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.380
So we expected, you know,

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.450
a couple of hypotheses that we tested,

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:50.220
one would be the kin selection hypothesis.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.650
You expect to share with your kids,

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.490
and we were really surprised, (laughing)

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.610
I don't know why I find it funny,

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.810
but we were really surprised

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.510
to find that that was not the case.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.540
And not only did they
share with adult males,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.410
but they also shared with adult females.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.240
And so that's definitely something

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.110
that we're looking into.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.710
We have a bigger sample size

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.440
but I believe our initial analyses

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.430
was of over 270 dyadic events.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:18.170
And so, yeah, that was really interesting.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.380
Males share with females

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.270
as well as other adult males.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.040
And again, the meat for sex hypothesis

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.450
has not been supported.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:27.820
So kids, you know,
offspring do get a share

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.370
but that is still surprising to me,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.263
that they don't get more than they do.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.530
- So one final question
about the hunting strategy.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.450
Do they already know when
they're approaching a tree

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.110
if there's a galago in there

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.430
when they stop poking with sticks?

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.637
Or is it just all exploratory?

00:35:46.494 --> 00:35:48.029
- That's a really good question.

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:49.440
that's something that we're exploring now.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.940
So I have actually someone
studying galagos at my site.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.840
She just, no, she'll start next week.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.950
We've been trying to study them.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.650
We have various ways of doing it.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.730
But one of the big questions is

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.500
the availability and counter rate,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.490
so I think it's opportunistic

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.690
but they do revisit sites

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.130
where they've captured galagos before.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.530
It seems to me there's a
definite age difference.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.870
So adults will abandon
a site quite quickly,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.050
and so they may go up and
just look in and leave it.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.360
They may go up, make a tool,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.090
stab around in there for a while.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.710
I don't know if you
could see here doing that

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.920
on the film, but they'll smell it

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.280
and sometimes even taste the tip.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.680
And adults will abandon sites
sometimes quite quickly,

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.550
and then immature individuals will come

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.500
and just keep at it for
10 minutes or 15 minutes.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.000
So I assume that they can assess

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.810
whether or not there's a galago there

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.820
fairly quickly, but we're not sure.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.760
So we have different methods.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.400
We have a borescope that we've been using

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.340
which is what a plumber uses
to look into drain pipes,

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.440
and so (laughing) I've been
having a field assistant

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.100
climb trees and use a borescope

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.740
to try to see what's going on.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.540
He doesn't really like that very much.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.610
(audience laughing)

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.470
That's only worked out
so, you know, it's okay,

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.580
but now we're really
doing a systematic studies

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.710
of the bush baby themselves,

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.830
'cause we think a lot of what's going on

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.880
at least in terms of the
tool-assisted hunting,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.310
and I didn't talk about it

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.080
but it's a very focused season,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.250
I call it bush baby season,

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.780
that probably has to do a lot

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.563
with the galago behavior itself.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.460
- I think it's just great
that these new discoveries

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.680
are still coming out, and it means

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.640
that students should be
going out to the field

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.630
finding new places to do the kind of work

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.579
that Jill has done.

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:23.412
Thank you.

00:37:23.412 --> 00:37:26.579
(audience applauding)

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.890
Jim, I think it's time
for me to turn over.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.740
- I guess I'll launch in.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.660
Margaret, are you still here?

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.550
Hi, Margaret!

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.300
Got some questions for you.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.383
(audience chuckling)

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.300
We've got a very specific one

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.850
and a very general one,

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.531
so this will kind of span the range.

00:37:50.531 --> 00:37:53.402
- What fun, yes.
- So which you want first?

00:37:53.402 --> 00:37:56.280
(laughing)

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.883
I'll give you the specific one.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.820
Do colobine monkeys fit the C3, C4 model

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.690
that you presented given their specialized

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.690
digestive systems and their
end stage digestion process?

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.783
- They do, actually.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.823
They don't eat C4.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:23.130
So they are actually
going only after C3 leaves

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:28.350
or there is one that goes after lichens

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.053
and those happen to be C3.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.143
So yes, it's all C3.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.463
- Now for the slightly bigger picture.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.067
There's a theory that associates

00:38:42.067 --> 00:38:44.770
the consumption of meat not only

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.870
with all the behavioral traits

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.160
that made us human but specifically

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.550
with the encephalization,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.890
the evolution of larger brains

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.350
in humans and other primates.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.390
Is this supported by the evidence?

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.840
An association between
the consumption of meat

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.620
and meat byproducts playing a role

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.277
in encephalization.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.630
- I wanna say that I happen to agree

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:13.013
completely with Richard's
point about the fat.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.670
The problem with fat is that it is

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.430
not gonna record in the appetite.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.420
It is not picked up.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.363
So the C3, C4 that I'm
seeing cannot be fat.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.550
There must be some meat eating going along

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.920
because you don't see it.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.150
So the question is,

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.520
do I think that has anything

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.030
to do with encephalization.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.050
I think the fat does,

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.690
because I think there's a lot of energy.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.660
And also, the very first tools we see,

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.900
there are fillets,

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.460
I'm not gonna deny there are fillets,

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.060
but there are a lot of pounding tools.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.120
And when I looked at the Hadza data

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.650
and I was watching them,

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.360
of course, they're pounding all the time

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.950
because they're eating baobab seeds

00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.910
and they're pounding.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.970
And I thought, hm.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.870
I mean, why couldn't you just pound a bone

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:08.030
and get the marrow out of it?

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.510
Also I should say, at Koobi Fora

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.100
where Henry Bunn was working

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.390
for a very long time looking at cut marks

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.040
and crushed bone, what we noticed,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.870
or he noticed, I should
say, and pointed out to me

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.000
is that every hippo jaw has a divot

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.290
taken out of it right where

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.493
there is a big fat pad.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.250
So I found that extremely interesting

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.600
because the energy from fat

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.900
would actually feed a growing brain.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.160
And as Bob Martin always said,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.370
the female will grow the
largest offspring she can

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.930
with the largest brain across anything.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:52.750
Well you increase the energy enormously,

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.290
then I can see where you could

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.040
actually end up with the mother

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.500
producing a larger-brained offspring

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.933
to a limit of what her body can tolerate.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.330
- I always like to make
things more complicated--

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.600
- Of course you do.
- Than they need to be.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600
- I know you do.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.155
I wrote a paper with you.

00:41:10.155 --> 00:41:12.101
(laughing)

00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:12.934
- Woo!

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.163
Well.

00:41:19.403 --> 00:41:21.374
- You shouldn't have said that to me

00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:22.916
until afterward.
- And on that note.

00:41:22.916 --> 00:41:24.989
- Yes. (laughing)

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:25.890
- As I understand it,

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.280
there's sort of two ways to look

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.000
at the role that diet changes

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.873
and that access to meat could
play in encephalization,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.620
and fat would be included.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:43.620
In one version, obtaining
this great nutrient source,

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.590
perhaps only great once it's cooked

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.990
but nevertheless is a
great nutrient source,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:50.783
enables us to grow a larger brain.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.500
The other version is that obtaining

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.290
this easily digested nutrient source

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.780
enables us to shrink our guts,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.460
and when our guts shrink

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.600
we're not spending as much energy

00:42:05.004 --> 00:42:09.093
metabolizing food and
so we have this surplus.

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:11.756
The surplus energy is then available

00:42:11.756 --> 00:42:13.940
to build the brain with there.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.440
Can you tease those apart at all?

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.273
- Yeah.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.680
There was a hypothesis by Leslie Allo

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.170
that you trade what's going on in the gut

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.600
with the brain.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.400
And I have to go back
to Bob Martin yet again

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.790
and say that what he was pointing out

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.800
was that you increase energy in,

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.710
you decrease the gut, and it
also can increase the brain.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.350
So the two are going together

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.840
but the way he liked to point it out,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.720
and I always thought
it made a lot of sense,

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.880
is that it's going through the mother.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.620
And so it's not so much

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.310
that the animal themself,

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.790
but it makes the sense
in terms of reproduction

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.200
because it's going through the mother.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.680
So I definitely think
the two are connected.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.220
You decrease the guts.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.516
You don't have to spend as much energy

00:43:01.516 --> 00:43:03.402
in processing your food.

00:43:03.402 --> 00:43:05.813
You have the energy left over,

00:43:05.813 --> 00:43:09.818
and it's usually more
easily digested energy

00:43:09.818 --> 00:43:12.960
whether it be fat or cooked meat.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.613
And yes, you can.

00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:16.420
I think it's always made sense to me

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.450
that that's the way it worked.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.081
- Okay, thank you.

00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:23.248
(audience applauding)

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.900
Briana.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.690
There were a couple of
questions along the line,

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.620
and you can see where this is coming from,

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.420
a couple of questions along the line of

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.380
given these ideas about
bone marrow availability,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.634
and actually Margaret touched on this,

00:43:40.634 --> 00:43:43.290
but what sort of actualistic data

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.683
do you have on scavenging
for the inside of bones?

00:43:47.694 --> 00:43:50.953
And any work going on and
bone marrow availability?

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.730
- So any actualistic work going on?

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:55.670
That's a good question.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.981
I don't think there has been as much

00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:00.540
actualistic work done on bone marrow.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.750
As far as thinking
about the fossil record,

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.761
though, I think percussion marks

00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:09.432
were only recognized starting in 1988,

00:44:09.432 --> 00:44:12.241
and they're, I think, in some ways

00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:16.070
harder to recognize on
fossils than cut marks are.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.750
And I have a really fun database

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.270
that I try to keep up on

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.865
actually from the early Stone Age

00:44:23.865 --> 00:44:26.010
all of the sites that have evidence

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.370
for butchering marks,
including both cut marks

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.480
and percussion marks.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.360
And I think the percussion mark,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.620
I think that percussion marks

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.970
are under recognized and under reported.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.870
So I'm really enjoying the conversations

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.570
about the importance of marrow

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.670
because I think that's pretty significant.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:45.922
- Okay.

00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:47.350
There's a couple of related ones.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.760
I'll just sort of ask them together

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.003
because they'll play off of each other.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.830
You were working, and for good reason

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:57.970
you're working in a place

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.140
that was a felid dominated environment,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.603
but how would the presence
of other scavengers,

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:07.223
in particular hyenas,

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:13.290
affect the availability
of scavenged resources?

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.840
And is there any way to then tie in

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.360
the availability of scavenged resources

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.614
to the absolute population

00:45:21.614 --> 00:45:24.450
that would be supportable?

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.783
A hominin population.
- Yeah.

00:45:27.652 --> 00:45:28.737
Okay, so the first question about

00:45:29.735 --> 00:45:33.220
how do hyenas, what
difference do hyenas make.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.530
So hyenas have very specialized dentition

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.860
for basically crushing bone

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.610
and so once you get hyenas,

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.420
once you get large populations of hyenas

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.200
they clean up the African ecosystems.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.630
And so there are much fewer
scavenging opportunities

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.650
when hyenas are involved.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.030
So I don't know if that fully answers

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.250
the first question potentially.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.547
And the second question was about

00:45:56.547 --> 00:45:58.790
how would that make a difference

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:02.047
for the overall hominin population

00:46:02.047 --> 00:46:04.230
that could be supported.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.140
Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:09.260
- So I'm not sure we have good ways

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.050
to model that and think about that,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:12.550
partially because I think

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:17.628
hominins, like carnivores,
were both pretty rare

00:46:17.628 --> 00:46:19.876
generally on the landscape,

00:46:19.876 --> 00:46:22.030
certainly much more rare than herbivores.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.420
And so I don't think we can confidently

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.620
extrapolate carnivore populations

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.760
are particularly like the proportions

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.280
of felids versus hyenas in the past

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.100
necessarily just from the fossil record.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.033
The fossil record is all we have.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.191
But I think that certainly

00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:44.860
in an area where felids were dominant,

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.010
and there were three different genera

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.683
of saber tooth felids that
were around in the past

00:46:49.683 --> 00:46:51.393
at the times that we're talking about

00:46:51.393 --> 00:46:53.940
when hominins were first eating meat.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.530
And there have been
propositions or hypotheses

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.290
that it's actually scavenging potentially

00:47:00.176 --> 00:47:02.000
from saber tooth kills,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.160
at least one of those genera

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.466
probably was a solitary felid

00:47:06.466 --> 00:47:07.910
more like leopards today

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.550
may have stashed their kills in trees,

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.230
and so those may have been

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.970
really profitable scavenging
opportunities for hominins.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:16.630
They're a little bit harder to model

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.110
since we don't have saber
tooths around today.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:20.944
- Yeah, I'd like to follow up on that

00:47:20.944 --> 00:47:22.630
because I know that there was a suggestion

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.870
that some of the saber tooths

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.410
were specialists on very large animals

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.103
and the whole saber tooth thing.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.630
There was a time when it was believed

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.030
that their teeth were so brittle

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.863
that all they could really do

00:47:34.863 --> 00:47:38.160
was kind of run in, slit the jugular,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.720
and I think there was even a suggestion

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.240
that they then lapped up the blood

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.800
and didn't really get
into the carcass at all,

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.840
but otherwise that they
would just eat the gut

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.830
and leave the skeletal
system complete intact.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.350
What's the status of that idea?

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.290
Or do we know more about saber tooths now?

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.540
- So, we will soon.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.020
I'm doing a research project actually

00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.950
with a member of the audience,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.090
Jennifer Parkinson, right now studying,

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:06.090
restudying a saber tooth
den collection in Texas,

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:09.800
a Pleistocene den where we have
lots of saber tooth fossils

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.050
and we have lots of baby mammoths.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.900
So we think, or at least the idea is

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.540
that saber tooths are kind of dragging

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.160
these baby mammoths,
and some adults as well,

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.920
or mastodons, back to this den.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.020
And so we see tooth marks
on some of these bones

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.130
so I think that the idea

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.400
that saber tooths were
only using their teeth

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.910
potentially for killing and not

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.800
for eating at all, and that they would

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.240
leave a lot of the carcass left over,

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.390
I'm not sure about that.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.480
They certainly were flesh
specialists, though,

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.950
so they did not have the kind
of jaw and tooth capabilities

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.750
that even probably modern lions have

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:47.970
in order to break up bones,

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.100
particularly of really big animals.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.900
So from really big kills of saber tooths

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.070
especially if they were solitary,

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.020
not social like lions were,

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.722
I think that's a really
good scavenging opportunity.

00:48:59.722 --> 00:49:01.600
- And when did lions come on the scene?

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.430
- I think about somewhere between two

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.490
and three million years ago,

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.920
so modern lions, leopards
are basically around

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.277
in some form by this time.

00:49:10.277 --> 00:49:12.240
- But the earliest stage,

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.640
you know, the sort of three
to four million, no lions--

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.760
- Well, or at least not modern lions.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.709
So certainly there were, you know,

00:49:20.709 --> 00:49:22.963
things like lions around at that time.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.633
- All right.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.563
A specific question.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.133
And for some reason, I'm not sure

00:49:31.133 --> 00:49:34.359
this is the right word,
but I can't remember it.

00:49:34.359 --> 00:49:35.601
Fecaliths.

00:49:35.601 --> 00:49:36.434
A fossil--

00:49:36.434 --> 00:49:37.650
- Coprolite?
- Coprolites, yes.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:38.657
- Coprolite.
- Yes, yeah.

00:49:38.657 --> 00:49:41.193
Well, fecal, you know, stone feces.

00:49:41.193 --> 00:49:42.464
(audience laughing)

00:49:42.464 --> 00:49:46.222
How far back can coprolites
give information about diet?

00:49:46.222 --> 00:49:47.440
- Ooh.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.990
I suspect that coprolites
can give information

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.720
about diet as far back
as we can find them.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.150
And I know that there have been coprolite,

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:57.390
at least carnivore coprolites found

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.130
in the fossil record, I think,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.550
for the past few hundred thousand years.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:04.350
I don't know so much about, you know,

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:07.090
human coprolites, but I
think that's an interesting

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.810
line of evidence that would, (laughs)

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.130
I don't know if we need more of it

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:14.460
but it would be,

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.340
I think it's a different and interesting

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.173
line of evidence.

00:50:18.173 --> 00:50:20.432
But it sounds like there
was more to the question.

00:50:20.432 --> 00:50:23.150
- I don't know if this
is a two part question.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.257
I don't know the relationship,

00:50:24.257 --> 00:50:26.020
but the other part of this was,

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.050
when does the first evidence
of cannibalism appear?

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.650
And I assume this is talking
about dietary cannibalism.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.590
- Right.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.970
So the first evidence of cannibalism there

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.510
is, I believe it's a fossil skull

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.560
from Sterkfontein, a site in South Africa

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.050
that's about two million years old

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.553
that has butchery marks on it.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.710
So this is kind of one individual

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.653
that seems to have decent cut marks on it.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.210
But the first evidence of
more systematic cannibalism

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.820
comes in, I believe,
at about 400,000 years

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.300
from a site in Spain

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.580
where there are hominins
that are butchered

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.700
basically in the same way

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.110
that animals are butchered at this site.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.760
And so it seems like dietary

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.950
or nutritive cannibalism is something

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.440
that was rare just
because hominins are rare,

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.320
and so you're less likely to find them

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.380
and less likely to find
butchery marks on them.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.540
But I would suspect that probably

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.360
for the entirety of the
evidence for tool use

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.973
in our evolutionary history.

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:28.841
- That's grim.

00:51:28.841 --> 00:51:31.091
(laughing)

00:51:31.956 --> 00:51:35.801
I'm tempted to ask John
Speth to come up here,

00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:39.340
but there's a question here about

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:44.890
would fire be necessary
to make scavenging safe?

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.250
When we hear about the bacteria.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:49.690
And I mention John because he's written

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:54.690
a really nasty paper on
modern human scavenging

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.240
or eating, consumption
of raw, rotten meat.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.590
And if any of you have been to Iceland,

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.350
I mean, rotten shark is a delicacy

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.220
so it is something that gets done.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.930
And I don't know--

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:08.730
- That's a good question.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.520
I think, you know, the evidence

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.409
that Margaret talked about in her talk,

00:52:13.409 --> 00:52:16.060
or I think it was one of the speakers

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.533
talked about with the evidence

00:52:18.533 --> 00:52:21.870
for just bacterial growth and other things

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.730
that can make scavengable carcasses

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.260
dangerous pretty quickly,

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.080
I think it really depends on the timing

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.870
of access to those carcasses.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.890
So if they're really quite fresh,

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:34.810
I think you just use your nose.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.660
If they smell bad, if they look like

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.830
they're disgusting, I suspect

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.530
that they wouldn't be as useful

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.420
for scavengable resources.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.330
- Okay, so it'd be playing, okay.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:46.453
- Yeah, potentially.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.107
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:52:49.107 --> 00:52:52.274
(audience applauding)

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.313
- Richard.

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.810
Since the high temperature
cooking of animal fats

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.583
can result in carcinogenic molecules,

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.930
could this have been a problem

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:10.390
that would have possibly led to increased

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.310
particularly gastrointestinal cancers

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.460
during human evolution?

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:17.680
- Well, they'd have been so lucky

00:53:18.611 --> 00:53:21.000
to be able to have regular access

00:53:22.135 --> 00:53:25.470
to overheated fats, I would think.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:29.320
It seems to me very much a question

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.700
about today's world,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.790
where we've dealt with a tremendous number

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.890
of the basic nutritional problems

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:38.180
and we can afford to worry

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.900
about the great detail of the costs

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.760
that come along with all of the benefits.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.050
The important thing for the hominins

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.710
would surely have been what it is

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.490
for other primates and for
hunters and gatherers today,

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:55.960
which is getting enough access to energy.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:00.960
The amount of carcinogenic impact would,

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.370
I would have thought, been
definitely extremely small

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:08.440
compared to the benefits
coming from energy.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.030
However, you know, it's fascinating

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:11.440
to think about the possibility

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.440
that there has been
some kind of adaptation

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.210
to some of the deleterious byproducts

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.623
that come from cooking.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:26.259
So Maillard compounds
is this very complicated

00:54:26.259 --> 00:54:29.630
family of compounds that are produced

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.680
by the ultimately interaction
of sugars and amino acids,

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.270
and they're basically unique
in their concentration

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.960
when produced by cooking.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.300
And there is a little bit of
sort of anecdotal evidence

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.590
that humans are less susceptible

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.440
to the deleterious consequences

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.468
of some Maillard compounds
than in other animals.

00:54:52.468 --> 00:54:55.467
This is a fascinating area to explore.

00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:57.850
- Okay, so you're looking at it, yeah.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:58.683
- Well, I'm not looking at it.

00:54:58.683 --> 00:55:00.300
- Well, no, but I mean you're looking

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.950
at the question of whether other people

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.783
are looking at it.
- Looking at it.

00:55:02.783 --> 00:55:04.320
- Yeah, looking up data for it.

00:55:07.217 --> 00:55:08.050
Okay.

00:55:10.488 --> 00:55:13.890
When I started grad school,

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.530
the story of human
evolution was fairly simple.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.027
There was a grass Australopithecus

00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:20.520
and it gave rise to a homo

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.650
and then it gave rise to advanced homo

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.870
and then here we are.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:27.990
And we now know that
there's a lot of bushiness

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.930
in the family tree.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:31.940
Do you believe that cooking food

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.040
evolved once or more than once

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.593
in the hominin lineage?

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.994
- Well, believe is a
little strong because,

00:55:39.994 --> 00:55:42.780
(audience laughing)

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.223
this is not a religion, this is science.

00:55:45.223 --> 00:55:46.940
(audience laughs)

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.213
- In your opinion, is there
evidence supporting? (laughs)

00:55:53.378 --> 00:55:55.721
- So the way I reconstruct it,

00:55:55.721 --> 00:55:57.100
you know, there's this conflict

00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.010
between the biological and
the archeological evidence,

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.750
I think of it, and the biological evidence

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:05.610
pushes us to saying that the change

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.550
in the shape of the ribs
indicating the smaller gut

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.253
that Margaret referred to,

00:56:12.378 --> 00:56:15.690
the smaller teeth, the weaker jaw muscles,

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.890
a bunch of these anatomical changes

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.356
they all happened just this side

00:56:21.356 --> 00:56:23.980
of two millions years, let's say.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.870
And so that's the biological evidence.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:27.703
The archeological evidence

00:56:27.703 --> 00:56:30.140
is that fire came in very late.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.299
To me, the fascinating
question about this is

00:56:33.299 --> 00:56:34.860
what is gonna resolve it.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.170
And if it turns out that for some reason

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:39.690
we're able to get convinced

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.850
that fire really wasn't controlled

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:43.810
prior to, say, half a million years ago

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:45.240
which is very, very (mumbles).

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.360
You know, there are sites like
Wonderwerk in South Africa

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.330
which has it at a million

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:49.850
and maybe a little bit more.

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.190
But if it turns out that fire

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:54.640
was controlled relatively late like that,

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.850
then what on earth was responsible

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:59.950
for the gracilization and reduction

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.840
of the human digestive
system, if it wasn't cooking?

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.519
And to me, what is so interesting

00:57:06.519 --> 00:57:08.200
is that nobody has really suggested

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.420
what that could be.

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.950
The only thing that I can think of

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:15.810
is that there would be
a pretty much 100% focus

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:19.040
on marrow fats, or on fats.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.983
And the reason I say that is,

00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:22.360
you've got to go close to 100%,

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.300
first of all, that doesn't
take much tooth work

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.273
and second,

00:57:34.473 --> 00:57:35.983
let's see, where was I?

00:57:35.983 --> 00:57:37.590
(laughing)

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:40.660
I'm so excited about it, sorry. (laughs)

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.770
- You were pointing out
that thoroughly rotten meat

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:44.200
doesn't take much tooth work either.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.758
- Yes, but that's not the point

00:57:45.758 --> 00:57:47.926
that I wanted to make here.

00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:49.720
The point I wanted to make is that

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.830
as long as the hominins had to resort

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:55.000
sometimes to eating plants,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.070
then they needed to have
the more robust jaws,

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.066
the bigger teeth, the bigger guts,

00:58:01.066 --> 00:58:04.100
to be able to process them in the mouth

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.920
and then ferment them in the colon.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.090
And until you can overcome the need

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:11.600
to eat raw plants at some time,

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.490
then I don't see how you can get

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.050
to that reduced digestive
system of humans.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.870
So for that reason, it's
just very, very difficult

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:21.790
for me to imagine that the entrance

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:23.490
of the control of fire won't come

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:27.650
up to something around
1.9 million years ago.

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:29.830
But if it doesn't, then, you know,

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:32.110
somebody in the audience
solve that problem.

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:33.888
What did they eat?

00:58:33.888 --> 00:58:35.293
- [Audience Member] What about

00:58:35.293 --> 00:58:37.793
mechanical processing of food?

00:58:39.126 --> 00:58:40.209
- Well, okay.

00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:42.955
(laughing)

00:58:42.955 --> 00:58:45.100
All right. (laughs)

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.300
So what about mechanical
processing of food?

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.890
Katie Zink and Dan Lieberman

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:55.010
have said that this would
make it easier to chew.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.390
So the problem I have with that

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:57.930
is that, to my knowledge,

00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:00.050
we don't have any examples

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.460
from modern hunter-gatherers

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:07.460
of processing of plants,
or pounding, to eat raw.

00:59:07.821 --> 00:59:09.540
And it's kind of difficult to imagine

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.230
exactly how it is gonna work to eat raw.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.580
I mean, to pound the seeds

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.980
and then put them into a,

00:59:17.495 --> 00:59:19.130
well, a pot makes it particularly easy

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:20.443
or a damper, you know,

00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:22.990
a sort of pancake type of thing

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:24.800
that you can put on the fire.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.930
That's fine.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:29.290
But what, you reduce this pounding

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:33.110
to something that you can eat as a powder?

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.290
And remember that starch grains

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:40.000
are not normally broken down by pounding.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.850
So to the extent that the plant part

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:44.800
is important for producing starch,

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.940
which should be very important,

00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.140
than pounding is gonna be no good.

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:51.810
You need cooking to get the starch

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:53.510
reduced to glucose.

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:55.199
But Rebecca's got a...

00:59:55.199 --> 00:59:57.570
- [Rebecca] (mumbles)
Most aboriginal groups

00:59:57.570 --> 00:59:59.060
that relied on wild tomatoes

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.560
pounded them up, so
they're pounding fruit.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.270
And part of the reason they're pounding up

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:05.780
the fruit is to concentrate the energy

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:09.240
so you can carry it and
keep it long distances.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.800
- Oh, and reducing the water.
- The water, yeah.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.860
And also you can actually get access

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.893
to the protein in the
seeds by pounding it.

01:00:16.893 --> 01:00:18.167
- Okay, so that sounds great.

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:19.480
But it doesn't sound as though

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.510
it would necessarily increase
the net energy value.

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:25.080
- It may not sound at all
to the people in the back.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.150
Let me just repeat,
(laughing)

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.810
let me just repeat that
Rebecca was pointing out

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.650
that among the people she
works with in Australia

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:33.720
that they pound tomatoes and other fruits

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.859
more in order to reduce the water content

01:00:36.859 --> 01:00:39.663
and make them more compact
and easier to carry.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.588
- We got other questions here.

01:00:43.588 --> 01:00:44.833
Are we allowed to take these?

01:00:45.882 --> 01:00:48.380
- [Audience Member]
Baobab seeds are 36% fat

01:00:49.652 --> 01:00:51.740
and so when they pound them, they usually,

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.170
and Melissa has obviously looked at them

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:57.150
longer than I did, they didn't cook it.

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:00.610
- Okay, so another example
from the Hadza of East Africa.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.700
- [Audience Member] And you do it twice

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.680
because of course, you can do it

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.400
when the baobab seeds are ripe

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.935
and then you do it when the
baboons have pooped it out,

01:01:08.935 --> 01:01:10.020
which makes it easier.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.890
- So another ethnographic counterexample

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.330
where people are pounding baobab seeds

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.800
to access the high fat seed within.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.165
So there are a few examples, then,

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:22.901
(laughing)

01:01:22.901 --> 01:01:24.350
and the devil may be in the details

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.650
of how widespread they are.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:30.073
So mechanical processing
is important some places.

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.683
Okay.

01:01:32.683 --> 01:01:33.645
- My masculinity...

01:01:33.645 --> 01:01:35.170
(laughing drowns out speech)

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:36.020
Yeah it's, zooop.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.450
- Well, that's no good.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.423
Are there any human cultures
that have lost fire?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.273
- No.

01:01:48.273 --> 01:01:49.172
- Thank you.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.928
(laughing)

01:01:50.928 --> 01:01:51.761
Okay.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.443
I don't know if this is,

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:58.887
well, I'll just give you this one.

01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:01.187
You can decide whether
or not to address that.

01:02:02.994 --> 01:02:05.203
- The question about losing fire,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.670
the question that people
do investigate more often

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:11.410
is whether people have lost the ability

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:13.630
to make fire for themselves.

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:14.730
And there are some claims

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.870
that that might have happened,

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.820
but it doesn't seem relevant

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.630
because they can always get fire

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:22.350
by going to the neighbors.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.270
So basically once you have a population

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.510
maintaining fire, then
they can keep it going.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.470
- I saw the movie, Quest For Fire.

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:28.303
- Exactly.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.740
And am I aware that there is something

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.446
called the roadkill cookbook?

01:02:35.446 --> 01:02:38.220
(audience laughing)

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.930
As a model of the origins of the human

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.592
predatory pattern, I'm dubious.

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:46.592
(audience laughing)

01:02:47.554 --> 01:02:50.093
- It might tie in with running, though.

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:53.821
There are two,

01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:56.150
you can either stay here or not.

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.290
There are two last questions.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.030
I'm not sure if we really have time

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:02.880
to address them, although they're directed

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.820
to all the speakers.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.170
I wanna read them because
I think what they do

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.319
is they fit very nicely

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.123
into what CARTA is all about.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.970
There's one, obviously
a switch to meat eating

01:03:18.537 --> 01:03:21.350
induced a radical change
in digestive systems

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:22.840
underlying genetics.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.670
How did we get from here to there

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:27.780
or from there to here, in any case?

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.700
So what are the underlying genetics

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.300
involved in the restructuring of the body?

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.883
And then a second one is,

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.480
I don't know if this is a
mildly aggressive question,

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.960
but, it's okay.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.840
Where does your understanding
of nutrition come from?

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.110
How much do you consult with nutritionists

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.850
and nutritional scientists?

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:51.630
How does it impact your interpretations

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:54.640
or observations if some of
your fundamental beliefs

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.223
about nutrition are flawed?

01:03:58.194 --> 01:04:01.490
I think that the reason
that I like those questions,

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:03.040
and I'll give you a chance to address it,

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:03.873
but I like those questions

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.960
because they both have built into them

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.820
this incredible interdisciplinary

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.380
transdisciplinary complexity

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.400
of understanding this problem.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.650
We've got people who, you know,

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.830
who study chimpanzees or who
look at cut marks on bones

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.880
and in order to interpret
what they're doing,

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.560
we need to know some genetics

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.950
and we need to know some nutrition.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:28.150
There's a lot of fields
that have to come together.

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.853
In the normal course of events,

01:04:31.873 --> 01:04:33.640
people in these different areas

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.340
go to conferences with other people

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.040
in their own areas, and
they talk to other people

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.580
who study bones or who
study apes or whatever.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.692
CARTA is a really great venue, I think,

01:04:45.692 --> 01:04:47.340
that brings together people

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.398
from these different specialties.

01:04:50.398 --> 01:04:53.380
We probably don't have as wide a net

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.180
present in this room or at this symposium

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.760
as we could use, but it's still wider

01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.650
than we normally get.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:03.760
And we start to try to get
at some of these questions

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.320
and put these pieces together.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.740
With that said, how do you interact with,

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.400
and this, again, is for all of us.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.770
On the nutrition specifically,

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.750
where do you get the interaction

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.833
and how much do you try to go for it?

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:24.123
- Nutritional science
is a very funny science.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:26.340
Marion Nestle--

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.761
- Says the guy who works on chimps.

01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:30.840
(laughing)

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.777
- Marion Nestle is this
very good biochemist

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.180
who was invited to do a,

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:45.040
to teach a course something like 20,

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.873
maybe 25 years ago, on nutrition

01:05:47.873 --> 01:05:50.640
because the department needed it.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.940
She hadn't gone into that area at all.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.870
And she tells a story about how she got

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.110
eight textbooks and opened them up

01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:00.193
and put them in a row on a desk,

01:06:01.147 --> 01:06:02.517
and then saw what everybody said.

01:06:02.517 --> 01:06:06.173
And she said, the answers were
just incredibly different.

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:10.740
So there is a real
danger, or there was then,

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.110
and even now I think there is a danger

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:16.483
of being able to cherry
pick what results you want.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:23.040
So having said that, let me
just mention about cooking.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.231
You know, because,

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:28.030
(audience laughing)

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:28.863
well, I mean, look.

01:06:28.863 --> 01:06:31.470
The fact is that cooking
is hugely important

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.557
for humans, okay?

01:06:32.557 --> 01:06:35.340
And so you would think that we would have

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.170
a lot of information about
what the impact of cooking is

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.940
on the energy value of foods.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:44.440
And I was astounded
when almost 20 years ago

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.760
I started thinking about
the importance of cooking

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.200
and I went to the nutritional literature

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.690
and it wasn't there.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.240
It was really, really difficult to find.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.850
In our lab, we did the
first-hand experiments

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:57.477
to looking at the impact
of cooking on meat

01:06:57.477 --> 01:07:00.350
and its digestibility
and the cost of digestion

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.340
associated with it.

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.320
And I've just said that you do not have

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.700
any data at the moment on the impact on

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.300
what I think of as the most important

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.760
macronutrient in human
evolution, namely animal fats.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.700
So where do we go for nutritional science?

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.950
You have to, very often,
make it up yourself.

01:07:19.276 --> 01:07:21.041
- [Alyssa] Can I take a question?

01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:22.208
- Alyssa, yes.

01:07:23.453 --> 01:07:25.382
I think this will be the last response.

01:07:25.382 --> 01:07:27.940
- Oh, this not a very
exciting end to that.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.590
But I think that was a
really important question,

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:31.440
so whoever posed that, thank you.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.825
This is something I struggle with

01:07:33.825 --> 01:07:37.240
(laughs) daily, weekly, monthly.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.850
I do a lot of presentations

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:40.800
and a lot of conferencing

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:45.800
with nutritional sciences,
food sciences, chemists.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.930
I do a lot of work with
the nutrition community.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.060
So me personally, I do a lot of work

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.730
that is totally embedded in nutrition.

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.052
And I blame Margaret for that.

01:07:54.052 --> 01:07:57.160
I blame Margaret because
I came to graduate school

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.770
here at UCSD, and I wanted to ask

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.090
these big, grandiose questions

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.970
about how ecology influences
behavior and reproduction

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:05.900
and I was using food as my metric.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.290
And Margaret said, that's great,

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.180
but what is in the food?

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.690
What are you actually measuring?

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.290
And I hadn't thought about that.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.530
I hate to admit this, but I think a lot

01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:18.810
of the literature doesn't
really think about that,

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:20.840
particularly the literature as far

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.215
as it pertains to human
foraging populations.

01:08:24.215 --> 01:08:27.170
And we have people in
here, Kristen Hawkes,

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.260
Nick Blurton-Jones and colleagues

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.750
who were one of the very first teams

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.650
that actually decided to work with

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.120
nutritional chemists to figure out

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.700
what's in forager foods.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.250
So personally, I do a lot of
work in nutrition sciences.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.190
It's very messy, and I will say

01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:42.380
that in the early 2000s when I came back

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.950
with wild hods of foods,

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:45.510
no commercial nutrition lab

01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:47.220
would take my foods.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.060
So Richard's lab is where I did

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.210
all of my analyses of hods of foods

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:56.028
with a fantastic nutrition scientist

01:08:56.028 --> 01:08:57.870
named Nancy Lou Conklin-Brittain

01:08:57.870 --> 01:09:00.200
who, I think, can beat
the pants off anyone

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.820
in terms of thinking about how to

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.250
use all of these different methods.

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.470
And she will often analyze a food,

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:08.920
a wild food, with four
different laboratory methods

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.600
that she's found from all over the world

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.250
and figure out where they overlap.

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:14.750
So I think it depends on who you're asking

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.860
in terms of our
relationship with nutrition,

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.730
but I think that as a
discipline in general,

01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:19.990
particularly for those of us

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:23.090
that are talking about food in general,

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:24.390
it's very important to think about

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:25.440
the nutritional components.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.380
And there are people, John
Speth is in here somewhere,

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.320
who really do this and do it very well.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.210
But there's not enough.

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:32.510
So graduate students,

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.810
go learn nutritional chemistry please.

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:37.713
It will serve you well, I promise.

01:09:37.713 --> 01:09:40.880
(audience applauding)

01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:48.480
- I was supposed to
spend about five minutes

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.970
summarizing this symposium,

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.751
and I cleverly let the questions go on

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:56.630
to pretty much chew up that time.

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:58.980
Because I think that
answering your questions

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.050
is a lot more important than listening

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.130
to what I might come up with.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.460
I will just say that the genesis

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.460
for this symposium came from the fact

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.620
that I work at a savanna
chimpanzee study site

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.890
where we have red colobus, and our chimps

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:16.110
don't seem to eat them.

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.190
And so I was presented with this puzzle

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.610
about chimpanzee hunting.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:20.890
And the reason that we work there

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:22.870
is to try to gain insight

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:24.640
into the conditions that early hominins

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.473
might have had.

01:10:25.473 --> 01:10:27.670
And so I started trying to
pull all of this together

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:29.227
and contacting smart people

01:10:29.227 --> 01:10:31.610
who know more about both modern hunting

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.543
and about chimpanzees than I do.

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:37.630
And I've been tremendously pleased

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.040
and learned quite a lot in the process.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.240
I hope you have as well.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.590
So that's my summary as far as it goes.

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:48.317
I'd now like to give you to Ajit Varki.

01:10:48.317 --> 01:10:51.484
(audience applauding)

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.351
- Thank you so much.

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.740
I'd like to thank the CARTA team

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.000
and all those who made
the symposium possible,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.840
the chairs, the featured speakers,

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.850
sponsors and supporters, and the audience

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:10.963
for attending and for the great questions.

01:11:12.032 --> 01:11:14.233
A really exciting and
interesting symposium.

01:11:17.116 --> 01:11:19.950
I'd like to remind you that we have

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:22.830
an upcoming symposium, and you
can look them up on the web.

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:25.530
I look forward to seeing
you at the next one.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:26.560
Thank you.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.314
(audience applauding)

01:11:30.314 --> 01:11:32.897
(upbeat music)
