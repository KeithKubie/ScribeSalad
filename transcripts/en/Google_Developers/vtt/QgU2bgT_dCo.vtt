KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.030
We are at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.500
Joining me today in the
studio is Shane Kelly.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.720
He's the founder and
managing director

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.680
at Wolverine Angel Networks.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.373
Shane, thank you for joining.

00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:12.952
SHANE KELLY: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:13.290
KORY JEFFREY: Of course.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.880
So tell us a little bit
about your Angel Network.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.267
What makes it different?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.100
SHANE KELLY: I think
what makes us different

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.680
is that we actually take
advantage of technology

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.492
to bring all of our
investors together.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.420
And all of our
investors, by the way,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.790
are University of
Michigan alumni.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.820
So we're leveraging
that affinity

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.620
to bring alumni together
to invest together.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.730
And so that is how our
fund is structured,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.260
and that is very different
than a traditional fund.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.960
And that's why we chose to
use Angel List to structure

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.114
our fund as a syndicate.

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.780
KORY JEFFREY: So is that how you
found the LPs was through Angel

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.360
List, had people subscribe?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.120
SHANE KELLY: No, those were all
through personal relationships.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.510
We just used the
Angel List technology

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.890
to bring the investors
together so that we can also

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.790
take advantage of all
their intellectual capital,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.980
so that we can put our investors
to work for our portfolio

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.252
companies.

00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:12.460
KORY JEFFREY: So obviously
the University of Michigan

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.240
is a very international
university.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.370
You have alumni all
around the world.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.530
Are the LPs the same
thing, alumni from all

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.749
around the world?

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.540
SHANE KELLY: Yeah,
you're absolutely right.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.980
I mean, we have folks from Hong
Kong to New York, and you know,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.180
that is one thing that's unique
about our network is that it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.300
over 540,000 living alumni.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.490
It is one of, or possibly
the largest living alumni

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.229
base on the planet.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.520
KORY JEFFREY: So officially
affiliated with the school,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.840
or is it--

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.350
SHANE KELLY: No, it's
independent of the school.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.950
It's just all of the
alumni are our investors.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.730
Obviously I go and talk
at University of Michigan,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.980
and I'm not a teacher.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.960
I don't work for them.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.910
But yeah, we're
looking at launching

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.220
a program in the
near future that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.120
will get additional benefits to
University of Michigan alumni.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.390
KORY JEFFREY: So where
is the fund itself based?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.260
SHANE KELLY: I say
in Los Angeles,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.630
but our investors
are everywhere.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.690
KORY JEFFREY: So
where do you invest?

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.273
SHANE KELLY: Our
first two investments

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:30.920
we just launched
earlier this year.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.540
And our first two investments
are actually in Los Angeles.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.580
But the companies that
we're looking at now

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.600
are across the country.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.891
SHANE KELLY: So we want to
invest outside of the United

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.810
States, though.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.310
KORY JEFFREY: So being
an Angel Network,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.817
is it correct to assume it's
an early stage investment fund?

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:47.900
SHANE KELLY: That's right.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.330
We think of it as
everything up to Series A.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.220
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.480
And Series A, Valley Series A?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.544
Or Series A, rest of
the country Series A?

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.335
SHANE KELLY: Sorry?

00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:00.520
KORY JEFFREY: So I find
that sometimes Series A

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.190
differs, like I mean
first institutional round.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.090
SHANE KELLY: By geography.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.465
KORY JEFFREY:
Yeah, by geography.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.700
So Series A here
could be $100 million,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.460
and Series A in
somewhere like Nebraska

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.896
might be like $1 million.

00:03:11.896 --> 00:03:13.660
SHANE KELLY: You're
absolutely right.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.820
And we're really looking
at mostly investments that

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.210
are outside of
the Bay Area, idea

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.820
being that there is a tremendous
amount of capital here.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.570
So do we want to start
investing up here?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.570
I'm sure we will, but
that's not the target.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.724
It's mostly everywhere
else in the country.

00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:42.390
KORY JEFFREY: And
there's a lot of funds

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.220
that are doing that
as well, right,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.840
kind of secondary
markets and looking there

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.058
where there's less sharks
in the water, right?

00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:51.520
SHANE KELLY: Oh, yeah.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.380
KORY JEFFREY: I guess
I'm wondering also,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.220
technologies that you're
interested in investing in?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.678
Is there anything
specific that you

00:03:56.678 --> 00:03:59.870
guys like that's
exciting you right now?

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.980
SHANE KELLY: No, there's
not a specific kind of focus

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.670
that we have to abide by.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.900
The general rule of thumb is,
do we have enough expertise

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.640
among our investors to really
add value to the company?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.610
That's the question.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.940
And if we come up
with a yes, then it's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.709
a sector that we can invest in.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.260
It also has to be
capital efficient.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.004
We're not going to invest
in pharma or medical devices

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:24.920
or anything like that.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.239
But there is an area that
I'm really excited about.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:32.030
There are a couple.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.040
One is entertainment technology.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.490
So I spent several years doing
film finance and distribution

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.850
at a start up that raised a
lot of money and really scaled

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.843
and had some success.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.190
Injecting technology into
that content lifecycle?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.490
We're definitely interested
in the kind of companies

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.450
that are in that space.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.390
The other area I really like
is just simple fact, right?

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.410
2/3 of the world's population is
not connected to the internet.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.370
So we're going to have about
3 billion people, some people

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.160
estimate, joining the internet
in the next six years.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.940
That is a huge, huge shift,
economically, culturally.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.650
There's going to be
a lot going on there.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.358
So we're looking at
the technologies that

00:05:23.358 --> 00:05:26.650
would enable that and then
the application layer that

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.950
would run on top of it.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.866
KORY JEFFREY: So building
for the next billion

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:30.560
type of mantra.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.120
SHANE KELLY: Exactly, exactly.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.390
You know, most people think
of just international when

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.800
you think about connectivity.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.220
But the truth is that there are
over 60 million Americans who

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.960
are priced out of smart phones.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.530
So we can find
those opportunities

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.770
in a lot of places, where
once people are connected,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.960
they have access
to education right?

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.830
They have access to
Wikipedia and Google,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.430
and it's really remarkable how
that can change someone's life.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.770
KORY JEFFREY: So Founder World.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.620
There's thousands of
people here today.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.530
It's a very busy
and happening place.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.860
What drew you to this event?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.140
SHANE KELLY: It
was really Harrison

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.790
who worked for F50
who invited me up.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.415
And he told me about it.

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:22.720
He got me really
excited about it,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.540
and then they really wanted me
to actually moderate a panel.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.330
And I really applaud
F50 for the work

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.540
they did in pulling
together an amazing panel.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.620
We had representation
from 500 start ups--

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.840
Velorum Capital, Longevity Fund,
as well as the Hawaii Angels.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.890
And so it was really cool to
see the women on the panel, just

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.025
really amazing investors.

00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.025
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.280
And so what were some of
the main messages that

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.239
came out of that panel?

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.488
SHANE KELLY: Well, our topic,
we really wanted to dive

00:06:57.488 --> 00:06:59.280
into the future of
venture capital,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.660
really with a focus on
seed stage investing,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.520
because we're all
seed stage investors.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.080
And so we talked a little bit
about the accelerator model.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.450
And I think one
thing that the way

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.257
that investors think about
accelerators is as investors.

00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:16.090
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.881
SHANE KELLY: Right.

00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.370
We think about accelerators
as being just another model

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.819
for venture capital, and
I don't think everyone

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:23.860
thinks about it that way.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.810
So we dove into
that a little bit.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:32.850
We also dove into Simone
who runs Velorum Capital,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.700
and her approach to
seed stage investing

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.980
is in manufacturing and
automation, which is really

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.960
thinking outside the box.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.630
And then we had
Laura Deming, who

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.170
is investing at the
seed stage in Longevity,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.470
so extending human
beings' lives.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.540
Those are two areas that you
don't often see new seed stage

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.350
investors entering the fray.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.920
And I applaud them for
their boldness and vision.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.710
Because when you talk to them,
they know what they're doing.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.710
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.209
So last question, do you have
a favorite Google technology?

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.750
SHANE KELLY: You
know, the one that I

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.570
use the most is Google Maps.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.370
I would be lost without
it, pardon the pun.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.890
KORY JEFFREY: I totally agree.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.207
It gets me around, for sure.

00:08:16.207 --> 00:08:17.350
Awesome.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.350
Well, Shane, thank you
very much for joining us.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.680
SHANE KELLY: Thank
you for having me.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.680
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining us.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.570
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.520
