00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.320
SWAROOP KUMAR: AppOn
is based out of Pune,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.510
and we started in 2012.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.570
We make games which
are easy to explain,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.450
optimized for the
emerging markets.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.450
With such a tremendous
acceptance of the smartphone,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.280
we have to focus on this markets
to maximize our revenues.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.242
They hold a great deal of
business opportunities for us.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.700
VAIBHAV HEMNE: So Kitchen Story
is a simulation casual game

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.930
and resource skill
management game.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.050
So you have to cook
different dishes

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.110
and compete with different
world-class chef.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.250
When the Kitchen Story was at
the conceptual level itself,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
we had keeping in mind
that whatever we make,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.100
we make it under 20 MB.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.110
In India, basically,
there are plenty

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.000
of challenges that we face.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.330
One of them is the
device compatibilities.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.260
Second is their
data [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.280
Third is the low-performing
devices and the language

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.930
support.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.830
So one must make
sure that the game is

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.750
built for all the
kind of devices

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
and the performance should
be same on all the devices,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.490
whether it's a high-end
device or a low-end device.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.490
SWAROOP KUMAR: We learned
from our past mistakes

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.720
that developing
[INAUDIBLE] a game heavier

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.330
is going to be disastrous
for these countries,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.560
so you are actually motivated
to make a game which is

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.750
already lighter in the files.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.900
Working with Google, we found
out the best possible ways

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.180
to keep the game size smallest.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
The first one would be to
use a Noto fonts instead

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.790
of using custom
fonts, as it reduces

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.310
the size of the applications,
and it's very easy

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.119
to translate your games
in other languages.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.910
VAIBHAV HEMNE: Second
of all, native shapes

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.350
are useful for animations,
UI, and effects.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.520
So if you use
native shapes, that

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.720
helps to reduce the
game size drastically,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.380
and to make sure that while
reducing the game size,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.170
we do not compromise
on UI and UX.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.230
SWAROOP KUMAR: I would
say use color tables.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.700
The images like
metrics of the colors,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.160
where you can stack the color
tables and their indexes

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.989
separately.

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.530
Then, you just change
the color table

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.390
and you have altogether
different image.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.310
We made the game to work
in the offline mode,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
because in India, not everyone
has the internet connectivity

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.880
all the time.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.020
We also shifted over a lot of
the game data or game assets

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.940
to on the cloud.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.680
VAIBHAV HEMNE: Up to now, we've
got almost 6 million downloads

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.729
and over 100,000 reviews
with a rating of 4.4.

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.270
SWAROOP KUMAR: The
initial retentions

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.830
are really high because the
game is very easy to learn,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.775
so the Day 1 retentions
are up to 60%.

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:28.710
We always are focused on
making a lighter, faster game

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.500
with having a great
user experience.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
Now, all these techniques which
we have been using so far,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.430
and now, it has become
the part of our DNA.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.660
And we do follow these
techniques in our newer games.
