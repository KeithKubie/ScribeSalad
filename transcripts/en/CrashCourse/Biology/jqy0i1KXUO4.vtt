00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.760
Well hello there! 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.370
You caught me while
I was working out.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.860
Last time I was lifting weights
during a Crash Course episode,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.010
also...the last time
I was lifting weights.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.139
We were talking about
how all of this is possible

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.799
because of cellular respiration,
the process our cells use

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.070
to get and store energy
from the food that we eat.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.130
Remember that?

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.180
Good times.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.590
As it happens, a lot
of what we learned then

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.770
is also really helpful in
understanding the organ system

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.060
that we use to do our
gun-blasting and walking

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.480
and fork-and-knife
operating, and parkour

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.629
and playing Assassin's Creed
and you know, like, moving around.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.719
I'm talking about
your muscles of course,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.679
and you wouldn't be able
to move them without the help

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.730
of the same molecule that your cells
use to get all their jobs done.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.690
Good old adenosine triphosphate.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.969
Now, your muscles may be your
body's most obvious moving parts,

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.679
but as with all things that
are truly worth learning about,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.539
this system is both way more
complex and way more awesome

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.579
than it first appears.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.729
YEAH!

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.710
Why? Because of chemistry.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.129
When you think of muscles,
your mind usually goes straight

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.650
to the guns there. But you
really have three different types

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.300
of muscle in your body.
You have the cardiac muscle.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.230
Your heart muscle, which is
different from all the other

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.620
sorts of muscle in your body.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.350
And then you have smooth
muscle, which is responsible

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.840
for carrying out most
of your involuntary processes,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.170
like pushing food
through your digestive tract

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.750
and pushing blood
through your arteries.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.810
Important stuff there.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.460
And then there's the muscles
that you're most familiar with:

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.470
the skeletal muscles.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.000
Your gluteus maximus.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.460
Your masseter, which is important
for chewing your hot pockets.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.550
And your abductor pollicis brevis,
right at the base of your thumb

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.740
aka your "video game muscles"

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.580
That's important for
the Assassin's Creed.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.980
Just some of the 640
skeletal muscles you have.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.820
Those muscles,
like all of your muscles,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.730
are only good at two things:
contracting to become shorter

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.540
and relaxing back out
to their resting length.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.020
That's all muscles do,
they contract, and they relax,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.490
it's pretty amazing that you
can make a ballerina out of that...

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.530
If you were to peel back my skin
and take a look at one of my muscles

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.229
Please don't do that,
but if you did...

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.149
You'd see that it
thickens in the middle,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.170
at what's called the muscle belly,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.860
and then tapers off on
either end into a tendon.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
Tendons are made of fibrous
proteins, mostly collagen,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.600
that connect the muscle to the bone.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.150
Just a side note, ligaments
are similar to tendons,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.350
but instead they connect
bones to other bones.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.700
These muscle-tendon combos
stretch across one or more joints

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.340
in this case, it
stretches across my elbow

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.970
so that one bone can move
in relation to the other bone.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.760
So I just moved my arm and
now I'm moving my mouth,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.940
and I'm basically moving
my whole body right now,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.670
and the question is:
how am I doing this?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.450
How am I moving all of these things
in all of these amazing, fluid ways?

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.050
How am I able to do that at all?

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.700
Unfortunately, it's kind of
complicated, but it's wonderful

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.840
and amazing so it will
be worth it in the end.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.280
First we need to understand
the anatomy of a skeletal muscle,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.260
which includes many, many
layers of long, thin strands.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.940
Think of one of your
skeletal muscles as a rope.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.400
It's made of smaller
ropes that are bundled together,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.500
and those ropes are
made of bundles of thread,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.090
and those threads are
made of tiny, tiny filaments.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.680
This structure is what
makes meat stringy,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.599
because after all,
meat is just muscle.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.790
This chicken breast is,
or was, the pectoralis major

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.030
muscle of a chicken.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.990
It connected the bird's sternum
or breastbone to the humerus

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.500
in its wing, and sometimes I
feel like chickens have

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.209
bigger pecs than I do.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.040
This is crazy.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.840
When you peel this muscle
apart, you see that it's really

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.830
made up of layers of thin strings.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.709
These are muscle fascicles,
and each fascicle is made up of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.430
lots and lots of much smaller
strands, these we can't see.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.849
They're called muscle fibers and
these are the actual muscle cells.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.140
Now, because muscle cells
perform such a specialized job,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.810
they're not like your
run-of-the-mill somatic cells.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.819
For starters, they each
have multiple nuclei.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.830
That's because each muscle
cell is actually formed

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.470
by a bunch of cells,
somewhat like stem-cells,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.140
called progenitor cells,
fusing together.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.989
Muscle cells are basically just
bundles of complex protein strands,

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.599
and since nuclei are essential
for the protein-making process,

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.819
muscle cells need lots of nuclei
to make all the protein they need.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.720
From here on you'll notice,
by the way, that a lot of the stuff

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.739
I'm talking about start
with the prefixes myo- and sarco-,

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.930
from the Greek words for
muscle or flesh, respectively.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.000
Whenever you see
those terms in biology,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.069
you know you're probably
in muscle country.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:17.650
For instance, those protein
strands that I just mentioned

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.449
that make up a muscle
cell are called myofibrils.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.000
And each one is divided lengthwise
into segments called sarcomeres.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.080
This is where the
action happens, my friends,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.870
because it's the sarcomere that
will actually do the contracting

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.300
and relaxing to create
the muscle movement.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.690
Each muscle cell has tens
of thousands of these guys,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.130
and they all contract
together to make you do stuff.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.630
And this contracting and relaxing
occurs through this really cool

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.340
and complex interaction between
two different kinds of protein

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.970
strands called myofilaments.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.060
One myofilament is the protein
actin, which are skinny strands

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.220
that attach to either one of
the two ends of the sarcomere.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.340
And the other is myosin,
which is thicker and studded

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.430
with these little golf-club
shaped knobs along it called heads.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.930
Inside a sarcomere,
these proteins occur in layers,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.340
with the thick strand of myosin

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.690
floating between several
strands of actin.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.300
Just how many strands of
actin depends on the muscle

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.000
we're talking about.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.240
In this case, let's just
say that there are four:

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.520
two sitting on top,
and two sitting on the bottom.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.380
Now, when the muscle
cell is at rest,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.330
none of these strands
are touching each other,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.250
but they really,
desperately want to!

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.960
They're like middle school
students at a formal dance.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.710
The myosin in particular wants
nothing more than to reach

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.750
its little heads up and do some
heavy petting with the actin.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.470
The chemical dance that
allows this to happen

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.530
is one of the sexiest things
that goes on in your body

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.820
other than, like, sex

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.080
and it's known as the sliding
filament model of muscle contraction.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.000
Which reminds me of
an interesting story ...

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.610
I mentioned last week that
we didn't really have even

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.740
a passing understanding of the
human skeleton until the 1500s,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.780
which seems kind of tardy
to the party to me.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.030
But that's nothing
compared with this:

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.440
we didn't figure out how
muscles worked until 1954!

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.949
In 1954, two teams of researchers
independently discovered

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.310
that the sliding filament
model is how muscles contract.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.110
And, as luck would have it,
two of the four scientists

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.410
who made this discovery
were named Huxley.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.759
We've already discussed
Thomas Henry Huxley,

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.600
the father of comparative anatomy,
and Darwin's Bulldog.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.800
Well, his grandkids were all
awesome at something, too,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.870
like Aldous Huxley, who wrote
the novel Brave New World;

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.180
Julian Huxley, who was
central to the development of

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.180
modern evolutionary theory;
and Andrew Fielding Huxley.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.050
Andrew Huxley was
a physiologist who

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.080
with colleague Rolf Niedergerke
set out to solve

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.120
the muscle-contracting mystery.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.900
Until the early 1950's all
we knew was that myofibrils

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.090
were full of protein strands.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.460
At the time, most people
thought that these strands

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.639
simply changed shape and shortened,

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.530
like how a spring recoils
after its been stretched out.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.889
And by the '50s, we'd
learned pretty much everything

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.389
we could about muscle cells
by using conventional microscopes.

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.860
So Huxley and Niedergerke
actually designed and built

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.169
a new microscope.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.729
A tricked out kind of
an interference microscope,

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.669
which uses two separate
beams of light.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.050
And with that, they found
that during contraction,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.090
some protein strands kept
their lengths the same,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.440
while others around
them contracted.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.370
But at the very same time,
British biophysicist Jean Hanson,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.380
and Hugh Esmor Huxley, an American
biologist who had no relation

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.039
to the famous British Huxleys,

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.820
were using another new-fangled
tool, the electron microscope.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.400
Using that, they observed
that muscle fiber

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.100
was composed of those
thick and thin filaments

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.410
the myosin and the actin

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.560
and that the filaments were
arranged in such a way

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.880
that they could slide across each
other to shorten the sarcomere.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.370
So in two separate papers published
the same day in the same journal,

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.470
the two teams proposed that
muscle contractions were caused

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.979
by the movement of one
protein over another.

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.910
I guess, an idea
whose time had come.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.270
Except it's not that simple.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.120
To understand how the
sliding filament model works,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.569
the first thing to
keep in mind is that,

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:54.990
in addition to needing
a bunch of protein,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.550
muscle cells need to
make lots of ATP.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.750
ATP, you remember, creates the
energy for almost everything

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.979
your body does. Yes, that goes
for muscle movement as well.

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:06.660
Another thing to remember is that
some proteins can change shape

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.470
when they come into
contact with certain ions

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.520
like we've seen that with the
sodium potassium pumps, for instance.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.150
Those pumps are proteins that can
accept sodium ions outside a cell

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.229
and then they change shape
to release them inside a cell,

00:08:18.229 --> 00:08:22.270
and also suddenly at the same time
become able to accept potassium ions.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.120
These shape-changers are how
cells get a lot of the

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.009
day-to-day job of living done.

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:28.650
In a sarcomere, it's calcium
ions that change the shape

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.470
of some of the proteins, so
that the myosin can finally

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.909
have its way and grope the
actin strands all around it.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.589
Then it'll drag those actin
strands toward each other,

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:38.959
causing the sarcomere to contract.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:40.520
But when the muscle
cell is at rest,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.190
there are a couple of things that
keep this groping from happening.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.270
The first is a set of two
proteins wrapped around the actin.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.860
They're called
tropomyosin and troponin,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.310
and together they act
as a kind of insulation.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.630
Let's just continue
our middle school metaphor.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.100
They're the chaperones that
protect the actin from groping.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.950
At this point, each little
head on the myosin strand

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.930
has the wreckage of a spent
ATP molecule stuck to it

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.890
that's an ADP and a phosphate

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.630
and the energy from that
broken ATP is already stored

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.050
inside the head.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.279
So yeah, the myosin has a
lot of pent-up...frustration.

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.260
While the muscle cell is resting,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.649
it's preparing a stockpile of
calcium ions that it will use

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:20.270
as a trigger when it's go-time.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.320
This is done by a specialized
version of the smooth endoplasmic

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.779
reticulum, called the
sarcoplasmic reticulum or SR.

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:28.500
It's wrapped around each sarcomere

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.240
and it's studded
with calcium pumps.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.550
These pumps are constantly
burning up ATP to create

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.330
a high concentration of
calcium inside the SR.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.080
And of course, whenever you
create a concentration gradient,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.690
You know it's gonna get used.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.140
So now we're ready for a
muscle contraction to start,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.740
but what starts it?

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.200
Well, stimulus,
of course, from a neuron.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.690
Muscles are activated
by motor neurons,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.040
and each sarcomere has
a motor neuron nearby.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.130
When a signal travels down the
neuron to the neuron's synapse

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.800
with the muscle cell, it triggers
a release of neurotransmitters,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.610
which in turn set off
another action potential

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.450
inside the muscle cell.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.360
That action potential continues
along the muscle cell's membrane,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.850
and then flows inside
it along special folds

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.450
in the membrane called t-tubules.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.060
When that signal reaches the
SR inside the cell, bingo.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.490
The SR's channels open wide
and let all the calcium ions

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.620
diffuse down that
concentration gradient.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.769
The calcium ions bind with one
of the chaperones to the troponin

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:25.120
which causes the troponin
to rotate around the actin

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.580
and drag the tropomyosin
out of the way,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.350
revealing all of those super-hot
binding sites on the actin.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.779
With our chaperones
distracted, the myosin...

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.470
it totally goes to town.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.120
It reaches all of those little
tiny heads along its length

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.890
to bind up with the actin, and the
excitement of that long-awaited,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.670
precious contact finally
releases the energy

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.110
that came from breaking
that ATP molecule.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.589
This burst of energy causes
the heads to suddenly bend

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:52.830
toward the center of the sarcomere,
pulling the actin strands

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.730
together, and
shrinking the sarcomere.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.580
In millions of sarcomeres in hundreds
of thousands of muscle cells,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.660
this is what allows
me to, like, lift my arms.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.760
You wouldn't think it
would be so complicated.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.630
Now, in order for
the contraction to stop,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.620
you're gonna have to
tear those two proteins apart.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.010
Because each myosin head
is really comfortable here,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.670
snuggling with its beloved actin.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.250
It'll take another passing ATP
molecule to attach to the head,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.630
which breaks off one of the
phosphates to release its energy

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.320
as soon as they touch.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.459
That energy breaks the
myosin's bond with the actin

00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:26.240
and lowers the head, leaving it
alone and frustrated once more.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.300
So, it's weird, that the
energy from the Atp

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.990
is actually used to
make the muscle relax.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.970
But in fact, that's
why we get rigor mortis.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.130
When you're dead there's no more
ATP to make the muscle relax

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.399
and all the calcium ions diffuse
out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:43.649
causing the muscles enter their
resting state...which is contracted.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:46.110
But, you're not dead yet,
so let's wrap this up.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.110
While the myosin and actin
are being separated,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.260
the sarcoplasmic reticulum is hard
at work pumping all of the calcium

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.940
ions back inside it and
storing them up for next time.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.450
That lets our chaperones come back,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.790
the troponin and tropomyosin
retake their positions

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.360
around the actin strands,
and resets the sarcomere

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.390
for the next impulse to come along.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.310
Chemistry makes it all possible!

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:08.450
From blasting your guns to,
my awesome dance moves.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.660

If you want to go back
and look at some stuff,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.220
because it was a confusing
episode today: table of contents!

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.000
And thanks to everyone
who helped put this together,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.910
this one was a doozy.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.610
