00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.370
&gt;&gt; I could not be happier to have
everyone here, and please join me

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.130
in welcoming Fiona McCrae, Tom
Sleigh and Juan Felipe Herrera.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.250
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.950
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: I'm
going to clap for you two.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.100
[Applause] We're going to start
with a reading from each poet.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Fiona
asked us to read

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.080
about five minutes, so
that's what I'll do.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.900
And I always like to start with a
new poem, so that's what I'll do.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.550
That, you know, kind
of keeps you honest.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.660
Here it is.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.340
Okay.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.960
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Nice and loud.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.910
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Can
everybody hear me?

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.210
[Laughter]

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.130
Nothing worse than sitting
there, and you can't hear a word.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.500
Anyway, before I start, I just
want to say it's a real thrill

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.810
to be here, in this
wonderful University Club.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.850
It's probably the first time
I've had a jacket, and I --

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.260
I mean, you know, I'm
all very spiffed up.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.890
I just want to say that it's
a great delight to be here

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.840
with my old pal, Fiona McCrae.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.740
I want to thank Jim and the
unbelievably dapper and suave Rob

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.960
for making this thing happen.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.440
You know, I also, you
know, organize events,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.050
and I know how difficult
they are to put together.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.040 position:56%
And I'm really delighted to be here.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.580
And I also want to say
what a pleasure it is

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.540
to be with Juan Felipe.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.070
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: And I'm just
glad to be with all of you here.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.480
I know a lot of friends
in the audience.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.990
And Matt, thank you.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.220
Josh Fosterguard [phonetic],
thank you.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.850
And that's it.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.060
Won't be any more thanks.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.870
It's all downhill from there.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:16.160
So I'm going to read a poem
that's in five short parts.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.290
And this poem comes
out of some journalism.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470
I don't really know
how to put it anymore.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.510
I've done a lot of journalism over
the years, starting around 2007

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.940
in the Middle East and East Africa.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.540
And this piece just comes
out of having been --

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.010
about a year, two years ago
just before Libya fell apart,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.760
traveling around with the
militia, all over the country.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.670
And I know you say
the word "militia,"

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.640 position:56%
and everybody goes, "Ohhh, militia."

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.850
You know, but everybody in this
room would be in a militia.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.800
So it's a very, very common thing.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400
And when you move through
different parts of Libya,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.180
you move from one militia's command
to another militia's command.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870
And that's just how you circulate.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.360
And so when I was there
I met a young man,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.070
a militia meter [phonetic]
who fought in the revolution

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.650
that overthrew Gaddafi, and
he had been seriously wounded.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.710
He had a big scar on his
cheek which deformed his face.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.210
And I was just thinking about
what it would be like to be him.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.100
And I kept looking at his scar
and thinking it was a certain kind

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.350
of writing on his cheek,
kind of calligraphy.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.800
So anyway, the poem is in
five parts, like I said.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:49.130
One. Once I cleared the choppers,
wop-wop-wop, the airstrip opened

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.830
up into a treeless drift of sand,
where I heard a distant hammer tap

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.240
against the wind and smelled
scorched concrete wafting

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.260
from shell holes in the runway.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.030
Then we were speeding along
in the back of an open truck,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.960
its axles shuddering over
hardpan, as I rubbernecked

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.910
at burned-out tanks, turrets
blown to the roadside,

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.020
seeming somehow sadder
that the men who died.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:37.500
Two. Just a boy who played
soccer until the revolution,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.000
he learned with a bad
shoulder how to fire an AK-47,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.250
shoot off of mortar so he didn't
burn his hands, talk away fear.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.590
The radio broadcasting endless
hero victim chatter sent him racing

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.890
behind a wall, hiding from
the sniper's crosshairs.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.410
Pinwheeling shrapnel sent them to
the hospital, where he suffered

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.710
as much from boredom as his wound.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.050
Playing with a lizard he holds by
the tail, the panting ribs pulse

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.350
as he dangles it head-down.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.650
His bandaged cheek crisscrossed
with tape, looking like it aches.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.130 position:56%
The hot breeze dries sweat from his
face as the lizard whiplashes loose,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.540
scrambling across the sheet
to disappear under the bed,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.840
one wounded foot leaving
pinpricks of blood.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.510
Not a trail or code, just the tail
left dangling in the boy's fingers,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.810
as he laughs and, swinging
it around,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.110
shows it to his mother,
frowning, "What's that?"

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.410
And snatches it away.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.890
Three. Each time the boy, grown
up now, is forced to flash ID,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.600
his scar tissues calligraphy
writes on his body the history

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.710 position:56%
of his own scalloped, twisted flesh.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.610
Shrugging off my pose
of objectivity.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:37.070
Shrinking, puckering, the skin
grafts on his burns shine white

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.420
as phosphorus in the sun.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.070
And whatever I write down,
the counter text scrawled

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:56.250
on his cheek revises itself each
time his mouth flexes into a grin

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:05.750 position:56%
or frown, as year by year whatever's
written there gets that much harder

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:13.730
to decipher that much
further from the war.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:35.850
Until in the mirror, he'll see
and won't see his own scars.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:34.460
Four. In shade and sunlight, the
lizard grows a new tail that writes

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.380
in dust over a broken
cobble, its slithering trail

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.840
until it stops short, heart pulsing
in its throat, red eyes fixed

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.740
on that foreign shape which
takes out a notebook, scribbles.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.840
Green and brown skin, broken
black diamonds arranged

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.150
in vertical stripes, claws that
look like hands of a fever victim.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.210
And then scribbled
notes and neutral tones

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.710
about mortar fire, flak jackets.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.670
The strap on the helmet that is
always too lose or too tight.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.770
The boy's bombed house,
shockwaves blowing

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.310
out the windows to let in riot gas.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.050
An adrenaline rush.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:35.920
The smell of tears, chemical
as ammonia and as harsh.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:46.740
Five. All around me, the
sound of men sleeping.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.020
Their bodies shifting
slightly in their dreaming.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.470
The engines of the
trucks still cooling,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.390
giving off little ticks and pings.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:06.010
And then I was climbing
out of my blankets to slip

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:13.130
under the tent's canopy, stumbling
away from mumbling and snores.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.860
The desert cold making
the dew-damp sand stiffen

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:26.110 position:56%
so it crunched underfoot, as I crept
beyond the watchman to take a piss.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.780
And at the edge of the camp near
the chickens and their coop,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.570
heads tucked under wings
was a fox staring back.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.070
Or what I thought was a fox,
ducking down into the shadows

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.180
and disappearing behind the trucks

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.100 position:56%
that in the morning would obliterate
its precise four-clawed tracks.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.930
But the next night and the
next would keep on coming back,

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.370
until the chickens got eaten

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.080
or the fox was killed.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:06.130
Then pattering of my own piss
brought me back into the cold.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.580
The sky overhead, dark and bright.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.590
Bundled bodies in the dawn
beginning to levitate.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:22.230
Whose elbows dreamed
up the chokehold?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.180
Who pushes back the boundaries

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.650
so that no man's land is the only
high-bond [phonetic] homeland,

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.130
patree [phonetic]?

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:42.030
Who strips us of our shadows so
that our histories turn to glass?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.060
And then it was time for breakfast.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:55.240 position:56%
To sit, pee, smoke and take my place
besides the others in the truck.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.870
Then I'll finish with
a short poem from my --

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.660
I don't know what to call her.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.620
You know, she came into
my life via divorce.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.320
So I'm not really her biological
dad, but I feel like her dad.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.820
So we have this little code.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.760
I'm her dear almost dad, and
she's my dear almost daughter.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.590
So we're both each other's dad.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.580
That works.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.880
Second Sight.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:46.330
In my fantasy of fatherhood,
in which I'm your real father,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:54.940
not just the almost dad arriving
through random channels of divorce,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.330
you and I don't lie to one another.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.230
Shrugging each other off when
words get the best of us,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.700
but coming full circle
with wan smiles.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.440
When you hole up inside
yourself, headphones

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:21.700
and computer screen taking you
away, I want to fill in ten years

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.990
that if I'm still alive,
you'll still look at me

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:34.930 position:56%
with that same wary expectancy, your
surreptitious, cool-eyed appraisal,

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:39.650 position:56%
debating if my love for you is real.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.520
Am I destined to be
those shark-faced waves

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.100
that my death will one
day make you enter?

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:57.940
You and your mother make
such a self-sufficient pair.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.910
In thrift stores, looking for your
prom dress, what father could stand

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.410
up to your unsparing eyes,

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:14.500 position:56%
gauging with such erotic calculation
your figure in the mirror?

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:21.180
Back of it all, when I
indulge my second sight,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.760
all I see are dead zones.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:34.030
No grandchildren, no evenings at
the beach, no bonfires in a future

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.980
that allows one glass of
wine per shot of insulin.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:50.260
Where we both agree that I love you
always, no matter my love's flawed,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:14:01.320
aging partiality, my occupation
now is to help you be alone.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.120
Thank you.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:12.190
[ Applause ]

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.800
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That was beautiful.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.100
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Thanks.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.240
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That was beautiful.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.780
Again, thanks, everybody.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.110
I really appreciate being
here at the University Club,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.650
and I really enjoyed
our conversations.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.440
We had some conversations

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.860
about possible projects
already and using video.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.510
And so I just want to tell Rob that
there's more projects coming up.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.370
[ Laughter ]

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.390
And things really began
to happen for me

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.630
when you came in, and
we had -- we met.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:53.970
So thank you, and also Tom
and Fiona, and the whole team.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.050
Thanks again.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.450
You know, I'm like you, you
know, I have a fresh poem,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.040
and I've been deciding --

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.340
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Read it.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.640
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Whether to
read it or read this or read that.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.960
So it's kind of like
the tradition, isn't it?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.290
To bring out a poem
that we just wrote.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.240
And I don't know why we
really do it, but we do.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.460
It's kind of -- I don't know.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.450
It just -- that's what we do.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.750
Is that strange?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.050
It's a strange little thing.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.370
We've got, you know, a ton
of poems already ready,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.030
published, and the whole thing.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.400
And here we go, you know,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.450
with a poem that we
just typed this morning.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.760
So Victor Martinez was a
really good friend of mine,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.910
a meticulous poet and writer.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:43.050
And he got the National Book Award
for Parrot in the Oven in 1996.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.870
And he got it by just cracking
each line into little pieces

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:52.060
and just really worked so hard
on the language and the story

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.060
and everything you
could ever imagine.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.490
Every word in that book is
measured and weighted and looked

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.550
at from a thousand angles, from
20 feet away, pinned on the wall,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.010
and then he would literally use it.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.800
He passed away in 2011
from lung cancer.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.730
A lot of my good friends
have passed away

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:19.010
from cancer recently,
the last ten, 15 years.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.700
And I had written him some poems
early on called Undelivered Letters

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.760
to Victor while he was alive.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.910
So I remember him saying --

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.890
he was really a deep guy,
a really deep thinker.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.860
And on the back of his only
poetry collection called Caring

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.630
for a House, he says quite a bit.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.180
He writes a big old, giant
paragraph on the back of that book,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.980
and he talks about this thing
he calls super imagination.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.700 position:56%
And who knows, you know, if it's
Quantum Theory or super imagination,

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.390
and all about being in two
places at the same time.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.350
So I always think of him.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:06.490
So this is called Thought Poem
for Victor Martinez, Undelivered.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:12.380
Still thinking about super time,
super space and super imagination.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.620
You said what you wrote
was being written

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.740
by someone somewhere
else at the same time.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:28.890
Some country, some town, in a
broken bus or a polished grain desk

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.890
or a cheap clinic deep in
the rainforest somehow.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.330
A hut fixed with branches
and strings.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.310
Just maybe a school tilted en route

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.790
to tumbo-by-baneke
[phonetic] somewhere.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.480
What would you be writing?

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.390
It does not matter and why.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.850
Poetry -- why that?

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.870
Why continue its tiny
mouth on a page?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.170
Why not a simple message,

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:08.790
just a message there is more
hunger than poetry, Vic.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.730 position:56%
I am pushing down the 300 buildings.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.210
There is thirst, Vic, more
thirst than knowledge.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.690
You always spoke of this thing,
knowledge, you read Heidegger.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.910
What is thinking more
than knowledge?

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.090
Vic, how about knowledge
in the hand?

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.420
In the gut?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.290
Water from a storm.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:42.250
Hunger in the center of your
flesh; not flesh, is not knowledge.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.790
It is pure insight, sinew.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.820
It is edge.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:52.460
More edge than poem paper
poems are not bread.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.620
I am calling for bread.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.080
With empty offices at night,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:03.940 position:56%
the ones across from my tenth floor
poetry bed door, D.C. Somewhere else

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:11.850 position:56%
in the variety realms, even though
I am here, brother, and you are not.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.140
So that's the Thought
Poem for Victor Martinez

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.620
that I hammered out this morning.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:33.010
And this is Task the Void, and this
is [foreign term], and this is --

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:41.910
it always comes to this too --
doesn't it -- which poem to read?

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.720
I Walk Back Nowhere.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.220
Let's do I Walk Back Nowhere.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:01.320
I walk back nowhere,
under moonlight.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.740 position:56%
The dogs look as if they are angels.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.310
The ones I never imagined,
with drooling,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.940
silvery rays and torn behinds.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.470
Yes, blowing in the strange

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:18.190
and excited phosphor,
dancing out of rhythm.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.830
Racing up trees, chasing snails.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.340
This is like a children's book.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.820 position:56%
Oh yes, the children with
rectangle heads and sacked stomachs,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.710
with the eyes of Da
Vinci, sad and impish.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.660
Meticulous as even Haldun
[phonetic] and [inaudible]

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.920 position:56%
as Nietzsche, phlegmatic and bitter.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.570
When they speak, they leave
opalescent liquids on the grasses.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.910
Stuttered, under a half-erased
mural of [inaudible].

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.210
Or is it [inaudible]?

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.970
Wait. The children never speak.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.950
They nod their heads.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.690
They carry huge bundles,
strapped across their foreheads.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.330
They weep under newspapers
and roll up their skirts

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.080
and wash them in gutters.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.940
Ponds, if they find them.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.500
Then they run into the sea.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.620
This is where we meet on occasion.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.420
We make up stories.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.070 position:56%
We'll remember fruits and produce as
if blessed by the plutonium blast.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.910
Remember the pears?

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.790
They were so green, and the
avocados, like guitars --

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.140
honey, golden; and the asparagus,

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:38.540
like a lion's rainy mane,
and our mouths water.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.770
Their mouths water.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.910
I am used to these stories.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:48.550
I am used to the land, barren,
bitten in a flame with lies.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.760
I am used to our faces in this
new wild, dispassionate life.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.880
I learned this from
my musician friends.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.740
From years waging feudal
wars with poetry

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:06.890
until I could not think
of anything else.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.690
[Inaudible]

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.050
[ Applause ]

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.220
Thank you, [inaudible].

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.770
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Thank you.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.070
Thank you both.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.600
So now's the chitchat time.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Chitchat.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.140
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: The heading for
tonight was Voicing the World --

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:30.580
How Poets Engage with Communities
Within and Beyond our Borders.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.310 position:56%
So as I was sitting here, I did have
a moment of enjoying the thought

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.170
of the, you know, poetry, literary
community that we're in here

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:42.920
and so many allies, sitting there
and just grateful to you all

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.900
and to Jim and Rob for hosting us.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.200
Thank you both for reading.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.060
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.600
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Juan Felipe, in
your -- somewhere in that book,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:00.860
the one you just read from, is
Literary Asylums, and in it,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.560
you write -- this is
just an excerpt from it.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.080
You say, "The idea of an audience,

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.760
the idea itself tears
into all experience.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.330
The assumption of an
audience, they are listening."

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.010
So I thought we might start
with community as audience

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:25.730 position:56%
and just ask each of you what
assumptions you make about audience,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.570
where your poems are
heading -- headed.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.660
If any.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.240
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well,
you know, I was always concerned

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.150
with the question of
audience, because I started --

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.320
I also started out in
theatre, kind of speak theatre,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.180
and I always wanted to -- and
having read Antonin Artaud's book

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.690
on the Theatre of Cruelty
and his journey to Mexico

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:56.620
and to [inaudible] ritual and how
he became all aflame with that,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.070
how he really got a lot
of stuff out of that.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:05.040
He wanted this kind of visceral
ritual, intense, you know,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.650
[inaudible] aflame ritual,
explosive self happening,

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.410
where his words will
just burble out.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:22.690
And he was like super totally
present in this ritual, compressed,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.250
symbolic, physical visceral moment.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.820
So I was excited by that
back in high school.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.660
And so I wanted to figure that
out, where there is no audience,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.410
because there is no audience
in that world, in a sense.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.480
So then I began to do community
theatre and political theatre,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.870
and there was always an audience.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:51.100
And I was always trying
to deal with that.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:25:00.420
And now I visit so many audiences,
and they're all so amazing,

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.730
and they're real audiences.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.080
And they're different, and they
ask different things of me.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.230
And I feel all their
lives hitting me.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:16.860
And I go to them, and we
kind of come together.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.040
And in my poetry, I think --
to change my poetry, I go,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.440
"I'm going this way, but
you're pulling me this way.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.330
You know, I want to write this,
but you want me to write that"

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.850
and "I have this in mind,
but you have this in mind."

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.830
You know, I feel that,
from the audience.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.130
You know, I feel it.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.090
I go -- I'm reading this,
you know, poem, I go --

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.490
they'll look at me, go, "Come on.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.510
Let's move on to something,
something real.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.810
Come on, Juan."

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.110
So I feel that, you know?

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.410
I feel that.

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.200
And they're excited and you
know they -- all these things.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.250
And I want -- I like -- I
want to adjust, you know,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.970
because I'm in the moment.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.270
I'm in the moment.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.300
So now for me it's a moment.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.120
It's a momentarium.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.540
I'm in that momentarium, and I
want to be in that momentarium.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.840
Of course, I am.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.140
Of course, we all are.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:18.290
But so now my poems are
changing because of that.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.560
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Well, audience,
the first thing that really came

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.920
to my mind -- I also read Artaud.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.220
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Hererra:
Remember that?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.520
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.010
[Inaudible] and you know,
a lot of the poems too.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.840
And I was always interested
in his idea

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.510
about how the actor makes a gift
of his whole being to an audience.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.220
That was something that,
when I first came across it,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.700
was such a different
kind of way of thinking

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.610 position:56%
about just approaching what it was
you were doing, because before that,

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.150
I, you know, what the
fuck did I know?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:58.660
I grew up in a tiny
town in Utah, you know.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.630
There was no culture of any kind.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.690
And so to come across this
and even what I thought

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.900
of as an audience was
me at the school play.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.550
You know, and then
and then, you know,

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.090
I did some theatre work as well.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.400
And one thing I thought
was interesting

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.400
about doing the theatre was
that, until I read Artaud,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.570
I always thought it was
like a kind of presentation.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.870
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Yeah, a presentation,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.170
and they're out there,
and we're over here.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.470
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:33.230
As opposed to a gift of yourself to
what was going on in their minds.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.190
And so that's just an
interesting way to kind of segue

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.490
with what you're talking about --

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.790
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And no
boundary, breaking that boundary.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.090
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, and
the boundary, exactly.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.390
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Breaking the boundary.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.900
And breaking down the whole idea
that when you're playing a role,

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.570
when you're playing a
part, that the audience is

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:59.360
in some way completely --
has suspended disbelief,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.700 position:56%
and they really think you're Julius
Caesar, where it's really, you know,

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.930
as far as Artaud was
concerned, I mean, he was Artaud,

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.520
and he was Julius Caesar
at the same time.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.200
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: He
was Antonin and Julius Caesar.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: So I always thought

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.460
that was an interesting,
really interesting idea.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.900
And just in terms of writing poems,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.230
that's the kind of
public aspect of it.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.160
And I think Juan spoke
really beautifully to that.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.100
But you know, just in terms of
the private aspect, you know,

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.330
when I'm sitting down, I think of
my audience as being all these --

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:34.220
well, all these dead people,
like, well, like Phil now.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's true.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.820
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: You know?

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.120
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.420
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: You
know, like dead friends.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.240
I think of those people as you
know sort of being in the same room

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.710
with me, and I don't want
their voices to be too loud.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.010
You know?

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:48.310
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.610
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: But I like
having then them there.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.160
And so consequently, I think

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.000
that for me an audience is
this present moment here,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.440
like Juan was talking -- Juan
Felipe was talking about.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.330
But it's also when you're
privately by yourself,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:06.950
it's like the whole community of
the dead that is speaking to you

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.930
and through you and that you're
trying to speak back to them.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.030
And I think that's one of
the most beautiful things

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.840
about being involved in
an art form like poetry.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.120
You know, the money is great.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.760
We all love the money.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.060
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Big money.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.360
There's big money.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.660
There's a Bentley and
a Rolls Royce outside.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, a Bentley
and a Rolls Royce, right.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.530
But the thing that's
really wonderful is

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:34.990
that you actually have a sense
of, you know, going, you know,

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.610
it's like every poem you
write is this time machine.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.190
And it goes both forward,
and it goes backward.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.760
And I love the sense of connection

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.290
that that gives me to,
you know, a wider world.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.950
Because I'm not a conventionally
religious person at all.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:58.020 position:56%
And it sort of makes -- and I always
think that posterity is kind of,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.700
you know, distant from me.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.830
And it also feels kind
of pretentious, you know,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.980
"I'm writing my poems
for posterity,"

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.230
just like, the fuck is posterity?

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.420 position:56%
You know? So it's sort of like --
but if I have the idea that in fact,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.190 position:56%
you know, I'm in this time machine,
and it's going forward, then it's --

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.440
then again, it's like that present
moment that Artaud was about.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.550 position:56%
It's a present moment in the future,

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.020
and it's also as much
present in the past.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.320
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.010
That's -- I think that's where we
-- that's where we were headed.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:38.380
Because as we're talking about
this, it all comes down to mind

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:44.340
as one big, juicy, spiraling mind
that goes back, forward, sideways

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.560
and in unknown directions.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.280
And it just keeps on.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.160
I think that's why we're writing.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.580
So the audience was maybe just
a draft -- a draft concept.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: It's like that
Teilhard de Chardin had this concept

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.050
of the noosphere, in
which there was --

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.570
the entire earth was blanketed
by an atmosphere of thought --

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.040
of thinking, of spiritual endeavor.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.400
It's a kind of a beautiful idea.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.460
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Or the universe blanket.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.680
The universe blanket
that the Mayans had.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.980
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I don't know that.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.130
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It's a universe blanket,

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.190
and it's also with the women -- the
women's [inaudible], you know the,

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:30.180
when we see those nice
Indian shawls and --

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.070
they're like universe blankets.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:36.810
They have the story of the universe
on them, and by wearing them,

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:40.240
by wearing them and moving -- you
wear it, you know, and you move --

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.630
of course, you're walking,
and you're moving around,

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.270
you're also contributing to
the motion of the universe.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.400
So it's like a universe blanket.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.240
And the whole notion
of [inaudible] or one

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.000
of the elder Mayan
[inaudible] in Chiapas,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.960 position:56%
and the vestiges of the rain forest.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: You knew him?

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.560
I know him too.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.420
I met him when I was
doing anthropology?

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.720
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
When was this?

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.200
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: That
was back in [inaudible]

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.840
with Pepe Martinez [phonetic], the
bush pilot and Robert Bruce and --

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.140
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Robert Bruce.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.440
He was there in the '50s.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.070
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, and then I met
him when he was a pretty old guy.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.370
He had cancer.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: In the '70s?

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.270
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Or later?

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.570
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Well, it was just
when the Guatemalan War was --

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.870
because I was working
for Gertrude Blom.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Oh, you were?

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.470
I was there with Gertrude Blom.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.770
[Inaudible] Yeah, it was me.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.070
I know Gertrude.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.230 position:56%
I knew him, and I knew all his sons.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.440
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I met his son,
[inaudible], and then I met --

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.740
did you know [inaudible]?

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.040
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.340
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Oh my God.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.640
You knew [inaudible]?

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.940
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.480
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: What
a sweet guy he was.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: A sweet guy.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.230
That was a sweet guy.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.530
That's right.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.830
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.680
I'm sorry, we're having
a conversation.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.680
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So
we came back to [inaudible].

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.890
Remember he said that when the
youth cut a timber of [inaudible],

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:04.130
a star falls, because you know
you're ripping up the rainforest.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.300
And every time you rip down or
cut down and kill or sever a tree,

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.910
you're also severing a star.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I mean, this
context of this is that Juan Felipe

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.880
and I were both in
Chiapas in Southern Mexico,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.450 position:56%
maybe at more or less the same time.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.990
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
When were you there?

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.290
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I was there --

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.340
God, when I was probably
30-some, 35, 40 years ago almost.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.870
Something like that.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:34.910
Just when the Guatemalan
War was getting heated up.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.210
And [inaudible] is a [inaudible].

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.300
And Gertrude Blom was kind of --

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.670
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
What a world.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.970
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah,
she was an archeologist.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:47.190 position:56%
She was a -- you know, what she
really was was a great photographer.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.490
That's what she really was.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.680
Yeah, and a strong force
of nature, for sure.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.710
Did you remember -- oh, my God.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.950
The stories I'd like to
tell about Gertrude Blom.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.250
Oh, my God.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.800
I remember once a woman -- she
had a kind of research center.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.100
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
She did, yeah.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.750
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: And anthropologists
would come from all over the world

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.440 position:56%
to visit there, and the way she kind
of financed the research center --

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.930
which she also sort of
had a quasi kind of hotel.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:16.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It was a quasi hotel.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.530
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.830
And people would come in,
and it was a little bit

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.550
like Fawlty Towers, right?

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.680 position:56%
Yeah, so the guests would come in --

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: The Mayan --

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.100
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: But they
had really wonderful --

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.740
they're great anthropologists
from all over the world, actually.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.220
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
so you got into anthropology?

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.520
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I did, yeah.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.130
I studied it, and that's
why I was down there.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.430
Yeah.

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:35.730
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So did I.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.550
Yeah, I got a degree
in anthropology.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.000
Is that what you did?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.270
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah,
I mean, I studied it.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.160
I mean, I did all the
[inaudible] the British guys.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.910
Anyway, well, no, but see
I've been so interested

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:51.670
in that stuff for forever.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.970
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:57.070
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So yeah,
so Gertrude Blom and Frans Blom --

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.480
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Frans
Blom, her husband.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.780
Yeah.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So what
was the last year you were there?

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.880
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: The last time
I was done there was long

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.180
after Trudy's death.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.480
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Oh, [inaudible].

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.780
The late '90s?

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.080
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.380
And then they transformed
it, you know,

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.680
and now it's taken
over by the government.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.980
And it hadn't had --
all the aura was gone.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.280
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Can
I have a minute?

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.580
Now I bring you back --

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.880
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I'm sorry.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.180
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: No, it's great.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.480
It's funny with --

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.120
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It's good to remember, huh?

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.780
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: We're just sort
of looking at you both and --

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.020
not looking at you both now, but
looking at you both together --

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.310
and that's two different poets.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.390
And then you do start to
see similarities in thinking

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.930
about this idea about
communities within and beyond,

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:46.120
you've both written about
places not right here or --

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.360
and you have public
subjects, in a certain way.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:57.120
And you've had all your travels in
the Middle East and East Africa,

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.900
and sometimes you've
written about that

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.810
in prose and sometimes in poetry.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.060
And then you have the book about --

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.050
a lot of your work
within the Senegal Taxi,

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.370
that I thought was
kind of interesting,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:13.780
where there's prose
and poetry within that.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.670
So I was wondering about what --

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:26.540
how poetry serves as a voice
to communicate about the other,

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.080 position:56%
the person who's not you, how you do
that and what responsibilities come

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.460
with that, to whoever you
might be writing about

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:40.590
and once you start going
public, then words like duty

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:44.040
and someone's thought coming
in, which is a different --

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.480
when you're writing about your
inner -- you and your stepdaughter,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.070
no one can contradict
you about that.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.340
But if you're, if you're writing

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.430
about something that's a little
bit -- when your subject is beyond,

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.840
what does that bring up for
you and how does -- how do --

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.140
you've both written theatre.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.440
You've both written prose.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.440
But how do you find the form?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.780
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well, you
know that -- I remember that --

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.730
that's a big issue, still.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.950
But it used to be such a hard
issue back in the early '80s.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.900
I remember we used to have
these big old hot debates --

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.610
I think poets in the schools had
these big hot debates about "Well,

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:27.430
you know, what, you know, you
can't write as a, you know,

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.250
a Chicano voice, because
you're not Chicano.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.010
And you can't write, you know,
African-American voice, you know.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.310
How dare you?"

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.510
and all that.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.590
And we kind of liked
that concept, you know,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.570
we were kind of grooving
with that concept.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:47.160 position:56%
And it was a cultural appropriation
and all that was like hot, you know?

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.460
Wrestling -- it was wrestling --

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.870
writers were wrestling on the
floors, trying to work that out.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:59.450
And but then, you know, you
know, it's not a, you know,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.130
that's kind of all said
and done now, in a way.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.800 position:56%
Because everything is crisscrossing,
and everything is changing.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.450
A poem is a poem.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.500
This is not a mirror.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.120
It's not a police report.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.820
It's not a social science tract --

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.310
even though it could be
all those things, in a way.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.770
But it's -- you know,
it's made out of jelly.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.280
You know, it's just perception.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.400
And what we see is changing.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.700
What we write is changing.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.000
Our thoughts are changing.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.080
Today is different than yesterday.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.990
So there's really no
real solid appropriation.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.110
That's one thing, for me.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.420
And then the other thing is,
you know, you really have to --

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.200
this is going to sound
a little corny,

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.320
but you really have to feel it.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.230
You really have to, you
know -- you may be way off,

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.150
but you really have to feel it.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.030
And you really -- for me,
when I wrote Senegal Taxi,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:00.500
I looked at National
Geographic in a dentist's office.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.140
That was really highfalutin,
intellectual moment.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.850
I was in a dentist's office,

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:09.110
and there was a National Geographic
magazine, and it was a feature

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.080
on Africa, and you know how
cool those features are --

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.840
and it was about the
[inaudible], sub-Saharan belt --

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.990
the Sahara, and right underneath
the Sahara, there was this kind

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.780
of weather belt called
the [inaudible].

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.280
And here's Sudan, way over here,
and way over here is Senegal.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.300
And because of the atrocities
committed in Darfur in the Sudan,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.020
people were running -- they were
massacred, but some of them escaped

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:41.190
and would try to go through these
big old climatic upheavals of dust

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:47.530
and winds and heat, and then people
grabbing whoever was migrating

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.630
or escaping and just killing them.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.680
And these little, tight
locked, ghost --

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.310
what they call ghost
houses, with Kalashnikovs.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.610
So you couldn't escape.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.720
They'd grab you, throw you in
there and just torture you.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.960 position:56%
And then they had to make it all
the way to Senegal, at the very edge

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.800
of the coast, all the way
from the Sudan to Senegal.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.230
And then from Senegal, they had to
find a little canoe or boat and try

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.560
to make it to the Canary Islands.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.040 position:56%
And then from there, they had to do
the same thing and make it to Spain.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.320
And from there, they had to do the
same thing and make it to New York.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.290
What a zigzag, long, impossible
journey -- a migrant journey --

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.490
escape, life or death journey.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.490
And I said, that sure is
much different than making it

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:42.850
from Mexico City or any town --
even though the torture is there,

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:48.250
through the border, and then the
scorching South Arizona deserts,

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:53.150
where many migrants
die or are killed

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.070
and are taken into
freezers in Tucson.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.680
So I was just amazed by that.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.250
I was moved by that, and
I said, I don't know,

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.570
I don't know, this is moving me.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.470 position:56%
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.450 position:56%
Then I happened to get a month at
the Montalvo Art Center in Saratoga.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:11.770
We have a month to write and cook
with people and feed yourselves.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.090
Really cool.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.260
And so I had 30 days,
and I just wrote that.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.250
I just wrote that piece,
no matter how it came out.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.180
Senegal Taxi.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.090
And I did all the things I wasn't
supposed to do, back in the '80s.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.790
I did all the things I
wasn't supposed to do.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.090
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: You did lots

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.680
of different voices
throughout that book, right?

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.390
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I used
a lot of different voices.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.010
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Including
Kalashnikov.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.310
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
The Kalashnikov voice,

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.700
the voice of the ant, the fly.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.000
And on and on.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.430
But I contradicted
myself, which felt good.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.290
It's still problematic.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:53.980 position:56%
But then I was surprised, and it
may not be 100% true, but I was kind

00:41:53.980 --> 00:42:00.990
of cautiously poetically weirdly
happy that a man from Senegal

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:09.820
and New York said I was in the
vicinity of weird accuracy.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.750
The only accuracy a poem can have.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.050
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Weird accuracy.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It's weird accuracy.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I agree.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.950
Yeah. What's funny -- I'll
just say that, you know,

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.090
Robert Frost once said that, you
know, just in response to this,

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.510
because he had an idea of
cultural appropriation --

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:29.360
yeah, because I did, you know,
poets in new schools too.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.490
And there was a lot of that kind
of talk around at the same time.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.660
And it was always complicated
because --

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.960
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It's complicated.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.880
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: What you
really wanted to say was --

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.670
Robert Frost did a
really smart thing once.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:43.970
He said he didn't really --

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.170
the thing that he really wanted
was the freedom of his material.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:52.600
And that seemed to me like if
you were a poet, that's the thing

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.430
that is most important to you.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:55.940
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's your thing.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.560
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: You know,
and so if you, you know,

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:05.200
if you break other
person's rules, that fine.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.000
You know, but you know
for myself, you know,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.880 position:56%
in writing about what I feel like I
owe the people that I write about --

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.920
you know, like that
Libyan guy, for example.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:23.360
You know, I was very aware
that his experience was --

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.540
I mean, in many ways it was
radically different than mine,

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.040
but in many ways it
was weirdly similar.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:35.290
Because like for -- the story
that he told me about Gaddafi

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:39.630 position:56%
and what it was like growing up
under Gaddafi was strangely similar,

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.640
because he said what would happen
was, you know, when he was a kid,

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.190
they didn't have any
television stations.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.860
So -- matter of fact, they only had
one, really, and that was the one.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.420
And -- but they didn't
have much entertainment.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.380
So he was watching -- when he was a
little boy he remembered watching a

00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:00.800
series, an animated series about
a baby bee that got separated

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.430
from its mother and
wants to find his mother.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.990 position:56%
And just as they get to the climatic
episode, Colonel Gaddafi comes on

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.350
and begins to blather
on about Pan-Africanism.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.570
So he says there was
that element of it.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.340
And then he said, you know, later
on there was another program

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.020
about a little boy who wanted
to become a soccer star,

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.860
and like just about the moment
he was going to make the team,

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.610
and again, last episode,
which he never got to see,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.440
there Colonel Gaddafi is
talking about the Green Book.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.950 position:56%
So, you know, I'm really aware -- at
the same time, I'm thinking, yeah,

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.760 position:56%
well I -- when I was a kid I watched
stupid television shows like that

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.950
and really got deeply invested
in them and I thought, well,

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.490
there's a kind of intersection
between his childhood

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:50.040 position:56%
and my childhood even at the same
time as, you know, you know, I mean,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.210
I've been in war zones, but
I never fought in a war.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:54.510
Not even close.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.810
You know what I mean?

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.400
And so the thing that I
wanted to do was in a way

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.600
when I was writing something
about him is I wanted to --

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.310
first thing to acknowledge
is, well, this is what --

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:09.580 position:56%
there is where we have in common,
but these are the areas for me that,

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.490 position:56%
you know, I just have to acknowledge
the limits of what I know.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.380
And I think if there's a way
of building that into the poem,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.860
then this whole issue about
-- is this your material?

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.890
Is that my material?

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.860
It just seems -- it seems silly
to me at the end of the day.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:30.580
And the fact of the matter is
if you feel compelled to take

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.460
on this material, well, then you
let other people sort it out.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.350
You know? And they will.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.330
I mean, they will, you know.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.770
One of the things I find really
strange right now is a kind of --

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.090
this phenomena of internet shaming,
which I just find very, you know,

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.770
very, very, you know, it's
troubling and disturbing.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:56.090
And one of the things about the
-- doing the kind of, you know,

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.600
writing about subjects that
are sort of located in cultures

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.960
that are very different than
your own is just being able

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.480
to acknowledge the limits
of what you can know.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.300
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: In one of your
recent poems, there's a line.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.380
Your first line is "You've
got to put your pants

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.930
on in the house of fact."

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.230
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Right.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.530
Yeah, you've got to put
your pants on right.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:17.830
"Put your pants on in
the house of fact."

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.130
It's a very important thing to do.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:20.430
Yeah.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.730
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: So as
long as you kind of --

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.030
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.650
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: There's
something that's going back to --

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:26.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: But you
have to find the house of fact;

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.210
otherwise, your pants
will fall down.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.510
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Exactly.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.020
The house of fact is
being ruined every minute.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.330
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
But what -- you're right.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.360
It's about -- it's about
connecting, where we can connect.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.660
You're right.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.530 position:56%
It's about compassion and suffering.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.620
And that's where I wanted to go.

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.430
And I didn't mess with
cultural practices.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.240
I didn't mess with
one-dimensionality.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.960
I wanted to make the people
we thought were terrible --

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.440
like the Janjaweed the
actual paramilitary.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.440
So I got to bring that
character into this piece.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.370
That's going to be impossible,
because I don't have --

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.240
I don't have any idea
about that person.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.560
And there's nothing really
written about Janjaweed.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.860
So how am I going to do this?

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.160
How am I do this?

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.220
Because if I leave
that character out,

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:18.640
I'm going to leave a big piece
out, because this is the killer.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.680
So I've got to bring that -- I'm
going to have to challenge myself

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.480
and jump into the hot
griddle and throw myself

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.890
into boiling chili sauce.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:33.830
And so I brought that
character in, in a radio show.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:39.490 position:56%
I threw a radio show in the middle
of the book, hosted by Bart Crimson.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:46.090
And then Bart Crimson is the host,
the anchor dude who's very nasty,

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:50.330
and he really pushes this
guy, which I like doing that.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:54.030
I like to have that pushy anchor.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.460
You know? "Come on.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.490
What do you mean you don't
know about those bombs?

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:02.290
Will you get with the story?

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.030
You know what you've done.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:05.330
Just come on.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.630
Get to the story.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:08.110
Only got 30 seconds."

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:13.940 position:56%
So I made that radio host like that,
then I made the Janjaweed more like,

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:22.360
"Oh well, I did have a
dream, and there were bodies,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.500
and the chest was opened up.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.680
The chest was open."

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.500
"Oh, so all of a sudden
you got feelings, huh?"

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.590
So then the -- so I
kind of turned --

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.870
I turned this around
as best as I could.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:40.030
And I enjoyed doing that.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.330
And that gave me a little --

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.200
a little room to bring
in those characters.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.500
But then again, we don't know --

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.310
you know, I didn't
know where I was going,

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.290 position:56%
and we don't know where we're going.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.590
The house of fact.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:52.570
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: I went through
a poem that used, you know,

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.930
I want to do a poem in the voice
of Charles Taylor, a war criminal.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.230
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.530
Like that, like that.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:00.830
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.800
And so -- and so there's
a way in which you can --

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.840
I think it's really how you pitch
it, in fact, because Charles Taylor

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:13.770 position:56%
and this poem is the sort of --
it's kind of a composite of my past,

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.020
as well as being, you know,
the historical Charles Taylor.

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.250
And it's an interesting, you know,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.760
problem because basically
what you're trying to do is --

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.270
as far as I'm concerned, you're
trying to make a credible voice

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.960
that will fit inside a poem.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.790
And I think that's
the important thing.

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.870
A credible voice that
will fit inside a poem.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.490
It doesn't have to be --

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: "The" voice.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.090
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: Yeah, "the" voice.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.390
But a credible voice.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:39.800
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
then we don't even know --

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.150
we don't think about that.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:42.450
We're not thinking.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:43.750
We got the feeling for it, right?

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.050
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: No, it's the idiom.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.000
When you get the words and
you get the idiom right,

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.720
then you don't worry
about it so much.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.020
Yeah.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.320
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Well, it seems like
-- from [inaudible] again, Juan,

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.930
again you're saying it's this or
throughout this conversation --

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.230
we've put this conversation.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.160
We've gone the mind, the
material and connecting.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.640
It feels kind of a nice --
the mind where you invent it.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.950
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And the house of fact.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.310
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: In
the house of fact.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.100
&gt;&gt; Tom Sleigh: One of your
[inaudible] house of fact.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.810
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: I think we're
ready to have Jim come back.

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.510
We thank you both very much,
and thank you all for coming.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:24.480
[ Applause ]

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:30.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's indeed an honor to be in the
presence of two such great poets.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.170
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Such
great anthropologists.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:35.270
&gt;&gt; And my publisher.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:41.310 position:56%
It's my job to give the benediction,
and it will be brief, blissfully.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:47.810
But I want to urge those and you
in the room to embrace the Poetry

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.630
and Literature Center at
the Library of Congress --

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:56.210
a great group run by a great man.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:57.840
&gt;&gt; Fiona McCrae: Here, here.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:03.270
&gt;&gt; And the National Council
of the Graywolf Press,

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:07.670
which is open to everyone.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:12.550
You know, the word that I'd like
to hit on tonight with regard

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:16.030
to Graywolf is non-profit.

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:19.740
And non-profit means we
that rely very heavily

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:26.700
to sustain the excellent work
that Fiona and her staff do

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.450
on contributors and the
community of readers

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.800
and literature fans
around the country.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.130
And we hope you'll embrace
the council as well,

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:41.860
and we'd love to have
you learn more about it.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.670
Before you leave tonight, I think
you can still get a glass of wine,

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:51.540
but we also have some books
from Tom and Juan Felipe who --

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.370
I think they'll be able
to inscribe them for us,

00:51:55.370 --> 00:52:04.280
and some catalyzed book lists for
your perusal and to take with you.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.510
And you have my thanks for coming
to University Club tonight.
