Why Does Toothpaste Make Things Like Orange
Juice Taste So Awful?

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.750
You may think the reason toothpaste makes
things like orange juice taste so awful is

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:19.490
simply due to the common mint flavor of toothpaste
clashing with other flavors, but this isn’t

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.170
actually what’s going on here.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.519
The real culprit is thought to be two compounds
almost universally added to toothpastes -sodium

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.169
lauryl sulfate and sodium lauryl ether sulfate,
which are anionic surfactants, meaning they

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.600
lower the surface tension of water.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.530
Why is that desirable in toothpaste?

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.280
Because it works as something of a detergent,
and makes the toothpaste foam to help it spread

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.710
around inside your mouth easier.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
Besides any cleaning effect, this has the
by-product of making you feel like the toothpaste

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
is doing something, which toothpaste manufacturers
have found to be a great way to get people

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.929
to buy more of their toothpaste.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.910
Mint is added to toothpaste for this same
reason, as it leaves your mouth feeling cool,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.899
clean, and fresh, particularly if it’s well
distributed throughout your mouth.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.140
As Tracy Sinclair, one-time brand manager
at Oral-B stated in the book The Power of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Habit, by Charles Duhigg,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.030
Consumers need some kind of signal that a
product is working.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.229
We can make toothpaste taste like anything
— blueberries, green tea — and as long

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.780
as it has a cool tingle, people feel like
their mouth is clean.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.560
The tingling doesn’t make the toothpaste
work any better.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.119
It just convinces people it’s doing the
job.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.220
(Interestingly enough, besides any real cleaning
effect, sodium lauryl sulfate is added to

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.590
shampoo for similar marketing reasons, as
people perceive that foaming shampoo works

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.810
better than non-foaming, whether a particular
brand’s foaming shampoo actually cleans

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.060
better than some other non-foaming shampoo
or not.)

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.079
Back to your taste-buds -the sodium lauryl
sulfate interacts with your sweet taste receptors,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.450
making them less sensitive, and thus dulling
the sweet flavor.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.520
In addition to that, it also destroys phospholipids
in your mouth, which are compounds that have

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.340
the same type of effect sodium lauryl sulfate
has on sweet taste buds, except the phospholipids

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.329
dampen your bitter taste buds.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.270
The net effect is that your sweet taste buds
are dampened while your bitter taste buds

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.759
become more sensitive.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.090
So when you drink something like orange juice,
which normally has an overpowering sweet taste

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.840
that masks an underlying bitter taste, it
is going to taste drastically different -in

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.900
this case extremely bitter.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.930
So if for some reason your morning routine
includes brushing your teeth before eating,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.310
you can simply find toothpaste that is free
of sodium lauryl sulfate, and sodium lauryl

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.230
ether sulfate and the food you eat directly
after shouldn’t taste awful, unless you’re

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.730
bad at cooking, of course.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.010
Sodium lauryl sulfate has been shown to act
as a shark repellent.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.709
There is also evidence that it is effective
as a microbicide when spread on your skin,

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.790
particularly effective in helping to prevent
infection from viruses like Herpes simplex

00:02:44.790 --> 00:03:11.189
and HIV, which are non-enveloped viruses.
