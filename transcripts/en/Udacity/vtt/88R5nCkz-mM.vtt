00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.930
Okay, let's do a little quiz called, how to optimize? So as rows

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.480
here, we have objectives. Optimize application code,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.540
reduce latency for static content, make app

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.810
more responsive, reduce data store reads

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.280
and improve performance as user base grows.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.690
And as columns, we have different optimization

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.520
techniques. Edge caching, mem cache, automatic scaling,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.570
app stats, and queues. Please select

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.300
the appropriate optimization strategy for the different

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.150
objectives. There could be more optimization

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.850
techniques for a single objective. Good luck.
