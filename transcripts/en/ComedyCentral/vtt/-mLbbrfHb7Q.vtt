00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.871
(♪ DJ Raff - Latino N' Proud)

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.873
- Put it on my tab, Arnie.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:08.775
- You got it.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.344
- (laughing) Got it!

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.280 line:0%
For 10, we were gonna
do as the first episode

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
one that was maybe
three or four rewrites

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.584
to figure out.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.586
And then once we figured
out that sort of noir tone,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.288
then it started coming together.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.123
(dramatic music)

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.791
- [Ilana] No!

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.393
(gasp)

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.129
- [Abbi and Ilana] Holy shit!

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.131 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You know, it's
almost the first time

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.967 align:start size:94% position:6%
that we see Abbi and Ilana
have any real tension.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.635
Because we love just
having two characters

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.238
that are unconditional
friends that are women,

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.107
but this was the first
time that we allowed

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.075
them to have that tension.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.610
- Well, it was the forgetting

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.445 align:start size:94% position:6%
something really important
about the relationship.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.846
- Great, thank you so much.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.081
- Yeah, okay, are you mad?

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.517 align:start size:81% position:19%
- (sighs) Not mad,
just informed.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.152
- Like, for Ilana
in the episode,

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.787
it's hard for her not
to take it personal,

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.288
but it's all there.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't really
need this anniversary

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.959
to say what good friends we are.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You're my
everything, and I wanna

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.197 align:start size:81% position:19%
tell you something
before we die.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.131
- Okay.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.700
- This morning, I was the horse.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.038
- What?

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.740 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Were you gonna
tell me about Leanne?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.675
- (Ilana laughs)

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.478
- Okay, there is this
Easter Egg of a joke,

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.680
that is like, one of
my favorite jokes.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.417
In 10, when we walk, and this
is like the dumbest thing.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.653
In 10, when we walk
into this karaoke bar

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.323 align:start size:97% position:3%
to follow this guy, there's
a man singing a song

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.758
that's called Leanne.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.260
- [Man] Leanne! We are Leanne!

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.866
- It is a song that we made up

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
and our music supervisor
Matt FX produced.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.605 line:0%
- [Abbi And Ilana] Leanne

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.242 line:0%
- I am Leanne.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.547 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
We're all Leanne.
Something like that.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.784
- (Abbi and Ilana laugh)

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And it plays throughout
the entire season.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.856
On the radio, in cabs.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.558
It plays throughout
the entire season.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.227
- In "The Mushrooms," when
Abbi's changing the music,

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.094
I'm nervous.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.929
- (♪ Leanne)

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.598
- (Abbi sighs)

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.799
- It goes

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.201 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Abbi and Ilana]
Leanne, Leanne

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.843 line:0%
- Well it just like,
what's the pop song,

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.545 line:0%
and it's playing everywhere.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:26.746 line:0%
- I am

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.649 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- [Abbi and Ilana]
Leanne! We are Leanne!

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.486 line:0%
- (♪ Leanne)
