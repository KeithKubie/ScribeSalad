Welcome to CS256 mobile web development. We're here

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.640
to teach you to apply your web development skills

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.940
to this, and to this because as you're probably

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.790
aware the mobile web is kind of a big

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.530
deal. Most statistics project that mobile web usage will

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.370
soon over take desktop web usage, so you might

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.570
ask whats the difference between developing for the desktop

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
web and developing for the mobile web. Well mobile

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.360
web development is really just normal web development

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.380
with some additional key considerations and a few additional

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.080
API's. We're going to assume that you're familiar with

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.570
the building block HTML, CSS and javascript. The mobile

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.990
web is also built on these technologies, although

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.160
we are going to cover some specific advanced features that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.140
apply to the mobile space. Of course, there are

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.420
a lot of additional considerations for developing for mobile.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.730
Things like smaller screen sizes and limited network bandwidth

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.800
and computing power. Well you might think these constraints are

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.510
a bad thing. In fact, developing mobile first forces you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.370
to focus on the key points of your user experience.
