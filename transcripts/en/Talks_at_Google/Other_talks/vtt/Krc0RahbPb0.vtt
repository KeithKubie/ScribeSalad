DAVE MARX: Jack Garratt.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:04.948
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:11.150
DAVE MARX: Let's have
a nice conversation.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.334
I was working on
my accent, you see.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:15.000
JACK GARRATT: This
chair is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.708
DAVE MARX: Yeah, pretty
good [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:20.200
So Jack, thank you
so much for coming.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.320
It means so much to us.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.700
JACK GARRATT: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.366
DAVE MARX: Yeah.

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.365
And now, so your
debut album, "Phase,"

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:27.990
you just released it
about a month ago.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.111
The reactions have
been phenomenal.

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.610
If you guys haven't listened
to the whole album through yet,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.764
you absolutely have to
because it's unreal.

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.680
But this wasn't your
first music-making foray.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.888
You've been making music
for a very long time, right?

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.702
I even watched some
old videos on YouTube

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:42.410
of you playing songs
off "Nickel &amp; Dime,"

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.795
and the acoustic guitar.

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:46.764
Can you tell us how Jack
Garratt in this form came to be

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:48.180
and how long it's
been around for?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.599
JACK GARRATT: Essentially,
about four or five years ago, I

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.640
woke up and realized I
wasn't happy with anything

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.181
about myself.

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:55.070
It was a great moment.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.650
In the same way
that, like-- I feel

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.550
there's a kind of decade in
which you have that opportunity

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.910
to have that realization.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.762
It's from like the
age of 18 to like 28.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:09.870
And it's in that
time at some point

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.650
you have to realize
that you suck.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.702
And then the day after
that, you can go, OK.

00:01:24.702 --> 00:01:25.920
Cool.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.740
I suck.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.410
That's great.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.950
I'm now going to
be better at stuff.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.050
A lot of the album has come
out of that way of thinking.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.040
You cannot have light
without darkness.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.790
You cannot have something
shining in your face because it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.404
needs to have darkness to be--
in the same way you can't have

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:50.820
darkness without light, because
otherwise neither of those

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.360
things exists.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.818
You cannot know what happiness
is unless you've experienced

00:01:53.818 --> 00:01:54.640
sadness.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.390
Those two things are
equally as important,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.650
and that's a realization I
made when I was about 19.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.990
And I had this album.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.680
And I'd recorded an album and
I'd been working really hard

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.230
and I woke up and I went,
I hate all of the songs.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.660
I genuinely don't
like any of them.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.010
And I'm not enjoying the
course I'm on at university.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.010
I'm not enjoying
myself as a person.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.130
How can I change that?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.755
And five years later, I finally
feel like I'm ready to go,

00:02:20.755 --> 00:02:21.510
I'm OK.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.652
DAVE MARX: I totally
understand where you come from.

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:27.860
It didn't sound right to you.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.660
You were making music maybe
that other people liked,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.420
but it wasn't meeting
your standards.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.080
JACK GARRATT: Yeah, that wasn't
another big thing, as well.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.240
The kind of relationships
that I had at that time,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.914
not just-- with all kinds of
people-- not with my family.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:42.580
My family have always
been the most kind

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.940
of supportive and consistent
group of people I've ever

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.382
had in my life, but like
other paternal figures

00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:49.090
I had in my life.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.560
Other maternal figures
I had in my life.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.060
I was surrounding
myself with people

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.840
who were fueling and supplying
the demand that their ego was

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.380
giving them and using
me as a way to do that.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.830
I had a guy who would really
regularly give me gigs,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.360
and I thought it
was out of support.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.960
Like, he gave me my first
ever show when I was about 14,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.140
and I thought it
was out of support.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.556
And I very quickly
came to realize

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:15.770
that he was doing it because
he saw a potential and saw

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.940
talent in something very
young and essentially was

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.140
the first person-- like invented
[INAUDIBLE], but with people.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.004
He would put me on
that show because he

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.920
knew that it would sell
tickets because people

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.050
wanted to come and see me.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.466
And this is not me blowing
smoke up my own ass, I promise,

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.010
but they wanted to come and
see a 14-year-old kid who

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.730
played blues guitar and sung
those kind of bluesy songs

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.065
and stuff.

00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:43.460
I just kind of, for
some reason, was

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.972
very attracted to
being used in that way,

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:47.930
which is a weird thing.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.763
It was very strange.

00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:53.760
And again, the realization
of that was pretty great.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.900
DAVE MARX: I think that's
the theme I actually

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.610
get from your album of this.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.580
It's a bit self-deprecating
and self-degrading,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.910
but to me, my interpretation is
there's a lot of things in me

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.244
I want to work on, but it's
not because I think I'm bad.

00:04:10.244 --> 00:04:11.993
It's because I want
to get better for you.

00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:12.805
JACK GARRATT: Yeah.

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:14.180
[INAUDIBLE] for
the other person.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.880
And a lot of my songs
kind of deal with that.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.040
[INAUDIBLE] I love
the feeling you

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.020
have as a person, where you
sacrifice so much of yourself

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.630
for the sake of someone
else, but really you're

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.784
just showing off.

00:04:28.784 --> 00:04:30.450
Really, you're just
doing it because you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.100
want to be able to say,
I'm a martyr for you.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.450
And that person's going,
I don't know who you are.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.110
And that was a really constant
battle I had with myself,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.650
where I would
pretend to be people

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.400
I wasn't to impress
people who didn't care

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.566
about me in the first place.

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:49.580
A lot of my songs kind
of deal with that idea

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.640
of self-sacrifice for the
sake of self-obsession.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.480
DAVE MARX: And I think that's
sort of the "Remnants" EP--

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.530
the idea of, I'll destroy myself
trying to get you to notice me,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.234
and you might not
even know who I am.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:01.150
JACK GARRATT: Exactly.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.691
It's the reason why
a lot of my songs

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:05.790
deal with the idea of death,
because you sit there and go,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.710
I don't want to die.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.910
Not because people will miss me.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.951
I'm going to miss myself.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.332
It is that very immature way of
looking at the way that things

00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:17.665
exist, and the end things,
and the beginning of things--

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:22.480
just the natural phase and
the natural progression

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.312
and the natural
[CLICK] [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:26.270
DAVE MARX: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.520
JACK GARRATT:
Yeah, there you go.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.064
Yeah, it's something
I think about a lot.

00:05:33.064 --> 00:05:34.480
It's something I,
for some reason,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.870
really enjoy writing about.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.030
The other thing I really, really
like about that way of writing

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.910
music as well is I write,
my lyrics especially,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.670
I write kind of as letters
to people or for people,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.276
not necessarily for
myself, but just a letter

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:54.400
from one person to another.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.364
And the great thing
about having the songs

00:05:57.364 --> 00:05:58.780
and having that
kind of discussion

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.780
be presented in that way
is a letter, on its own,

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.230
drops you somewhere in the
middle of a conversation.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.315
You don't know how
many letters have

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:08.600
been exchanged back and forth.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.620
You're just looking at one.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.986
That's what my song
[INAUDIBLE] just one letter out

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:11.910
of a conversation.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.370
So it drops you in the
middle of a conversation

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.800
you know nothing about, and
then puts you deeper and deeper

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.560
and deeper and deeper
into the conversation

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.560
and then never resolves
it because you never get

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.590
an answer back from the person.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.340
So my songs are kind of just
like, hey, here's an emotion.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.610
Here's me exploring
that emotion,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.040
and now you're in a hole.

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:35.310
And I'm sorry, I've
run out of ladders.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.887
I don't want to know
why I have a lot of fun

00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:39.970
writing about that kind
of really uplifting stuff.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.832
DAVE MARX: We love to listen.

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.540
Is there a song off
this album that you'd

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.675
say is your proudest work?

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:46.050
JACK GARRATT: I
wouldn't say it's

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.680
a song that's my proudest work.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.780
There's lots of
songs that I admire

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.650
for lots of difference reasons.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.980
It's good to admire
your own work.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.870
It's good to enjoy
the thing that you do.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.300
It's the same in anything,
especially creative,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.170
and especially
creative in business.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.360
If you don't enjoy the
thing that you're creating,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.400
then the substance,
the purpose, of it

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.640
kind of disappears, so I
make sure that everything I

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.230
release-- everything that is
listened to by other people--

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.225
is something that I would want
to listen to as a fan of music.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:22.100
And for that reason, I
like the music I make.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.780
So for that reason,
I enjoy a lot

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.660
of the songs on this record
for different reasons.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.810
Kind of in the conversation that
we've just been having, track 3

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.790
I think it is, "Far
Cry," is I think

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.090
the deepest I go
in terms of what

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.041
we were just talking about.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.540
But there's other
songs on it that I

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.320
like for different reasons.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.945
Like "The Love You're Given" is
one of the first songs I really

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:45.670
probably produced and sat down.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.459
It's a couple years
old, that song.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.125
One of the first songs
I really sat down

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.335
and produced and mixed
it and did it myself

00:07:51.335 --> 00:07:52.700
and then kind of sent off.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.200
DAVE MARX: That was kind of the
first song of this new saga,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.366
where you were doing
electronic and doing

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.200
the songwriting and the
mixing at the same time.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.650
JACK GARRATT: Yeah,
because first EP,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.441
"Remnants," was a lot
more songwriter-based

00:08:01.441 --> 00:08:04.020
and then the second
EP was me kind

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.450
of trying to get a hold of my
production trying to figure out

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.840
what it meant to be a producer.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.770
I've never gone to
school to study music.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.800
I've never had someone tell
me what my compression is.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.400
I remember doing music
technology at school because I

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.310
was like, hey, computer games.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.135
That will be fun for
two years, as a joke.

00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:29.260
And then that's essentially
what it ended up being.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.650
The teacher I
didn't really know--

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.360
Anything that is not to say--
I have a really, really good

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.860
education.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.700
I've really good
relationship with my teachers

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.150
because I wanted to.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.800
You want to admire
your peers and you

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.341
want them to admire
you, and you need

00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:46.170
that kind of basic
level of mutual respect

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.620
to be able to learn
from each other.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.122
But unfortunately the
subject wasn't well-funded

00:08:51.122 --> 00:08:53.080
and we didn't have a lot
of stuff to work with,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.180
so I went and did-- this
was like when I was 17,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.593
so doing my A-levels, like
college or university--

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:03.990
but I went and I
remember like a week

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.110
before we were supposed to
go in and do our final exam,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.110
I had a conversation with
another friend of mine

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.740
who was studying music
tech at another school,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.440
and he told me about
this magical thing

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.060
called compression.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.120
Musicians in the room
maybe kind of understand

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.160
how important it is to have
that in recorded music.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.164
None of us knew.

00:09:22.164 --> 00:09:24.080
We'd been studying it
for about a year and 1/2

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.750
and it was our final
exam coming up,

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.890
and I suddenly
come into the room

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.014
and go, what's compression?

00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:31.260
And everyone goes, duhh.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.410
Our teacher comes back with a
two-page Wikipedia printed out

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.260
description of what
compression is and goes, there.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.850
DAVE MARX: And would the right
way to describe to people

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.550
in the room who
don't know what it

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.770
is, making the loudest
parts and the softest parts

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.265
come closer together?

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:46.230
JACK GARRATT: It's so you
don't have-- it just cleans up.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.100
You have to kind of put it on a
lot of the individual tracks--

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.440
vocals, drums, bass, everything.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.580
It all needs to be
compressed to a point

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.340
so that they can sit
against each other

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.690
and it all makes a nice sound.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.606
It's not like an obvious
effect that you hear.

00:09:58.606 --> 00:10:01.060
It's just something that's
there to clean everything up.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.390
It's really necessary.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.450
DAVE MARX: [INAUDIBLE]
you'd have your real house

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.210
to be self-producing
albums where you are.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.376
JACK GARRATT: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:11.350
And so when I started producing
my music after I left school

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.120
and after I tried
to go to university,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.545
I started to teach
myself worse things

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:19.425
because I realized
suddenly I didn't have

00:10:19.425 --> 00:10:20.550
the teaching anywhere else.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.633
But it's the same with
instruments and everything.

00:10:22.633 --> 00:10:27.320
I've always found that
I teach myself in a way

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.385
that I can respond
to rather than

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:30.510
if someone else teaches me.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.010
But if someone else teaches me
and gets me excited about it,

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.030
I sponge and I just
collect all the information

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.172
and it just soaks in me.

00:10:37.172 --> 00:10:39.130
DAVE MARX: And so you're
a self-taught musician

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.007
putting out the album
completely by yourself.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:44.090
I've seen an interview
where you describe yourself

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.390
as of a perfectionist who
doesn't believe in perfection.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.931
And I saw an interview
from last week

00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:50.780
where you said songs from
the head and the heart,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.960
but that you play
with the hands.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.669
Do your songs accurately
represent the way

00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:57.960
you hear them in your head now?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.410
Are you able to
present them in a way

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.640
where it actually sounds
like you want it to do this?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.320
JACK GARRATT: Well, yeah,
because I kind of know

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.190
exactly what sounds
I'm going to make,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.650
and I also have no idea what
sounds I'm going to make.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.430
It's a weird balance of
those two exact things.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.160
You know exactly
where you want to go,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.590
but you don't know what it is.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.920
I don't quite know how to
explain it, but in the same way

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.006
I've said before, I've never
produced a song that I've

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:26.630
sat there and listened
to the end of it

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.399
and gone, hm, just not
sure about that one bit.

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.690
That's never happened because
if I'm not sure about it,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.770
I've said to
everyone, I'm sorry.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.270
I know the deadline
is in 5 minutes,

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.750
but you're going to have to
wait another couple of hours

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.590
because I've got
something to fix.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.310
The most important
thing is making sure

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.965
that what I'm
outputting is the best

00:11:42.965 --> 00:11:45.897
that I can be in that moment.

00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:48.230
Not the best that I can be
in comparison to anyone else.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.890
I don't try and
compete in music,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.980
because music isn't elitist.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.876
It's not competition.

00:11:52.876 --> 00:11:55.030
It's an art form.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.925
I just try and better
myself and be the best

00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.710
that I can be in that moment.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.270
I always know what
I'm going to hit.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.999
I just have no idea
what it is yet.

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.040
DAVE MARX: I'd like to
open it up to the audience

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.450
with the few minutes left.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.160
AUDIENCE: First, thanks so much.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.880
Unbelievable.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.170
I just wanted to dig
into the writing style

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.580
as it pertains to how
you do a live set.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.300
Do you kind of
write it as you're

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.360
going with the idea of
that live set in mind

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.063
or do you deconstruct
a finished product?

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:31.090
JACK GARRATT: A little of
column A, a little of column B.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.450
I started off just
kind of writing songs

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.891
because I'd written all
these songs acoustically,

00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:38.640
and I kind of taught
myself to write music

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.650
while playing acoustic
guitar, and then

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.970
I kind of realized
that I was having

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.730
more fun producing those songs.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.102
And that was kind
of the first thing,

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.310
was deconstructing the music
I'd written acoustically

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.501
and then putting my
producer's hat on and sitting

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.750
in front of my computer and
having all my other things

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.083
around me and then producing
it into an electronic piece

00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:02.140
of music or whatever genre
was taking me at that moment.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.000
The next step was then trying
to find a way to play it live.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.940
When I did the first run of
shows a couple years ago,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.800
it was, OK, so if I
wrote these songs,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.267
I need to find a way to
play them life and I'm poor,

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:15.350
and I don't have a band,
and I don't have the time

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.540
to have a band, but I have
loads of shows coming up.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.920
And I knew that I'd be able
to do something like this

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.520
because ever since
I was little I've

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.310
been able to do lots
of different things

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.290
when it comes to music.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.090
So that was a case of going, OK.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.756
I've got to be strict
on myself and I've

00:13:29.756 --> 00:13:32.130
got to find a way to
deconstruct the music

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.761
and represent in the best way
possible in a live situation.

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:36.385
When the record came
out, I had already

00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:38.260
been digging like this
for a couple of times,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.500
so I did start
thinking, oh my god,

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.560
how am I going to
play this live?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.000
If I was asking
myself that question,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.600
I knew I was on the
right path for the song.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.200
I sitting there
going, this is crazy.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.170
I have no idea how I'm going
to be able to do all of this.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.249
And then I said, well,
don't worry about it yet.

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:55.290
You're on the right line.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.248
If you're questioning
yourself about that right

00:13:57.248 --> 00:13:59.232
now, then surely
that's a good thing.

00:13:59.232 --> 00:14:00.690
It's like, I don't
have seven arms.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.314
OK, let's see if we
can get seven arms.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.955
AUDIENCE: Which tools are you
using to write and record?

00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:17.649
And when you're on
the road, do you also

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.315
write music, recording,
what do you use?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.554
JACK GARRATT: I actually
still use Logic 9.

00:14:25.554 --> 00:14:26.970
Yeah, it's a couple
of generations

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.400
old because I don't like
change and I'm terrified.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.700
I've just heard nightmares
about the relationships

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.550
between those programs
and the laptop I'm using,

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.620
the software updates
and everything.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.720
So I'm running on an older
version of everything.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.606
And that's kind of what I use
for all of my recording stuff.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.470
I did most of the
record in the box.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.990
I did most of it on my laptop on
the road, in the back of vans,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.656
in the back of cars,
on buses, and stuff

00:14:58.656 --> 00:15:01.430
like that because I was touring
and trying to finish an album.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.500
And then I had like a
two-week period where me

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.680
and a really good friend of
mine, the engineer who actually

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.770
worked on the entire record and
kind of co-produced a lot of it

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.230
and finessed a lot of it with
me-- a guy called Brett Cox.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.190
We spent two weeks in this
small studio in London

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.880
doing all of the extra bits.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.440
Like, I kind of demoed
these ideas on my laptop

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.610
and get them to a point
where I'm happy with them,

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.220
and then he'd come
in and go, cool.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.125
That's a good idea.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.500
Here's a way that you can do
it so it'll have more impact

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.315
and it's live.

00:15:28.315 --> 00:15:28.815
It's real.

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:30.272
It's existing.

00:15:30.272 --> 00:15:32.730
And so we kind of had a lot of
fun playing around with that

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.646
in those couple weeks.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.195
In the back of the bus
that I'm driving around

00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:40.234
with on this tour, I've got
only room for one speaker,

00:15:40.234 --> 00:15:42.400
so I'm doing everything in
mono at the moment, which

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.110
is so confusing.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.980
And then my laptop and
a keyboard, and it's

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.400
just everywhere I go.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.540
I have it there just in
case something happens.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.248
And I've got my phone
on me at all times,

00:15:52.248 --> 00:15:55.070
as well, so if an idea
hits me, just straight

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.790
onto recording ideas down.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.430
It's so important,
if you have an idea,

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.060
if it comes to you
[SNAP] like that,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.320
it's come to you for a reason.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.700
A lot of artists talk about
the idea of what genius is

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.960
and what it means.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.000
I think Tom Waits
and Bob Dylan have

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.950
spoken about
[INAUDIBLE] in the way

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.434
that actually great philosophers
would think about genius.

00:16:14.434 --> 00:16:16.100
It's not something
that you own or have.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.950
It's something that visits you.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.325
It's something
that comes to you.

00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:20.802
That's why you can have
those eureka moments.

00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:23.010
And it's important hearing
those people talk about it

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.332
because Tom Waits says,
if an idea comes to me

00:16:25.332 --> 00:16:28.420
and I'm not ready for it, I'll
just say go somewhere else.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.840
Bob Dylan is around the corner.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.320
He'll take it.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.246
But it's important that
if it comes to you,

00:16:33.246 --> 00:16:35.120
it's come to you for a
reason, because you're

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.911
willing for it to come
to you and also it's

00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:39.230
respecting you enough to
visit you, in a sense.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.438
That's kind of how I try
and think about the writing.

00:16:41.438 --> 00:16:43.574
So I always have my phone
in case I happen to.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.760
AUDIENCE: So it talks--
your rule for everything

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.096
seems to be confidential,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.470
I was wondering what's on the
docket for you this summer.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.785
Any festivals you can
let us know about?

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.109
JACK GARRATT: I'm just
staring at my manager.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.970
No, there's a couple of
things that are going on.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:14.680
If I'm honest, I don't
know a lot of it.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.000
I try and know everything I can.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.825
It's important, I think, to
know everything I'm up to

00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:22.700
and I'm doing and
stuff, but in terms

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.410
of scheduling and calendars,
I get kept out of the loop

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.590
because it would
just destroy me.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.680
I know I'm doing a lot.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.920
I know I'm coming back
out to the States.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.878
Is there any-- I'm trying
to think of festivals

00:17:36.878 --> 00:17:38.790
that we're doing.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.331
MANAGER: Firefly in June.

00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:41.830
You've got a couple
of shows in June

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.462
and then Firefly's
over the east coast.

00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:47.420
JACK GARRATT: Yeah, so
that's about it for now.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.990
Will you put more in?

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.790
MANAGER: Yeah.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.380
JACK GARRATT: That'd be cool.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.417
So yes.

00:17:53.417 --> 00:17:54.125
But I don't know.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.660
DAVE MARX: And I'd say,
along with that question,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.076
one I'd like to
end on is what are

00:18:00.076 --> 00:18:02.340
you most excited about
coming up, going forward,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.974
whether it's an idea you had
or an event you're playing at?

00:18:05.974 --> 00:18:07.390
JACK GARRATT: I'm
actually working

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.670
on a lot of different
ideas at the moment,

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.580
a bit of passion
projects brewing, which

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.894
I'm keeping my voice off of.

00:18:16.894 --> 00:18:18.310
I don't what it's
going to be yet,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.782
or how it's going
to manifest, but I'm

00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:21.990
creating a lot at the moment.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.300
I'm not a very prolific writer.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.970
It takes me a long
time to write songs.

00:18:29.587 --> 00:18:30.420
I'm trying to think.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.920
There were some
from the record that

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.220
had taken up to two
years, maybe three years

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.950
to write-- to finish.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.594
And at the moment, for some
reason, I'm outputting a lot.

00:18:40.594 --> 00:18:42.010
So I'm kind of
encouraged to sing.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.890
I was going to say
that's the reason why

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.674
I have a small studio
with me everywhere,

00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:47.840
because it seems to be
happening more at the moment.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.630
So I don't know want it
is, but it's definitely not

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.970
like anything I've done before.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.553
But then again,
nothing I've ever done

00:18:53.553 --> 00:18:55.150
is like anything
I've done before.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:55.650
I think.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.370
I don't know.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.360
DAVE MARX: Well we look
forward to seeing it.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.640
Guys, let's hear it one
more time for Jack Garratt.
