SPEAKER: It's my honor to
introduce Dr. Pascal Bokar

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.670
Thiam.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.570
He's a professor at the
University of San Francisco

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.450
and the author of "From Timbuktu
to the Mississippi Delta:

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.970
How the West African
Standards of Aesthetics

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.480
Shaped the Music of
the Delta Blues."

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.970
He's also the owner
of the Savannah Jazz

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.009
Club in San Carlos.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.560
So please give him a
warm welcome to Google.

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:38.520
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM:
Thank you, Max.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.500
I hope this is working.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.120
And thank you for spending
a few minutes with me

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.110
and we're delighted
to be here at Google.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.850
I was asked to come and
talk about this book

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.040
that I wrote a
couple of years ago.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.350
And I wrote it because I
teach a course entitled Jazz

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.115
Culture and Social Justice.

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:09.300
And in the teaching
of this book,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.380
I found out that
whenever we would

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.180
talk about American music
and this American art form

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.250
that we call jazz, all the
books talked about 1865 New

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.360
Orleans moving forward.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.540
I was like, well, that's
really interesting because what

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.250
happens before 1865?

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.930
Well, what happens
before 1865 is documented

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.810
in the libraries or the
history departments of Harvard

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.825
University, in the
history departments of la

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.780
Sorbonne in Paris, or
in Oxford in England.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.550
But somehow we never apply
that knowledge of history

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.970
to what it did and to what it
contributed to American music.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:18.020
And so I was born in Paris,
and I thought I was French

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.290
and I found out that my father
was from a country named

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.190
Senegal and he was part
of the first generation

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.280
of West African who had
received a scholarship

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.630
to go study in Paris, which
is where he met my mother.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.180
And we went back to
a city called Segou,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.800
and Segou is in
the center of Mali.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.440
And it's also the place which
is famous for the instrument

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.730
that you see behind me.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.810
This is called a
kora in Malinke.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.200
And kora by the way
means singing in Malinke.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.020
And people interested
in etymology

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.320
will tell you that it's the
same word in Greek, which is

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.340
where the term kora comes from.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.228
That instrument
is extremely old.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.780
So I grew up in Mali and
I kept listening to music

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.090
coming from the United States.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.280
And it was really
puzzling because I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.150
was trying to figure
out how we got to this.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:04:16.370
[MUSIC - BOBBY BYRD, "I KNOW YOU
 GOT SOUL"]

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.510
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: And I
was like, wow, this music was

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.680
making the entire planet dance.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.310
And I was like, where
does it come from

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.060
and how do we get to that?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.200
And I really couldn't find out
except that my dad said, well,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:43.215
you know, Africans were
taken to the United States.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:44.006
I was a little kid.

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.145
I said, Africans were
taken to the United States?

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:47.010
I'd say, why?

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.810
And he said, well, when
you get a little older,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.935
you'll study it.

00:04:55.935 --> 00:05:00.606
I was, huh, interesting.

00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:06.400
So in the process
of my studies, as I

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.350
was looking at the
demographics and I

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.430
was looking at the history, I'm
looking at the United States,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.670
a majority population
of European descent,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.740
African-American
represented about 10%

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.130
of their population, the largest
ethnic group in the United

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.740
States being of
German descent, which

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.100
is why the country as a whole is
Baptist from the Martin Luther

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.045
school.

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.520
I was like--

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.330
I ended up studying classical
music in a French conservatory.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.120
So it was very
academic and they know

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.360
exactly how the music works.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.490
The oldest recorded
music in Europe

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.170
is what we call
the Baroque music.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.650
And I was listening--

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.080
[MUSIC - BOBBY BYRD, "I KNOW YOU
 GOT SOUL"]

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.000
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM:
--and I was like,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.890
that cannot possibly translate.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.258
This cannot possibly
come from this.

00:06:02.258 --> 00:06:05.291
[MUSIC - CLAUDE DEBUSSY, "THE
FOUR SEASONS CONCERTO NO.

00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:19.240
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: So
where does music come from?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.520
What are the foundation
of this music?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.950
Where are its roots?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.820
And how come I can't
find it in the books?

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:36.490
And so I looked around, then
I studied a little bit more,

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:47.240
and I found out that this is
that between 1515 and 1888,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.330
we brought in to the southern
part of the United States,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.910
between North and
South Carolina,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.490
Alabama and
Mississippi, Louisiana,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.930
in excess of 8
million West Africans.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.060
West Africans.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.400
99% of African-Americans,
I found out,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.311
are from the west
part of the continent.

00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.560
They're not from the north,
they're not from the east,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.200
they're not from the south.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.283
They come out of the west.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.110
If you go to St.
Augustine, Florida,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.322
there is a plaque that says,
first Africans arrived.

00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:25.400
It say 1550.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.055
Was recorded by the Spaniards.

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:30.430
And the Spaniards acknowledged
that the French were there

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.530
with Africans before them.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.980
1860 is when the US
government sends back--

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.890
is recorded as
sending back a ship

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.080
called the Clotilde
in Mobile, Alabama.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.540
That's a first archive of
the US government taking.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.210
And I started thinking
because I was--

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.810
I was a developing musician.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
I wanted to-- I was really
interested in learning

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.750
to play jazz, and I was amazed
by the complexity of that art

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.180
form.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.640
Jazz was very complex.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.640
My dad used to play those
records all the time,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.080
and I really didn't
like them very much.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.094
I like James Brown.

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:15.510
By the way, the
gentleman that you

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.026
heard before that was
singing, I got soul,

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:19.650
I know you got soul,
that's Bobby Byrd.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.242
He's the one who
discovered James Brown.

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:25.570
And James Brown was in his band
as a vocalist and a keyboard

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.170
player.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:34.640
And I found out that
the concentration

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.750
of Africans in the southern
colonies in some cases

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.140
was four to one.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.920
It was a majority population.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.550
1515 to 1888,
that's a long time.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.455
West Africans come every
day, every week, every month,

00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:58.000
of every year.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.750
It is not as if they just
came and then, and stop.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.520
No, no, no, no.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.160
They kept coming.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.170
And they kept coming with
their songs, with their music,

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.020
with their instruments, with
their sense of religion.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.840
If you go to Louisiana in some
parts when it's really dark,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.800
they talk about voodoo.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.770
Be careful.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:28.400
Voodoo religion exists in
Ghana, in Togo, in Benin.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400
And so I found out that
the greatest concentration

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.540
of Africans was actually
in the Mississippi Delta.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:44.010
And in the Mississippi Delta
emanates a popular form

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.520
that at the beginning
of the 20th century

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.200
we're going to call
the Delta blues.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.710
And I started to
listen to a gentleman

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.240
by the name of Son House.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.410
And if you're interested in the
roots and the origin of blues,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.690
you have to go to Son House.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:09.940

giant in that art form.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.300

listening to this--

I listened to that I said,
that's the music of the Delta.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.960
And when I heard that,
I knew it had nothing

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.080
to do with baroque music.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.887
It sounded a lot like this.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.680
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: That's the
music I was hearing at night.

00:12:26.152 --> 00:12:31.520
And I realized in the
course of my studies

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:41.070
that there are three medieval
empires that are recorded

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.160
in the West, in West Africa.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.470
One of them, the first
one is the Empire

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.660
of Ghana, which is roughly
from the fourth, fifth century

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.460
until the 10th century.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.290
And I was talking to
some of my colleagues,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.560
and if you look at it,
it's placed right there.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.920
The north is part of Senegal.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.860
It's called the Empire of Ghana.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.400
And it has nothing to do with
the country of Ghana, which

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.682
is a lot further south.

00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:11.390
But where there was
a direct relationship

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.130
with the country of
Ghana is that Ghana

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.140
was a British colony.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.122
It was the empire
of the Ashantis.

00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:18.080
The British were there.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.210
They called it the Gold Coast.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.320
And Kwame Nkrumah, who was a
revolutionary and a scholar,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.750
wanted to name
his country, which

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.090
was one is the first
independent countries

empire of West Africa.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.630
And that's how the country
got its name, Ghana.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.680
But the Empire of Ghana
itself was a lot further

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.010
north than the country of Ghana.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:55.870
The second empire
that comes in is

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:01.900
the Empire of Mali from the 10th
century to the 14th century.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.220
And you can see how
extended it goes.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.300
And it controls the trade
routes to all of Europe

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.380
to the Middle East to Asia.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.870
And at some point,
Mali is a gold reserve

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.060
of the Western world.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.100
It's well documented
that those trade

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.700
routes are very well managed,
very well administered.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.490
And you have to have
in place societies

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.372
would know how to do this in
order to have successful trade.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:38.960
And the third Empire I found
out was the Empire of Songhai

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.460
from the 14th to
the 17th century.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.610
And it takes-- it grows
concentric from that.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.980
And that's probably the
largest West African empire

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.570
that we had.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.430
So what that told me-- and if
you look there is a river here,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.490
which takes its roots in
Guinea that goes all the way up

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.400
north to Muktu, which is
a real city by the way,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.520
and all the way down to
the delta of Nigeria.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.830
That's how big that river is.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.570
It's the third largest
river in the world.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.397
And it gives it's
name to two countries.

00:15:16.397 --> 00:15:18.230
There's a country of
Niger here, the country

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.620
of Nigeria right there.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.420
And the riverways
are the place where

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:29.970
people exchange cultural norms,
exchange languages, exchange

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:35.340
skills, exchange technology,
instrument, music, songs,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.360
lullabies.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.300
It is-- it serves the same
cultural and economic process

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.890
as the Mississippi, Missouri
River, from the Gulf of Mexico

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.170
all the way into
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.100
St. Paul, where it
takes its roots.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.120
So very important
riverways managed

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.070
these empires had
some navies of sort

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.700
to ensure that the
commerce would prosper,

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.434
and so forth and so on.

00:16:05.434 --> 00:16:06.350
So I started thinking.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.480
I said, well, if they
could manage trade routes

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.160
that successfully--
and by the way,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.120
this is a time where
there is no inbalance

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.930
between the African
continent and Europe

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:24.440
because there is no recorded
history of European empires

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.730
trying to go into Africa.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.200
They're not, which
tells you that there's

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.840
a lot of respect between
the kingdoms of Europe

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.090
and the kingdoms of Africa.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.910
They trade, and that
commerce is well-documented.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.940
But with the event
of the gunpowder,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.160
we are going to start seeing
a shift in these relationships

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.892
as a result.

00:16:47.892 --> 00:16:48.850
But I started thinking.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.800
I said, OK, so the trade,
the Atlantic slave trade

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.960
takes place, you
know, around 1550

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.050
with the Spanish and
the Portuguese first,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.070
and then the French and the
British and the Dutch later.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.080
And then these
European powers vie--

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.680
they battle each other
for control of that.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.869
But I said, these populations
come with knowledge,

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:16.859
with music, with technology.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:20.190
By the way, there's no
rice in the United States

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.680
before the arrival
of West Africans.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.480
So much so that plantation
owners were looking for people

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.890
from the West part between
Guinea, Senegal, and Gambia

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.520
who knew how to cultivate rice.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.130
And at one point
before the Civil War,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.540
rice is the main economy
in the Carolinas.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.360
If you look at the foods of
the South of the United States,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.460
whether you go to New Orleans,
okra, which you need for gumbo,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.750
comes out of West Africa.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.540
Black eyed peas, West Africa.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.730
So you have an entire
culture, and the food

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.890
that people eat in the
South are the same food

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.170
that people eat in West Africa.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.240
Because you don't move
millions of people

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.600
over long periods of time
without bringing them

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.810
with their culture.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.850
And so I started thinking,
OK, in American music, what

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.091
is the oldest American
musical instrument?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.290
And people started
telling me, well,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.370
in my classes I have some smart
alecks who would say, you know,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.360
the voice, which is true.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.330
And then I hear the
drums, which is also true.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.010
I said, but, I said Native
Americans were here first.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.020
Their culture has not got
into the mainstream of America

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.755
because none of you can sing me
a Navajo lullaby, for example.

00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:48.710
It hasn't transferred into.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:55.600
But America's oldest musical
instrument is called the banjo.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.554
But there's not a
single banjo in England.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:58.720
There's no banjo in Ireland.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.870
There's no banjo in Scotland.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.620
The banjo comes
out of West Africa.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.860
It comes out of Mali.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.720
It is the instrument
of the people.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.507
It's easy to make.

00:19:10.507 --> 00:19:12.340
It's easy to tune because
there's only about

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.800
three strings mostly.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.550
Afterward we added
some extra strings.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.361
But it is the instrument
of the people.

00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:21.110
And it's a very, very
important instrument

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:27.770
because that instrument allowed
the West African population

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:33.210
to reorganize a sense
of cultural identity

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.740
in the face of these
political economic hurricane

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:44.070
that they encountered
coming into the South

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.810
and into these plantations.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.800
And so I'm going to take you
to a place near Segou, which

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.575
is a place where I grew
up, so that you can hear--

00:19:59.788 --> 00:20:03.225
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.210
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.620
I was born here.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.870
[INAUDIBLE] is part
of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.420
[INAUDIBLE] is made
up of 12 villages that

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.890
exist since the 13th century.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.430
That's a ngoni.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.140
In the 13th century,
only the great warriors

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.350
were allowed to listen to it.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.080
The ngoni is Mali's
oldest string instrument.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.320
The djinn, the water spirits
that live in the Niger,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.720
gave the ngoni to my
great grandfather.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.670
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.110
When I was about 20 years
old, I went to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.120
That was in '84.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.420
I met [? Toumani ?] in '87 and
we started working together.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.070
I played my first concert
in Europe with him

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.135
at a festival
called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.030
Then I traveled to the USA
alone to represent the ngoni

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.260
at the Banjo Folk
Festival there.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.750
The banjo has its origins here.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.240
In the US I went
to a banjo museum.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.660
There I saw that the slaves
that were brought from Africa

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.200
built the instruments just the
way we used to build them here.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.660
We used to make them
with our calabash.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.380
The blacks that were brought
to the US did the same thing.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.350
Later they added a lot of
machines to their banjo.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.840
We here in Africa
didn't change much.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.710
We left it like it was.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.600
But still, it's the same thing.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.655
The banjo and the
ngoni are the same.

00:23:24.661 --> 00:23:28.112
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.730
That's what A banjo
sounds like, isn't it?

00:23:49.357 --> 00:23:50.190
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.370
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM:
When I started

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.420
thinking about the banjo--

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.982
because, you know, I'm
a guitar player and I

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:07.740
like all forms of
music that where

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.220
a guitar is very present--

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.280
and country music has a lot
of great guitar players.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.860
And they also have
a lot of banjo.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:25.180
And I started looking and I
was like, how did that happen?

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.410
Well, in order to
understand how that works,

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.960
we have to understand the
chronology of the demographics

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.310
in the United States.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.950
So West Africans bring the
banjo in the plantations

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.670
of the South.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.950
And West Africans are
also in the plantation

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.030
in charge of the music.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.610
And for the longest time, they
are going to play the banjo.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.550
When European-Americans move
into the United States between,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:01.800
literally between 1790
and 1840, the first wave,

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:08.310
the second wave is between
1850 and 1910, they find--

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.610
these European populations were
coming from the British Isles

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.930
in particular--

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:14.670
find on the banks
of the Tennessee

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.270
River these African
populations have been there

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.490
for several hundred
years before and play

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.560
that instrument, the
banjo, with these colors

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.810
that we are later at the
beginning of the 20th century

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.310
going to call the blues.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.280
The term blues is something that
the industry with the invention

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.864
of the phonograph gave
to black people's music

00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:37.780
so they could sell it.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.290
These Irish populations,
Scottish populations

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.490
find these African populations
and they like what they hear.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.870
They're going to
integrate the sound--

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.760
first of all the banjo,
but also the sound

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.050
that the colors of
the music of the Delta

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.100
into their own Celtic
heritage to give birth

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.270
to another American
form of music,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.010
which is extremely popular
outside of the coast,

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.385
called Bluegrass.

00:26:10.385 --> 00:26:17.100
And you did that
instrument for Mali

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.916
in order to have good Bluegrass.

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:22.290
Otherwise, you might have
something and it would be nice,

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.581
but that wouldn't be Bluegrass.

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.630
You need that instrument.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.980
The banjo is even more
important in terms of aesthetics

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:35.450
because the rhythmic
syncopation of the banjo.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.140
You know, when it goes
like [RHYTHM] like this.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.040
That's what Africans
are going to translate

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.240
when the missionaries
in the 1650s

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.780
brings them Christianity
and the piano.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.870
The syncopation of
the banjo are going

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.140
to be translated on the
left hand of the piano

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.771
to give America a new form of
music that we call ragtime.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:10.420
So it's interesting to see
how the transfer of standard

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.220
of aesthetics in
music have applied,

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.850
and over time have developed
into the United States

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.750
several forms of music who
have identity markers that

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:32.540
gives this nation its own
sense of cultural significance.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:38.250
But it comes from this
marriage over time

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:43.130
of this West African
culture, which

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.730
you hear later on in the music
of Bobby Byrd or James Brown

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:52.170
or Buddy Waters or
Louis Armstrong.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:28:02.080
And so I started thinking,
because growing up in Africa,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.470
I found out that Americans
are the only people

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.590
on the face of the planet
who clap on two and four.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.650
And what I mean by that,
when you listen to music,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.400
you're listening for--

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.890
it's called a norm--

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.190
you're listening for that space
where you're supposed to clap.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.190
And sometimes, you're
not in the right spot,

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.900
and you rectify real
quick, because you

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.290
don't want your friends
to think you're square.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:33.130
And it's not intuitive.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.580
It's something that
you have to learn.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.930
It's part of culture.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.200
So if you grow up in
the Baptist church,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.050
and you hear everybody
clapping, you're like, OK,

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.910
this is where it is.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.230
But if you don't grow up
in the Baptist church,

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.990
everybody might be on that beat,
and you're on the other one.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.380
And I said, why
are they beating--

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.660
because Europeans use one
as their metric reference

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.830
of rhythm.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.010
So Europeans clap on one.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:13.120
Africans also couple on
one, for different reasons.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.170
So why are
African-Americans, who

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:22.100
started clapping on two
and four, not on one?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.650
So the reason for that is
because I found out that when

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.070
these Africans came here and
they started beating on that

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.867
wood-- which is where
the term rap comes from--

00:29:32.867 --> 00:29:33.700
things would happen.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.275
You know, the stopwatch
would catch fire,

00:29:36.275 --> 00:29:37.400
so everyone would run away.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.316
Somebody get poisoned.

00:29:38.316 --> 00:29:40.550
So very quickly
in North America,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.020
in the plantations of the
South, plantation owners

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.690
took the drums away from them.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.490
That's why in American music--

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.070
unlike South American music
or Central American music--

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.880
it's very hard to hear even
the sounds of percussion.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.550
I think we only hear in
mainstream American music

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.300
the sound of percussion
around the '60s when there

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.450
is a resurgence of a
national sense of pride

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.110
with respect to Africa
in the music of Motown.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:08.120
I think Marvin Gaye we
hear some percussion.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.320
I think in the music
of Donnie Hathaway

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.835
we hear some percussions.

00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:17.570
But very quickly after the
'70s, and certainly by the time

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:23.780
of the '80s, that ethnicity
of sound is relegated to--

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.391
is taken over by the computer
and by the synthesizer.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.880
So in my studies, I started
looking, and I said,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.720
there's got to be a
fundamental reason why

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.250
Americans as a whole--

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.640
why African-Americans
drove an entire nation

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.240
to clap on two and four.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.870
Because when I would take
Africans to a jazz club,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:51.440
and they would listen to that
double base going [RHYTHM]

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.100
and African-Americans
would be [RHYTHM]

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.630
And then they would look
at the African over here,

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.440
and the African-Americans
would look

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.399
at these African
populations and say,

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:03.690
why are they on the wrong beat?

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.730
Well, we know they have
rhythm, so that can't be it.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.580
Well, what happens is that
when Africans are listening

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.040
to sound, the
subdivision of time

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.930
is always ternary, meaning that
they're subdivided by three.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.260
So when they're hearing
the bass going [RHYTHM],,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.065
they're actually
hearing [RHYTHM]..

00:31:25.065 --> 00:31:27.530
That's what they're hearing.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.230
Which is where that notion
of swing comes from.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.775
Ellington said, it
don't mean a thing

00:31:35.775 --> 00:31:36.670
if you ain't got that swing.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.190
And that's what
he's referring to.

00:31:41.209 --> 00:31:43.250
And I started looking at
the West African rhythms

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.730
in general, and particularly
the rhythms of Mali.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:52.180
And 99% of the West
African rhythms

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.850
are sequentially created.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.760
Technically they call
that poly-rhythm.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.160
But they really are sequences.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.280
And what happens is that when
you listen to this rhythm--

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.810
and we are going to do a
little exercise together--

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.190
you can hear-- these rhythms
go like this [RHYTHM]..

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.610
And if you put that
in the context of four

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:24.230
beats per measure, which is what
the missionaries in 1650, 1660

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.780
brought to Africans
in the plantations,

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.970
and you're starting
to do [RHYTHM]..

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.440
So you're going to do--

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.060
do this with me.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.060
One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.110
So keep doing it.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.253
Three, four.

00:32:41.253 --> 00:32:41.752
[RHYTHM]

00:32:49.895 --> 00:32:52.630
And you're going to
hear that the accents--

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.310
[RHYTHM]---- end up
on two and four.

00:32:59.481 --> 00:32:59.981
[RHYTHM]

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.350
So now the pulse becomes a
reference point, as opposed

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.930
to the one.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.840
Africans are hearing [RHYTHM]
and they're thinking [RHYTHM]..

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.460
And so West Africans were
stripped of their percussion.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.510
They were stripped
of the instrument.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.850
But they never lost a pulse.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.120
And so any music that
was given to them,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.630
they re-inserted
that pulse there.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.480
So much so that when
the missionaries bring

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.040
Christianity, and
they're singing

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.750
the hymns of the old
Church of England,

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.600
the Africans are
listening to the way

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.920
these Europeans are singing,
and they say OK, we're

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.260
spiritual by nature.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.310
We will embrace Christianity.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.510
And we'll sing these songs.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.330
But we're not going to
sing them like that.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.860
That's that not our expression.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.980
We're going to sing it this way.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.280
And the way Africans express
their music was so shockingly

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.360
different from what
European experience was

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.520
that the same hymns that they
were singing at First Baptist,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.914
they called that
negro spirituals.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.190
And that right there
gives you a sense

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.310
that these populations
from West Africa

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.850
were bringing that
sense of expression

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:43.650
and a sense of delivery and a
rhythmic impetus and necessity

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:49.120
which was so important to
their old sense of identity

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.420
that it was reflected in
any music that they touched.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.310
And so when you look
at American music,

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.880
and when I was listening
to Bobby Byrd--

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.330
and this was labeled
American music--

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.060
I was like, yeah, it's
uniquely American.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.130
Sure.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:17.620
But the aesthetics that
fed that foundation

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.175
could only have come
from the Western part

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.690
of the continent of Africa.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.960
And these rhythmic markers,
which are accompanied

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.250
by these colors of the blues--

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.360
which by the way, the church--

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.130
in particular, the
Catholic church

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.910
was going to label notes of the
devil, and things not to play.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:51.720
These colors made me realize
that music is an expression

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.745
of cultural power.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.450
And it's really important
to understand that.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:10.550
And as such, it is extremely
difficult in the context

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:17.860
of a majority population to
accept that it is its minority

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.260
population--

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.420
i.e.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:26.100
African-Americans-- who gave
the majority population the art

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.560
form for which it is
known all over the world--

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.590
i.e. jazz.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.650
It was jazz that was born
at the roots of the delta,

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.140
into blues, into the
music of Al Strong,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.640
into the music of Ellington,
into the music of Dizzy

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.612
Gillespie and Charlie Parker
and to the music of Miles Davis.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:52.520
And the context for this was
always a political context.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.310
It is Europeans--

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.600
European scholars--
who told Americans,

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.930
stop playing classical music.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.040
You have an art
form of your own.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.560
You have to go to the
other side of the tracks.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.450
Because we studied.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.400
Europeans had the benefit
of being more expansive

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.500
and being an older civilization.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.600
You have people like
Ravel and Debussy,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.740
who are scholars in music.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.900
They study this music
coming out of the South,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.670
and they're like, whoa.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.530
They write it down.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:30.750
They see the complexity of the
work of Ellington and Strayhorn

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.520
and King Oliver and Armstrong,
that they start saying,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.430
there is something
going on here.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:42.990
So much so that
Europeans as a whole

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.540
stopped playing their music.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.020
And little kids-- particularly
the British kids--

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.070
are going to go and study
this music of the South,

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.560
the music of the delta.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.960
And thus are born the Beatles
and the Rolling Stones and Led

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.540
Zeppelin.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.630
And even the bands
from England who

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.270
dealt with the
history of the blues

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:15.480
and this idea of modern sounds.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.270
There's a band
called Pink Floyd.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:23.190
Did you know that Pink
Floyd was a cult name that

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:29.230
would tell band members whether
or not you were experienced?

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.670
Pink Floyd is named after
two great rural blues

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.940
singers of the
American South, one

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.110
named Pink Anderson and the
other named Floyd Council.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.690
So Europeans are so taken
by this music coming out

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.400
of the other side
of the Atlantic

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.740
that all of a
sudden, they forget

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.942
about the music of Handel.

00:38:53.942 --> 00:38:55.650
They forget about the
music of Beethoven.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:02.370
They delve into American music,
into the roots of this music

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.610
coming from the South.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:13.020
And that's why we got to this.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.020
Now, I want to play
for you that instrument

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.110
called the ngoni in a
contemporary setting

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.310
in West Africa.

00:39:37.262 --> 00:39:40.214
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.070
When you listen to
this music carefully,

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.745
you can hear the
swing of a jazz band.

00:41:14.745 --> 00:41:15.244
[RHYTHM]

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:25.970
That pulse is what gave American
music its unique marker.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:31.270
And that pulse is
what Africans never

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:39.480
lost in the evolutionary process
of their journey in America.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.520
Now, some people
say, do you have

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.910
to be Africans to
have that pulse?

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.040
So let me tell you something.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.640
In Senegal, we have
European Americans

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.760
who have been there for
several generations.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.730
And there's these two little
blonde kids in my neighborhood

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.910
who had never been to France.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:00.870
They grew up with us.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.340
They heard those percussions.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.670
They heard those pulses.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:09.830
And they would go to the
traditional dance parties

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.660
and they would
dance just like us.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.540
And French people coming from
France would look at them

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:22.090
and say, how come they
can dance like this?

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:26.922
So really, it's more
culture than nature.

00:42:26.922 --> 00:42:28.630
It's really important
to understand that.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.680
Why?

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:36.370
Because I believe that we
haven't studied enough what

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.750
happens to the developmental
brain of a child

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.740
in his mother's womb.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.736
If you live in Africa and
you hear these percussions

00:42:48.736 --> 00:42:52.580
and you hear these
pulses for nine months

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.130
before you come
out, when you come

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:59.780
out regardless of your racial
makeup, you're swinging.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.910
You are swinging.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.140
Because it's ingrained.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.120
It has become part of you.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.590
So that's my talk for today.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.020
I want to leave some
time, because if you

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.755
have some questions, I'd
be happy to answer them.

00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:20.665
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.070
AUDIENCE: So earlier
on you showed a clip

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.900
where the gentleman
was playing--

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.435
I can't remember the name of
the instrument, the guitar.

00:43:30.435 --> 00:43:30.780
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: Ngoni.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.696
AUDIENCE: Ngoni, yeah.

00:43:31.696 --> 00:43:32.760
It is like a banjo.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.470
And you or him was mentioning
that this was an instrument

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.480
given to the warriors.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.890
So I'm wondering--

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.660
I play guitar in classic
rock music, Led Zeppelin,

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.330
that kind of era stuff, right?

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:49.680
And of course, the guitar is
often referred to as an axe.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.690
I'm wondering if
in your research

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.990
you came across the etymology
of that use of the word axe

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:58.830
for guitar, and if there's
any kind of correlation,

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.470
relationship between
these warriors having

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.780
this axe-like instrument.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.120
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: It's a
really interesting question.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.036
You know, it's interesting
you're saying that,

00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:10.300
because at the club,
we have jam sessions

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.580
on Mondays and Wednesdays.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:17.510
And at the jam session, when
the guys bring their instrument,

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.970
I greet them at the door.

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:21.250
I say, I see you've
brought your weapon.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:29.610
So yeah, I think
you definitely can

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:37.050
think about it as an element of
representation of your power.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.320
Because an instrument
does nothing.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.430
It is what you do with it.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.892
I mean, everybody plays
guitar, but guitar players

00:44:44.892 --> 00:44:45.600
are not the same.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:54.710
For example, the trumpet-- the
trumpet is a German instrument.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.830
But after Louis
Armstrong played it,

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.450
everybody wanted
to play like that.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.050
It became an
American instrument.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:06.180
So what you do with the
instrument is really--

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.430
this is what shocked Europeans.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.220
The piano, a
European instrument.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.170
But after they heard Art
Tatum, they said oh my god,

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.050
what's going on over
there in that country?

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.700
It became the standard.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.850
So what humans break--

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:27.620
it is the shear force
of their spiritual power

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.230
that makes that
instrument speak.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.980
And that's really
what's important.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:39.860
And that's why music speaks
to our common humanity

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.634
well beyond race.

00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:44.050
And the reason why
I'm saying this

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.170
is because what I found out.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.920
And I tell that to my students.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.810
You're only concerned about
race because you can see.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:03.250
And in my journey,
in my travels,

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:06.430
I truly believe
that race is a trick

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.120
that God put on humans to
see if they've developed

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.535
the intelligence of the heart.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.340
Because music allows you
to speak beyond vision,

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.620
because you're dealing
with sound wave vibration.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.520
And those are expressions
of your inner.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.430
And your inner is not a
function of your skin tone.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.170
That doesn't that
race is not important.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:36.350
Race is important,
because it defines

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.510
your social cultural
experiences.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.860
But it's just one
step out of it.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.649
I don't know if I
answered the question.

00:46:44.649 --> 00:46:48.870
AUDIENCE: That was
very [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.600
AUDIENCE: I think it's
really fascinating

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.830
the way you talked about almost
an evolutionary model of music,

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:58.520
the way different forms of music
are hybridizing with each other

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.910
and creating new forms, which
are then being mixed and picked

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.790
up by other people in
different countries

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.810
and then brought back.

00:47:08.274 --> 00:47:09.690
Is this something--
I mean, you've

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.331
talked a lot about tracking that
over the last couple hundred

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:13.830
years.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.510
But is that something
you think is

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:21.300
sort of fundamental to music,
that it has that life to it?

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.550
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: Yeah,
it's a very complex question

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:24.260
that you ask.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.890
And I'm glad you asked it.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:30.600
It's hard to answer
it quickly, but let

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.700
me try to come to it this way.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:39.520
What I described in this short
presentation and in my book

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.300
is essentially the history and
the social cultural journey

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.960
of a people over time.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.720
In the case of American
music, I looked at the history

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.610
of the African diaspora.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.330
That knowledge is
extremely important,

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:03.830
because when I look at
the history books today,

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:08.210
there is no reference to the
contributions of the West part

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:09.980
of the African Continent.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:14.030
And yet it is so present in
our mainstream every day.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:17.270
Just the fact that you guys
are doing that tells me you're

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:18.020
African.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.427
You just don't know why
or how come, but you are.

00:48:21.427 --> 00:48:23.760
The fact that you play in
major tells me you're African.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.320
You don't know why, but you are.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.410
The fact that you're using
those sounds in the blues

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.120
tells me you're African.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.490
Regardless of your
skin tone, it tells me

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.010
that you are Americans,
and therefore

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:38.090
that you've had that
African influence.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:42.650
Where it becomes tragic is
for young African-Americans--

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.370
particularly boys--

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:49.030
who get it to their teenage
years, and they rebel

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.320
against the system,
to have not been

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.540
given the benefit of knowing
that they actually come--

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:01.180
that slavery is a
bump on the journey

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.790
of the nations of Africa.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.720
It is not the beginning.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.670
And most young
African-American kids

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.720
are not taught
about these empires

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.650
of Ghana, the empire of
Mali, the empire of Somalia,

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.300
who've delineated the
standards of aesthetics.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:25.510
So when they look back, all they
see is slavery and a system.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:29.470
If they had the
chance to be given

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.970
a sense of chronological
history within a context that

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:37.270
is academically sound, then
that would give them the tools

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.180
to say OK, life is hard here.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.680
But you know what?

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.880
I come from great people.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.820
There's an entire
continent behind me

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.270
that contributed great stuff.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:51.750
And look what we did here
in America musically.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.520
I mean, you go to Singapore,
they have a jazz festival.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.620
I go to Scandinavia, they
have a jazz festival.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:02.440
You go to-- that comes
out of that community.

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.710
Giving them that sense
of historical perspective

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:11.050
and chronology would go
a long way to giving them

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:16.100
the tools to move forward in
life and say, yeah it's hard.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.550
It was harder for others.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.650
But we come from great stuff.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.850
We can overcome.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:26.410
We can contribute, and we
want to contribute positively.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:34.680
And so knowing where you
come from essentially

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.710
gives you the confidence
to overcome the obstacles

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.940
that you're going to find
being a minority in a majority

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.810
population.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.220
Because one of
the things that we

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.890
need to understand very
clearly about the friction

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.660
in the United
States, the friction

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.090
is black and white
because that's

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:58.260
the nature of the society.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.650
But if you look at Europe,
they have minorities who

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.820
have contributed enormously.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.180
For example in classical music,
every major classical musician,

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.910
whether it's Mozart or
whether it's Beethoven,

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:16.470
have said we've got our
ideas of the Gypsies.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.510
Musically, we would
go to Gypsy camps

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.460
to hear how they
played the violin,

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.060
and we would hear
those melodies,

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.980
and we're re-arrange them.

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.481
It's not black and
white over there.

00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:27.271
They are all white.

00:51:27.271 --> 00:51:28.880
The Gypsies are maybe
a little darker.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.520
But you know what I mean?

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.160
So it's frictions of minority
versus majority populations,

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.015
and you have those frictions
irrespective of skin tones.

00:51:37.015 --> 00:51:39.390
And it's really something
that's important to understand,

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.200
because a lot of people tend
to get lost in the race issue.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.840
And the race is an issue.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.390
But the social construct and
the friction of societies

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:49.280
has to be understood
beyond that.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.740
And the music tells you
things about societies

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.040
that the music books want.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:02.470
Say that when you
hear an American white

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:07.650
playing the banjo, if you have
knowledge, you're like wow,

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.080
this is how that
instrument from Mali

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.360
came into his own expression.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.490
And understanding that and
having that perspective

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:21.840
is what allows you to overcome
social cultural realities that

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.040
are very relevant.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this music
guy is a cultural superstar.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.900
And then one other
thing is when you

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.310
talked about what was happening
in the European music,

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.740
I used to sneak up and sit
in your classes unregistered,

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.900
because I was there
for the knowledge.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.630
And you introduced us to one
of the Three Musketeers, who

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.710
was a great musician.

00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:52.170
Can you talk to us, I think it
kind of balances in with what

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.310
you're saying in terms of race.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:58.020
When they asked John Coltrane,
does race have anything?

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.370
And he says, no, race has
nothing to do with it.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.280
There are people that are not
of the African race that'll

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.072
look to this music,
and they'll enjoy it,

00:53:05.072 --> 00:53:07.280
and they'll want to be a
part of it, and some of them

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.470
will contribute.

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.270
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: These
are difficult questions,

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.300
but you should know that
this is the Archbishop

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.160
of the Church of St.
John Coltrane was here

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.900
in the audience.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.160
So I want to--

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.910
let me say this.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:26.030
What I have said is that
African-Americans created

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.010
an art form in the
United States that

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:33.500
lifted this nation to the
status of a cultural superpower.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:37.520
And we see that crystallization
of reality in the period

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.310
that we call the
Harlem Renaissance.

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:42.860
This is a time where--

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.590
prior to the Harlem
Renaissance, America

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:52.010
was looking to Europe for a
high standard of aesthetics.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.350
People were trying to dance
the way Europeans danced.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.570
People were trying to
play music the way--

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.880
after the Harlem
Renaissance, after Al Strong,

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.840
after Ellington, after Lindy
Hop, all of that was gone.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.440
Americans have found a sense of
identity within their culture

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.550
through this art form.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:13.670
And Europeans may choose
to dance this way,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.850
but now Lindy Hop is
the way Americans dance.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.450
And you guys are young here, but
you guys think you can dance.

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:21.280
You cannot dance.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.090
Go see your grandparents.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:26.270
They were dancing at a time when
they didn't have health care.

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:29.120
And when you see what they
were doing with Lindy Hop,

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.690
it's amazing.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:34.330
In tempo rhythm, people
actually play instruments.

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:36.050
Not computers doing beats.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.480
And that's why I was saying
after the Harlem Renaissance,

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.500
Europe looks to the United
States for direction in music,

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:55.280
in the way in which
we organize music,

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.930
in the structure of composition.

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:04.320
And that's why I
tell my students,

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.630
if you don't get an A in
the jazz history course,

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.690
we cannot give you a passport
to get out of the country.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.960
Because you go to
Europe, and they

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.080
know more about
Ellington and Strayhorn

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.570
and Benny Goodman and
Grant Miller than anybody

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.330
I can actually quiz
somewhere on your campus.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.070
I can tell you that.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:30.620
That's how important
that art form became,

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.370
not just to the United States--

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:36.810
because we're the one who
actually look at it the least--

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.790
but elsewhere.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:42.330
Because they realized--
when you're a trumpet player

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.730
and you hear Armstrong, and
you pick up that instrument

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:49.560
and you try to play, you realize
that the gap between your skill

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.940
set and his is the size
of the Grand Canyon.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.881
And everybody wants
to get over there.

00:55:57.881 --> 00:56:00.380
And that's why this art form
is so important to this nation.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.370
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that there isn't a lot of books

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:14.290
that talk about this history.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.350
And I was just
curious if you had

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.480
pointers besides your
book of other places.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.480
PASCAL BOKAR THIAM: That's
a very good question.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.760
So this is what happens.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.710
Knowledge is very
compartmentalizing.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.520
People will study history
where a professor of history

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:39.060
or a PhD in history, they know
about these empires of Ghana,

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.710
of Mali, of Somalia.

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:41.547
They know those.

00:56:41.547 --> 00:56:42.380
They know the names.

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.360
They know the leaders.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.240
But when it comes to
the general culture,

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.910
I can walk in virtually
every classroom in America

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.550
and ask a young
African-American kid,

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:57.560
have you ever heard
of these empires

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.520
from which you come from?

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.120
And the answer would be no.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.420
So we have not
integrated that knowledge

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:10.250
into public education period.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.390
Why?

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:16.860
Because frankly, slavery
is difficult to talk about.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.720
That's why.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.360
But you can talk about that
subject through the music,

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.670
because through the music, you
can watch almost any subject.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.640
And through the playing of
an instrument and saying,

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.970
OK, we're going to do some
music from the Delta blues.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.390
They could go back and now
listen to these guys from Mali,

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.490
they could go back.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:48.070
And they can seamlessly
find in their own space

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.320
the connection to that.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:56.300
But the actual academic
knowledge exists perfectly.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.030
You go to la Sorbonne they
have all these books about it.

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:03.130
But in history,
they're never applied

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:08.580
what that meant to the
development of a superpower.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.570
Because that's a little tricky.

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:15.040
People who write books
have a certain sense--

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.190
particularly in
academia-- of supremacy.

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:21.600
So it's difficult.
It's not an accident

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.830
if you look at the way in
which American music functions.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:30.570
In the literature, the first
person baptized King of Jazz

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:34.080
is a classical musician
who happens to be white,

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.737
who is a very
competent musician.

00:58:35.737 --> 00:58:36.820
His name is Paul Whiteman.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.860
He's the son of the great
conductor of the Denver

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.060
Orchestra.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.590
But he's not a jazz musician.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.140
But he loves the
music, and he's going

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:54.890
to ask a young Jewish
composer to go in Harlem,

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:57.770
listen to the music that
these people are playing.

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:00.560
And he comes back
with a piece that we

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.480
call "Rhapsody In Blue".

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.280
It's a real piece.

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.270
There is not a single
note of improvisation,

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:09.350
and it's not really jazz.

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:10.830
But it's an attempt.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:15.490
But in the literature today,
he's the Kind of Jazz.

00:59:15.490 --> 00:59:17.932
When African-Americans
hear that, they are upset.

00:59:17.932 --> 00:59:19.390
That's the generation
of Armstrong.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.190
Because Armstrong
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.880
and Freddie Keppard
and others before

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.420
have laid out the
performance for that.

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:30.790
They decide to create a new
style that they call swing.

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:36.830
And the father of that music
is an African-American chemist

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:38.860
by the name of
Fletcher Henderson, who

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.016
couldn't find a job in
chemistry, played the piano.

00:59:42.016 --> 00:59:43.390
And the nation
should be grateful

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:46.420
that he could not find
a job in chemistry.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:50.410
But when you look at the
way in which he articulated

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:53.980
the instrumentation, which
we call the big band,

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:55.870
if you play big band
music in America,

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:57.196
you play Fletcher Henderson.

00:59:57.196 --> 00:59:59.320
Because he's telling you,
OK, this is five trumpet,

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.200
this is how they work.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.074
This is four trombone,
this is how they work.

01:00:02.074 --> 01:00:04.714
This is five saxophone,
these are the rules.

01:00:04.714 --> 01:00:06.880
And if you apply my rules,
you'll have a great band.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.880
And if you don't, you
won't have a great band.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.790
And Fletcher Henderson
and Ellington, these guys

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.930
are out there doing it.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:19.330
And the new King of Swing
is Benny Goodman, who

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:22.280
is an absolutely fine musician.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.230
But he's not issued
from that community.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:30.360
So then young
African-Americans who

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.260
were playing in the big
bands were really upset.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.680
And they said now, we're
going to create a music that

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.615
is so complex melodically,
so fast technically, that it

01:00:42.615 --> 01:00:45.260
is going to require so much
mastery of your instrument,

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.950
we want to see if you're
going to be the king of that.

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:50.240
And they called a bebop.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.810
And guess what?

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:55.440
There's no king of bebop, except
the two guys who created it.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.970
And the industry said, we
don't want this music anymore.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.590
We're going to go
toward something that's

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:04.190
less convoluted, and
they turned their sites

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:09.640
to what was a black music
called rhythm and blues.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.120
And they look at what
Buddy Waters is doing,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.510
and Howlin' Wolf, and Chuck
Berry-- who just passed--

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:19.000
and Little Richard--
who's still alive--

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.150
and they say, oh, we
can deal with this.

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:26.050
And that's how Elvis
Presley comes in.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:29.810
His first songs we're
literally Little Richard songs.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:31.740
So he's the king of that.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.760
So there was this
replication, which

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.450
is a function of that friction
that exists between minority

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:41.160
groups who have to create
something when they need

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.350
in a majority situation in order
to retain a sense of identity.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.900
And the majority will
look at what they create,

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.470
and eventually if they like it,
they're going to take it over.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:55.380
So as long as you understand
that that's a process,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.490
you can avoid paying
bills to your psychologist

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:59.790
or psychotherapist.

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:03.450
Because it's going
to happen wherever

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:06.040
that context is present.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.420
If you are green in
a purple, and there's

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.330
five green for 20 purple,
you're going to have that.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.737
If you have 12
blue for 30 yellow,

01:02:16.737 --> 01:02:17.820
you're going to have that.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.790
It doesn't really matter.

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:25.120
These are the natural frictions
of minorities creating art

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.050
to get a sense of identity, and
a majority looking at that art

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:32.660
and deciding, yeah, we
like what you're doing,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.230
and we're going to take it.

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.930
Soul music.

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.010
Soul music was defining the
landscape of American music

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:45.050
between 1970 and '75.

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:50.010
The industry was desperate,
because European Americans

01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.730
could not work.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:58.530
And so they went and
recruited three guys out

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.360
of Nashville,
Tennessee who really

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.180
wanted to do country music.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.020
And they said, no, we
want you to write this.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.170
We're going to call it disco.

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:15.090
We're going to make a movie
called "Saturday Night Fever".

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:17.310
They found the worst
dancer in America.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.360
They put him in the
middle of the dance floor.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.790
I mean, this is a time after
which we've had "Soul Train".

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.956
I mean, have you seen those
dancers on "Soul Train"?

01:03:23.956 --> 01:03:25.150
Those guys were bad.

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:28.830
They get-- bless his
soul, what's his name?

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.000
John Travolta.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.920
You know that guy can't dance.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.650
They put him there,
and the Bee Gees

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:42.380
became for a period of time
this expression of the majority

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.340
population playing soul music,
playing the music of Motown,

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.440
playing the music
of Marvin Gaye.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.190
And Barry Gibbs, to his credit,
is an amazing songwriter.

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.690
But again, this is not
what they wanted to do.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.280
They wanted to
play country music.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.880
The industry said no, we
need you to get into this so

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.570
that we can compete.

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:06.040
Because music is an
expression of cultural power.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.160
So the majority is
always going to want

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.610
to be represented first.

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:15.150
And so once you understand
that, like I said,

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:18.151
hopefully that save you from
your psychotherapist bill.

01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:18.900
But it's not easy.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.850
OK, thank you very much.

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:27.900
[APPLAUSE]
