00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
I've been doing a lot of improv lately.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.680
And for those of you who don't know what improv is,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.840
Improv is when a bunch of people go on stage

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.340
with no idea what they're going to perform

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.940
and they perform.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.820
One of the most imperative rules of improv is

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.740
to say "yes and."

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.620
And that basically means you have to agree

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.760
to the circumstances set forth in the scene

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.080
and add to them.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.220
So if someone says:

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.520
"Mom, I really want to get another cat."

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.820
You shouldn't say:

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.220
"I'm not your wife.  I'm your mom.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.700
And if by cat you mean vagina, then I want a divorce!"

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.720
Now, what does that have to do with you and me?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.940
Well, it has forced me to realize

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.460
exactly how often I say "no" my real life.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.680
"Do you want to make love tonight?"

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.160
Uh, no.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.080
I say no without even using the word no.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.280
Hey!  Do you want to go camping this weekend?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.380
I've got a bunch of work/Netflix to do/watch so...

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.140
I say no out of fear.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.960
Hey, Anna?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.640
Hm?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.580
I've got an open slot on my comedy show

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.380
if you want to do some Stand-up (comedy) next weekend.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.480
Ahhhhhh!

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.500
Thanks though.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.340
I say no because I'm just too lazy.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.300
Are you sure you don't want to make love?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.800
No.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.200
It's been many moons.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.980
No I'm good.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.720
I'm good.  I'm solid.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.580
So something that I really want to start working on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.400
is to stop saying no and start saying yes.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.240
Because I started to think about all the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.080
experiences that I would have had

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.800
if I had not said no.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.400
And I'm not disillusioned, like I'm sure

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.640
if I said yes to all the experiences

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.760
some of them would be "meh" and some of them

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.240
would be downright terrible.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.180
But at least I would have had a really good story.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.080
And experienced more of life.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.180
So Brad and I actually host a monthly live show

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.180
called the "Last Comedy Show" at Nerdmelt.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.140
And at the last show I did stand-up (comedy)

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.060
as my Japanese character.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.740
And after the show I usually do like a little meet-and-greet

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.480
and someone asked me to please do

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.260
the Japanese character the next time I have to do an ad

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.160
because she is missed.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.800
So, here it is.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.560
