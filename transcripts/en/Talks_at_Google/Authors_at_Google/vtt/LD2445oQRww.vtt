[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.628 --> 00:00:08.080
SPEAKER: I don't want to make
the assumption that everyone

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.700
knows what Reddit is.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.140
I think most of this room will.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.770
But I thought there was a
really great quote in your book

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.580
that kind of described it.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.710
So I want to describe it
from the book that you wrote.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.084
And then I want
to hear your take

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:20.732
on how you would
describe it to someone

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:21.940
who's never been to the site.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.280
So the quote is, "Being
in love with someone

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.340
who has a constantly
expanding and mostly beautiful

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.929
multiple personality disorder."

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.220
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yes.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.960
SPEAKER: How would
you describe Reddit?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.230
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Well, in standard interviews,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.050
for folks who actually
have no clue about Reddit,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.830
I say, it's sort of a mirror
of the entire internet.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.530
It's kind of a
bulletin board site

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.480
with everything under the sun.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.890
It's got the day's news.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.750
It's got every shiny meme.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.100
It's got every conspiracy
theory, anything

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.887
you can imagine, you know?

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:56.470
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.970
So let's dig into--

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.710
you're a full-time journalist.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.290
When did you decide to take
on the challenge of a book?

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.420
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Well, so this

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.600
is kind of a funny
story, because I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.490
took on the idea of
this book before it

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.990
was a good idea for a book.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.900
I mean, it was back in 2011.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.830
And I was a young journalist
working at "Inc." magazine.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.340
And I met with Alexis
Ohanian and Steve Hoffman

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.830
on a total whim at
South by Southwest.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.200
And they were, at
the time, working

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.040
on a site called Hipmunk,
which is a travel search

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.730
site like Kayak, only
it searches sites

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.340
based on the agony they
would induce on the user

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.340
rather than, say, price.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.690
And I wasn't that interested
in their little travel site.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.960
I was interested in the fact
that these two seemingly normal

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.974
guys built Reddit, which, at
the time, was in the news for--

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:51.640
I think it was--

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.764
I can't remember if it was
either jailbait or creep

00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:56.900
shots or a combination of both.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.950
But it also was sort
of known already

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.050
as the internet's
virality engine.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.997
It was something that,
when one of our articles--

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:06.580
as a journalist,
when an article would

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.495
reach the front page of Reddit
or even the top of a news

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:13.780
subreddit or something, it
would send so much traffic.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.750
We called it the
Reddit hug of death

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.330
that it would
cripple our servers,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.830
but, you know, give
so much traffic.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860
So I wanted to know
more about Reddit.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.220
And I didn't get to know
that day, all the stories.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.440
But turns out, Alexis Ohanian
lived in Brooklyn, as did I.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.152
And we were able to meet
up on Atlantic Avenue,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:32.860
have some coffee.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.310
So I heard the whole story and
thought, this is fantastic.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.800
Just what they went through
in the first year of building

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800
it alone was such a
scrappy, great, garage

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.880
building-a-startup story
that I pitched them both.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.370
I pitched Steve and Alexis
on exclusively talking to me

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.910
for the purpose of a book.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.372
And so it's been years,
years in the making.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.830
SPEAKER: So you
kind of met halfway

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.120
through where it is today.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.920
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.187
And none of the crazy recent
stuff had happened yet.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:02:58.770
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.630
And you're at a place that it's
also a start-in-a-garage kind

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.160
of really interesting start.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.764
So when you started to
uncover the history of Reddit,

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:07.180
you started digging
into the book,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.880
what was that look-back
to that first,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.714
kind of, beginning years
of how this site spawned

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:13.630
into what it is today?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.005
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Right.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:18.550
Well, those are kind of the
nice, friendly, gentle times.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.600
And it was fascinating to look
back because you see the seeds

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.090
of how virality works and how
things-- just little ideas--

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.660
can take off online in ways
that we had never seen before.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.250
So I mean, from one of--

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.431
Reddit has two magic
secret sauces, right?

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:36.430
They're not even secret.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.850
But there's the algorithm
that powers the front page

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.700
and everything on the
site, from every comment

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.310
and how the threads
are threaded,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.050
to just how stuff
bubbles to the front page

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.900
and how much time it is
allotted to stay there.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.680
Then, that's coupled with
the fact that moderators--

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.800
well, basically anyone on the
planet can start a subreddit.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.230
But then, you have to
take on the responsibility

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.320
of running that thing.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.650
You are responsible
for its content

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.560
and for maintaining the rules of
that little fraction of Reddit.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.600
So having thousands
upon thousands

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.719
of volunteer moderators paired
with that algorithm, I think,

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.010
is what made Reddit so special.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.970
And then it allowed us to
see, in the early days, things

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.000
like--

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.170
there was this great story
called Mr. Splashy Pants.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.350
Are any of you guys familiar
with Mr. Splashy Pants?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.850
OK.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.750
If you've heard
Alexis speak, you've

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.430
heard this story, probably,
because he loves to tell it.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.490
But it really was one
of the first moments

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.120
where you could see, OK, this
formula on Reddit is working.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.760
And when something
becomes popular on Reddit,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.450
its ready for mainstream
viewing by everyone else.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.770
What had happened was
Greenpeace decided

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.170
to-- they were trying
to just basically build

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.800
some community online
around whale support

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
and earn money for tracking
more whales avoiding

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.050
Japanese harpooning.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.650
And they decided to open up
a contest for the internet,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.750
in general, to name a whale.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.460
And there were beautiful names
that people had submitted.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.220
I think one was
Kaimana, which means--

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.350
I forget exactly.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.370
It means something.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.040
It means, like, lovely
creature of the sea.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.880
And someone posted
to Reddit, hey,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.670
Greenpeace is doing this
campaign to name a whale.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.966
Let's name him
Mr. Splashy Pants.

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:29.840
Go to the site and vote
up Mr. Splashy Pants.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.509
So of course,
redditors did en masse.

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.550
So did people from 4chan.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.420
So did lots of folks.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.230
And Greenpeace was
not happy about this.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.220
But Mr. Splashy Pants did win.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.310
And then for a while, Greenpeace
had a really good merch

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.700
business on its
hands with that one.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.707
SPEAKER: So we'll get into some
of the virality of the site

00:05:51.707 --> 00:05:53.540
and some of good and
bad that comes with it.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.352
But looking back at,
from where it started

00:05:56.352 --> 00:05:58.810
to where it is today, what was
the part of the history that

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.961
surprised you most?

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.460
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Well,
I mean, the business story.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.230
I'm a business journalist.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.730
The story of Reddit sustaining
itself through the years

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.120
was just consistently the most
surprising and fascinating

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.760
story to me.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.990
I think that's one that's
little known, as well.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.440
So Reddit was acquired
just more than a year

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.550
after it was created.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.050
It was acquired by Condé Nast
whose parent company is Advance

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.420
Publications.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.360
They're known for their
shiny, glossy magazines.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.430
Now, Reddit is not that.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.120
But it was acquired for a
little more than $10 million.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.770
And after that point, Reddit
was put into the "Wired" office

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:39.760
in San Francisco.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.060
The guys moved out there.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.160
There's four to six of them at
a time in a little conference

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.050
room in "Wired."

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.020
And they were sort of left to
build the site on their own.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.740
And miraculously, that worked.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.550
The Newhouse family that runs
Condé was pretty hands-off with

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.870
them.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.942
They had quarterly
meetings and shared goals

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:02.900
and that sort of thing.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.010
But otherwise, it was just
left to its own devices.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.010
And somehow, it worked.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.170
When Steve and Alexis, the
two founders, left Reddit,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.730
it worked.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.910
There was amazing growth in
the year after they left.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.890
When Condé Nast spun out
Reddit from Condé into Advance

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.470
Publications, basically allowing
it to operate like a Silicon

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.350
Valley company
and take VC money,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.420
which it subsequently
did, that still worked.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.440
They got a new CEO.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.100
They just put in a total
outsider named Yishan Wong.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.974
And the site kept growing
and growing and growing,

00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:39.140
and even operating under a
different business model.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.560
So watching that unfold, I
think, it was just incredible.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.061
And Yishan made some very
bizarre business decisions

00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:47.810
during his tenure.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.520
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.103
That was going to
be my next question.

00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:53.380
So when Alexis and
Steve left, there

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.150
was a period where
he was in charge.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.400
And there's a lot in the book.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.780
And the book goes into
the history of everything,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.900
so I highly recommend it.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.520
What were some of
those decisions

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.450
that they had to turn back
that you kind of uncovered?

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.610
And now, with looking
at where they are today,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.216
how that section of the business
really took it to, again,

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:13.090
where they are today?

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.420
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.169
Well, I think the
funniest one is actually

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:19.840
before Yishan came
in, when the guys were

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.370
unable to hire anyone.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.620
There were four guys just
basically working on Reddit.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.270
And they wanted anyone.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.280
They wanted just
another programmer.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.240
And Condé Nast told them, well,
if you bump up your revenue,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.710
make $1 million for us next
year, you can hire someone.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.510
And they were just looking
at each other like, what?

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.559
And so instead of just
shuffling their feet,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.830
they decided to wait for a
summer Friday when they assumed

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.920
that most Condé executives
would be off in the Hamptons.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.300
And they launched a thing
called Reddit Gold, which

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.810
basically allowed people
to give them donations.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.310
It was sort of a
subscription model.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.476
But there wasn't-- they
didn't really offer anything

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:01.390
in exchange for the money yet.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.640
And they turned the thing on.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.910
And nobody at Condé was pissed
because they didn't notice

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.410
at first.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.780
But by Monday, they had raised
so much money that no one

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.524
at Condé was upset.

00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:15.440
So it actually worked.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.700
And I mean, I--

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.830
a funny-- a little
known fact about this--

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.710
Steve Hoffman, who's
the CEO of Reddit now,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.760
was not at Reddit at the time.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.200
And he told me later,
much, much later,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.700
when I was asking
him about this--

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.222
he said he was
watching from afar.

00:09:32.222 --> 00:09:34.430
And he thought it was a
little embarrassing that they

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.357
had stooped to this level.

00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:37.690
These guys were all his friends.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.220
But they turned on Reddit Gold.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.130
And I said, well,
it worked though.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:48.280
And he looked at me and said,
well, it didn't not work.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.200
SPEAKER: So that's
an interesting piece.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.360
A lot of when you read
the book, you realize

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.950
that it doesn't
seem like everything

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.000
was always very
well thought out.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.730
It was more of a-- they
kind of had to just roll

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.700
with what happened.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.043
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Right.

00:10:00.043 --> 00:10:00.386
Yeah.

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.011
SPEAKER: How do you
think that-- again,

00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.920
how does that shape where
we are today in the business

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.880
side of the history?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.530
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Well, I actually think more

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.780
interesting than the business
side of the history is--

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.080
and I can get to that too-- but
is the social side of things.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.860
How did it shape
internet culture today?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.830
And how did it shape
what Reddit became?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.246
I mean, you think
about how Reddit

00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:20.430
was founded as sort
of this freedom

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.570
from the press, a place
where users have the power

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.730
to upvote and downvote
things and determine

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.690
what's on the top of every home
page rather than an editor.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.990
That, sort of, was
taken to its extreme

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.840
by this community, which
was left to its own devices

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.220
during those years.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.320
And users on the site loved to
push and prod at those limits.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.190
What was the limit
of free speech?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.910
What is the limit of
what we can get away

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.860
with in terms of gore and
anything-- pornography,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.410
and animal abuse,
like, a highway crash?

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.870
It's like, what's the
limit of what's allowed?

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.860
And that's why,
during those years,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.080
the community spiraled
out of control at times.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.700
On the business
side, I would say,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.850
Reddit's kind of been in debt
to itself for years, right?

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.690
As soon as--

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.020
Steve Huffman came
back more than,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.940
I guess, three years ago as CEO.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.170
And he still has his work
cut out for him, right?

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.420
The site had taken $50 million
in venture capital at that time

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.700
and now has taken
a great deal more.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.200
But he had to hire
up from something

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.600
like 20-some people, after a
bunch left after he returned,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.990
to the more than
400 it has today.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.880
And that's before you
even start working

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.300
on those noxious content issues
and building in really reliable

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.934
advertising to the site.

00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.600
SPEAKER: So I want
to pivot a little bit

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.460
to another player
besides-- obviously,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.917
Alexis and Steve
are the main two.

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:53.250
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.606
SPEAKER: There's one who kind
of weaves their way in and out

00:11:54.606 --> 00:11:55.890
of this book a lot,
almost to the point

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.050
where you got to remember
it's not fiction--

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.990
is Aaron Swartz.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.490
So what was his role early on?

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.850
And then obviously, he
kind of had a sad ending

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.190
with suicide towards the
end of his time with Reddit.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.470
It's a big part of his story.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.070
So what was it like hearing
people talk about his time

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.160
at the company?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.868
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
I have to say,

00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:23.430
as a reporter, that was one of
the most interesting threads

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.310
to pull, and then, as a
writer, one of the most

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.822
complicated stories to tell.

00:12:28.822 --> 00:12:30.780
One of the great things
about writing this book

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.280
was that every person in it
is a super complex character.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.810
Nobody is as they seem on
the surface at first, right?

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.670
Because you've got
Alexis Ohanian,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.370
who's a great showman
and a charismatic dude.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.220
But he's gone through some
really troubling times

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.340
personally.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.270
And then you've got
Aaron Swartz, who--

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.860
I always held him up as sort of
this early internet wunderkind.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.700
He was this great
hacker with a heart.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.170
And he obviously
had a tragic end.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.240
And I thought this was
a fascinating story.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.060
But then I started to hear
about the early days at Reddit.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.470
When he was just 19
years old, he basically

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.210
stumbled into
working for Reddit.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.949
Paul Graham, who
started Y Combinator,

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:18.990
suggested that he started
working with those guys

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.240
because his own startup
sort of floundered.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.370
And he did.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.750
And he and Steve rewrote
the site into Python.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.170
And then, after that, I
started hearing that he just

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.290
sort of gradually
stopped working on Reddit

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.450
and started writing
a book on childhood

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.000
development in his room.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.990
And this all--
their relationship

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.460
got really fractured.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.430
And I thought, god, this
is such a tricky story

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.150
to write because he's
someone so beloved.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.650
And then to hear that--

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.830
I heard from many sources that
he was one of the reasons that

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.710
they sold the company so
early, is they couldn't--

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.200
they all couldn't
work together anymore.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.561
And then Aaron left shortly
after the acquisition.

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.560
It was sort of amazing
that he even stuck around

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.720
that long, I learned.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.920
And I do think he loved Reddit.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.670
I do think that part of
Reddit's original spirit--

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.160
and it's sustaining.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.710
Its spirit to this day was sort
of that hacker with a glint

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:25.550
in his eye, that trouble-maker,
information-wants-to-be-free

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.830
sort of activist
behind a screen.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.230
And you can see a
little bit of his sense

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.410
of humor and his
passion still in the way

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.730
the site thinks today.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.840
Similarly, you can see Steve
Huffman's sense of humor

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.830
in the site--

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.010
that trollish, nothing is
as it seems on the surface--

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.619
that's Steve, for sure.

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.660
SPEAKER: So you mentioned
the complex characters.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.182
As you interviewed a lot of
different people for this book,

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:53.640
how did you piece
together what you

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.920
would hear from the person
versus what you're hearing

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.900
from somebody else
explaining, sometimes

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.180
the same story, but hearing
very different things,

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.559
to kind of piece together
what was the reality?

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:04.600
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Well, as a journalist,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.380
there are certain layers of
how deep you can go, right?

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.710
If I'm just working on a
daily news story or something,

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:18.140
I just take what is said and
what is facts at, kind of,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.680
face value.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.720
When you're working on
a narrative like this,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.120
it's so much deeper
because you have

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.310
to try to get as
many perspectives

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.130
on a situation as possible.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.130
There are certain scenes
from the book that I was not

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.350
present at, that read
like I was present at,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.480
because I've spoken
to so many people

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.580
about that moment in time.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.950
There are others, by the way,
that I was not present at,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.040
that I simply could put together
from a photograph or a video

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.600
or something.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.330
It's amazing.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.746
This is a book
about the internet.

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:50.600
And the internet is just
riches of documentation.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.320
The research was so
fun and so interesting

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.720
at times because I could
see a photo from a day

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.720
and put it together with
what people had told me

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.610
and read someone's
blog post about it

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.890
and check out the Reddit
threads from that moment as well

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.160
and then piece
everything together.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.620
That said, not every
source agrees with itself.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.740
There were certain facts
that one person would just

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.780
disagree with.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.420
And because I was
reporting on things

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.640
at times that happened
12 years ago--

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.810
memories are all different.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:30.740
I learned so much about how the
human brain and memories work.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.300
Everyone is so
different in terms

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:38.940
of how they process information
and which pieces they retain.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.870
So I really had to
weigh heavily on people

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:47.600
whose memories were kind of
trust-- were lined up at times.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.960
And then I knew that their
other ones would line up as well

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.230
or I could weigh a
little more heavily.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.022
Or I could lean on
them more heavily.

00:16:56.022 --> 00:16:57.980
SPEAKER: So I want to
switch gears a little bit

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.430
to the social aspects
that you mentioned.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.695
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Sure.

00:16:59.695 --> 00:17:02.810
SPEAKER: Reddit's obviously--
has a very interesting social

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.800
aspect of it--

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.736
some good, some bad.

00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:07.069
I want to get into a couple
that you cover in the book--

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.390
some good, some bad.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.829
Which would you prefer
to go first, good or bad?

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:10.520
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Oh, I don't care.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.030
Up to you.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.480
Up to you.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:11.980
SPEAKER: OK.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.520
Let's start with the bad first.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.000
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
All right.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.050
SPEAKER: And then, we
will be a little bit more

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:15.869
uplifting after.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:21.020
I think the doxing, which
is sharing someone's

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.670
personal information online--

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.230
and I think the
moment that it really

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.140
highlights in the book is with
the Boston Bombing suspects.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.890
So what was it like looking
back on that national, almost

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.140
global history moment, and how
Reddit's played a huge part

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.640
in it?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.973
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:37.820
When the Boston
Marathon happened,

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.530
I was actually
working at CBS News.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.540
I was a writer for Katie Couric.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.602
And so if you're
in a newsroom, you

00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:47.060
sit with a computer
in front of you

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.250
and a row of TVs
above your head.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.580
And I sat there just
watching everything.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.500
And we were reporting
on it simultaneously,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.520
as everyone else was.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.630
And this was, I think, America's
introduction to Reddit.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.020
This was the time our parents
first heard about the site

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.810
because it was actually
a bunch of reporters

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.520
who were tweeting
stuff from Reddit

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.060
and spreading around little
bits of misinformation

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.390
that they didn't
know were unreliable

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.640
that fed, that kind of fed the
beast and fed that hype cycle.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.870
And the news moved
so fast that--

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.970
it was a tricky thing
because Reddit had actually

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.700
solved crimes in the past.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.380
It's the place where
you go if you get hit.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.420
If your vehicle's parked
and gets hit and run,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.378
and you've got a little
piece of the tail light

00:18:37.378 --> 00:18:40.020
of the other car, someone
out there on Reddit

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.581
will identify that.

00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:43.580
And you can give that to
your police department.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.750
That's happened so many times.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.660
So when it came to this higher
stakes situation with Boston,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.897
it was just horrifying to think
of that family that was hurt.

00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:55.730
I'm not sure if you
guys all know the story.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.460
But basically, a suspect
was misidentified.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.200
And it was a student named
Sunil who had disappeared

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.270
from his university.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.280
He looked--
physically, just kind

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.670
of resembled one of the actual
suspects, the actual brothers.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.940
And by the time--

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.710
his family was harassed.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.130
And they were already
in a place of mourning

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.040
for having their son
having disappeared.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.240
His body was later found
floating in a river

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.470
and in an unrelated death.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.910
So it was just this
horrifying thing

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.600
that Reddit sort of happened
to-- because of the nature

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.440
of that community and being able
to post anything anonymously,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.700
I think people got really
worked up about it.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.740
And I think the incident
really highlights

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.630
how difficult it is
to be a moderator

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.490
in a situation like that.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.530
Those moderators
were volunteers.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.301
They were-- by my
best estimation,

00:19:56.301 --> 00:19:57.800
I think a couple
of them were really

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.130
young students themselves.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.470
Trying to keep up with
those instances of doxing

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.400
and whatnot, it's
almost impossible

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.080
when people jump
on it so quickly.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.930
And I think it
raises the question,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.650
how do we do content
management and community

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.020
management in this modern era?

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.150
How do you manage that
kind of bandwidth?

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.550
Facebook has had this
question repeatedly.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.590
Twitter, obviously,
is grappling with it.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.800
And Reddit has a fraction of the
employees as those companies.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.010
It only has 400 and some.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.617
Is that weight all on
the volunteer moderators?

00:20:31.617 --> 00:20:33.450
SPEAKER: Well, I think
that's the other part

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.760
of the social, maybe,
bad is when there's

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.200
borderline illegal
or sometimes illegal

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.880
subreddits that have popped
up over the years that

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.410
can be started and how
moderators have to police that.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.993
And I know there's
an interesting part

00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:48.390
of the book of where they
had to almost make a decision

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.470
and draw a bright line.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.880
And can you speak to--

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.090
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.100
Which decision was it
that you're talking about?

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.590
SPEAKER: I believe it was
with the jailbait and some

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.377
of those other--

00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:57.960
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Well, is it

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.750
the first decision that Ellen
Pao made when she was-- yes.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.320
There we go.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.509
So after Yishan Wong left--

00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:06.300
by the way, that's one
of my favorite lines

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.509
in the book is that--

00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:09.050
and it's a direct
quote from Yishan--

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.740
that his story of
leaving the company

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.730
was unbelievable
because it's so weird.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:20.130
And after he left,
Ellen Pao became CEO.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.750
And she was already deep in
her "Kleiner Perkins" trial.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:30.201
She was set to testify while
she was at Reddit, and she did.

00:21:30.201 --> 00:21:31.950
And I think that
informed her a little bit

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.980
in terms of where we need to
start drawing lines online.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.460
And I mean, it's always been
a tricky issue for Reddit

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.590
because it's always been known
as a haven for free speech.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.260
And to say, no, we are
not, we are cutting off

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.800
these noxious communities, was
a really, really tricky thing.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.030
So she basically tasked
her head community manager

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.730
with identifying
five subreddits--

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.980
say, OK, we're just
going to cut them off.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.820
And one of them, most
notably, was fatpeoplehate.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.740
That was a very
sizable community.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.710
And so on that
day, they actually

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.190
did just make an announcement,
cut off the communities,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.460
managed those same
communities popping

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.590
back up under new names--

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.900
fatpeoplehate2,
wedislikefatpeople,

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.920
or whatever.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.850
It wasn't super savvy, but
of course, people tried.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.920
After they cut off the next
waves, then they did see--

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.310
and this was not until years
later that we could really

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.050
document it-- but
researchers have

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.210
found that the simple act
of cutting off those five

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.350
first subreddits has improved
the quality of speech

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.600
on Reddit throughout the site.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.370
You think of all this uncivil,
dis-civil discourse that's

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.450
been plaguing the
internet right now,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.770
it actually demonstrably
improved that

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.070
throughout the site.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.120
So years later-- and this wasn't
until I think a year or two ago

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.390
that this research came out--

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.860
it's shown that Ellen Pao did
accomplish what she set out to,

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.110
despite the crazy
backlash to it.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.410
SPEAKER: So let's switch
gears to something good--

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.630
the Reddit Gifts, which
is its own business.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.680
But I think the most recent stat
I saw was at the 10-year mark,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.680
it was $29 million
worth of gifts.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.050
How did that kind of--
again, the social impact

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.510
of that culture that was
self-created and then

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.840
turned into its own business
as a piece of the company.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.160
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Totally.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.493
SPEAKER: And it's got its own
really interesting history

00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:32.067
being in a separate location
and all those different pieces.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:33.400
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.031
So Reddit Gifts was actually
not created as part of Reddit

00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:37.530
at all.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.340
It was created by this guy named
Dan McComas out of his home

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.730
with his wife.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.200
And eventually, it became
such a load for him

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.660
to bear that he went
to Reddit and said,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.790
I can't do this anymore.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:57.440
And somehow, miraculously, they
convinced Condé Nast to also--

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.880
Reddit to acquire Reddit Gifts.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.060
And this just shows how crazy
and convoluted everything was.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.630
But I don't know why--

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.570
I mean, I do slightly, but
it's kind of a long story--

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.100
Reddit Gifts was
not allowed even

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.210
in the office to work with
Reddit after it was acquired.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:20.120
They were kept at a distance.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.530
That sort of flipped
at one moment in time

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.510
when Yishan recognized--

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.010
I think Yishan and Ellen
together recognized--

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.430
hey, this part of the
business could make money.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.680
They started
suggesting gifts to buy

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.020
and advertising on the market.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.150
They created a
marketplace for gifts

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.650
and actually started
to make money.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.120
By that time, Dan
and his wife had

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.236
moved to Salt Lake City,
because they were so

00:24:42.236 --> 00:24:43.860
starved of resources
that they couldn't

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.830
afford to live in San Francisco
anymore, which is crazy.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.670
I mean, I know it's an
expensive city, but--

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.480
so they're working in
a $300-a-month rented,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.140
little tiny space near a Dunkin'
Donuts where they're hearing

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.220
the drive-thru
voice all day long.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.590
And they start to manage to
make money for Reddit-- one

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.510
of the first times Reddit has
had significant actual income.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:13.590
But yeah, Reddit Gifts-- it's
like this very uplifting story

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.200
of individuals
creating what I call

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.240
the daisy chain of goodwill.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.880
You send a gift anonymously
to someone that you're given.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.760
You can kind of stalk
their social presence.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.562
You can check out
what they might like.

00:25:27.562 --> 00:25:29.770
And then that person, who's
also signed up for gifts,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.220
sends a gift to someone else.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.570
And yeah, it's massive.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.190
It's massive.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.840
SPEAKER: Another kind
of fun social one

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.930
is the Ask Me Anything
subreddit that's obviously

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.130
a really big piece of the site.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.520
I think-- are you going
to be doing one, correct?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:44.820
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yes.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.170
I'm going to do one on the 11th.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.070
You guys should--

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.436
SPEAKER: I mean, that
also has its own issue.

00:25:48.436 --> 00:25:49.477
It was run by one person.

00:25:49.477 --> 00:25:52.260
And then there was
someone working full time

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.330
bringing celebrities on
and bringing guests on.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.269
And now kind of just
spawned to what it is today.

00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:59.560
But the social good that has
come from that subreddit--

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.780
can you speak a
little towards that?

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.155
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Right.

00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:04.790
I guess I feel like AMA is just
Reddit's brightest, shiniest,

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.870
most celebrity-centric thing.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.590
It's a lot of people's
gateway to Reddit, itself.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.030
And I just, I love that every
scientist, and everybody

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.550
studying something super
niche, everyone who's

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:23.070
had a bizarre medical condition
or strange life coincidence

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.520
can just get on
Reddit and say, AMA,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.140
I had a bellybutton transplant.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:36.180
[LAUGHS] And over the years,
everyone from President Obama

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.483
to--

00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:38.089
I don't know.

00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:38.880
Who's the craziest?

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.580
What's your favorite AMA?

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.055
SPEAKER: I thought the Obama
was really interesting.

00:26:42.055 --> 00:26:42.380
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.320
SPEAKER: And some of
the bizarre medical ones

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.190
are really, really
interesting to read.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.060
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Right?

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.835
SPEAKER: But yeah, I mean, it's
just a rabbit hole to go down.

00:26:49.835 --> 00:26:51.168
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:55.200
I love that the vacuum repairman
was the most popular AMA

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.920
for so long.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.800
Because people just google
what's this valve in my vacuum?

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.370
And they come up with
the vacuum repairman

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.249
and can't take their
eyes away from it.

00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:07.790
SPEAKER: So let's pivot about
some more where they are today.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.915
So there's obviously a big
piece about the redesign

00:27:09.915 --> 00:27:14.610
of the site and the app and also
just the adding ads and just

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.320
kind of all the different
pieces of the business now.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.565
How did you take
where they are today,

00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:20.940
where do you think
they're going,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.300
and especially the
redesign piece, which

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.200
was a pretty big shift
for the business.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.550
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.940
So when I started
reporting on the book,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.550
Reddit had 20 employees, maybe.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.340
And they were spread out
over different cities.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.430
And so seeing, in
the last three years,

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.210
Reddit become a
legitimate big business,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.860
like a legitimate
Silicon Valley,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.710
fast-growing company valued
at more than $1 billion

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.540
has been super fascinating.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.910
I watched them switch offices.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.140
They're now at this big cool
office at 420 Taylor Street.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.580
And I mean, despite that it's
kind of in the Tenderloin,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.900
it's a pretty nice office.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:03.040
[LAUGHS] And Reddit was--

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.160
I think even two years
ago-- even one year ago,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.940
really-- it looked like 2005
had invaded your desktop when

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.590
you went to Reddit.com.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.930
My favorite quote about
the way Reddit looks

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.670
was from "Bloomberg
Business Week."

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.280
They said it had all the
aesthetic seduction of a phone

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.480
book.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.920
So dystopian Craigslist is
my other favorite description

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.846
of what Reddit looks like.

00:28:25.846 --> 00:28:27.220
But within the
last year, they've

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.780
undergone a site redesign
that's really kind of complete.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.740
It's taken every page and
turned it into something that--

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.650
when I was at South by
Southwest this last year

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.050
with Steve Huffman, on the
main stage, I asked him--

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.758
I was joking with him
about the redesign.

00:28:42.758 --> 00:28:44.196
And I asked him
what it was going

00:28:44.196 --> 00:28:46.570
to look like when it was done
because it wasn't done yet.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.350
He said, oh, it'll look
just like Facebook.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.520
Half the audience laughed.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.000
And then, there was kind
of a pause, like, really?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.800
And now, it honestly, it does.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.830
It's white and blue and movable
blocks of text and images.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.090
And you use the app.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.700
You see that it's a lot
of big squares of memes

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.130
and photographs and videos,
like, infinite scroll, super

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.990
fast scroll.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.480
So it's a new sort
of Reddit now.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.470
And with that
redesign, they would

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.420
like to retain some of
that original anarchist

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.390
spirit of Reddit.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:27.670
They want to retain some of that
Aaron Swartziness of it, right?

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.490
That I-- that rebel feeling.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.350
And so even during
the redesign, they

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.560
brought in a bunch of staff
from Microsoft and from--

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.142
where else did they
hire designers from?

00:29:39.142 --> 00:29:42.220
I forget the-- from big
companies basically-- people

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.790
who had done big tech
company designs before.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.040
And when Steve
Huffman was presented

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.640
with some of their
mock-ups for the new site,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.680
even he would bristle.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.650
He created that
original ugly Reddit.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.620
And redditors
themselves are very used

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.470
to this really tight design
where the site is cluttered,

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.380
and it's kind of ugly, and
they loved it for that.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.100
So it was a difficult process
just like any tech site

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.000
redesign.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.130
But Steve actually would
tell them sometimes,

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.960
can you just remove some
of that white space?

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.630
Or can you just chisel that
around the edges a little bit?

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.810
It looks too nice.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.460
So it's a work in progress.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.130
And as a company, they're
retaining the ability for users

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.000
still to revert
to the old design

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.450
so as to not alienate
users too, too much.

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.570
But that said, this
Reddit today is

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.290
trying to move into the future.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.750
It would like to be--

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.930
to have its users be a little
less anonymous, I think.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.990
You have the ability now
to create a profile page.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.120
And on that profile
page, other users

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.190
can see the top five
subreddits you visit.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.680
So there's a little
less anonymity,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.770
even when you're hiding
behind a username.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.040
So Reddit's opened up
the door for brands

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.830
to post, for media
companies to kind of get

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.810
involved more overtly.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.530
They would love for every
celebrity to have an account

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.500
and be super public.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.730
They would love for Elon Musk to
be not just tweeting or posting

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.260
his rocket videos on Instagram.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.360
They would love for
that content to come

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.640
to Reddit first and then
spread out over the web.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.770
So for Reddit to turn into more
than just kind of a melting pot

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.140
for the stuff of the internet
and a virality engine,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.420
they want to be the
originator of that content.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.120
And so that's what
we will be watching

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.505
over the next few years I think.

00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:30.880
SPEAKER: So your
book, obviously,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.780
is probably a to-be-continued
because there's obviously

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.387
an ending.

00:31:34.387 --> 00:31:35.720
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.170
As if I haven't been working
on it long enough, right?

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.211
SPEAKER: What's the one
thing that didn't make it

00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:41.434
into the book that you wish--

00:31:41.434 --> 00:31:43.600
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
There's a million things.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.641
There's a million things.

00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:49.230
I know way too much
about all of these guys.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.992
But there were some--

00:31:52.992 --> 00:31:54.700
I mean, there's such
great cultural stuff

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.658
that happens on Reddit.

00:31:55.658 --> 00:31:58.480
All the April Fools Day--

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.384
those little pranks.

00:32:00.384 --> 00:32:02.050
And I mean, they're
not even pranks now.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.630
They're full-blown
internet stunts.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.690
You remember Place,
where anyone could

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.150
put any pixel on a canvas?

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.832
And it was through this
cringe moment on the internet

00:32:12.832 --> 00:32:14.290
where everyone is
like, is it going

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.170
to be just swastikas
and penises?

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.090
Or is it going to be
a beautiful canvas

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.870
full of interesting thoughts
and different communities

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.890
coming together?

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.540
And we got to see sort of,
again, a mirror of the internet

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.040
happen.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.706
I had this very long scene about
that that nobody wants to read,

00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:31.220
I'm sure.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.540
And same with the button.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.490
I loved the button.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.460
I don't know if you-- do
you remember that one?

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.330
No?

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.580
SPEAKER: I do want to open
it up to audience questions

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.455
because I know we have
lot of people in here.

00:32:44.455 --> 00:32:45.790
So a lot of people line up.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.590
I will do a few
rapid fire real quick

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.420
while people are lining up.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.067
Favorite Reddit
scandal you covered?

00:32:51.067 --> 00:32:52.900
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Favorite scandal?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.400
Gosh, I didn't like any of them.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.170
I mean, I did.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.180
But they're all traumatizing
in their own way, right?

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.460
I mean, I think I did
some great reporting

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:06.047
around what's called amageddon.

00:33:06.047 --> 00:33:07.880
You guys may remember
when an employee named

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.120
Victoria Taylor was sort of
unceremoniously dismissed

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.840
from her role.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.480
And the internet snuffed out.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.240
Well, Reddit snuffed out.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.900
That was a great revolt of
moderators against the site

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.290
that they created
and that harbored

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.360
them and a fascinating moment.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.040
And I think it's one
of those things that's

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.080
a few years in the
past, but I sort of

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.689
figured out what
actually happened,

00:33:34.689 --> 00:33:35.980
what actually transpired there.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.390
So I guess that was kind of fun.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.651
SPEAKER: Favorite subreddit?

00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:41.900
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
My gateway subreddit when I

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.539
started reporting
was definitely--

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:46.580
well, there are a couple.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.330
I think showerthoughts
and mildlyinteresting

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.310
was my gateway.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.040
I just love the dumb photos
of, like, my gummy bear

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.940
has two heads.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.164
SPEAKER: Favorite AMA guest?

00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:01.830
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
I don't know.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.380
I love-- I mean,
Bill Nye, right?

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.760
Like, he used to be so good.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.650
Now he's not as great.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:11.560
But I don't know.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.920
There are so many good ones.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.480
Any time "The X-files" were--

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.210
they did so many repeatedly
good ones with Victoria.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.280
That was always great.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.196
SPEAKER: And last one.

00:34:22.196 --> 00:34:24.255
Sort by new or sort by popular?

00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:25.880
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
I mix it up.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.250
It depends what I'm
looking for, right?

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.750
You're always looking
for the best--

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.270
if you're a lurker,
you're looking

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.420
to get the best of
history of a certain time.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.644
So yeah.

00:34:38.644 --> 00:34:39.810
SPEAKER: A lot of questions.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.320
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Yeah, great.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.420
SPEAKER: So we'll
start over here.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.719
AUDIENCE: Reddit's not
entirely original, right?

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.780
We've had Slashdot, where
you could upvote comments.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.489
We've had 4chan, which
has also produced

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.440
a considerable amount
of viral content

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.380
and also is full of
terrible content.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.514
So why did Reddit succeed where
others before it had failed?

00:34:58.514 --> 00:35:00.290
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:04.070
Well, so Reddit was actually
designed after the Delicious

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.680
Popular page.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.930
I don't know if you know that.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.200
It was sort of just a clone
of that, which is crazy

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.360
because Delicious
didn't even make it

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.700
in a substantial way as its
original vision, at least.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:20.240
But I mean, Reddit was sort
of the best of all the worlds.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.090
And sadly, 4chan was
started by Chris Poole.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.640
He just couldn't-- he was
one guy working on it alone.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.980
He couldn't really sustain that.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.490
And it really spiraled way
the heck out of his control.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:40.280
So I mean, it was never
really a company either.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.190
He just didn't want it
to be, so that's fine.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.130
Reddit had enough
of a company to it.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:50.540
It had enough of a
backbone and just

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.419
such a great community of
moderators through the years.

00:35:53.419 --> 00:35:53.960
I don't know.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.410
I mean, it's amazing
that it made it, right?

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:00.420
There's so many times during
the book where, as a reader--

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.960
well, working on it, but
also reading it-- it's

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.300
like, how did it
possibly come through?

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.800
And that's one of
the main reactions

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.810
I'm getting to the book from
readers, which is why I stated

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.090
that answer in that weird way.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.770
It's like, how did
it make it through?

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.080
But yeah, by a hair it did.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.260
And there are still really,
really substantial challenges

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.717
I think that it faces.

00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:23.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.883
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yeah.

00:36:24.883 --> 00:36:27.382
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the redesign--

00:36:27.382 --> 00:36:28.340
very interesting stuff.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.220
So I want to say
about a month ago,

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.580
there was a post
on DataIsBeautiful.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.890
Obviously, there is
some response bias here.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.880
But it was a survey about use
of old.reddit versus www.reddit.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.420
And about 80% of responders
said they still use old.reddit.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.120
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Really?

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.880
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.590
AUDIENCE: So it
doesn't surprise you.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.006
And you've spoken
to these people.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:52.342
Why are they so confident
in it if 80% of responders

00:36:52.342 --> 00:36:53.800
say they still use
the old version?

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:53.970
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: I mean,

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.220
they're confident in
their own work, right?

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.490
I mean, they work there.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.980
Yeah, at one point
when I was interviewing

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:05.100
Steve Huffman on stage, he--

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.365
I think we were--

00:37:06.365 --> 00:37:07.740
I don't know what
I was talking--

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.250
it may have been a design thing.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.400
And I was speaking kind
of critically of it.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.910
And he said, well, hey,
come on, I work there.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:19.080
And they believe that they
need to move into the future.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.360
I think they've seen Reddit
kind of left in the dust

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.970
by the rest of the
internet in terms of design

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.740
amongst other things.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.750
Content was obviously
another area

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.390
where they were
slow to act and slow

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.220
to put into policy certain
behaviors that they needed to.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.500
So the redesign-- I
think it's simply--

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.240
Steve has a mandate
from his board

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.680
to get to 1 billion users.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.399
And I don't think he believed--

00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:42.940
I'm not sure.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.540
I don't mean to put words into
his mouth-- but he and his team

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.165
didn't believe they
could do it looking

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.810
like 2005 on your browser.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.230
AUDIENCE: Do you think the
2005 option will remain,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.950
even if it's not the default?

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:53.910
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Oh, interesting.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:54.360
I know.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.900
I know everyone wants
to know that, right?

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well, you have
a lot of insider information,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.470
right?

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.920
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: I don't

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.810
have that inside information.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.840
I will ask next time
I talk with them.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.620
Because--

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.868
I will reiterate the
question on the AMA.

00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.710
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Thank you.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.400
We should.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.910
And we can get spez
to comment, right?

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.394
Yeah.

00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:15.810
AUDIENCE: A lot
of the stories you

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:19.260
told seemed to illustrate some
of the moral hazards associated

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.380
with this really anarchic
internet presence.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.660
And I thought that the story
you told about Ellen Pao

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.300
was interesting because it says
that, actually, the leadership

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.758
of these sites can have a really
big influence on the kinds

00:38:29.758 --> 00:38:31.704
of communities that develop.

00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:33.870
And the leadership of other
large social media sites

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.172
have sometimes had great
influences on their communities

00:38:37.172 --> 00:38:38.130
and sometimes bad ones.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.136
And so I'm curious,
how seriously

00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:41.760
does the leadership
of Reddit right now

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.060
take the extent to which Reddit
has been involved in fostering

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.810
a modern, violently
misogynistic, white supremacist

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.389
movement, which has largely
developed in the shadows

00:38:51.389 --> 00:38:52.680
of Reddit and other places too.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.630
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: This
is a huge question on my mind

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.170
too.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:59.220
And I've tried to get down
to it through my reporting

00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.880
over the years.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.680
They will address it with
me, and we do talk about it.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.470
And I do think that
they have been--

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.720
they jumped on it
the obvious alt-right

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.180
subreddits fairly quickly.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.730
I mean, the stuff was
there, and it was brewing.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.380
But obviously,
The_Donald is just

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.700
this huge question for them.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.740
It's got more than
600,000 subscribers now

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.960
and still harbors in it's
network of adjacent communities

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.530
a lot of the worst stuff, like,
the worst speech we see online.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.980
And it's so tricky.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.580
I think that Steve still
believes that they have

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.410
a right to political speech.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.400
And now that we are in an era
where the things that the First

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.700
Amendment was meant to protect,
namely, political speech

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:57.610
is at times intersecting with or
the same thing as hate speech.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.030
These sites and
their leaders need

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.720
to address that and draw, I
think, draw firmer lines on it.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.350
I think that it's a huge
question for regulators

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:12.090
and for our government
as well, despite that

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.150
that's a tricky thing
that, in the business,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.490
you don't really want--

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.470
you don't know whether
you want to be regulated.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.420
It's something
that I think people

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.850
need to speak to
their representatives

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.910
about if they feel strongly
about it because it is not

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.567
happening at the pace that
speech is evolving online,

00:40:31.567 --> 00:40:33.150
whatever way you
feel about regulation

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.480
versus a business handling
this stuff on their own.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.020
But yeah, it's a
huge, huge issue.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.474
And it's still there, right?

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:44.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.848
This is really interesting
to hear about the business

00:40:46.848 --> 00:40:48.150
history of Reddit.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:53.760
So I think on subreddits
that aren't explicitly

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.510
female-oriented, there's
often an implicit assumption

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.302
that you're male.

00:41:00.302 --> 00:41:02.010
And comments can be
kind of quick to jump

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:03.912
to sexist or objectification
or something.

00:41:03.912 --> 00:41:05.745
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:05.745 --> 00:41:07.290
AUDIENCE: Was there
any discussion

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:12.000
inside about either making
the culture, by default,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.880
more neutral or
more female-friendly

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.589
or any sort of consciousness
internally about that?

00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:19.880
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Yes.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.600
There is a great
consciousness internally

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.530
that I've seen about it.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.260
I-- again, it's an
uphill battle for them.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:33.100
But still, I think 60% or more
of redditors are male, 65%,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.980
I think.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.230
And you can tell, right?

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.670
When you're-- even still.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.460
They've made a great effort
to reduce casual misogyny

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.830
on the site.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.500
And I think, for me,
I can look back now--

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.420
years ago, and I think it was
maybe five or more years ago--

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.910
the culture on the
site was so much worse

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.540
than it is now, that a
business manager of Reddit

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.540
in a casual press interview
encouraged all women

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.750
to completely stay away from
r/gaming because it was simply

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.210
too abusive.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.200
I mean, can you imagine that?

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.126
And today, even on
TwoXChromosomes,

00:42:12.126 --> 00:42:13.750
you can get harassed
for being a woman.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.754
It's crazy.

00:42:14.754 --> 00:42:16.170
I just saw, a
couple of weeks ago,

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.395
a woman posted something about--

00:42:18.395 --> 00:42:19.770
she was having a
really bad week.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:23.910
And then she scrappily
looked at a YouTube video

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.990
and fixed her parents' dryer
that was broken on her own--

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:29.700
went out and bought the part.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.670
And then you just have
people bashing her saying,

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.020
why would a woman even
try to do such a thing

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.580
and questioning her abilities.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.030
And the way Reddit is
set up with moderators--

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:47.790
volunteers being responsible for
keeping all of that content how

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.140
they see fit in their
little box of Reddit,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.750
it's so tricky to regulate
anything that's not strictly

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.530
hate speech.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.670
And they're still
drawing new lines.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.440
So much the way we talk
online exists in a gray area.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.800
And I don't know--

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.560
even personally, I question--

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.370
I used to-- I was educated as a
journalist and really used to--

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.152
part of the foundation
of that was I

00:43:13.152 --> 00:43:15.360
believe people should have
the information they want.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.580
And people should be able
to speak how they want.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.420
And now, again, that hate
speech can be synonymous

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:27.330
with political speech or
with a casual statement,

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.590
how do we go forward?

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.610
Do you-- I don't know.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.020
Feel free to ask a
follow up question

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.686
or say what you think
about it because I

00:43:32.686 --> 00:43:34.286
think it's really complicated.

00:43:34.286 --> 00:43:37.260
AUDIENCE: I think even
if 65% is a majority,

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.534
it's actually not a
very big majority.

00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:40.950
And I think I had
seen a statistic

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:43.620
about how it's really not
as skewed as people perceive

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.610
it to be.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.110
So I sort of wish that they
would publicize more that--

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.980
so you really don't
need to assume.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.380
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
I have it.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.660
65-- this is brand new--

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.710
65% percent male.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.480
35% female.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.080
By age, majority of our
audience is under 34.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.224
A quarter of the
audience under 24.

00:44:00.224 --> 00:44:02.765
AUDIENCE: First off, I just want
to thank you for being here.

00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:04.562
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Thank you for being here too.

00:44:04.562 --> 00:44:06.645
AUDIENCE: It's been
definitely really interesting.

00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:09.570
So you talked about the horrible
doxing and misidentification

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:12.430
that happened with
the Boston Bombing.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:13.972
And then you look
at something like--

00:44:13.972 --> 00:44:15.554
for those of you who
don't know, there

00:44:15.554 --> 00:44:17.030
was a mass shooting
in Jacksonville

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.410
at a "Madden" tournament.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.950
And there's a really
big overlap in those two

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.000
communities with Reddit
and gamers and all of that.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.360
So there was a really big
subreddit-- a few of them--

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.190
that popped up
around that trying

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.250
to almost do the same thing.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.180
And those got shut down very
quickly by internal moderators.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.920
But you said they're
all volunteers.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.295
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Admins

00:44:42.295 --> 00:44:44.460
are the-- there's an internal
community team, which

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.650
is more substantial
today than ever,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.750
but I would say
shockingly small.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.774
AUDIENCE: Well, that actually
really was my question.

00:44:52.774 --> 00:44:54.940
What do you know about that
internal community team,

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.590
if you can share anything
about it, about its growth

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.920
and about the strategies
around that and ways

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.946
that those things are being
handled post-Boston Marathon.

00:45:04.946 --> 00:45:07.680
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.390
I don't know exactly
how big it is today.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:14.070
But more than a year ago, I sat
in on a meeting with about 12

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.860
of the community
team members and got

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.750
to know them and their jobs.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.780
And they each have
a purview, right?

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.920
There's one who works
on r/books and r/AMA.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:33.900
And there are two who
manage the most passionate

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.250
political speech.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.200
They are the most
familiar with The_Donald.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.627
I have quite a bit of their
storyline in the book.

00:45:39.627 --> 00:45:40.710
You should check that out.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.790
Their names are, adorably,
Bill and [? Susie. ?]

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.650
And they each have
really crazy stories

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:52.470
of how they came to Reddit and
came to work together also.

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.070
And it's a team that's evolving.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:02.490
And it's a team that
is very tight-knit.

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.440
And they work hard together.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.710
They have-- so you think
of this community, right?

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.340
They are, like, good cop, right?

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.771
They're working-- they're
communicating with their user

00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:11.270
names.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.450
They're well-known people
if you're a real redditor.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.680
And say, there's a couple dozen.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.340
I don't know exact
number, whatever.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.010
But then you've got a
team that's, sort of,

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.680
their secret counterpart.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.350
That's called-- well, there's
two parts of it, actually.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.940
But the secret counterpart,
literally, their identities

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.860
are not public.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.770
They are not known as
employees of Reddit.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.320
And they are the ones that enact
bans and cut off communities

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.140
and identify communities
for being cut off.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.900
And there's just as
many of them on staff,

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.470
which is really fascinating.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.520
And then they've got a data
side of that team that's

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.491
just evolving now.

00:46:51.491 --> 00:46:52.740
That's what you saw last week.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.970
Steve was referencing in
his public comments about,

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.400
how are we going to manage
the flow of disinformation

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.040
in the future from Russians?

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.235
That's the team that
he's talking about.

00:47:03.235 --> 00:47:04.610
They also, by the
way-- you might

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.320
be fascinated-- kind of
think of Russian influence

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.360
on the site, or
any disinformation

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.370
campaign-spreading, as
just the same as bots.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.850
If you can take it down from
the side of it being spam,

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.182
that's ideal for them.

00:47:19.182 --> 00:47:20.640
So then part of
this team is called

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.870
anti-evil, which is a
great team name, of course.

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.720
And they are the ones that are
secret and doing this stuff.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.350
You can think of them
as sort of bad cop.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:36.030
And then their
counterparts are--

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.130
or actually, trust and safety
is kind of the secret one.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.474
And then you've got anti-evil.

00:47:40.474 --> 00:47:41.640
And they're kind of Robocop.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.290
They build the algorithms.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.750
They bust the spam.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.790
So you think, good
cop, bad cop, Robocop--

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.340
not my original line, but
it's a great way of thinking

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.890
about how they're structured.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.640
AUDIENCE: As Reddit's
gotten more popular,

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.280
it seems that there's
a very obvious play

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.440
towards a more valuable
demographic for advertising

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.330
and product promotion.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:07.380
And it seems that there's a
pretty obvious correlation

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:11.290
for AstroTurf-type
submitted content,

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.980
whether that's a
company promoting

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.460
a product or some content
that they've created

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.970
or something to political
ends of a similar nature.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:23.490
Has there been any efforts
or any ongoing work

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.530
towards making sure
that it's actually

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.530
people behind this instead
of companies and shadow

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.160
organizations?

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.470
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Yeah, yeah.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:36.000
I think, in comparison, in
contrast to what it could be,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.460
Reddit is incredibly good at
managing spam and that sort

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.010
of posting by brands and stuff.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:46.437
That's got dual components.

00:48:46.437 --> 00:48:48.270
It's the community
regulating itself, right?

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:51.920
People hate seeing that
kind of disingenuous,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.490
"I'm just self-promoting"
kind of thing

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.260
and will report that
on Reddit right away.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:01.770
And also the teams are
very good at managing bots.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.260
So yeah, I mean, will
we see a little bit

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.880
more promotional content?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.190
I don't know.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.595
Yeah, but this is stealing
a line from Steve Huffman.

00:49:10.595 --> 00:49:11.970
Like, you have to
be pretty naive

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.550
if you think no one is
marketing to you already, right?

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:15.050
They are.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.008
They're just trying to
do it in more savvy ways

00:49:17.008 --> 00:49:18.619
than they maybe could.

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:19.160
I don't know.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.270
I think that we will see
more brands actually come

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.860
to the Reddit way of
doing things and being

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.690
a little more genuine maybe.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.850
If they can just go on
and say, like, hey, want

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.320
some free stuff?

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.700
Look at this AMA.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.250
We'll give out 10 free books.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.630
Or we'll give the best person
with the answer to this trivia

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:41.760
question a free shaving kit.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.340
I don't know.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.798
I mean, there's a million ways
to actually market on Reddit

00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:45.600
that aren't gross.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.870
So I think brands will
come around to that.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.050
And their ads don't look
bad under new Reddit.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.670
So I don't know.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.420
What do you think?

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.750
Do you think-- are you seeing
more bleh-feeling stuff?

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.660
AUDIENCE: I mean, less the
actual advertising that's

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:01.290
on there.

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:03.630
I understand that's part
of the business model.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:07.170
And more, I guess, accounts
that are pretending

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.980
to be people that are upvoted en
masse and kind of artificially

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.744
floating towards the top of
the front page that are not

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.660
just something that
somebody found interesting

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.640
and thought it was
relevant and more placed

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.860
there for a very specific goal,
whether that's site traffic,

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.170
selling products, et cetera.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:23.586
CHRISTINE
LAGORIO-CHAFKIN: Got it.

00:50:23.586 --> 00:50:25.560
I mean, they're pretty
good at cracking down

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.040
on nets of individuals
who upvote stuff.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.720
That said, even
certain Russian domains

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.750
can get past those filters.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.580
So I don't know.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.940
I think, honestly, that's
been a strength in the past.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.420
And maybe it still happens.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:49.050
But I think that is far less
of a concern for me personally

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:50.970
or many citizens of
the United States

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:56.122
than, say, Iranian or Russian
influence on the election.

00:50:56.122 --> 00:50:57.035
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:57.035 --> 00:50:58.910
SPEAKER: Christine,
thank you for being here.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:59.070
CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN:
Thank you.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.028
SPEAKER: Appreciate it.

00:51:00.028 --> 00:51:03.050
