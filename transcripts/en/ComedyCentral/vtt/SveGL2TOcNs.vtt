00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.971
I HELPED A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
NAMED BRIAN WOLFE

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.507
WHO WASN'T TOO FOND
OF MY NATURAL PERSONALITY.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:08.509
- YOU'RE IN A [bleep] PINK SHIRT
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.977
OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:12.980
- BUT NOW, THANKS TO THE ADVICE
OF A DIVERSE FOCUS GROUP,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.949
I WAS ABLE TO TRANSFORM
INTO A MORE LIKABLE PERSON.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.186
SO FOR MY FINAL TEST,
I VISITED BRIAN AT HIS HOME

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.288
TO SEE WHAT HE THOUGHT OF
THE NEW ME.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:25.092
SO I'VE COME A LONG WAY SO FAR,
THANKS TO YOU.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.628
BEFORE I GO IN TONIGHT
TO TALK TO BRIAN,

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.530
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
DO I LOOK OKAY?

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.331
IS ALL THE...OUTFIT?
- YOU LOOK GOOD.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.935
YOU'RE DRESSED, AGAIN--
IT FITS YOU PERFECT,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.770
THE V-NECK AND THE BLAZER.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.572
- THIS IS GOOD?
- YEAH. IT FITS YOU.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.140
IT FITS YOU.
- OKAY. AND SO THIS IS ME.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.476
- THIS IS YOU.
BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.044
- WITH THOSE ENCOURAGING WORDS,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.246
I MARCHED INTO BRIAN'S HOUSE
TO SEE IF MY NEW PERSONALITY

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.614
WOULD WIN HIM OVER.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.183
BRIAN.

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.418
- NATHAN. HOW YOU DOING?
HOW YOU BEEN?

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.920
- I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
BRIAN.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.722
LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:56.857
- OKAY.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:57.858
- AND I WASN'T REALLY
BEING MYSELF.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.627
SO I THOUGHT
WE COULD DO THIS AGAIN.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.895
- OKAY.
- AND THIS TIME,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.363
YOU CAN GET TO KNOW
THE REAL ME.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.731
- LOOK AT YOU.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.300
YOU'RE STILL A GOOBER,
BUT THAT'S JUST YOU.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.368
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.570
GOOBER?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.972
- GOOBER JUST MEANS
LIKE A DORK, A NERD.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.241
- I'M A NERD.
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE A NERD.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.443
YOU'VE BEEN A NERD
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.378
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING A [bleep] NERD.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.380
YOU'RE A NERD.
- I'M NOT A NERD.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.482
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S MY OPINION.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.084
SERIOUSLY, IF I THREW A FOOTBALL
AT YOU RIGHT NOW,

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.519
YOU THINK YOU COULD CATCH IT?

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.688
- I COULD CATCH THE FOOTBALL.
- YOU CAN CATCH A FOOTBALL?

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:29.923
- YEAH.
- I DOUBT IT.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.259
I DOUBT YOU CAN CATCH
A FOOTBALL.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.927
- BRIAN STILL DIDN'T LIKE ME.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.864
AND AFTER ALL THE WORK
I HAD DONE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.366
- DON'T BE SAD.
IT'S OKAY.

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.767
- THEN, WHEN I RETURNED
TO THE TRUCK,

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.736
I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER
THAT THE GROUP WAS TRYING TO

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.205
DISTANCE THEMSELVES
FROM THEIR OWN SUGGESTIONS.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.640
- IT'S TOO LOW.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.176
THE V-NECK.
IT'S JUST TOO LOW.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:51.111
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SPEAK UP
BEFORE?

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.113
I ASKED BEFORE I WENT IN
IF THIS WAS GOOD.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.182
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE
THAT LOW, MAN.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:57.017
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE V-NECK?

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.886
- NOT THAT LOW.
- I ASKED YOU GUYS

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:01.255
BEFORE I WENT IN WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THIS LOOK?

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.190
- V-NECK IS THIS, NOT HERE.
- YOU GUYS SAID

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.792
YOU LIKED THE LOOK.
- IT FITS YOU PERFECTLY,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.728
V-NECK AND THE BLAZER.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.863
- THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
THERE WAS A MAJOR FLAW

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.665
WITH MY ENTIRE EXPERIMENT.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.935
THIS NEW PERSONALITY
WAS BASED ON THE JUDGMENT

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:17.404
OF FOUR PEOPLE WHO HAD AGREED
TO WORK OUT OF THE BACK

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.406
OF A MOVING BOX TRUCK.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.308
OF COURSE IT WAS FLAWED.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.210
IN THE END, MAYBE
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.846
TO BECOME THE GUY
THAT EVERYONE LOVES.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.681
BUT FOR A BRIEF MOMENT IN TIME,

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.284
IT FELT NICE THINKING
THAT I HAD A CHANCE.

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.619
CAN I GET A LITTLE
RUBBY-DUB-DUB?

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.421
- HO HO HO HO!

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:35.789
- NICE.
- GOOD ONE.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:36.990
GOOD ONE.
GOOD ONE.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.292
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:41.962
[upbeat music]
