00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:02.223
 We have devoted much time to ours 

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:05.961
 old girlfriend glucose, which is monosaccharide. 

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:09.540
 It is the building block of glycogen, 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.824
 of starch and of chitin. 

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:14.146
 But in this video I want to pay a little attention 

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.525
 another highly expressed monosaccharide, 

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:20.114
 this is fructose. 

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:23.678
 Fructose is often called fruit sugar. 

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.756
 It is monosaccharide and 

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:29.727
 is the sweetest of all sugars. 

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.573
 Now we will compare glucose and fructose. 

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.187
 The first thing that can impress you - 

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:34.487
 you can compare the two molecules - 

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.123
 It would be useful to be able to paint your own 

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.584
 these two molecules, 

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:41.987
 because you will see them many, many, many times 

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:44.681
 while studying biology, chemistry 

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.061
 and organic chemistry. 

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.882
 If we compare them, we will see that both molecules 

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.761
 have six carbon atoms. So for both 

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.491
 in the chemical formula we will have 

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.520
 six carbon atoms. Then we see that both have 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.852
 one, two, three, four, five, six, 

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:03.840
 seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.927
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, 

00:01:05.927 --> 00:01:07.912
 eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. 

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:10.919
 They have 12 hydrogen atoms and to finish, 

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:14.356
 have six oxygen atoms. 

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:16.295
 One, two, three, four, five, six. 

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.826
 One, two, three, four, five, six. 

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:22.692
 Both molecules have six oxygen atoms. 

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:25.919
 So they have the same chemical formula, 

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.834
 but they are different molecules, making them isomers. 

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.550
 As we shall see, they are structural isomers. 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.187
 The compilers 

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:36.055
 carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms 

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:37.580
 are connected in a different way. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.352
 So we call them structural isomers. 

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:41.400
 And if you look, 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.054
 there is one main thing that will make you impression. 

00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.225
 The glucose molecule when in 

00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:47.525
 its open form, 

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:48.686
 we will think of her, 

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:51.322
 we will think of both molecules in their cyclical form in a second. 

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:54.526
 But when it is in its open form, 

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:57.185
 the glucose molecule has a carbonyl group 

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.517
 the carbon atom number number one, if we start the numbering here. 

00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:04.917
 If we start numbering - one, two, three, four, 

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.818
 five, six, the open-chain glucose has a carbonyl group 

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:12.127
 on its first carbon atom. While fructose, 

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.159
 has a carbonyl group. 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.060
 One, two, three, four, five, six, 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.952
 of its second carbon atom. 

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.158
 Remember, the carbonyl group is simply a carbon atom linked to a double bond 

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.850
 with oxygen. Fructose has a C? 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.417
 its second carbon atom. 

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:29.252
 This is the main structural difference. 

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:31.852
 Even if you look at the way I drew them, 

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:34.811
 we have three hydroxyl groups 

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:35.951
 on the right and 

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:37.855
 one on the left. Three on the right, 

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:38.923
 one on the left. 

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:43.126
 So the main difference is what we explained here. 

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.726
 Now we will get some more experience 

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.420
 with the names of the different function groups. 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.626
 When we were learning about glucose, we knew there was 

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:53.284
 carbonyl group at the end of the carbon chain. 

00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:55.688
 The carbon atom in the carbonyl group is bound 

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:59.728
 with a hydrogen atom and with the rest of the carbon chain. 

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:01.957
 We call it here 

00:03:01.957 --> 00:03:04.616
 aldehyde functional group. 

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:08.209
 Aldehyde, an aldehyde function group that makes 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.283
 whole molecule 

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.918
 aldehyde. 

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:15.199
 Where the carbon in the carbonyl group is not 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.723
 at the end of the chain, and in the middle 

00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:19.755
 or rather it is in the chain, 

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.589
 not exactly in the middle, 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.860
 this carbon atom is linked to two other carbon atoms. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.781
 We call this molecule a ketone. 

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.452
 This will be a keto group, 

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:28.579
 because the carbon atom is connected 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.922
 with two other carbon atoms. 

00:03:31.922 --> 00:03:33.919
 Therefore, fructose 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.984
 is considered a ketone. 

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.784
 Now to think how he can form 

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:42.128
 its cyclical form. As we have said before, 

00:03:42.128 --> 00:03:44.345
 the open and cyclic form can 

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:47.120
 be in equilibrium if they are in aqueous solution. 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.954
 What I paint here is not the only one 

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.323
 forms that glucose takes. If you look 

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:52.925
 in textbooks or on the internet, 

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:55.293
 you will see the most common 

00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:57.046
 in nature form, when we talk about cyclic forms, 

00:03:57.046 --> 00:04:00.494
 you will find glucose as a six-membered ring, 

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:02.921
 right here. 

00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.022
 Five of the ring atoms are carbon, and the last one 

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:06.125
 is oxygen. 

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.817
 While fructose most often forms a five-atom ring, 

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.406
 in which four of the atoms are carbon 

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:13.521
 and one is oxygen. 

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:15.750
 Glucose may form a six-membered ring, 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.957
 when we have a six-membered ring, 

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.684
 when we have a carbohydrate that forms a six-membered 

00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:22.809
 a ring in which one of the atoms is oxygen, 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.549
 we call it pyranose. Pyranose is a carbohydrate ring which, 

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:31.180
 there are six members one of which is oxygen. 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.259
 When there are five members, 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.860
 one of which is oxygen, the name is furanose. 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.554
 Furanose. 

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:41.350
 In fact, fructose can be detected as a furanose 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.322
 and as pyranose. But furanose 

00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:46.424
 is also most typical when people think 

00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:49.419
 for the fructose ring, most often think of 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.812
 this shape. 

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.054
 How to get it 

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:53.947
 this shape? 

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:57.047
 Especially in comparison with what happens in glucose? 

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.254
 We saw, 

00:04:58.254 --> 00:04:59.984
 that in glucose 

00:04:59.984 --> 00:05:02.387
 but also in fructose, 

00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:05.150
 the carbon atom that is part of the carbonyl group will be attacked. 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.925
 Here's the carbon atom number one. 

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.794
 This is the number one carbon atom, 

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:12.186
 and here is carbon atom number two. 

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.288
 It's carbon atom number two. 

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:16.981
 Carbon atom number two here, 

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.489
 in both cases -- 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.091
 If we want to get these forms 

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:22.693
 here 

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:25.341
 we have an oxygen atom that is 

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.558
 in the hydroxyl group 

00:05:27.558 --> 00:05:28.974
 at the fifth carbon atom. 

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.658
 Oxygen in the hydroxyl group bound 

00:05:30.658 --> 00:05:31.981
 with the fifth carbon atom. 

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.451
 This is the first, second, third, fourth, fifth carbon atom. 

00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.959
 This oxygen 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:40.851
 formed 

00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:44.160
 this connection here when we talk about 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.447
 glucose, and this one here, 

00:05:46.447 --> 00:05:49.559
 when we talk about fructose. If we look at oxygen atom number five 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.220
 in the hydroxyl group of the fifth 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.841
 carbon atom, we see the hydroxyl group here. 

00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.826
 This is this hydroxyl group 

00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:58.487
 and this oxygen atom. 

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:00.623
 This oxygen atom 

00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:01.993
 forms a connection 

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:04.582
 with the carbon atom in the carbonyl group. 

00:06:04.582 --> 00:06:07.775
 When this happens, it allows 

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:10.747
 of one of these double bonds 

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:15.187
 to free itself from the carbon atom and 

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:16.726
 to form a connection 

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.385
 with a proton floating around. 

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.125
 This proton would probably be 

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:24.481
 of the hydroxone ion. 

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:26.293
 The same thing would happen to glucose 

00:06:26.293 --> 00:06:27.256
 here. 

00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:30.286
 One of these double links will be used, 

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:32.086
 to connect 

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:35.488
 with a hydrogen proton, 

00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:38.019
 so in practice it's the same mechanism. 

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.223
 The reason is a five-membered ring with four 

00:06:41.223 --> 00:06:44.474
 carbon atom rather than a six-membered ring of five, 

00:06:44.474 --> 00:06:46.854
 is that the carbonyl group 

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:50.395
 is down the chain 

00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:54.036
 in glucose. That's why she's forming 

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:57.187
 this pentagonal shape here. 

00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:58.684
 We have already talked about it in other videos. 

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.405
 Fructose, as I said, 

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.619
 is the sweetest sugar of all monosaccharides. 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.719
 When we talk about table sugar, 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.760
 which you may add in your tea or coffee, 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.489
 table sugar is called sucrose. 

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:15.287
 Sucrose, sucrose. 

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:20.221
 It is a disaccharide made up of glucose and fructose. 

00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:23.054
 The way in which the relationship takes place is also 

00:07:23.054 --> 00:07:26.885
 by dehydration, 

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.720
 in which 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.554
 oxygen 

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:33.491
 at the first carbon atom in glucose, 

00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:34.594
 this one here, 

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:37.218
 I will color it in a color I have not used so far. 

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:40.155
 But I have used almost all colors, so it will be difficult. 

00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:42.222
 I'm just going to use this green. 

00:07:42.222 --> 00:07:45.519
 This oxygen can form a bond 

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.422
 p 

00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:52.787
 carbon atom number two of fructose. 

00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:56.189
 When the bond is formed, 

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:58.058
 this connection here, 

00:07:58.058 --> 00:08:00.461
 I will color it in another color, 

00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:03.155
 this connection here, 

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:06.127
 can return to oxygen 

00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:07.857
 or if you want to look at it in another way, 

00:08:07.857 --> 00:08:10.225
 can be used to form a link 

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:14.474
 with a hydrogen proton, 

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:16.251
 which floats through the solution. 

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.851
 Carbon will bind to oxygen, 

00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.311
 who will connect with another 

00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.587
 carbon atom. 

00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:29.022
 Another water molecule 

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:32.052
 can attract this hydrogen proton here 

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:33.294
 and then we will have 

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:34.827
 connection, 

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:36.452
 with which we are already familiar. 

00:08:36.452 --> 00:08:39.552
 These glycosidic linkages are obtained 

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:42.420
 in dehydration, these connections 

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.287
 are the basis of how we start with mono-saccharides 

00:08:45.287 --> 00:08:47.052
 and create 

00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.119
 disaccharides. If we continue, 

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:52.868
 we will create polysaccharides. 

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:55.318
 One way to think about sucrose is, 

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:56.619
 if we have 

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.894
 glucose here, 

00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.425
 glucose, 

00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:03.155
 I will draw it here 

00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:05.291
 we have glucose, 

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:09.123
 we have glucose. 

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.350
 Glucose forms 

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.218
 glycosidic bond 

00:09:15.218 --> 00:09:17.250
 with fructose, 

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.194
 with fructose 

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.984
 right here. 

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:25.260
 And sucrose is produced. 

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.791
 To really imagine it, 

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.880
 we will rotate the fructose and lift it up, 

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.808
 then they can connect. 

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:35.524
 This atom will form a bond with this carbon atom 

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:37.434
 right here.
