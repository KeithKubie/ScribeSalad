Final behavioral diagram I'd like to mention is the state diagram.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.130
This is the most powerful, the most complex of the behavioral diagrams.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.560
They're also sometimes called state charts. These diagrams convey extended

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.440
finite state machines extended with the ability to represent aggregation,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.620
concurrency, history, broadcasting events and so on. We're going to devote

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.000
a whole lesson to them, but let me give you one example diagram here.
