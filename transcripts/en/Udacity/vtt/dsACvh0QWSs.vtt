00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.700
We now discuss UML's behavioral diagrams. Those diagrams that

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.490
have to do with the behavior, the dynamic aspects

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.940
of the system, rather than the static ones. The

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.670
first behavioral diagram I want to discuss is a very

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.590
fundamental one, the Use Case Diagram. So, let's start

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.370
by seeing what a Use Case is. A Use Case

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.800
represents two main things. First the sequence of interactions

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.250
of outside entities which is what we normally call actors

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.990
with the system that we're modelling and the second thing

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.290
is the system actions that yield an observable result of values

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.380
to the actors. And basically these two things, and nothing else

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.010
that the outside view of the system. So the view of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.060
the system in which we look at the interaction between

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.170
this system, and the outside world. If you want to parallel, think

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.070
about designing a house. Considering how you would use the house.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.550
And you might have seen use cases called with different names.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.820
So for example, they're also called scenarios, scripts or user stories,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.220
but in the context of UML, we'll call the use cases.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.650
Now let's look at the basic notation for a use case,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.910
which is fairly simple. We have a use case which is represented

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.760
by an oval, with a name, which is the name of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
the use case. We have an actor, which is represented by

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.330
this icon and is normally identified by a role name. And

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.820
finally we have an edge which is a solid line that connects

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.970
actors and use cases and indicates that an actor

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.270
is the actor of a given use case. And just

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.360
for completeness let me note there are some additional notational

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.750
elements but now for simplicity we'll just use these ones.
