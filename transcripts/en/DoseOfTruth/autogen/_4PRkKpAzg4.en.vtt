getting over of relatively serious loss
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.170
getting over of relatively serious loss
like a death in the family a year you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
like a death in the family a year you
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.200
like a death in the family a year you
know and so the first thing you might

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
know and so the first thing you might
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.869
know and so the first thing you might
ask yourself is are there things that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
ask yourself is are there things that
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.220
ask yourself is are there things that

are good about the promotion
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.360
are good about the promotion
the second is do you have the capacity

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
the second is do you have the capacity
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310
the second is do you have the capacity
to do the job or to learn how to do it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
to do the job or to learn how to do it
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900
to do the job or to learn how to do it
you could talk to someone about that and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
you could talk to someone about that and
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.510
you could talk to someone about that and
then the third thing is have you given

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
then the third thing is have you given
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430
then the third thing is have you given
yourself enough time to adjust because

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
yourself enough time to adjust because
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.290
yourself enough time to adjust because
one of the things I often recommend to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
one of the things I often recommend to
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.579
one of the things I often recommend to
people when they've made a radical

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
people when they've made a radical
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679
people when they've made a radical
change like going leaving home and going

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
change like going leaving home and going
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390
change like going leaving home and going
to university is don't pay any attention

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
to university is don't pay any attention
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.149
to university is don't pay any attention
to how you feel for a year because

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
to how you feel for a year because
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920
to how you feel for a year because
everything is so much up in the air that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
everything is so much up in the air that
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.830
everything is so much up in the air that
you can't really trust your own judgment

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840
you can't really trust your own judgment
 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.630
you can't really trust your own judgment
so you have to give yourself time to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
so you have to give yourself time to
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.539
so you have to give yourself time to
adapt and you can't expect that that's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
adapt and you can't expect that that's
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.550
adapt and you can't expect that that's
going to happen overnight it's certainly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
going to happen overnight it's certainly
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410
going to happen overnight it's certainly
not and to put that expectation on

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
not and to put that expectation on
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149
not and to put that expectation on
yourself increases the probability that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
yourself increases the probability that
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450
yourself increases the probability that
you're going to feel bad about it
