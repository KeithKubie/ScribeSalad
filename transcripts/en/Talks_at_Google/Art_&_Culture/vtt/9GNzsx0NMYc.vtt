[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:08.530
LAURA MURPHY: Ben Folds
is a singer, songwriter,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.960
multi-platinum selling artist.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.470
He's also a TV and film star.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.460
He's done a number of things
outside of the music industry

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.500
that he should be very proud of.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.670
He's a father.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.450
He's a photographer.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.330
He's also the
soundtrack of my youth.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.020
No big deal.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.270
My mom is here.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.200
You can ask her.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.320
BEN FOLDS: Hey.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.060
LAURA MURPHY: She knows.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.559
Yeah.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.780
So we're super excited
to have you here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.530
Thank you so much.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.630
It's a giant honor to
have you at Google today.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.130
So--

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.540
BEN FOLDS: Well, thank you.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.331
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:38.560
Thank you.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.752
So we're going to do this
a bit differently today.

00:00:41.752 --> 00:00:43.210
I know that most
of you in the room

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.000
know that Ben has a performance
tonight at the Fillmore.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.250
So he's going to
reserve his voice.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.950
Hopefully, you win tickets
so you can go hear him.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.740
You have been completely
jam packed on this Fall

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.450
tour all the way
until, I think, I

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.280
saw your last show is
going to be in Honolulu.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.570
So that may not be so bad.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.020
But it's been a
pretty packed tour.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.209
And it's called "The Paper
Airplane Request Tour."

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.270
So I thought what we could do
is just start off with tell us

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.570
why it's called that?

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.990
BEN FOLDS: Well, the second
half of the show, the set,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.750
is requests.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.790
And instead of people
shouting the request,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.050
which is scary if
you're sitting on stage.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.170
Close your eyes, you see
people with pitchforks.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.090
They sound angry.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.814
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:31.230
Because you can't
understand this.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.090
And I just thought, oh, people
just make a paper airplane

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.140
and throw that.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.000
So basically, I just
walk around the stage

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.807
and pick those up and play them.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.390
I mean, it didn't
occur to me how many

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.310
songs that I had either written,
done, been involved with that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.930
might be on stage.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.780
So I brushed up on
a couple hundred,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.880
and then I've got about
50 left that I just can't

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.530
seem to crack at the moment.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.714
LAURA MURPHY: What's
one of those 50?

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.070
BEN FOLDS: Oh.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.710
I don't know.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.930
You know, stuff
like, there's songs

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.920
that I would have never
thought to play on the piano

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.207
by myself is why, like--

00:02:07.207 --> 00:02:08.040
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.690
BEN FOLDS: So I did a movie
called "Over the Hedge"

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.130
for DreamWorks.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.660
It was a kids' movie.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.730
And the songs I wrote
for that, I never

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.495
expected to come back
to haunt me in any way.

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:19.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.230
The songs make me think
of conference calls.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.935
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.150
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.370
BEN FOLDS: But,
yeah, so there's one

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.320
of those that's just like
kind of cacophony, horns.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.112
It's a kiddie song.

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:34.778
I never thought about
playing it before.

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:36.560
But it's in the book
in case someone asks.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.990
LAURA MURPHY: OK.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.840
BEN FOLDS: And
somebody yesterday

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.940
asked for something I wrote
when I was 16 years old,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.980
which got on the internet.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.570
I didn't know.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.080
So--

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.630
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.046
BEN FOLDS: I
couldn't remember it.

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:46.704
LAURA MURPHY: Well
so on the flip side

00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:48.370
of that, what's been
your favorite song?

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.900
Of all the paper
airplanes that have

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.694
landed on the stage, what's
been your favorite song to play?

00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:53.860
BEN FOLDS: Oh, I don't know.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.610
I don't really have
favorites of anything.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.318
LAURA MURPHY: Oh.

00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:57.280
Even of your own stuff?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.940
BEN FOLDS: No.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.320
Especially of my own stuff.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.730
I think I've got a block there.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.231
So, yeah.

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:02.688
LAURA MURPHY: Well,
that's awesome.

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:04.330
BEN FOLDS: I try
to be a fair dad.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.270
LAURA MURPHY: Well, so Ben is
really involved with his fans.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.330
He's huge into social media.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.010
And so what we thought we'd do
next is just kind of highlight

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.924
some of the ways that Ben
outreaches to his fans.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.340
And what we'd love to do, since
we're on the topic of tour

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.850
is can you talk to us a little
bit about the VIP experiences

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.690
that you offer around soundcheck
before each of your shows?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.670
And why you do that?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.360
BEN FOLDS: Well, I
mean, quite honestly,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.360
I do it because, you know,
if I'm going to tour,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.490
I want to make the
most of it, you know.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.780
I like touring fine, but
I also like being home.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.390
So it takes care of a whole
lot of stuff at once on tour.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.330
The normal-- I've been
approached about these a few

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.560
times, and didn't really want to
do them, because the ideas of--

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.337
look at-- Bon Jovi is great.

00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:55.420
I think Bon Jovi is great.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.211
I'm not making fun.

00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.760
But the idea of
like, I think I'd

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.450
seen Bon Jovi standing
and taking pictures

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.000
with people for two hours.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.350
And I don't want to do that.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.310
But what we realized is we
could do something like a class.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.850
So what we do is something
called a master class.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.772
Not really a master class, but
it's almost a master class.

00:04:17.772 --> 00:04:19.230
And then I will
let people come up,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.089
if they want to play the
song, and we'll talk about it.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.899
That's fine.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.710
So it's like a
class for people who

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.680
are of any age that want to
talk about, commiserate about,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.940
where they are in music,
or music education.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.384
And we were bringing local
music teachers in to begin with,

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:38.550
because I think if you're
going to talk about music,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.840
it's best to do it in
context of having learned it.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.079
Which, as a rock
musician, you're

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:48.370
really supposed to put off
the idea that you rolled out

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.130
of bed one day,
and smoked a joint,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.701
and started making up songs.

00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:53.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.020
And you know,
between that point,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.450
which is obvious that happened.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.790
But at some point
you did learn it.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.177
I'm a big fan of as much formal
training as possible in music,

00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:09.760
no matter what kind
of music you make.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.160
I think it makes it better.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.550
So that gives me a
chance to do that.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.700
It gives me a chance
to connect people

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.080
on things like National
Endowment for the Arts, which

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.150
was sort of tentatively was
up on the chopping block

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.140
for a little while.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.879
And, you know, stuff.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.670
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.336
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:05:30.336 --> 00:05:33.490
So the VIP, that makes
me feel good because I

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.680
feel like I'm hearing
from a lot of teachers,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.870
I'm talking to people,
we're talking about music,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.940
and it's not as much
of a celebrity affair.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.960
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.460
BEN FOLDS: So it's given-- it's
been a good thing, you know.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.610
It's actually-- and
I'm working on--

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.450
I think I'm writing a book.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.950
And--

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.010
It seems that way.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.800
I can't tell people
with a straight face

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.145
I'm working on my memoirs.

00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:56.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.980
But it's good for that
too, because talking

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.220
to people about music all
the time, and of all ages,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.200
and where they're
coming from, and how

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.050
they're learning
it is helpful to me

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.670
when I'm outlining
the things that I

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.100
think are important
when you're cramming

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.919
the music in your head.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:15.710
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.200
I think one of those
experiences is called

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.610
"Ask Me Anything" and then--

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.420
BEN FOLDS: Almost anything.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.180
LAURA MURPHY: Almost
anything about music.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.560
BEN FOLDS: AMAA.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.470
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.084
"Ask Me Almost
Anything About Music."

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:25.750
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.124
LAURA MURPHY: So you've had
some really interesting folks

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:28.700
come through.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.830
Have you ever had anyone
that's blown you away,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.967
or been really
musically talented?

00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:33.800
BEN FOLDS: Oh, yeah.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.630
I think almost everybody
who has bothered to step up,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.390
play a song, has been
really impressive to me.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.550
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.600
BEN FOLDS: And, yeah, and
sometimes-- a couple of days

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.050
ago, I was sort
of taunting a kid

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.660
to write a song on the spot,
because they were wondering

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.340
about-- every night of my
solo career just about,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.890
since like 2002, I've sort of
had to freestyle songs onstage.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.815
It's been a sort of
a tradition where--

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:13.190
I was playing in Chicago and
we were making a live album.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.160
This guy goes, rock that bitch.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.740
Rock this bitch.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.120
And he just meant I wasn't
playing fast enough, or loud

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.750
enough, or something.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.666
But we were making a
live album, and I made up

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.860
a song called that for him.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.220
And that became popular.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.470
So that it became a code word.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.010
People would ask for that.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.660
And I do it with
symphony orchestras

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.660
regularly, where I'll
freestyle a song,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.860
and then I'll dictate parts
that I hear in the orchestra.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.260
And so, yeah, I was
trying to get the kid

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.520
to put him in that position.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.490
Let him make something up,
because we can do that.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.990
LAURA MURPHY: That's awesome.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.050
So, OK.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.300
You're here at Google.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.160
And we, beyond the
obvious search engine

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.624
that I'm sure you
use sometimes--

00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:00.040
BEN FOLDS: I've
heard of it, yeah.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.760
LAURA MURPHY:
You've heard of it?

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.180
Yeah.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.904
We also own a little video
property called YouTube--

00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:04.570
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.270
LAURA MURPHY: So
knowing all of that,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.946
and knowing how involved
you are with your fans,

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:12.320
can you talk to us a little
bit about digital technology,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.060
and how you use it to keep
in touch with your fans?

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.210
BEN FOLDS: To be
very honest, I think

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.580
my fans have always been the
types who are very ahead.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.710
Always have been ahead.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.430
To the point where
in 1999 I was signing

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.530
at least as many burned CDs.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.549
And I was fine with that.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.240
And I think that, because
I've embraced however

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.070
they want to be
excited about music--

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.960
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.560
BEN FOLDS: --and
open to it, it's

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.480
been really more of--
like now my management,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.830
he comes from politics.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.260
He doesn't know
anything about music.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.740
And he also comes
from social media.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.470
I personally have
been on Facebook

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.020
for a total of about
three minutes once.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.460
To check it out,
and that's back--

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.690
LAURA MURPHY: This is
your Facebook page.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.930
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.290
LAURA MURPHY: In
case you wondered.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:08.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:08.820
Yeah.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.670
It's right here.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.320
BEN FOLDS: Well,
last time I did it,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.175
people were sending me
emails about poking.

00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:14.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.185
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.810
BEN FOLDS: That's
how far back it goes.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.010
I do, you know, I do read
the news on my phone.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.881
LAURA MURPHY: OK.

00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:23.380
Good.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.566
BEN FOLDS: I know that's
terrible, I just do--

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.730
LAURA MURPHY: Do watch
a lot of YouTube?

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.274
Do you use YouTube as a
resource for your music, or--

00:09:30.274 --> 00:09:30.940
BEN FOLDS: I do.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.620
Especially, like,
you know, one thing

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.230
is because I make up
a song every night,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.750
sometimes I want to
remember what it was.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.140
And people will always film it.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:39.640
So--

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:39.790
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.300
BEN FOLDS: --I'll back.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.010
In fact, one time
it came in handy

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.980
because had some guy being a
little bit of a jackass online,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.780
saying that I'd stolen this
song from some guy I've never

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.640
heard of.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.123
And he was kind of a famous,
like a comedian in the UK.

00:09:58.123 --> 00:10:00.420
And so everyone was jumping
on the bandwagon saying,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.560
oh, I thought Ben was better
than that, to steal a song.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.320
And I'm like, I
don't even know--

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.186
I didn't really want to click
on that song they said I stole.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.060
So I didn't even want
a record of ever having

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.820
heard this damn thing.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.660
Anyway, I realized,
oh, wait a minute.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.780
I made that song up on
stage mostly in 2011,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.920
way before that guy had
his first record out.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.045
LAURA MURPHY: That's funny.

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:21.441
BEN FOLDS: So I went on YouTube.

00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:21.940
Found it.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.250
Someone had posted it.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.410
And sent that to
the guy in the UK.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.396
He's like, OK.

00:10:27.396 --> 00:10:27.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:31.480
Like, will you have a press
conference now for me?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.211
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.211 --> 00:10:32.710
Because--

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.130
LAURA MURPHY: Will
you set this straight?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.260
BEN FOLDS: --everyone
thinks I'm a thief.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.540
I've been smeared.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.340
LAURA MURPHY: That's awesome.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.720
Well, so sort of in the same
vein of digital technology,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.805
you have three children?

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:45.430
BEN FOLDS: Mhm.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.720
LAURA MURPHY: And there's a
ton of folks here at Google

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.420
who are also working parents.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.250
Do you allow screen time?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.840
Do your kids use digital
technology for music research,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.710
too?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.320
BEN FOLDS: They do.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.650
They live in it, you know?

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.520
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.210
BEN FOLDS: They went to
Waldorf School for a few years

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.840
to wash them clean of it,
which I think is good, too.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.790
I think a combination is good.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.720
Some time off I think
was really good for them.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.310
And then time on is good.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.530
I don't really--

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.030
I think anything
can be addictive.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.830
And certainly with
kids, iPads and stuff

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:32.090
like that can start to
seem to form an addiction.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.330
But you know, short of
that, it's really amazing,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.332
because they have
at their fingertips

00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:39.040
all this information
that we didn't have.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.570
And I think also they
learn pretty quickly how

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.760
to discern fake information, or
invalid information, I'd rather

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.200
not use the word fake anymore.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.440
Invalid information
from valid information,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.540
where my generation
wasn't ready for it.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.810
We're like, whoa,
look at all that.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.200
And I think, you know,
also like, you know,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.400
e-mails, and things.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.950
Like, they kind of
know how to do that

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.090
without getting in trouble.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.570
There was a moment
in the Waldorf class

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.050
one year where two of the
kids had gotten on Instagram.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.939
And they weren't supposed
to even be on it.

00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.730
But they had gotten on
it, and were calling

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.560
each other horrible names.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.900
I mean, stuff that--

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:29.435
I mean, look, I've said a
few bad words in my day.

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:31.560
I can't repeat the kind of
things they were saying.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.310
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.200
BEN FOLDS: They were so gross.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.700
The teacher had them.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.060
She printed it out,
as if it was a play.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.470
And had them read it aloud
into each other's face

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.090
in front of the class.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.840
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.080
BEN FOLDS: And they
would say, well,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.600
your mother is a f-ing B that
likes to cram Ds in her--

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.960
And you're like, wow.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.180
And the teacher is like, I
don't think that's what it said.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.830
Well, it said
something like that.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.950
Well you're sitting
in front of him.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.210
You say to him.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.400
And that's what you're doing
when you put it online.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.020
I think kids learn those things.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.750
And so it's a different era.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.027
I think in almost any
time-- the danger is talking

00:13:20.027 --> 00:13:21.860
about it for someone
like me is because I've

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.910
been through all the eras.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.940
And I think that
naturally we're all

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.730
programmed to think
that new technology has

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.340
some evil into the
world component to it.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.170
It's like everything
that was ever

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.090
invented that was ever
important was just

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.090
a sign that the end was near.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.570
And that's the way
our brains work.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.860
So I sort of got out
of that business.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.950
And I understand--
I'm not a total idiot.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.240
There's an electric piano.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:47.707
LAURA MURPHY: Oh.

00:13:47.707 --> 00:13:48.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:49.110
I love that.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.270
BEN FOLDS: So what
do I think of those.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.550
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.050
All right.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.777
Well, we're going to focus
on something else you love.

00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:58.360
BEN FOLDS: OK.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.780
LAURA MURPHY: Seemingly--

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.270
BEN FOLDS: Something
else besides--

00:13:59.270 --> 00:13:59.690
LAURA MURPHY: --that you love.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.970
BEN FOLDS: --besides
digital media.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.470
LAURA MURPHY: Besides
digital media.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.960
Photography.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.585
BEN FOLDS: Yes.

00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:06.990
LAURA MURPHY: So, if you guys
haven't checked this out,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.370
Ben has one of the most
amazing photography sites.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.530
It's a split between
his music career

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.410
and his photography,
where he is actually

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.990
selling a lot of his work.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.800
A lot of his work
is highlighted.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.884
So we wanted to just kind of
ask you about a couple of these.

00:14:22.884 --> 00:14:24.800
I understand those might
be your own children?

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.190
BEN FOLDS: That's them.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.450
LAURA MURPHY: Is that right?

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.490
BEN FOLDS: Would
you run it back one?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.448
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, sure.

00:14:27.448 --> 00:14:28.176
Of course.

00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:30.050
BEN FOLDS: Anyone know
the movie, "The Room?"

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.644
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:30.644 --> 00:14:32.310
BEN FOLDS: Like, you
know, Tommy Wiseau?

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.480
BEN FOLDS: My daughter drew this
whole big collage of the room,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.435
with all the quotes randomly
from it, when she was 14.

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:41.900
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
that's awesome.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.160
BEN FOLDS: It's really good.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.430
That's what--

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.360
LAURA MURPHY: That's
what this poster is?

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:44.570
BEN FOLDS: That's what that is.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.620
LAURA MURPHY: Is her name Lisa?

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.980
BEN FOLDS: No, no.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.230
Lisa is one of the characters.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.280
So you're tearing
us apart, Lisa.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.080
Anyway, sorry.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.704
I just noticed that
was in the picture.

00:14:52.704 --> 00:14:54.650
LAURA MURPHY: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.742
So these are-- is
this one of your--

00:14:56.742 --> 00:14:58.200
BEN FOLDS: That's
Louie and Gracie.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.056
There were about-- maybe I--

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:01.430
I'm going to guess
they were six?

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.790
Five?

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.900
They were probably five.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.370
LAURA MURPHY: I love the
back story on this, too.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.380
And you can find
this out on his site.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.580
Ben-- they were in a hotel.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.450
He was on tour.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.830
And he had just gotten
incidentals for the hotel room,

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.330
and was kind of maybe
obsessing over how much he

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.500
spent on bottled water.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.945
BEN FOLDS: Bottled water, yeah.

00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:18.650
Like $100 or something.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.470
LAURA MURPHY: And then
captured this amazing moment

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.050
of your children, just kind
of taking in all the scene

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.544
outside of the hotel room.

00:15:25.544 --> 00:15:26.210
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.260
There were people
watching 20 floors below.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.525
It's kind of cool.

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:32.150
LAURA MURPHY: And you're friends
with a bunch of famous people,

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.500
too.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:32.980
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, that's--

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.542
LAURA MURPHY:
[LAUGHS] Bob Sagat.

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:35.750
BEN FOLDS: It's Bob and Jeff.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.250
Yep.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.712
Bob Sagat, yep.

00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:39.836
LAURA MURPHY: I just picked
a couple of, you know--

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:40.340
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.720
LAURA MURPHY: Your
work is all amazing.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.430
But some of the
stuff-- it seems to me

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.660
you're really interested
in photographing people,

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.340
and somewhat, obviously,
your performances, but

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.830
behind the scenes, too, as well.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.930
But actually, this
is what I was hoping

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.640
you could talk to
us about, because I

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.800
found this really fascinating.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.890
He's got-- Ben has three
photos of his experiences

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.510
at Bonnaroo in 2006,
2008, and 2012.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.780
But I believe, if
I'm not mistaken,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.250
fact check me on this, Ben,
this was the first time

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.650
you asked the audience to--

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.900
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, that's right.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.310
LAURA MURPHY: --flip you off.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.835
BEN FOLDS: Flip me off.

00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:17.040
Yeah.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.831
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:20.210
So talk to us a little bit
about what inspired that?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.286
And what became a sort
of somewhat like--

00:16:22.286 --> 00:16:22.952
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:27.710
When you see that first
one enlarged, because it's

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.610
a pretty big negative,
you can see people happily

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.400
flipping me off all the
way back to about 50,000,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.870
60,000 people back there.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.921
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.970
And then I just--
it became a thing.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.240
I just asked them to do that.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.790
Stand on my piano with very
large camera and photograph it.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:50.130
I get myself one or two
shots really quickly.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.770
But, yeah, you can how they--

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.097
someone must've
dehydrated it this year.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.180
And then they've got the
trough through the middle

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.649
so they go in and out.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.440
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
and then they're just--

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.190
BEN FOLDS: And the
trees change some, too,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.109
which is kind of cool.

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:04.150
Not so much between these
two, but the first one.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.941
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:05.824
BEN FOLDS: Anyway.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.449
LAURA MURPHY: Is that something
that you do other performances?

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.810
BEN FOLDS: No.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.599
LAURA MURPHY: Or is it
just special for Bonnaroo?

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.932
BEN FOLDS: That's just Bonnoroo.

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:12.685
Yeah.

00:17:12.685 --> 00:17:14.461
LAURA MURPHY: [LAUGHS]
That's awesome.

00:17:14.461 --> 00:17:14.960
All right.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.814
Well, one of the
things, a connection

00:17:16.814 --> 00:17:18.230
back to Detroit,
one of the things

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.290
that I love about what
you do-- you spoke

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.250
a little bit about this when you
are performing with orchestras

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.880
or symphonies, and someone
shouts out, what was it?

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.750
Rock this bitch?

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.541
Or rock that bitch?

00:17:30.541 --> 00:17:31.490
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.323
LAURA MURPHY: I just
think it's unbelievable

00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:37.070
how then you take 10 15 minutes,
whatever it takes, to compose

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.520
that song sort of live.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.390
So I was hoping you could talk
to us about your experience

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.950
with the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra,

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.450
since you're here in Detroit.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.470
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.812
Detroit has a great
symphony orchestra.

00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:48.770
I mean, they really do.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.140
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, they do.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.223
BEN FOLDS: It's a real--
and Grand Rapids actually

00:17:51.223 --> 00:17:53.300
does, too.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.740
AUDIENCE: Rock this bitch!

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.700
BEN FOLDS: Oh, shit!

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.130
And since [INAUDIBLE] I'll
do it in monotone today.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.962
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.730
Yeah.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.660
What can I say?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.650
I don't-- then I can
see the conductor.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.540
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.130
But, yeah, they've got a
great symphony orchestra.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.300
They really do.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.910
When it comes to the rock this
bitch moments with the symphony

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.980
orchestra, they're
all a little different

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.440
in terms of how
receptive they might

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.730
be as an organization to
that, because they have

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.952
a lot of rules
about they show up,

00:18:34.952 --> 00:18:36.660
and they understand
what they're playing,

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.493
and they're not put in
a position of looking

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.230
like they're not prepared.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.270
You know, it's-- that really--

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.400
I understand why
that's not fair.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.350
But they're all--
they've all relaxed.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.730
Detroit was fine about it.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.480
And they're relaxed a
lot, because I think

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.310
they can see that it works.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.770
It humanizes the
orchestra to me,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.470
because the audience sees
the orchestra as something

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.940
that may well just be
stuck in the 19th century.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.240
I mean they don't really look--

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.320
you don't see it.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.990
It's not a personal thing.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.570
An orchestra is not a
diva-oriented individual

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.230
or thing.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.350
And it did not come from.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.880
It came from the whole
thing as one group.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.759
And when you see people
reacting differently to how am I

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.800
going to do this thing
that he's asking me to do?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.180
And having to kind of sit up.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.580
And they're very proper
classical musicians

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.146
are asked to do this.

00:19:25.146 --> 00:19:26.270
I think that's interesting.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.530
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.230
BEN FOLDS: And it's interesting
for the orchestra, too.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.550
Puts their ear to the test.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.494
And it's good for me,
because it teaches me--

00:19:32.494 --> 00:19:34.410
I mean, there's-- you
can't learn enough about

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.700
orchestration.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.620
It's such a wormhole.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.435
It's an art that takes years.

00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:43.560
And part of the reason that
we have trouble with it

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.720
now is because most
of the orchestration

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.130
is done on the computer.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.930
And the computer
doesn't actually

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.920
give you a real idea of what
it sounds like, in the space.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.860
It does an amazing thing with
telling you the theory of it.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.170
But the real art of
orchestration is that.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.445
So I get to be
onstage and go, oh, I

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:02.820
was wondering what
it would sound

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.640
like if I put the piccolos
two octaves above the bassoon

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.290
and have them do this.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.740
And then I get to hear it there
on the spot, which gives me

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.190
nightly orchestration lessons.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.840
Yeah.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.650
LAURA MURPHY: Do you let the
crowd also shout out the song?

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.480
Or when they say,
rock this bitch,

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.850
do you decide what song
you are going to arrange?

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.433
BEN FOLDS: No.

00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.620
I just make it up.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.200
I think the last time--

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.600
I believe here was--

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.520
I think there was
a woman who asked--

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.644
LAURA MURPHY: Detroit
Rock City, was it?

00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:35.310
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, that
may be what I did.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.520
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:35.970
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.920
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.851
Yeah, so I had them--

00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:38.850
I knew there were some--

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.700
I had my tour manager
print the lyrics

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.280
to the Kiss song,
"Detroit Rock City,"

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.560
and I made up a whole new
orchestral melody had nothing

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.060
to do.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.185
It has nothing to do
with the original music.

00:20:50.185 --> 00:20:50.820
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.486
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:20:51.486 --> 00:20:54.520
LAURA MURPHY: It's interesting
to attend a symphony

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.930
and hear hecklers.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.250
It's not usually something
that you hear, but--

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.000
But really, in this case,
it's become something.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.920
Do you hear it at
your other shows, too?

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.090
Do you ever get someone--

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.170
BEN FOLDS: You don't think
of the symphony they like,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.058
more Adagio!

00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:07.781
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:09.117
LAURA MURPHY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:09.783
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.800
LAURA MURPHY: How do you
deal with hecklers otherwise?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.020
Or is that not really a
thing, because your fans

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.690
are so ingrained with you?

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.870
BEN FOLDS: I think most of
my audience is pretty nice.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.820
People speak up.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.710
But that is the thing
with the orchestra,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.810
in that it's gone through--

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.500
historically, it's gone
through a lot of periods.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.210
In Mozart's time,
is good example,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.800
it was coming back to
a more informal time.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.849
And he encouraged people
to clap between movements.

00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:42.640
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.380
BEN FOLDS: You're
looked at as an idiot

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.460
if you clap between
movements now.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.960
Used to be--

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.260
I mean, there have been
eras of classical music

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:57.400
where they drank, played folk
songs in the middle of it,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.890
composer would bring out
one of his new tunes,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.007
but then would play all
kinds of other stuff.

00:22:02.007 --> 00:22:02.840
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.080
BEN FOLDS: So it's
become another thing.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.710
And I think it's
intimidating to people.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:13.390
And so, you know, I think it's
nice that they can actually--

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.430
I don't think heckling
is probably great.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.820
But I think it's good that they
can feel comfortable enough

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.060
at the symphony to be a little
less formal, I think is good.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.940
At the same time, I think
that the symphony orchestra,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.359
as an institution, needn't dumb
a note down at all in order

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:34.900
to accommodate for that, or in
order to bring in more people.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.920
They don't have to play
like children's movie music,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.953
and put a screen up,
and shit like that.

00:22:44.617 --> 00:22:45.700
LAURA MURPHY: That's true.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.480
So you're basically our
modern day Mozart with this.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.230
BEN FOLDS: Oh, no.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.396
LAURA MURPHY: So, thank you.

00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:51.090
[LAUGHS]

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.881
BEN FOLDS: I've already
lived a lot longer.

00:22:52.881 --> 00:22:53.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.520
LAURA MURPHY: So,
outside of this,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.032
any other connections
to Detroit?

00:22:59.032 --> 00:23:01.240
We know you're playing at
the Fillmore tonight, which

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.150
is an unbelievable venue.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.650
Then--

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.524
BEN FOLDS: The Fillmore
was the State, right?

00:23:05.524 --> 00:23:06.360
Am I right?

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.800
LAURA MURPHY: Correct.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.830
BEN FOLDS: When it
was a State Theater--

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.621
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:11.960
BEN FOLDS: --I was
very excited to have--

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.950
when I went solo
was right around--

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.750
my album was released,
first solo album

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.790
was released on 9/11.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.740
And that was pretty much it.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.107
Anyone who put out a record
that day, there was nothing.

00:23:27.107 --> 00:23:28.690
You didn't hear more
from that record.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.700
The record was called
"Rocking the Suburbs."

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.190
And it pretty much
died commercially.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.590
And so I went out and
played solo for a while.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.060
And the idea was that I
probably couldn't play anymore

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:45.910
to like to 250 people, and
that was it for my career.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.430
That's what was
discussed in my circle.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.080
It was pretty
much, this is over.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.790
Your album's not doing well.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.980
You're going to play for
a couple hundred people,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.050
and if you're cool with
that, then keep doing it.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.010
I was like, that's fine.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.759
I'll just do that.

00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:03.400
So we got in a van, and
I just went solo piano.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.210
And over the course of the
year, we went from our 250

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.940
to selling out places
like the State.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.080
So it all came back.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.880
And it was fine

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.710
The State Theater
was one of those

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.180
that I was really excited
about having sold out.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.210
It was in a row of ones like.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.360
Problem is, is I came
down with pneumonia

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.420
and played the State
Theater with a 105 fever.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.170
LAURA MURPHY: Ugh.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:26.822
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:24:26.822 --> 00:24:28.780
BEN FOLDS: And I did the
whole thing like that.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.580
And then, just
because I'm stubborn,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.620
I decided I'm going to
walk out on the sidewalk.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.180
It's two degrees outside.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:40.240
And signed shit for 45 minutes.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.300
And then I did the same thing
in Chicago, the next night.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.820
Still it just ran--
like, I would break down

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.710
to like 102 and go back up 105.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.252
I was about to have
some kind of fit.

00:24:49.252 --> 00:24:50.001
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:24:50.001 --> 00:24:51.760
BEN FOLDS: It was
terrible on your brain.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.130
And I play Chicago,
and I fell over.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.700
A total VH1 "Behind the Music."

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.860
I walked off the stage,
and all of a sudden,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.800
I just kind of
remember, like, it's

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.990
going to be really
embarrassing if I pass out

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.920
in front of people.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.750
And I made it to the soundboard.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.690
And there was a really
nice, good-looking guy

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.210
with shaved, bald
head in a suit.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.700
It was a security guy.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.020
And he's like, I got you.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.180
I think he carried
me downstairs.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.749
And I woke up back home.

00:25:23.749 --> 00:25:25.290
LAURA MURPHY: Did
you stop your tour?

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:25.850
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.310
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.930
Oh.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.430
I hope--

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.110
BEN FOLDS: But I made
it to that point.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.830
Like, I made it--

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.621
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:32.380
BEN FOLDS: --my career
[LAUGHS] was back.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.452
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:33.452 --> 00:25:34.410
My health, not so much.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.576
LAURA MURPHY: Nothing a
little pneumonia can't cure.

00:25:36.576 --> 00:25:39.772
[LAUGHS] Well, I'm sorry.

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:41.230
I'm glad you're
feeling better now.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:42.680
We're glad you're here
and healthy tonight.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.784
BEN FOLDS: All better.

00:25:43.784 --> 00:25:46.020
LAURA MURPHY:
[LAUGHS] All right.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:46.660
So--

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.535
BEN FOLDS: I was trying
to think of a Detroit

00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:49.480
story I remembered.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.470
I like the book store.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.590
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, anything?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.030
BEN FOLDS: That John King
bookstore, I love that.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.420
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
that's a good--

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.200
BEN FOLDS: That's fun.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.810
LAURA MURPHY: The
John King bookstore.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.476
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:56.290
LAURA MURPHY: The city
is alive right now.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:56.725
BEN FOLDS: It's neat.

00:25:56.725 --> 00:25:57.160
LAURA MURPHY: It's come back.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.368
BEN FOLDS: No, it really has.

00:25:58.368 --> 00:25:59.080
It's really neat.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.750
LAURA MURPHY: Our office
is making a move down

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.034
to Detroit next year, so--

00:26:03.034 --> 00:26:03.700
BEN FOLDS: Cool.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.980
LAURA MURPHY: --when
you're back in town.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.350
BEN FOLDS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.900
LAURA MURPHY: Any other--

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.900
BEN FOLDS: Oh, I know
this is Birmingham.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.220
That's right.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:07.870
LAURA MURPHY: This
is Birmingham.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.675
BEN FOLDS: We were
talking about Detroit--

00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:08.980
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.200
BEN FOLDS: But--

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.240
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.875
BEN FOLDS: I do like to
watch that Sports Illustrated

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:14.815
and there's a special.

00:26:14.815 --> 00:26:17.980
I think it's called "30 for 30"
on the bad boys on the Pistons.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.643
I've seen it like
five times now.

00:26:19.643 --> 00:26:20.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.349
It's so fun.

00:26:21.349 --> 00:26:23.890
LAURA MURPHY: And Dennis Rodman
is, of course, your favorite.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.180
BEN FOLDS: Oh, I
think he's amazing.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.555
Yeah.

00:26:25.555 --> 00:26:26.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.055 --> 00:26:26.780
No, I do.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.850
What a character.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.570
Yeah.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.403
LAURA MURPHY: He is.

00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:29.990
Yeah.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.490
OK.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.070
So in the vein of
music, any other bands

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.030
you're into right now?

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.510
BEN FOLDS: No.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.730
LAURA MURPHY: Anything-- no?

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.730
BEN FOLDS: It's just me.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:37.824 --> 00:26:38.740
LAURA MURPHY: Perfect.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.490
Yeah, that's good.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.960
BEN FOLDS: I may
as well be honest.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.280
No.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.306
You know, I just listen to
a lot of stuff that's not--

00:26:46.306 --> 00:26:47.180
I mean, I don't know.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.962
I-- the way I feel about it
right now, at this moment,

00:26:50.962 --> 00:26:52.420
is that if something
really, really

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.000
catches my ear for a
really profound reason,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.180
I'll go back and revisit.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:58.971
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:58.971 --> 00:27:02.940
BEN FOLDS: Otherwise, at this
very moment, I'm so much more

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.630
caught up with
200 years of music

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.940
that I missed because
I wasn't born yet.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.370
And that's a lot of great
stuff to catch up on.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.120
LAURA MURPHY: Mhm.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.090
BEN FOLDS: My job was to
know about it all the time.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.160
And now I just kind
of feel like it's

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.890
a relief not to have to
know every little crappy

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.809
thing that comes out.

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:23.100
Because there's some really
interesting and good stuff,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.820
too.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.260
But I don't find it
anymore inspiring to hear

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.520
someone's indie rock mating
call, which is essentially

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.219
what it is, next to say the
housekeeping person singing out

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.760
in the hall that
might sound amazing.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.470
To me, it's like,
well, that's great.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.600
That's great music.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.060
And I don't have
to hear everything.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.100
But when something
really great comes out,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.340
you know, like I think the last
few things that really struck

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.380
me were, one, Caroline Shaw.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.910
I think Caroline Shaw
is just a damn genius.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.450
And I liked Dirty
Projectors, but I

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.720
think maybe they're gone now?

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.430
Are they still--

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.914
AUDIENCE: Still
going [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:03.580
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.550
OK, good.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.000
I like Dirty Projectors.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.750
You know, and every
once in a while I hear

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.380
something on the radio I
think it's kind of cool.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.615
I like that one
Justin Bieber song

00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:11.810
about how you've got
to love yourself.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.601
That's pretty good.

00:28:12.601 --> 00:28:13.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:15.450
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.900
So, music today sucks.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.410
But the stuff that you're--

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.743
BEN FOLDS: No, I don't think so.

00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:20.300
I think music it is incredible.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.100
I think I don't see the need
at the moment to package it.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.959
I just-- my head's
not in that space.

00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:26.750
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.630
BEN FOLDS: I'm not
excited about the--

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.320
it almost feels like
Vogue magazine covers

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.610
to me, even the good stuff.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.370
I just can't get my head
around it, at the moment.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.470
That's just honestly
where my head's at.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.810
LAURA MURPHY: Well, how are
you consuming that other 200

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.530
years of music?

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.115
Are you listening to it on
vinyl, cassette, digital?

00:28:44.115 --> 00:28:45.490
BEN FOLDS: Wherever
I can get it.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.080
I don't-- like, I'll look
at it, like, you know,

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.250
like YouTube is great.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.360
So I go--

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.700
I went down a Bernstein YouTube
wormhole a couple of years ago

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.130
that now has become sort
of like my favorite thing

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.890
to do if I can't sleep,
is to go on there.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.690
I mean, I did go
on YouTube recently

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.335
and see people's videos
about their pet pigs.

00:29:05.335 --> 00:29:06.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.490
I could have been listening
to new music, but I was--

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.680
there's a site called
Squeals on Wheels.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.180
I want--

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.660
I want to buy--

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.332
the one that I really was
in love with, she's gone.

00:29:20.332 --> 00:29:21.790
She's someone--
someone picked her.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.770
LAURA MURPHY: That's amazing.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:26.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:26.280
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.571
LAURA MURPHY: Very fascinating.

00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:29.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.320
All right.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.595
So, Ben, there's--

00:29:31.595 --> 00:29:32.480
BEN FOLDS: Hey, I
want be clear though.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:32.870
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, yeah.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.970
BEN FOLDS: I think there's
a lot of great music.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.690
I really do.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.670
I'm not cynical
about it that way.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.850
I think people are
having amazing ideas.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:41.750
And it's evolving.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.360
And a lot of it's evolving
because how incredibly

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.580
fast ideas are being exchanged.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.200
But the packaging of
it, and the ambition

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.230
of succeeding with it,
and essentially it's

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.039
mating music for about
15 years of your life.

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:57.830
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.060
BEN FOLDS: And now that's
all I can really hear in it.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.380
Like--

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.171
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:30:01.171 --> 00:30:04.950
BEN FOLDS: I see the mirror
and the hairbrush and stuff.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.370
And it makes me want to listen
to Ravel string quartets.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.140
That's all.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.047
LAURA MURPHY: Are you a Spotify,
or a Pandora, or a digital--

00:30:13.047 --> 00:30:15.130
when you're on the road,
and you don't have access

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.754
to some of those
other outlets, are you

00:30:16.754 --> 00:30:19.610
listening to online
or web-based music?

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.410
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, I mean,
I'll grab it wherever

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.200
I can to show somebody.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.210
I liked the idea of
Pandora when it came out.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:31.930
I listen to comedians that way.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.040
I think it's kind of fun
to put in one comedian

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.950
and see who else pops up.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.430
It's kind of interesting.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:43.690
I thought their sort of idea I
thought was really interesting.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.900
So I sort of agree with it.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:51.410
I don't keep up with the sort
of intellectual property rights

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.520
issues on anything.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.284
I never had it out for Spotify,
or Pandora, or any of those.

00:30:56.284 --> 00:30:57.200
LAURA MURPHY: Nabster?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.580
Or anything?

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.329
BEN FOLDS: No, no.

00:30:58.329 --> 00:31:01.730
I wrote letters on
behalf of Nabster

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.040
when they were held up in
some court in California.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.890
And I think I might
have been the only one,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:11.210
besides I think maybe Chuck
D was doing that, as well.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.260
I was asked to do all
these appearances about how

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.180
they were stealing music.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.040
And I couldn't get on with that.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.330
I've never agreed with that.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.080
I don't even agree with it
when someone sues someone

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.270
over a song that sounds
like their old song.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.640
There's just not enough
chords and melodies

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.220
for me to get on with that.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.500
I don't understand it at all.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.490
I know that people have
to make money at it,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:44.900
and I can see that technology
sent musicians back from,

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.432
hey, I could make
millions of dollars to oh,

00:31:47.432 --> 00:31:49.640
I might be standing out on
the street with the monkey

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.710
and piano scrolls again.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.560
But that was a really
short period of time

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.530
where musicians
became millionaires.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:03.540
And so the fact that we got sent
down from that by technology,

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.850
at least for a little
while, you know, oh, well.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.852
I mean, I'm not sure that--

00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:10.560
I think there's--

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.135
I would rather be
concerned about the cutting

00:32:15.135 --> 00:32:16.760
of the National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.290
or paying schoolteachers,
or something than I would

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.430
at making musicians, like
myself, millionaires.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.270
I mean, look--

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.510
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.676
BEN FOLDS: I'm cool with it.

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:26.101
I'm happy to be one at any time.

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:26.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.780
But I think the
technology has made

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.905
people excited about music.

00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:31.738
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:33.990
BEN FOLDS: It's created some
legal problems, which are

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.690
the legal people's problems.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.190
That's--

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.960
That's for us to all deal with.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.220
Seriously.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.480
LAURA MURPHY: They
need jobs, too.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.220
BEN FOLDS: When you--

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.136
when you-- it's right.

00:32:41.136 --> 00:32:43.370
When you make up a
thing, and you're like--

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.137
I mean, god, I was
watching the Ken Burns

00:32:45.137 --> 00:32:47.345
thing on the Civil War and
about how many people were

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:51.370
killed then because technology
had outpaced tactics.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.120
Well, it was time for
tactics to catch up,

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.160
so people get killed at
it, because that's just

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.010
the way it is.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.160
And so I feel like
we're catching up.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.030
And that the music industry
seems, from what I hear,

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.340
to be more robust again.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.852
And everyone can not
worry that technology is

00:33:06.852 --> 00:33:08.060
the end of the world anymore.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.780
But we may find
ourselves, as musicians,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.650
questioning the value
of a note or a song.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.540
And it used to be pretty clear.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.230
Like a song is 1/10 of
an album, and an album

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.960
is worth 12.99, or
something like that.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.009
You know, then that
change to-- technology

00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:27.800
redefined it and said,
no, actually, a song

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.145
is worth nothing.

00:33:30.145 --> 00:33:32.270
You know, it was like, oh,
OK, is it worth nothing?

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.910
Well, but people started
becoming music therapists,

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.180
and doing other things
with their lives.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.720
And music then-- it's
found to sell other things

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.130
when it's packaged with it.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.940
And music has always
needed context.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.260
So to me, it's all just
always going to be a mess.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.050
Which is part of the reason I
think I sort of divorced myself

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.640
from it all, except for
being someone that goes,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.974
oh, I want to find that song.

00:33:54.974 --> 00:33:57.140
And I just put in a search
and wherever it comes up,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.077
I play it.

00:33:58.077 --> 00:33:59.910
LAURA MURPHY: It's
interesting you say that,

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.540
because I was going to ask
you about this quote of yours.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.880
But another quote of
yours that I love so much,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.770
you were doing an
interview where you said,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.360
write the bad songs.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.940
Like writing the bad songs
could be one of the best things

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.210
that you do.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.889
So if you would talk--

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:12.149
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:13.523
LAURA MURPHY: --a
little bit more

00:34:13.523 --> 00:34:16.260
about what you think
may bad songs are?

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.178
Or why you think that theory?

00:34:18.178 --> 00:34:20.469
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, well, I
mean, I think you have to be--

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.260
and I think almost--
this is almost cliche.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.330
I mean, in any artist I think
worth anything will probably

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.386
admit that you need
to be OK with failing.

00:34:33.386 --> 00:34:34.219
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.545
BEN FOLDS: I mean, you
have to be OK with failing.

00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:35.820
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.460
BEN FOLDS: But,
you know, the chips

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.389
are going to fall to an extent.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:41.630
You're always collaborating.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.340
Kind of like what I'm
saying about technology.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.060
It is like a song collaborating
with the circumstances.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.360
You can't be responsible for
the rest of the circumstances.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.192
You're collaborating your half.

00:34:52.192 --> 00:34:54.650
If someone's religious, they
can say the other half is god.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.750
If they want to say
it's the universe,

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.875
they can it's the universe.

00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:58.970
And they can say it's
mistakes or chance.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.650
But you're collaborating
with something.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.270
If I'm writing a
song right now, it's

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.520
going to be a different song
than I would write if you

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.290
put me in another situation.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:10.520
You know, so you have to be
OK with the dynamics of life.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.800
Without the downs, you don't
have the ups, well, you

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.150
don't have the downs.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.960
And you know, it's kind of
like people worry about,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.140
I don't know, you know, like
music businesses going out

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.970
of business.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.420
I'm sure they worry
about news, for instance.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.730
But people will consume news.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:30.450
People need it.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.490
And so it's going to happen.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.240
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.250
BEN FOLDS: Someone-- we're
all going to figure this out,

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.650
because you're not going to
unsee the technology that you

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:38.150
have.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.700
And I think the same thing is
true when you think of a note.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.140
Or you think of
a part of a song.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.520
It's like, well, that was bad.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.460
Well, that's part of your life.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.200
You know, so now
maybe that spurs you

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.489
to think of something better.

00:35:50.489 --> 00:35:52.280
But there's got to be
a trajectory running.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.690
And I think that one of the
things about improvising

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.880
a song in front of
an audience always

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.730
reminds me about those moments.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.730
It reminds me that things
have to shift in order to save

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.050
something that's going down.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.250
And then it goes
up, and it's never

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.420
what you think it's going to be.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.919
If you knew what
it was going to be,

00:36:07.919 --> 00:36:09.606
you would have
written a song before.

00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:10.980
It would have
already been there.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.480
There's a point
where you're writing

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.480
and it's just ahead of
you, and it's coming out.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.980
And if what you've done is just
gone down the roller coaster

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.050
to the bottom, then
you get to head up.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.200
And if you apply your ego
to writing songs too much,

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.140
you assume that every note has
to be taken as the best thing.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.149
Every phrase.

00:36:27.149 --> 00:36:29.190
I have when people say,
like, that's a good line.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.942
Ugh.

00:36:29.942 --> 00:36:31.790
I don't give a shit about that.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.560
Like I want a trip.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.780
It's not like a list of
quotes from John Bartlett's

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.510
book of quotes.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.260
LAURA MURPHY: Mhm.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.310
BEN FOLDS: It's like
life, which does that.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.231
LAURA MURPHY: A story.

00:36:42.231 --> 00:36:43.230
BEN FOLDS: It's a story.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.750
Like, that's
actually what it is.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:45.450
It's a story.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.700
And you don't know
what the story is.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.840
That's part of the story.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.048
You haven't gotten there yet.

00:36:50.048 --> 00:36:50.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.750
So when you're improvising on
stage, or you're making a song,

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.670
embracing the moments that seem
to you, judgmentally, to be bad

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:04.500
is you have to get through
it to get to the next point.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.770
You can't decide
to just dismiss it.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.080
It's like, you know,
like it's scientifically

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.540
proven when you sneeze
and you repress it,

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.970
it blows up all
your brain cells.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.570
It's not.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.482
But if sneeze--

00:37:16.482 --> 00:37:17.690
LAURA MURPHY: Scientifically.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.510
BEN FOLDS: Yes, scientifically.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.760
LAURA MURPHY: Scientifically--

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.030
BEN FOLDS: If you sneeze, cough,
and burp at the same time,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.530
your heart will
stop and you'll die.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.950
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, I heard it's
impossible to do that, right?

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:26.490
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, you'll die.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.360
LAURA MURPHY: No
one's ever done it.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.735
BEN FOLDS: No
one's ever done it.

00:37:28.735 --> 00:37:29.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.051
LAURA MURPHY: Well, wow.

00:37:31.051 --> 00:37:33.300
BEN FOLDS: I hope you just
cut these little bits out--

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.124
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.399
--and just put those
online, so people learn--

00:37:37.399 --> 00:37:38.190
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.000
BEN FOLDS: --lessons.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.540
LAURA MURPHY: Well, yeah.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.780
We'll do that take.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.630
We'll just more quotes
from you up on--

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.710
BEN FOLDS: Yeah,
that I don't even

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.921
acknowledge when I'm talking.

00:37:44.921 --> 00:37:45.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.560
I'm just like, whatever
that said, I don't know.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.627
I'm just going to talk.

00:37:48.627 --> 00:37:49.460
LAURA MURPHY: Well--

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.340
BEN FOLDS: Is that
my handwriting?

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:50.710
It looks really--

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.885
LAURA MURPHY: No,
that's-- that's-- no.

00:37:51.885 --> 00:37:53.240
BEN FOLDS: It's very consistent.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:53.700
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.290
Very.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.400
Well, OK, so at
this point, I want

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.786
to make sure I don't
hog all of you,

00:37:58.786 --> 00:38:00.660
because there's a ton
of questions out there.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.350
So does anyone have
any questions for Ben?

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.485
Someone want to be brave
and kick us off here?

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.610
BEN FOLDS: Come at me, bro.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.034 --> 00:38:11.700
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, we
got one right here.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.310
AUDIENCE: You're clearly
an entrepreneur of works.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.680
Did you start out seeing
yourself that way?

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.642
Or did that come about
through your career?

00:38:19.642 --> 00:38:21.890
Or do you not see
yourself that way at all?

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.280
BEN FOLDS: Oh, I think
entrepreneur is a great--

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.660
I think it should be
acknowledged more often,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.860
that musicians, recording
artists, actually most of us

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.960
are, and have that gene.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.730
Mostly because I
found when I started

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:41.915
to do arts advocacy
on Capitol Hill,

00:38:41.915 --> 00:38:44.790
and I'm talking to a lot of
Senators and Congressmen,

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.520
I could see a real
discrimination

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.340
against the artist as
being someone who obviously

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.230
doesn't understand numbers.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.660
And I'm wanting to
say, look, bitch,

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.920
I can balance a checkbook.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.450
Because I started for like
five years in a van on fumes.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:06.580
Like a rock band knows that they
have a business that they're

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.830
running, looks for
the opportunities,

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:09.890
is creative about it.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.530
And at the same
time, has to balance

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.280
the checkbook, has to get from
A to B, knows how to do it.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.799
I didn't inherit,
you know, a lot

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:20.715
of money like a lot of
these guys that I go in

00:39:20.715 --> 00:39:22.580
and talk to have.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.640
And so I consider
myself with quite a chip

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.060
on my shoulder probably
a lot better businessman.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.610
And I think as far
as entrepreneurship,

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:34.180
yeah, I mean, you know,
I think most creative--

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.190
it's a matter of
culture that we would

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.710
prefer to see our artist as,
you know, the guy who rolled out

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:50.410
of bed, smoked a joint, saw
the future, and wrote about it.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.890
I think that sells
human beings short.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.900
And I enjoy seeing
an opportunity--

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.770
a thing that hasn't
been covered.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.360
That's totally capitalistic.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.680
Like, this is awesome.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.020
I can make a shit ton of
money doing that, you know?

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.890
I think that's fun.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.010
Like, I recognized when we
started that there were no--

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.740
you did not go to a rock show
and see a piano, a real piano,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.340
on stage.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.530
So I thought, well,
I could probably

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.180
bypass a whole lot
of competition,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:24.400
if I just bothered to move a
baby grand piano onto a stage.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.020
That's so audacious.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:31.000
So we played our punk rock
clubs where we weren't welcome.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.180
It was-- I think it was
probably threatening

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.010
the establishment
of the punk rock

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.930
community, which I enjoyed.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:40.475 --> 00:40:42.840
It's like it turned
them into the old man.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.647
You can't put piano
on that stage, kid!

00:40:45.647 --> 00:40:46.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.960
And yeah, and ever since then,
I still do the same thing.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.750
And you know, as far as kind of
running the business part of it

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.484
goes, and to tie it back to
technology, if I were a CEO,

00:40:57.484 --> 00:40:59.150
I would be the kind
that would be fairly

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.380
hands off about the
technology but said,

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.860
I recognize that you
three people, you kids,

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.880
seem to be very
interested in this.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.056
So go nuts.

00:41:08.056 --> 00:41:10.055
Throw it all against the
wall, see what happens.

00:41:10.055 --> 00:41:11.070
LAURA MURPHY: You would
empower your people.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:11.730
BEN FOLDS: I-- absolutely.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.150
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.066
BEN FOLDS: That's, I
mean, that's always been.

00:41:14.066 --> 00:41:16.010
I mean, we, as a
result, like, I think

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.917
I played the first
Myspace broadcast

00:41:18.917 --> 00:41:20.750
and have all these
things are sort of first.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:24.200
Like I think I put the
first iTunes EPs out.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.390
Had three number one
records on iTunes

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.920
because there wasn't that
much competition yet.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.770
Tried to do it with no CDs.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:35.030
This was in 2003 maybe,
tried to do it with no CDs,

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.980
and vinyl and digital.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.020
Just because I thought
that would be cool.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.050
And you guys just take it
and make it do something.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.740
You know, and I enjoyed
that way of doing it.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.790
But [INAUDIBLE]
entrepreneurship.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.010
But I like that word,
and I think it's cool.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.680
I think more artists--

00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:00.170
I mean, look, Charles Ives,
one of our great composers

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.890
of the turn of the century,
20th century, he did two things.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:10.730
He made some of our most really
distinct creative or original

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.740
avant garde American music.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.060
And he also revamped
the insurance business,

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.040
life insurance business.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.290
That wouldn't be cool in
the '90s, if Kurt Cobain had

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.615
said, yeah, man, I was just
thinking about life insurance.

00:42:25.615 --> 00:42:26.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:30.830
You know, like that doesn't
work in my generation much,

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.840
but I think it's cool.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.590
AUDIENCE: How did you
get out and convince

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.984
these bars and punk rock clubs
to let you you play there?

00:42:35.984 --> 00:42:36.650
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.024
AUDIENCE: And when
in your career

00:42:38.024 --> 00:42:40.070
did you realize that
you were finally--

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.385
or what did you do to
get to the next level?

00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:45.380
BEN FOLDS: Well, it had
been such a long time.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.880
You know, this is--
you're obviously

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.280
talking when I was
like 27-years-old when

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.922
the band started.

00:42:50.922 --> 00:42:52.774
LAURA MURPHY: And
you're 28 or 9 now?

00:42:52.774 --> 00:42:53.440
BEN FOLDS: Four.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.780
AUDIENCE: One other
thing to add to that.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.610
Did you know when you
started that that's

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.610
where you wanted to get?

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.737
Or was it just for
fun at the beginning?

00:43:02.737 --> 00:43:04.070
BEN FOLDS: A little bit of both.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.880
I came from working class south.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.790
And that's-- being
a musician is not--

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.340
that's not even cool to say.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.460
I mean, I think like in
the equivalent in the UK

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:21.030
might actually be kind of cool
to be a musician, if you were--

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.410
but I think it's like
singing, nah, that's off.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.870
That's-- You're a sissy.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.440
But playing music is only
something that, you know,

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.430
that some sort of
elite fruitcakes

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.470
with like tight
leather pants do.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.840
You could teach, but
who wants to do that?

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.000
So I kind of kept it to myself.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.190
I kept my whole-- but I
knew I was a musician.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.690
I think I knew I
was going to do it.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.190
I was stubborn about it.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:49.150
And, you know, I spent from
when I was maybe 18 to last year

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.775
when I was 27--

00:43:49.775 --> 00:43:51.452
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.452 --> 00:43:52.910
That's really
supposed to be funny.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.858
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.930
You know I wrote songs,
and sent them in as tapes,

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.600
and tried to do-- tried to
get the approval that one

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.880
would need to make a record.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.720
And I wasn't getting it.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.890
So I just started doing
what I wanted to do,

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.040
which is to play shows.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.150
I had-- if I remember, it was a
little bit of a rocky long ride

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.220
on this piano business,
putting pianos in.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.400
Because I fought to do that.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.960
And I borrowed
some money somehow,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.960
I got some kind of little
loan, to get a piano.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.520
And then I snuck back to
the soundboard at a really

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.700
kind of small Elton John gig to
talk to a sound man about how

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.168
he made his piano loud,
because I was at the show,

00:44:37.168 --> 00:44:39.104
and I was like,
well, I can hear it.

00:44:39.104 --> 00:44:41.270
Which I happened to know
was really difficult to do,

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:42.880
because we'd stuck
mics in at one time

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.921
and you couldn't hear it.

00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:44.600
It didn't work.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.690
So we found out some
technical things.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.190
And it was just all long trips.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.070
That was maybe one was like 22.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:52.671
So between 22 and
27, it was just

00:44:52.671 --> 00:44:54.920
a matter of me being stubborn
and trying to figure out

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.790
how to amplify the piano, should
I ever find myself in a rock

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.710
band to put it on stage.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.860
And it's just a real
long road, I think.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.050
But it's good because I
would say in that time

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:10.250
I sort of found my voice.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:14.510
I became increasingly
stubborn, because I

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.030
started to realize the
folly in trying to get--

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.660
in trying to get approval.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:25.220
And I started to realize the
advantage of placing yourself

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.480
in positions that seemed
insane, like the idea

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.120
of rolling yourself between
some band called Fucking Death

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.230
Grip and Santa's Cock.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.081
And playing-- sorry, just
whatever comes to my head.

00:45:39.081 --> 00:45:39.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.930
And playing a piano
rock show between that,

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.020
and then going back to
waiting tables the next day.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.320
And as I saw that
working, but slowly.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.470
So we would try to book gigs.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:58.670
I had a couple of friends,
and we were trying to--

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.305
I had some help, but I was
mostly doing it myself.

00:46:01.305 --> 00:46:02.680
Try to book a gig,
and of course,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.810
they'd say, yeah, we can
put you on on folk night

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:05.680
over at this place.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.310
And there's a upright piano
when they're drinking tea.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.510
It's like, no, I kind
of want to play in the--

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.320
and I think we should play
like opening up on a Monday

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.660
night for a grunge band.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.920
I think that would be better.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.130
It just took a while.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.490
I had to turn down
a lot of stuff.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.205
Also, we had to
turn down anything

00:46:23.205 --> 00:46:24.580
that the piano
wouldn't fit into.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.454
For like three to five
years of touring, even

00:46:26.454 --> 00:46:28.704
with an indie record
label behind us,

00:46:28.704 --> 00:46:30.120
they would want
us to play a place

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.330
like called Eddie's Attic.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:32.996
Well, you can't move
a piano up to that.

00:46:32.996 --> 00:46:34.300
We were moving it ourselves.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.490
I mean, I can move a
grand piano myself,

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.795
out of here onto a
truck, and off she goes.

00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:42.370
I just learned how to do it.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:43.260
I figured it out.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.590
And you know, that's
kind of the trip.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:46.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:47.340
LAURA MURPHY: Oh--

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.214
BEN FOLDS: I'm sorry.

00:46:48.214 --> 00:46:50.470
But it enabled me to see
something that I've always--

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.600
well, I-- sometimes, you
just want to see a thing.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.266
Like, if I made a
movie, I'd go, oh, I'd

00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:57.100
like to make a Victorian
love story, and at the very

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:00.670
end the spaceship lands, and
some orange guy gets out of it,

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.290
and starts saying crazy shit.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.570
You know, like, you can
do anything you want to,

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.390
if you put your mind
to seeing something,

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.900
even if it's a little
odd that you want to see,

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.320
then you're the
only one doing it.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.587
And I think that's
worked, luckily.

00:47:13.587 --> 00:47:14.170
Most the time.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.130
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.922
Sometimes it doesn't
work at all, you know.

00:47:16.922 --> 00:47:18.338
LAURA MURPHY: I
think we only have

00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:19.480
time for one more question.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.037
Is there

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:20.536
anything--

00:47:20.536 --> 00:47:22.150
BEN FOLDS: Especially if
I don't talk that much.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.031
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah?

00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:23.530
Lindsey?

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.327
AUDIENCE: So if you to
write a song for Google,

00:47:26.327 --> 00:47:28.910
what would the story, I guess,
because we're not saying words,

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:29.740
what would that be?

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.153
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:31.153 --> 00:47:33.684
LAURA MURPHY: That's
a good question.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.725
BEN FOLDS: Well, I wouldn't
write that right now.

00:47:35.725 --> 00:47:37.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.700
Because it'd be
really-- it'd be vapid.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:45.530
But I-- it would
probably be about--

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.880
it would probably be about being
with a bunch of cigar-smoking

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.980
fat guys in the front of--

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:00.310
like in the first
class of an airplane.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.800
And then the next time I
went in, it was all guys that

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.760
looked like me, the next trip.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.302
Like something like that.

00:48:06.302 --> 00:48:07.885
You know, something
to show, because I

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:09.760
think there was a
change when I realized

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:15.280
that the first class
went from being

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:22.490
fat cigar-smoking white guys
to a whole variety of people,

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:23.980
many of them that
looked like me.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.840
And it happened
within like a year.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.000
And I feel like there was
Google in there somewhere.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.910
And it was almost like--

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.567
maybe as some metaphors, there
could be some oxygen. You know,

00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:34.900
oxygen's always a good metaphor.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.691
But, I mean, like--

00:48:35.691 --> 00:48:37.250
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.180
BEN FOLDS: You've got your
cigars, some breathing--

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.050
something in there.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:41.549
Yeah.

00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:43.630
Because I used to
like, if I would ever

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.389
get lucky, and be
like, oh, we're

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.930
going to fly you to
a TV show, so you

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.650
get to sit in the
front of the plane.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.850
I was always asked to go
back to my seat in coach.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:52.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.570
And then I would--
you pissed me off.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:58.420
And I'm all, I've got
my ticket right here!

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.010
Why do you think I'm not here!

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:00.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.630
And then all of a sudden one
year, it's like, oh, Mr. Folds,

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.290
have a seat.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:07.000
And that was like my
people had arrived.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:12.220
And I feel like people
my age had ideas.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.140
And the ideas took over.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.557
And then that might
be something--

00:49:15.557 --> 00:49:17.264
there would be something
like that in it,

00:49:17.264 --> 00:49:18.620
and it would take me a while.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.890
I would work off of
note cards for this one.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.360
And I would probably
set myself up

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.270
with a little bottle of Scotch
for about four nights in a row,

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:30.400
lock myself in my room with note
cards, and a toy bass guitar.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.320
AUDIENCE: What kind of
Scotch do you drink?

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.120
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.480
BEN FOLDS: Well, let's see.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.362
You know, what when I'm on
tour, and not in a pinch.

00:49:41.362 --> 00:49:42.070
I won't say that.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.960
It doesn't sound nice.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.490
But it's-- you can't always
get everything you want.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.220
So Lagavulin is
always out there,

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.300
which is a real good bet.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.760
Let's see.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.660
I like Ardbeg, both the 12
and 16 ages are really nice.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.440
There's some really kind of
rare whiskies that are basically

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.950
scotch that come from Tasmania,
Hobart, one called Lark,

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:06.880
and one called Nant.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.090
Those are--

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:07.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.830
BEN FOLDS: --probably
the best I've had.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.080
And they're kind
of like the Scotch

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.300
that you-- or the whiskeys
that you get in Japan,

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.710
the ones that won
all the awards.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:15.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.030
LAURA MURPHY: I think you just
get an invite to the next Men

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.199
at Google Bourbon Night.

00:50:19.199 --> 00:50:20.240
AUDIENCE: After the show.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.224
AUDIENCE: Tonight
after the show!

00:50:21.224 --> 00:50:22.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:22.870
BEN FOLDS: Oh, awesome.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.860
LAURA MURPHY: Tonight
after the show.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.810
AUDIENCE: We have
the Lark [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:26.600
BEN FOLDS: Really?

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.880
Lark's kind of hard to get
your hands on, that's really--

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.048
LAURA MURPHY: I
know where he lives,

00:50:29.048 --> 00:50:30.110
so we can head back there.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:30.310
Yeah.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.540
BEN FOLDS: See, but
the thing is, is we're

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.720
heading right for that
fat cigar-smoking guy.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.652
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:34.652 --> 00:50:37.437
But really in about 20
years, we'll be that guy.

00:50:37.437 --> 00:50:39.770
And these other people will
come along with these ideas,

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.880
and we'll be going, back when it
was Google, and it was proper.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.169
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:44.169 --> 00:50:45.835
LAURA MURPHY: I don't
know about proper.

00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:47.870
BEN FOLDS: Oh, you
know what I thought?

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.720
It just popped into my head.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.700
When I was-- and I went
to an experimental school.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.830
It called Moore
experimental school.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.250
It was kind of a hippie,
completely public

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:04.740
it was like 50/50
racially integrated school

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.590
in the middle of the '70s.

00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:11.000
So I was bused a long
way, went to this school,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.110
and we sat on the floor.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:16.650
We never used desks.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.590
A lot of our class was
done in dry erase stuff.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.540
And 90 people in a classroom,
sitting on the floor.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.000
So it was a really
unusual school.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:26.570
LAURA MURPHY: Was this
in North Carolina?

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.060
BEN FOLDS: North Carolina.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.851
This was West [INAUDIBLE],,
North Carolina.

00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:33.680
And we had a thing called
mini society, where we would

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.610
make a business for an hour.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.170
You'd make a business,
and then that

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.480
would be that class
would the mini society.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.800
And we all got to vote on what
we called the currency, when

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.804
I was in fourth grade.

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:48.720
I was in fourth grade.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.660
So this is 1974, something like.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:53.690
'75.

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:57.230
And I won with the name
of the currency that year.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.720
And so that year, the currency
was called the Google.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.320
That's true.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:00.860
LAURA MURPHY: No.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.790
BEN FOLDS: That's true.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:02.150
LAURA MURPHY: Really?

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.660
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.410
It was the Google.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.080
That's what-- what I--

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.740
I'd made up the Google, so I--

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.239
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:09.239 --> 00:52:10.530
LAURA MURPHY: Here you have it.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.530
Best Google talk ever.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:12.030
[LAUGHS]

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.780
[APPLAUSE]
