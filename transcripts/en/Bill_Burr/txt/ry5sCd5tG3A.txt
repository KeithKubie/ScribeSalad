Speaker 1:          00:00          Here's a good one. Should I kick my neighbor's ass? Uh, yes, yes. Generally speaking, yes. Yes. Uh, hey, bill loved the podcast. No. Yeah, that's east coast. Oh, okay. Uh, that's why people bitch. Where the fuck is a podcast? I need some advice on what to do about the gut. This guy lives in a few houses down from me. I'm a third year college student and I live at home. My parents moved, uh, to go live in the state above mine. I mean north and I currently reside, uh, alone while they are trying to sell the house. A few months ago I was driving home, coming back from a gym and while I was driving in my neighborhood, I saw this guy step in the middle of the road, about 20 yards from my car. He was yelling something at me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I slowed down and stopped my car right in front of him and he came to my window and told me to get out. I was totally confused and thought I'd run over. I thought I ran over his cat or something. Also, I think he just moved in because I never seen the dude in my life. So I rolled down the window and ass. What did you say? He goes, I'm going to kick your fucking ass. Get out of the car. This guy's probably in his forties and asked to be around five 10 is that, is this me? I'm 250 pounds. That's not me. I'm 21 six three 200 I do crossfit and I wrestle occasionally at another gym I go to. So I get out of the car and I'm standing there trying to figure it out. What the Hell is going on? The guy starts moving towards me, so I take the initiative and take a step towards him.

Speaker 1:          01:29          We ended up being an inch from each other and he's trying to do some alpha male shit by just staring at me. But I have the height advantage, so I'm looking down at him. At least 10 seconds go by before the guy goes. How fast do you think you were going back there? I say, I dunno, probably around 30 the speed limit. My neighborhood is 20, and I know I wasn't going that much over it. Then he goes, I'm not going to have my children playing in the yard if I know assholes like you are driving like that in the neighborhood after. Uh, he said that I saw his wife and son were a little off to the side of the road. Once the word asshole left his mouse, I was fucking pissed. I wanted to just tackle the Dick and put him to sleep in front of his wife and kid to teach them a lesson, but I pussied out and just apologize to them and said that I was really Sally, sorry.

Speaker 1:          02:21          And it wouldn't happen again. The guy then gives me a fucking little smirk and turns around and says while walking away with his back, turn it better not or you know what will happen. Ah, yeah, yeah. You definitely should have kicked his ass. You should have kicked his ass. Yeah. What a fuck did you realize? What a good do you realize what this kid did? He's such a fucking gentleman. He could have kicked the fucking shit out of this guy. He saw his wife and kid there. It would've been a masculinity. Yeah. His Dad is superman. He sits there. You know what is? It's that little smirk. Yeah, that fucking smart guy. But that Khan steals from work. Yeah, I bet he, sorry dude. That's the first time I, I literally had to walk away. You fucking cunt. Yeah. He should have kicked that guy's ass. But it's a good cause. It's good that you didn't do it, but because you weren't the bigger person as they say. But he definitely has it come in.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Then he writes snap to do that shit. I wanted to explode. I mean the guy totally disrespect me, so I get in my car and drive off end of the story wrong. I couldn't get this fucking guy out of my head. I t dude, I can't get out of my head. I'm going to actually fantasize that I was there and he did that. What I would want to do, I've already, you know what I would fucking do? I would wait till he was alone. Don't do this shit. Don't do this, but I know what you just want to get, get the guy alone and be like, Hey, what are you going to do now? Huh? What are you going to do now? Just get right in his fucking grill and have him back down. Yeah. Or I would almost just say the guy say, hey listen man, just call them over the car and just say, listen, I just wanted you to know the other day that if I wanted to I could have fucking stuffed you in my trunk.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Tied you up like a fucking pressel and ass rates you in front of your fucking wife. But I chose not to. Okay. Cause I didn't want your son to know what a little fucking f I can't say it. Pussy. Yeah, he has for it. That wouldn't have been homophobic either. I wouldn't be me talking about gay people. That's such a fucking pussy move. Yeah. And if for some reason but, but I'm putting up no, then that's what you say. Maybe do like Colombo to say. Listen man, I got to ask you something cause I'm six foot three, I crossfit. I wrestle. Okay. And just looking at you. I know I could tie into a pretzel. I know I could do it if I want to, but the confidence you had, I just want to know what is your background. You know, cause you know I'm a real competitive guy. You know, if you've got some sort of martial arts training, you know I would love to have you once we didn't. You come down to the gym sometime when your wife and kid aren't there. So I don't have to feel guilty when I fuck you up and close both of your eyes with this one and his friend over here.

Speaker 1:          05:09          What does the rest of the thing say? I don't even need to read it. It's not a but it's not over though. I know. Because this is what's happening now. This is what happens when you do the right thing in life. Okay? When you know you, it eats away at you. You have to make peace. You have to make peace and you've got to tell yourself the lie that someday this guy's going to get his. And you know what? He doesn't guys like this. Don't get theirs. Oh, that's smart. I see this kid, this kid really painted a fucking picture. I can. This is driving me nuts. He goes, I couldn't get this guy out of my head. A week went by and I was still thinking about that asshole too. I would think about this guy. 20 years from now, two weeks later I was driving home from school and I see the guy rolling his garbage can out to the curb.

Speaker 1:          05:55          I slow down to fucking under 20 and I know this because I looked down at my spit, Thomas pedometer. I pretend to stare the guy down, so I look at him and he looks at me and yell, slowdown. Wow. Now when he said that I am fucking raging, I wanted to stop my car and do some ground and pound on his face. Yeah. This kid knows what he's doing. This isn't wrestling like this kid's doing UFC shit, but did I know I just drove off like a fag the next day I talked to my friend about it, about what had happened and he said that this guy said the same shit to him. If he said it, he would have put them on his ass. I know you do. You know what I would've done? He told me that, uh, if he says he's going to kick your ass, then that's a threat so you can defend yourself.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Don't listen to your dumb friend. He's saying you won't get arrested. So a few months have passed and I'm still thinking about this asshole every time I drive by his house. Fast forward, uh, two yesterday and, um, I'm biking in my neighborhood. Let's do an iHeart and I hear a honk from behind me. So I pull my bike over to the side of the road and it's none other than the same dude in his Ford F150 driving along and he looks at me and gives me the middle fucking finger. Wow. Now granted I was in the middle of the road and didn't hear the guy coming because I was listening to music, but still the middle finger. So I bike home, take a shower and try to convince myself to walk over to dude's house and confront him. But after a couple minutes of pacing, I just decided to wait it out until the asshole does one more thing.

Speaker 1:          07:25          I mean, I don't want to get arrested. So my question is what the hell should I do? I mean, every time I drive by this guy's house, now I want to fucking veer off the road and ran my car into the middle of his living room. Any advice would be good. A, all of my friends think I should go over there, but I want a second opinion. Um, you can't do anything to this guy unless he puts his hands on you unless he puts his hands on you. This is just one of these things, but you can do to him what he's doing to you. This guy has an insane temper. So, uh, you know, I'm not advocating legally, so you don't do this, but like, um, I don't, I don't what I would next time, you know, if you see him out in the yard or something, this is what you do.

Speaker 1:          08:11          I have a great idea. Do you have any friends who are really good mechanically? Um, why don't you take your credit card out, go down to the fucking auto store or whatever. I'll go online and buy like one of those fucking train horns and have it installed in your car and next time you drive down the street, just be sort of zigzagging down the street just to get this guy to be fucking, you know, getting all like, Bro, what the fuck? And the second he starts screaming, you lay on that fucking horn as loud as humanly possible and you blow out his ear drums. That's what I would, but then again, then the no one do shit like this. He would say that I have permanent hearing damage. You know what I think you should do? Maybe because I'm a female and I'm all about the cycle of revenge.

Speaker 1:          08:54          Okay. Psychological warfare. What should you, what should he do? I think when the husband is not home, I don't know if how he, if he knows his schedule, whatever he needs to go over there when the wife is at home and be like, listen, you know, I'm so sorry about that time that I was speeding. I really, you know, but your, your husband seems really upset. I'm really not trying to be like that. I would never do anything like that. And women are like, oh no, no, no. Cause she knows her husband is a psycho. Right. And like, I mean she could turn around and be like, yeah, you shouldn't do that either. But I have a feeling she's not like that and he can just go over and just make nice and be like the sweet kid that's helping out or oh, do you need me to take the bowels out?

Speaker 1:          09:30          And then, but then the, I feel like maybe that would fuck with the husband and he's like sitting there sipping tea with the wife and Oh look who came over. He just wanted to apologize in person. And you know, I dunno. I Dunno. There's there's, and then fuck the wife. You No, no, no. He should fuck his wife. He should fucking play with his kid in the backyard. Like the toss the football around with him. Be More like rather he never had nothing like just start keeping him in a finger. Listen, this is the deal. All you gotta do is just give him the finger, give him the finger right back. Cause uh, this guy thinks you're a bitch right now. So all you got to do is, you know, you can just yell back. Just say, you know, just give them the finger, yell back at him when he's in the driveway.

Speaker 1:          10:15          I would like swerve, add him and then swerve back. Just fuck with the guy. He's an, I mean just do that once because the next time you might have like a video camera, but um, uh, I, I just don't wanna get any, I don't get any. You know what? If I was in that situation, uh, dude, you know what I would dope. Yeah. Oh Monday morning quarterback. Look while I was in that situation with that other guy, right? Yeah. At the last place we lived and I didn't fuck with him cause he was an old guy. I just didn't fuck with him. And now we find out he has dementia and all this shit. So I'm cite, I never yelled at the guy, you know what you do now. You know, what's, what really diffuses angry guys like that or it makes them even more angry.

Speaker 1:          10:57          It's just laugh at him. Just keep laughing at him, laugh at him, give him the finger and just keep calling him tough guy. All right. They're tough guy. Anything do anything. You just keep calling them? Anything that is remotely all right there, Chuck Norris. Anything you want to say to this guy that will bait him into hitting you? This is a really a fuck. This is a great question and I don't want to get in trouble if some shit goes down so you shouldn't do anything, sir. Wink, wink, wink. Um, this guy's such a dick. I, I, I always say, you know, fucking with somebody whose car is like a pussy. Move with this guy is such a dick and he has like such a, uh, oh my God dude. How many times you thought about throat to choke slam and that guy ran into the hood of your car repeatedly when you said, I can step into my trunk. Veggie like a Pretzel and ass rape and your boy, nobody. If you just said it really calmly, if you set a comedy with sort of a smile on your face, you'll come off like a fucking maniac. Yeah, that's true. If you scream that at somebody, you just sound like you're quoting, like you know how Cogan or something. Right? Let me tell you something, brother. Come to Saturday. I'm going to bet you in a pretzel asked for AP.
