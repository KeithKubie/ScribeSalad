00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:01.428
Male voice: What I want
to do in this video

00:00:01.428 --> 00:00:05.510
is a little bit of 1960's
U.S. economic history

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.009
and then just see if our Aggregate Demand

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.428
Aggregate Supply model
fits the description

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:12.757
of what actually happened. One could argue

00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:17.094
you don't need the ADAS model
to describe what happened,

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:19.472
but we should at least
make sure that it does

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:24.737
describe what happened. If we go to 1960,

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:27.862
this is the very end of the
Eisenhower administration.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.861
Eisenhower was a Republican
in office. The only

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:33.998
reason why I give his party
affiliation is because

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:37.195
if the economy is weak,
and in 1960 the economy

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:39.748
was weak and one can always debate whether

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.989
it was due to the government or whether

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.795
it was due to just the
natural fluctuations

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:46.552
in the economy, but in
general, when the economy

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.724
is weak, it tends to go against the party

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:52.284
that is in power. In 1960, the Republicans

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.126
were in power. There was
a recession. One could

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:58.264
argue that was a major
reason why the Democratic

00:00:58.264 --> 00:01:00.995
candidate in the 1960
election was able to win,

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:05.813
John F. Kennedy. In
1961, JFK is inaugurated.

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:08.699
He becomes President of the United States.

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:11.610
One of his top goals is
to try to turn around

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.332
this economy. He does
it with what can best

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:18.162
be described as Keynesian
policies, and we'll

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:19.685
talk more about that in future videos.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:20.880
In fact, I should probably devote many

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.621
videos to Keynesian policies.
It's the general idea

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:26.733
that the government might
be able to turn around

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.543
a recession by sparking demand. The way

00:01:29.543 --> 00:01:31.415
that it would spark demand is try to put

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:33.472
more money in people's pockets, or even

00:01:33.472 --> 00:01:35.213
in businesses' pockets. It would do that

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:37.210
through some combination of increased

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.271
government spending,
maybe somehow giving money

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.405
to the poor, some types
of transfer programs,

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:45.401
and tax cuts for people and for businesses

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:47.546
so that they have more money to spend.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.718
These policies get implemented and over

00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:56.208
John F. Kennedy's term
you do have GDP begins

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:01.072
to turn back around,
unemployment, I'll just write

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:05.832
employment goes up, and
inflation stays low.

00:02:05.832 --> 00:02:09.684
Inflation is low.

00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:13.421
These are all of the things
that you want in an economy.

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.508
Unfortunately, this is just
kind of a sad human event,

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:22.197
in 1963, John F. Kennedy,
you probably know,

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:24.867
is assassinated. Then his Vice President,

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:28.335
Lyndon Baines Johnson, that
is LBJ right over there,

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.558
Lyndon Baines Johnson becomes President.

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.601
LBJ becomes President.
A little bit of trivia:

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.286
He's tied for the tallest
President in U.S. history,

00:02:37.286 --> 00:02:40.827
tied with Abraham Lincoln at 6'4".

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.004
He inherits a very, very
good economy; almost,

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.597
one could argue, a perfect economy.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:50.930
If Keynesian policies were
really to be practiced

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.660
here to their full idea, in theory, once

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.749
the economy started to
get a little bit really

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.861
overheated and really
approaching its potential,

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:03.064
in maybe 1964-1965, the
government maybe should have

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:06.407
started to pull back a
little bit on its spending

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:08.415
so that the economy
doesn't get overheated.

00:03:08.415 --> 00:03:11.007
But Lyndon Baines Johnson did not do this.

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.130
He kept things going,
and in fact he added more

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.504
fuel to the fire. One
could argue that some of it

00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:19.691
was driven by geopolitics.
A major factor was

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.075
right over here, the
Vietnam War, which was

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.666
escalated in a major way
under LBJ's administration.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:28.416
JFK was already dabbling
in Vietnam, but it

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.928
became a really major
war for the United States

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.334
under Lyndon Baines Johnson.

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:39.929
So some combination of
Vietnam, and he had a huge

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.930
number of social programs,
increased government

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.662
spending, to try to ease
inequality in the U.S. as well,

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:49.466
so social programs. One could
call it guns and butter.

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:53.670
Social programs to try to ease inequality.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.675
The net effect of this
is government spending

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.203
even though the economy
was already red hot,

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:01.936
it was already at its potential, he wanted

00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:03.746
to increase government spending even more,

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:06.606
so he kind of took it
beyond its potential.

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:09.467
He made it overheat a
little bit and what happens

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:15.671
in 1966 and onwards is
that you have inflation

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:18.603
starting to grow at a
fairly uncomfortable rate.

00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.810
Inflation starts to grow dramatically.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.284
Just to get a sense of
it, when I keep saying

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:24.466
that the economy was at
its potential and maybe

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:26.268
he might have taken a
little bit of his pedal

00:04:26.268 --> 00:04:28.584
off the gas, or his foot off of the pedal,

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.221
I should say, is as we
get into the beginning

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.547
of his administration,
1964-1965, unemployment

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:39.758
is in the 4-5% range.
Inflation is in the 1-2% range.

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:43.544
GDP is growing at a very healthy rate.

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:46.008
Despite that, and maybe he could argue

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:48.287
maybe his hand was forced
by geopolitical events

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.422
especially on military
funding, the government

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:53.209
continues to even spend more
money, stimulates things

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.278
even more because that
money goes to soldiers'

00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:59.336
salaries, it goes to
companies that provide,

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:01.666
I guess that make napalm
or make boats or make

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:05.140
whatever else. All of
these government programs

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.837
inject even more dollars into the economy,

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:10.587
and so you ended up with
inflation. The economy

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:12.344
was already operating at close to capacity

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:14.952
and it made it go maybe even beyond its

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:17.261
natural capacity. Let's see whether our

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:21.997
ADAS model would make, would
allow for this to happen,

00:05:21.997 --> 00:05:23.969
or would describe this,
or would predict this

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.750
given what was going on. Let's draw ...

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.116
That right over there is my price axis.

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:35.718
This right over here is my real GDP axis.

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:37.203
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:39.711
This right over here is real GDP.

00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:43.545
If we go into the 1964-1965 timeframe,

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:45.290
you could say that the U.S. is performing

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.330
at its potential GDP. When I talk about

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.892
its potential GDP, I'm
saying that on the long run,

00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:55.768
assuming that people aren't overworked,

00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:58.190
assuming that factories
are getting their proper

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.930
maintenance, they're not being run so hard

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.068
that they start cracking at the seams,

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:06.334
this is how much that
the U.S. can produce.

00:06:06.334 --> 00:06:08.408
If theory, if everyone worked even harder

00:06:08.408 --> 00:06:11.391
and didn't sleep and
were doing things in an

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.694
unsustainable way, they might even be able

00:06:14.694 --> 00:06:16.131
to produce more. One could view this as

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.668
a theoretical maximum. When
we talk about potential

00:06:18.668 --> 00:06:20.463
we're not talking about that short term

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.874
theoretical maximum, we're talking about

00:06:22.874 --> 00:06:27.734
the maximum GDP that
an economy can produce,

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:29.269
I guess you could say, in a healthy way,

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:32.130
or over the long run, assuming that people

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.954
aren't overworked and that the factories

00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:36.936
aren't overworked in
some way, shape or form.

00:06:36.936 --> 00:06:42.207
This could be our situation
maybe in 1964-1965.

00:06:42.207 --> 00:06:45.623
Let's draw this right over
here is the level of prices.

00:06:45.623 --> 00:06:48.100
We just want to see if, in general, we get

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.186
this type of thing
happening from our model.

00:06:51.186 --> 00:06:55.196
This is our aggregate
supply in the long run.

00:06:55.196 --> 00:06:57.657
Our aggregate supply in
the short run we know

00:06:57.657 --> 00:07:03.662
might look something like this.

00:07:03.662 --> 00:07:06.265
That's aggregate supply in the short run.

00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:08.857
Then from our model we will assume ...

00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:12.150
Let me draw that a little
bit neater so it intersects

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.992
a little bit better. This right over here

00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:17.393
is aggregate ... let
me draw it a little bit

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:19.852
better than that with the slope ...

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:24.518
This is our aggregate
supply in the short run.

00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:27.472
Aggregate supply in the short run.

00:07:27.472 --> 00:07:32.267
Let's draw our aggregate demand.

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:34.936
I'll do that in this green color.

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:38.600
Aggregate demand might
look something like that.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.040
That is our aggregate demand.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.532
This is 1964-1965. Here
we are, the economy's

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.016
humming along at its potential.

00:07:47.016 --> 00:07:50.070
Now more gas is thrown on the flame.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.662
Government accelerates
its spending; not just

00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:54.419
to turn on the economy;
now because of Vietnam

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:57.326
and all of these social
programs. What's going to happen?

00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:00.128
That money's ending up
in company and people's

00:08:00.128 --> 00:08:03.061
pockets, they're going to demand more.

00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:04.977
It's going to shift the
demand curve to the right.

00:08:04.977 --> 00:08:07.218
At any given price, they're
going to demand more.

00:08:07.218 --> 00:08:10.573
Aggregate demand is going
to shift to the right.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.049
Maybe it goes, it shifts
to the right, and maybe

00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:16.460
it goes someplace right over there.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.537
What is the new short term equilibrium?

00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:21.393
Aggregate demand is
intersecting aggregate supply

00:08:21.393 --> 00:08:25.727
right over here. Right
over there, and as we see,

00:08:25.727 --> 00:08:28.669
the equilibrium level
of prices on this model

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.955
now has gone up. Our
productivity, we're now

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:35.462
producing above potential.
We're overheating a little bit.

00:08:35.462 --> 00:08:38.955
Actually, if you look at
the data in 1966-1967,

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:41.124
unemployment did become ridiculously low.

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:44.144
It even got in kind of the
three point something percent

00:08:44.144 --> 00:08:47.066
for a little while.
Many people would argue

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:50.304
that even now that is
an unnaturally low level

00:08:50.304 --> 00:08:52.846
of unemployment; that people and factories

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:55.896
are really operating at, maybe beyond

00:08:55.896 --> 00:08:59.048
full capacity, or beyond a
sustainable full capacity.

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:01.634
But, we see from this model what you think

00:09:01.634 --> 00:09:02.937
would happen actually does happen.

00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:06.347
Prices would go up. Right over there.

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.301
Then on the long run, you
really wouldn't be able

00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:09.799
to sustain this level of producing above

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.009
your potential, and
over the long run things

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.080
would settle back right
over here, and all you're

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.000
left with, really, is the inflation.
