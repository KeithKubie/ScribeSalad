00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.370
Recipes are great, because usually the end

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.930
product is something pretty tasty, like a cake.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; I love cake.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.970
&gt;&gt; Me, too. But the bad thing about recipes

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.160
is, you kind of have to stick to the

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.380
recipe, and if you change something, even something small,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.930
you can end up with a change that's really insignificant...

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.730
&gt;&gt; Or a really big change.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.190
&gt;&gt; And If we think of our genome as a big book of

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.130
recipes, then we can pull from these

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.620
individual recipes to make individual proteins, and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.780
we call these individual recipes genes. A gene is

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.430
just a sequence of DNA that codes for something.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.980
&gt;&gt; So, let's bring these back to blood

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.850
type. You're saying that we have these Individual

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.790
genes that create A,B or O proteins and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.000
that dictates what kind of blood type we have.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.030
&gt;&gt; Actually and this A,B,O gene that creates this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.110
proteins if we change it a little bit that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.690
can change the protrein right and then that protein

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.630
may give us type A or type B or

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.500
could elimate the protein all together and we get no type or type O.
