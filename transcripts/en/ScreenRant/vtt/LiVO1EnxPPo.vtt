00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.350
Nobody sets out to make a bad movie, but it
does happen from time to time.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.300
Still, these awful flicks are still made by
professionals, meaning every now and then,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.640
they’ll be able to craft a standout scene
or two.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.380
Some of them are so great in terms of character
and story development that we wonder how the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.910
rest of the film went wrong.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:32.230
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 amazing scenes
in terrible movies.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.989
Attack of the Clones

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.630
The Star Wars prequels are maligned for everything
from the production design to characterization,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.620
but they still have a few merits.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.940
One of the most powerful moments comes midway
through Attack of the Clones, when Anakin

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.670
embarks on a personal mission to save his
mother from the captivity of the Tusken Raiders.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.710
Getting to her too late, he watches in horror
as Shmi dies in his arms, setting off a chain

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.050
reaction that would lead to Darth Vader.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.680
It’s haunting and dark, and also established
Anakin’s bad premonitions could come true.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:12.020
If only all of Hayden Christensen’s performance
could have been this strong.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.560
Superman Returns

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.740
Bryan Singer’s soft reboot of the old Superman
franchise was criticized for being dull and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.070
void of action, but that was not an issue
in one of the movie’s most memorable moments.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.850
When a plane malfunctions after a power failure,
only the Man of Steel can save it, and what

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.479
we saw was a thrilling throwback to old school
Kal-El heroics.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.829
The scene announced Superman’s return both
to the movies and in the film’s story itself,

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.149
illustrating why the world isn’t the same
without him.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.229
It’s a shame the rest of the movie couldn’t
be this exciting, as this early sequence got

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.929
our hopes up for a rousing adventure.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:59.619
X-Men: The Last Stand

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.319
Credited with derailing one of the top superhero
franchises, The Last Stand didn’t offer

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.279
much in terms of quality filmmaking when it
was released.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:11.039
But things got off to a compelling start with
Brett Ratner’s depiction of Angel’s childhood.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.100
Conveying the series themes of mutant inclusion
and prejudice in society, it shows the lengths

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.380
someone with beautiful gifts – like angel’s
wings – would go just so they could “fit

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.380
in.”

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.750
It instantly makes the mutant plight sympathetic
and sets up the mutant cure storyline in grand

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.750
fashion.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.760
Too bad the rest of the film didn’t have
the same payoff.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.090
Die Another Day

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.730
Between invisible cars and over-the-top action,
Die Another Day forced Bond producers to reboot

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.320
the franchise from the ground up.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.340
But Pierce Brosnan’s final mission wasn’t
a total loss.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.950
A standout sequence is when Bond engages in
a high-stakes fencing duel with Graves.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.920
Expertly choreographed and done practically,
the scene was so great because of how real

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.950
it felt.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.870
The combatants tired as it went on, getting
bloody and sweaty by the time their violent

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.870
battle was all over.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.580
The sword fight gave Die Another Day a grittiness
that the rest of the film largely lacked.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.380
The Matrix Reloaded

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.460
The first Matrix sequel was thought to be
too heady and philosophical for its own good,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.850
but the Wachowskis still proved their knack
for breathtaking action.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.130
By far, the most memorable set piece in the
film is the 14-minute highway chase, notable

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.940
for the amount of effort that went into it.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.040
The Wachowskis actually built a freeway to
use specifically for the scene, and injected

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.600
the action bits with the classic Matrix twist
to give viewers something new and exciting.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.360
Full of high stakes and death-defying stunts,
even those who dislike the sequels have to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:46.630
admit this is pretty slick.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.630
Spider-Man 3

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.850
An overcooked story with too many characters,
Spider-Man 3 had trouble figuring out which

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.540
arcs to pursue.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.069
Director Sam Raimi had always intended to
use Sandman as a villain, and his passion

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.100
for Flint Marko is evident in this beautiful
scene.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.180
After his body is fused with sand during a
particle accelerator test, Marko is reborn

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.490
as the Sandman in a moment that is poignant
and touching.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.630
Accompanied by a mesmerizing musical score
and no dialogue, it draws viewers in with

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.780
its genuine emotion that tugs at our heartstrings.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:25.930
Sandman was never a bad guy, and this scene
shows it to great effect.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.020
Fantastic Four

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.230
Criticized for being more Joel Schumacher
camp than Bryan Singer serious, the first

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.820
attempt at a Fantastic Four movie didn’t
go over well.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.669
But even that had moments that resonated with
audiences.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.680
After being transformed into The Thing, Ben
Grimm attempts to reconnect with his wife,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.300
who is horrified by the “monster” her
husband has become.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.159
It’s a heartbreaking scene that’s reminiscent
of the mutant paranoia in the X-Men films

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.990
and goes a long way in setting up Grimm’s
character arc.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.080
If only the entire movie could have been this
emotionally driven, Fox might have had another

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.820
tentpole to supplement their top franchises.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.569
X-Men Origins: Wolverine

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.779
Erased from franchise continuity now, the
first Wolverine movie had a lot of promise

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.150
in 2009.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.919
It was squandered, but the opening sequence
is still one for the ages.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.630
Showing Wolverine and Sabertooth fighting
through every historical war as unstoppable

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.879
soldiers never leaving each other’s sides,
the scene thrillingly showcased their pasts

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.840
and seemingly was building towards an epic
fight for their lives in the main plot.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.110
Sadly, these first bits are about as hardcore
as the combat got, but it didn’t make it

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.309
any less awesome to see on-screen.

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:44.930
In fact, it would have made a great movie
in its own right.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.930
Doom

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.969
It’s no secret that video game movies have
had troubles breaking into Hollywood, but

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.169
that hasn’t stopped the studios from trying.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.139
Looking to bring the first-person shooter
series Doom to the big screen, director Andrzej

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.849
Bartkowiak found a way to replicate the game
play for viewers.

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.389
Audiences responded well to the “first-person”
sequence – the first of its kind – which

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.251
immersed moviegoers in an eerie setting that
was packed to the brim with tension.

00:06:09.251 --> 00:06:14.259
Keeping us on the edge of our seats, the pulsating
music score complimented the thrilling action

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.979
and teased fans with what the movie could
have been had the rest of it been handled

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:19.979
with such craft.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:30.479
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.379
Peter Jackson’s Hobbit trilogy is considered
to be overdrawn and dragged out, with epics

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.380
that far exceed the needs of its brief story.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.090
He still found a way to recapture some of
that old Lord of the Rings magic in the famed

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.779
“Riddles in the Dark” sequence in An Unexpected
Journey.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.580
Featuring Andy Serkis’ triumphant return
as Gollum, it pitted the creature against

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.930
Bilbo in a deadly game as the young Hobbit
tried to escape.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.789
Harkening back to Tolkien’s writing and
Jackson’s keen sense of directing, it was

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.690
one of the standout moments of the trilogy,
giving us nostalgia and meaningful character

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.350
development for the hero.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.770
