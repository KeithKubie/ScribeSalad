00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.459
One thing we don't talk about is that—it's
sort of hard to talk about this—our minds

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.430
have theses kind of back doors.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.270
There's kind of—if you're human and you
wake up and you open your eyes there is a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.480
certain set of dimensions to your experience
that can be manipulated.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.590
When I was a kid I was a magician, and you
learn all about these limits, that short-term

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.500
memory is about this long and there's different
reaction times, and if you ask people certain

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.950
questions in certain ways you can control
the answer.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.690
And this is just the structure of being human.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.480
To be human means that you are persuadable
in every single moment.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.500
I mean the thing about magic, as an example,
it’s that magic works on everybody, sleight

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.690
of hand, right?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.960
It doesn't matter what language you speak,
it doesn't matter how intelligent you are,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.790
it's not about what someone knows: it's about
how your mind actually works.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.079
So knowing this, it turns out that there's
this whole playbook of persuasive techniques

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.241
that actually I learned when I was at the
Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab and that

00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:11.999
most people in Silicon Valley in the tech
industry learned as ways of getting your attention.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.100
So one example is: we are all vulnerable to
social approval.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.299
We really care what other people think of
us.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.920
So for example, when you upload a new profile
photo of yourself on Facebook, that's a moment

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.749
where our mind is very vulnerable to knowing,
“what do other people think of my new profile

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.749
photo?”

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.170
And so when we get new likes on our profile
photo, Facebook—knowing this—could actually

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.569
message me and say, “oh, you have new likes
on your profile photo.”

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.889
And it knows that we'll be vulnerable to that
moment because we all really care about when

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.179
we're tagged in a photo or when we have a
new profile photo.

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.119
And the thing is that they control the dial,
the technology companies control the dial

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.429
for when and how long your profile photo shows
up on other people's newsfeeds, so they can

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.240
orchestrate it so that other people more often
end up liking your profile photo over a delayed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.540
period of time, for example, so that you end
up having to more frequently come back and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.319
see what the new likes are.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.519
And the problem is that they don't do this
because they're evil, they do it because,

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.349
again, they're in this race for our attention.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.650
And we should also ask, is that necessarily
such a bad thing if they're orchestrating

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.900
it so that other people like my photo?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.860
I mean that might feel good to me.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.489
So we have to have a new conversation about,
as these technology companies use these techniques,

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.290
these vulnerabilities in our minds, when is
that actually aligned and good for us?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.290
When is that ethical?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930
When is that honest?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.370
When is that fair?

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.709
And when is that dishonest and unfair?

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.200
Because they're actually manipulating our
minds in a way that doesn't add up to our

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.330
spending our time well on the screen.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.360
Well, so another vulnerability in our mind
is something called a variable schedule reward,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720
and that's like a slot machine in Las Vegas.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.510
It turns out that slot machines make more
money in the United States than baseball,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.560
movies and theme parks combined.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.469
People become addicted to slot machines, I
think it's two to three times faster than

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.370
any other kind of gambling in a casino.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.700
So it's insane.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.700
And why is that?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.159
Because it's very simple: you just pull a
lever, and sometimes you get a reward and

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.909
sometimes you don't.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.700
And the more random it is and the more variable
it is the more addictive it becomes.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.090
And the thing is, that that turns our phone
into a slot machine, because every time we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.810
check our phone we're playing the slot machine
to see “what did I get?”

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.890
Every time that we check our email, we're
playing the slot machine to see, “What did

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.890
I get?

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.450
Did I get invited to an interview at Big Think
or did I just get another newsletter?”

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.709
Or if you're on a dating site like Tindr and
when you're swiping, each swipe is: you're

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.129
playing the slot machine to see “did I get
a match?”, I'm playing the slot machine

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.639
to see, “did I get a match?”

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.790
And the problem is that this dynamic, these
variable schedule rewards or this slot machine

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.450
mechanic, is so powerful that it's the best
thing at addicting people and putting you

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.620
in the zone.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.780
One of the original designers of the Facebook
newsfeed told me that the thing that made

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.700
the newsfeed work at the very, very, very
beginning back in 2006 was in part a hardware

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700
innovation.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.530
And I looked at her and I said, "What do you
mean?"

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.370
And she said it was actually the scroll wheel
on a mouse, because with the scroll wheel

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.100
on a mouse your hand never had to leave its
resting position—you just scroll to see

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.280
the next thing.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.790
Because before that you had to click on the
down button or move your mouse and drag the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.630
arrow down and scroll the page that way.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.630
When you don’t, you can take your two fingers
on a track pad and do this, or you can just

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.090
scroll on a scroll wheel—it just means your
hand never has to leave its resting position,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.200
and it's more like a slot machine: you can
just keep swiping and playing just like in

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.910
Vegas where there's the button right there.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.910
They actually changed it.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.420
In fact, it used to be a lever, and now it's
just a button in Vegas because they found

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.820
it's easier just to get people to see if they
get a match this way.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.290
So, how much on our phones, when we use our
technology, Instagram is like a slot machine?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.140
What's going to come next on the feeds?

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.570
Snapchat is a slot machine, each time you
see the red notifications and you don't know

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.090
what's behind it you're playing the slot machine
when you click on it to see “what did I

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.610
get?”

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.380
And so it's sprinkled all throughout these
products because it's a very compelling way

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.150
of getting people's attention.
