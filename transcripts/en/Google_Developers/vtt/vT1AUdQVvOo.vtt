00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.170
ROSE YAO: All right,
hello, everyone.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.230
My name is Rose Yao
and I lead product

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.060
for Google Maps Platform.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.100
I want thank you guys
for joining us here

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.080
for our second session
at Google I/O this year.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.510
And for those of you watching
on YouTube, hello and welcome.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.730
Yesterday we talked
about how we're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.530
changing the way
we build product

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.870
and what that means
for you as a developer.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.447
We also introduced a new
name, Google Maps Platform.

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:35.030
Today I want to talk
a little bit more

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.970
about why platform more
accurately represents

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.740
our ambitions and the products
we want to build with you.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.570
We spent a lot of
time yesterday talking

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.900
about how we're making Google
Maps Platform easy to use,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.980
simple, and scalable by
partnering with Cloud.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.190
This means one
website, one plan,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.150
one console for all your
Maps and Cloud projects

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.900
and the ability to scale
seamlessly without interruption

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.019
as your product grows.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.950
We also talked about
our core products,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.600
the ones we know and love
for the last 13 years, Maps,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.140
Places, and Routes.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.170
These are the foundational
building blocks

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.876
of any location-based
experience.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.250
Today I want to
talk about how we

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.760
go beyond the basics
with industry solutions.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.920
In particular, I want
to talk about one

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.580
of our first industry solutions,
Real World Games, a Google Maps

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.900
Platform.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.370
To understand what
this means, I'm

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.090
going to bring Clementine up
to talk more about what exactly

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.350
our offering is
and how it works.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.800
But first, I want to
talk about the journey

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.590
that we took to get there
and how we really built it.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.970
So as product managers, we get
ideas from all sorts of places.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.500
But the most important one is
from you guys, our developers.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.430
In this case, about 18 months
ago, a lot of game developers

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.420
are approaching
us to ask how they

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.900
could use Google Maps to
build real world games

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.760
and whether we have a
product to support them.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.770
We were intrigued.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.310
But honestly, up
until this point,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.000
we are never
investigated where really

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.430
takes to build a
product from the grounds

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.060
up just for a particular
use case or industry.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.330
All of our core products were
designed to be universal.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.570
So to do this right, we
interviewed dozens of top game

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.320
developers in the world.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.100
We asked them what they
wanted to build and why,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.250
what tools they used, how
they ran their business,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.280
and what success really
looked like for them.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.160
Once you got a basic
picture of what type of game

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.560
they wanted to build and
what success looked like,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.470
we got deeper into problems
that Google Maps can really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.180
help them solve.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.660
From there, we worked
closely with a small group

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.330
of developers who gave
us regular feedback

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.045
and helped us test every build.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.420
There are also
developers who are

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.370
launching with us this summer--

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.640
so coming soon to
mobile screen near you.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.710
The result is our
View One product,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.450
which helps with two
core use cases that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.610
are unique to understanding
of the real world.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.070
First is world building.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.990
We build an SDK that
allows developers

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.020
to build beautiful
fantasy worlds based

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.840
on Google's understanding
of the real world.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.420
Second is mission planning.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.880
We answer what seems like
a very simple question.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.480
What is the best place
to place a game no matter

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.130
where you are in the world?

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.860
And that's how the Playable
Locations API was born.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.320
And Clementine will talk
about how that's not

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.960
quite as simple as it sounds.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.350
This is the type of industry
solution and partnership

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.870
we want to have with
you, our developers,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.890
on Google Maps Platform.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.770
So now that you know
our journey here,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.680
I'd love to welcome Clementine
up to talk about the product

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.268
and how it works.

00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:51.603
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.710
CLEMENTINE JACOBY:
Awesome, thank you, Rose.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.770
And hello, Mountain View.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.300
My name is Clementine Jacoby.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.850
And I'm the product manager
for the gaming offering

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.170
that Rose just introduced.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.530
So this product is
hot off the press.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.480
We actually
announced it in March

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.770
at the Game Developers
Conference in San Francisco.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.100
And it's been
overwhelming to see

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.740
the response from the
developer community so far.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.060
It's super, super exciting
to see the range of ideas

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.810
that developers want to bring
to the real world stage.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.270
So today I'm here to
actually dive a bit deeper

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.920
into the product and tell
you what we've built.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.080
But to do that, I have
to take you back to 1972.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.040
So raise your hand if
you've ever played "Pong?"

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.130
OK, so almost everybody.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.740
I want you to think about
the game world in "Pong."

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.220
It's a two-dimensional
world and a single screen.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.980
And this is where
gaming started.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.050
Later, those single
screens became

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.200
one of many, part of still two
dimensional but more complex

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.830
game worlds like we saw
in "Super Mario Bros."

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.560
And today there's this
ever increasing demand

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.940
to model game worlds as more and
more realistic 3D environments

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.760
on bigger and bigger scales.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.340
So game developers
invest huge amounts

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.070
of time, energy, and
money in this problem,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.170
in developing game worlds.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.440
And we at Google Maps
were surprised to discover

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.390
that they spend about
as much energy as we

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.680
do on modeling a world for
their users to explore.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.560
Modeling this all by
hand can produce really

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.580
breathtaking results, but
it's also very expensive.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.380
And it's getting more
and more expensive

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.000
as we scale this problem up.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.110
And so we're
constrained by that.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.630
As an example, the game world
and "Grand Theft Auto 5,"

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.790
which is one of the richest
and biggest game worlds

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.810
ever created, was about as
big as downtown Manhattan

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.480
at launch.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.540
But what if we could scale the
art of creating game worlds?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.420
What if we could create game
worlds in which detail didn't

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.400
have to be balanced with size?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.020
Hold that thought.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.260
In parallel to that progression,
mobile phones have gotten

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.240
good-- like, really good--

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.990
good enough that developers
can start to convincingly blend

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.460
realities.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.590
And across the mobile
ecosystem, we're

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.490
seeing digital content brought
into the physical world

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.650
by smartphones that
are now powerful enough

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.950
to do this blending of reality.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.950
And Google Maps
specializes in reality.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.170
For over a decade
now, we have been

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.170
building our model of the
world, capturing the complexity

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.780
of the real world, bringing
it to your smartphone

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.580
so that you can explore
no matter where you are.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.260
So game worlds are getting
bigger and more realistic.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.310
Phones are getting
better and more powerful.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.500
And as Rose said, lots and
lots of game developers

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
were coming to Google
Maps asking for a product.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.300
So we looked at the demand.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.550
We looked at the momentum.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.790
And we decided that
we wanted to pitch in.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.760
So we set out to create
an offering specifically

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.820
for gaming to help
developers build games

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.630
based on the real world
powered by Google Maps data

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.390
and backed by Google
Maps infrastructure.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.550
We turned the real world
into your playground,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.470
allowing you to take
the richness of reality

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.350
as your starting point.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.480
Before I dive deeper,
I just want to show you

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.890
a quick, 30-second video.

00:07:30.522 --> 00:07:31.480
This should have audio.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.472
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:58.264 --> 00:08:00.796
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.170
All right, so
there's obviously--

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.860
Thanks.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.597
There's a lot of magic happening
in that 30-second video.

00:08:08.597 --> 00:08:10.180
But I'm going to
break it down for you

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.390
in the rest of this talk.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.200
So with this product,
we really wanted

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.440
to both build something
that gave developers

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.660
the control that they
were after but was

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.831
also easy to get started with.

00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:24.580
And so, like Rose said,
we went and talked

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.620
to lots of developers
about how to strike

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.280
that very elusive balance
of control and ease of use.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.200
And from those conversations,
what we learned

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.575
is that there are three key
things that developers really

00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:36.770
want from us.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.169
The first one is
sort of obvious.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.590
They want access to Google
Maps data, that rich, accurate,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.690
and living model
of the real world.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.080
Now critically, our
data is really fresh.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.490
We make 25 million
updates a day to this map

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.880
to reflect the pace at
which the world is changing.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.130
And it's all backed by
the same infrastructure

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.420
that serves billions of daily
requests to Google Maps.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.220
The second piece
is that developers

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.830
wanted the real world
in the game engines

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.780
that they were
already using where

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.720
they could leverage a
whole ecosystem of tools

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.790
for game development.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.100
So we brought the
real world into Unity,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.750
which is the most popular engine
for creating mobile games.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.180
Our SDK does all of the
heavy lifting for you,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.970
no Google Maps expertise needed.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.340
This allows game
developers to focus really

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.800
on what they do best,
which is creating

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.370
rich and immersive game play.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.280
The third piece, I want to
spend a little more time on.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.370
The third piece is that we
help you design interactions

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.510
around real world places.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.580
And this is a really
fascinating technical challenge

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.066
it turns out.

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:49.290
To understand how
hard this is, I

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.240
want you to think about
designing a scavenger hunt.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.930
It's up to you to decide
where players need to go

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.260
and what they need to
do when they get there.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.210
That's already sort
of hard, as anyone

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.340
who's designed a
scavenger hunt knows.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.130
But now imagine that you're
trying to design that scavenger

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.310
hunt around a city on the
other side of the world

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.190
that you've never
been to before.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.840
That's harder.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.960
And now imagine that you
need to expand that scavenger

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.760
hunt from one city to every
town and suburb on the planet.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.180
That's the challenge that
you're up against when

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.860
creating a global-scale
location-based game.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.950
Doing this well
requires knowing a lot

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.345
about the players' environment,
no matter where they are.

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:39.720
Because no matter
where they are,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.011
you want to find things that
are unique and interesting

00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:44.100
about the area around them.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.590
So you need to know things
like, what do people

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.300
take pictures of?

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.920
What do they ask
for directions to?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.740
Which areas are
vibe-y and interesting

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.500
that players might
enjoy exploring?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.330
Which ones are off
the beaten path

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.300
that you should place rare
treasures at and reward

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.270
players for finding?

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.410
You'll want to know
all of those things.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.110
But just knowing all
of it isn't enough,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.320
because you also have to find
a sensible way of prioritizing

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.390
between all these
signals to find

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.420
the best place for your
player at that point in time

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:15.960
and space.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.020
And as a bonus, these things
are constantly changing.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.230
So a street that's
bustling during the day

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.360
might be abandoned at night.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.590
A busy mall might turn into a
restricted construction site.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.500
And they do all the time.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.010
Plus, even if you worked
this all out once,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.940
it's still not enough--

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.060
and this is the
sad spoiler alert--

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.347
because it can take years
to build a good game.

00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:44.930
And so you need
something that's going

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:49.310
to be challenging and
dynamic for years, too,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.650
which means that
these experiences have

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.670
to be somewhat dynamic.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.530
They have to change over time.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.280
Hopefully, I've illustrated that
this is a really hard problem.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.613
So now I'm going to talk about
how we help you solve it.

00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:03.350
And in short, we've built
a really special product

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.570
specifically for this use case.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.510
It's called the
Playable Locations API.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.380
Its charter is to help
developers find the best places

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.020
to play games
anywhere in the world.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.180
So we start by combing the
Earth looking for places

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.250
to stage interactions.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.880
These could be businesses,
or public spaces,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.990
or areas of historical
or cultural interest.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.839
The important thing
is that we start

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:34.130
with getting sufficient
coverage so that your game will

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.680
be interesting no matter
where in the world

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.410
your user opens their
phone to play the game.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.290
The next, very important
step is that we get rid

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.370
of all the bad points.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.010
So we make sure that there
aren't points in water,

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.150
or in the middle of big
roads, or anywhere else

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.140
it's inappropriate
for playing games.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.690
And it turns out
that the world is

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.990
full of places that
aren't very playable

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.900
and often for very
non-obvious reasons.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:09.070
Cemeteries, landfills,
emergency room entrances, these

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.840
are all bad places to
play but for, like,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.170
different and nuanced reasons.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.640
So we have to figure that out.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.024
Now that we've gotten
rid of the bad points,

00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:19.690
we need to rank every
place in the world

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.690
by how playable is, which
is also non-trivial.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.540
So we take into
account a huge range

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.810
of signals in deciding
how playable a point is.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.390
But one signal that
developers really care about

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.280
is recognizability.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.890
Because your player is
not going to have fun

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.620
if they can't find
the place that you're

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.882
trying to get them to go.

00:13:40.882 --> 00:13:44.220
So we use a vast
array of signals

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.770
to determine what the
most recognizable places

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.750
around your player are.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.210
And then we rank those
places by prominence,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.060
which is represented by
the big, blue dots here.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.530
Now we also recognize that
the best places to play,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.020
they are going to vary
depending on the kind of game

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.730
that you want to make.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.980
So we let you
tailor your request

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.680
to find the places that will
work for your particular game,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.570
for the experience
you want to create.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.121
You can set up
rules, and filters,

00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:13.870
and choose the places
that are appropriate

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.104
for your particular game.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.020
And I'll show you a bit
more of that later on.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.670
But here's an example.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.330
You may want to direct young
players to busy social spaces

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.150
where they can interact
with their friends.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.190
Or maybe, instead,
your game is designed

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.200
to get players to move.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.380
And so you place collectibles
along jogging tracks

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.290
and in public parks.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.680
Or maybe your game is designed
to sort of seamlessly fit

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.600
into users' everyday lives.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.260
And so you center game
play around popular cafes,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.250
commuting paths, busy
thoroughfares, et cetera.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.550
This choice is up to you.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.220
We give you that
control to create

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.150
whatever experience you want.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.570
And then we help you do
that at global scale.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.220
This is possible, because
the API gives you metadata

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.970
about each playable location.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.400
So this means that you can
control the types of places

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.340
that appear in your game and
the types of game objects

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.250
that appear at each
sort of location.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.240
So I'll give you a
very literal example.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.110
Let's say that you interpret
the real world place type

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.040
super literally and place
treasure chests at banks,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.270
previsions at grocery stores,
and power ups at doctors

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.830
offices.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.090
The result would be a game that
works as well in downtown Tokyo

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:40.330
as it does in a Sydney suburb
or in the rural United States.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.770
This is pretty cool.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.580
And getting to this
end state manually

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.660
is virtually impossible.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.360
These design challenges require
a detailed understanding

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.430
of your players
context and environment

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.200
no matter where they are.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.020
But with this Playable
Locations API,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.320
you can build your game
once, design it once,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.970
and know that it'll
work everywhere

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:07.479
that Google Maps does in over
220 countries around the world.

00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:09.020
That's a lot of
things that you don't

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.630
have to worry about
and billions of things

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.700
that you don't have to do.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.460
Instead, you focus on
the what of creating

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.960
exciting experiences while we
help you figure out the where.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.800
OK, so that is the
first component.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.870
The second component
that I want to talk about

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.660
is the Maps Unity SDK.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.100
So now we're going
to look at some maps.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.130
Imagine now that you're
building the game

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.820
world or the environment that
all of those interactions

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.190
are going to take place in.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:46.470
The very first thing you need
is high-quality maps data.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.380
To help you with that piece,
we bring the real world

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.940
into Unity.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.690
Let's take a look.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.550
This is Manhattan
rendered by the Maps Unity

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.380
SDK in a demo app that we
put together for this talk.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.560
Our SDK makes it easy to
turn this blank canvas

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.750
into a stylized
game environment.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.520
Here's an example.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.609
Notice how custom
textures have been applied

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:16.900
to buildings, parks, and roads
to create this futuristic

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.280
look and feel.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.730
We give you fine-grained
control over this process

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:27.160
by modeling each map feature
as a separate game object.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.080
What that means is that
what was previously

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.950
a blank street corner could
be a sci-fi adventure,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.740
a medieval setting, or
really anything else

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.770
that you dream up.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.790
Now every game object is
annotated with metadata.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.560
This allows you to
make styling decisions

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.390
based on the real world.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.460
Since this is a
candy land, I might

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.050
decide to make shops, chocolate
bars, or turn restaurants

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.994
into gingerbread.

00:17:55.994 --> 00:17:57.410
Changing the heights
of buildings,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.160
it's really easy, too.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.190
And through simple
customizations like these,

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.070
you can create a
game world that's

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.940
connected to the real world
but has your own look and feel.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.130
OK, now we're going to marry
that 3D world with the Playable

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.950
Locations API that I
just told you about.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.680
So here the green dots
represent playable locations

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.430
around the player.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.180
Let's turn the prominent
ones into mission points

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.910
so that our players have
somewhere interesting nearby

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.960
to play.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.880
And these will be represented
by funky rainbows, obviously.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.380
Now because you
get metadata, you

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.350
can also control what types of
objects appear at what types

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.770
of places.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.000
So for example, we
could place candy stands

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.580
at real world stores.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:48.110
Or as another example, we could
place gummy bear characters

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.760
at real world restaurants.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.230
And now, if we were to switch
back to our fantasy theme,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.580
these could instead be
dragons and treasure chests,

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.237
or in our futuristic theme,
spaceships and floating loot.

00:19:07.237 --> 00:19:08.820
But whatever your
game, you're focused

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.860
on the fun part of
creating rich and engaging

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.370
game play while we do the rest.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.670
Keep in mind that this is all
happening inside of Unity.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.430
And so if I press
Stop here, you can

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.770
see that the scene is empty,
because this is all being

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.070
created dynamically at runtime.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.690
We include lots
of other features

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.400
to help you build
your game, as well,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.800
like nine slicing for
texturing buildings,

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.860
decorators for adding gargoyles,
or parapets, or other objects

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:44.900
to roofs, borders for
simulating contact shadows.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.520
And we include the names
of roads and buildings.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.010
We also integrate with
Unity's lighting system,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.550
which helps you create a
beautiful day/night cycle.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.440
And we support Unity's level
of detail system, which

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.950
means that we automatically fade
out distant objects to maximize

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.940
mobile performance.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.380
But most importantly,
Unity is a physics engine,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.560
which means that you can now
use the real world's geometry

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.420
in any 3D physical space game.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.410
The spaceship always
gets the applause.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.970
OK, enough about features.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.190
Next, I'm going to show you
some examples of just how

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.620
far you can push this platform.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.920
So the technique used
to create this scene

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.080
is a little different from
the previous examples.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.260
In this case,
procedural rules were

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:49.050
used to assemble a city based
on the real world's layout.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.540
Below, we can see
cars driving around,

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.560
and lampposts, and power lines.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.110
And as we zoom in, you
can start to see just

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.220
how detailed this
game world really is.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:08.920
There are cafe tables,
shopfronts, people arguing.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.850
This technique is
more sophisticated.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.880
But it's that same
semantic model

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.175
of the real world that
makes it possible.

00:21:22.065 --> 00:21:23.315
Let's look at another example.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.130
This scene looks
totally different,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.700
but it's using the
same technique.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.190
The way the buildings
work is really cool.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.340
They assemble themselves
from modular components

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.590
to create a stylistic
interpretation

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.690
of the real world.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.090
Or to put it another
way, the cityscape

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.560
is grown organically to
match the real world.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.720
What's really
incredible about this

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.720
is that these examples
were all created by one

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.550
developer in a matter of weeks.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.030
And so what you
can see is that he

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.510
was able to achieve this
insane level of detail

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.040
in a really short
amount of time.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.940
I want to talk about one more
example before we move on.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.800
This is a road running
through Glacier National

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.830
Park in Montana.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.490
Here, the trees,
rocks, and vegetation

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.790
were all procedurally
generated down

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.000
to individual blades of grass.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.480
Elevation data was brought
into the Maps Unity SDK

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.790
to create this vast,
open world environment

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.710
complete with mountains, roads,
towns, animals, and wilderness

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.801
areas.

00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:44.550
And what we really
like about this example

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.370
is that it shows that you're
not limited to urban centers

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.475
when building these games.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.419
All right, this is the most
exciting part of the talk.

00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:56.210
Now that you've seen
the product in action,

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.730
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about what developers

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.810
are already creating.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.660
So for the last year,
we've been working

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.650
with a small set of developers
to refine this offering

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:13.520
with folks who wanted to build
games launching this year.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.120
Today I'm going to show
you three of those games.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.210
First up, we have
"Jurassic World Alive."

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.060
This is the second installment
of Ludia's "Jurassic World"

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.950
series created in partnership
with Universal Studios.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.470
In this game, players are part
of the Dinosaur Protection

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.160
Group and use the game
to search for, find,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.195
and rescue dinosaurs.

00:23:35.195 --> 00:23:35.861

00:23:51.060 --> 00:24:00.420
All right, here's a shot
from inside the game.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.350
So in "Jurassic World
Alive," visual contrast

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.360
was really, really
important to the developer.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.030
So they limited the
building heights

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.250
so that the dinosaurs
were the first thing

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.600
that players saw on the map.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.570
Let's take a closer
look at the game play.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.690
So Ludia, the developer
for this game,

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.010
uses the Playable Locations
API to spawn dinosaurs

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.070
based on their actual
characteristics and behavior.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.100
So you'll get some
dinosaurs that

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.500
spawn at certain
times of the day

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.220
and others that only spawn
in certain kinds of areas.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.070
For example, you might find some
very toothy dinosaurs hanging

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.320
around your dentist's office.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.550
"Jurassic World Alive" also
features some really cool AR

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.520
game play powered by
ARCore on Android.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.220
And when it comes to safety,
"Jurassic World Alive"

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.860
spared no expense.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.200
By using the Playable
Locations API,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.260
they were able to help players
avoid unplayable locations

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.650
and stay safe, while
also encouraging players

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.840
to meet up at POIs,
which introduced

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.244
this social component
into their game.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.600
OK, next up we have
"Ghostbusters World,"

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.410
a location-based
AR collection game

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.210
built by Next Stage
in collaboration

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.080
with Publisher FourThirtyThree.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.140
"Ghostbusters World" features
first-person shooter mechanics.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.722
It also allows players
interact in real time

00:25:28.722 --> 00:25:30.180
as they capture
and collect ghosts.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.610

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.710
Notice the London Eye
in the background.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.140
High-fidelity landmarks
really help orient the player

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.550
in their surroundings.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.350
And they instantly
make the game feel

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.760

Finally, we have "The
Walking Dead, Our World"

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.390
built by Next Games and
based on AMC's mega-hit.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.410
This is a location-based
AR survival game

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.960
where players experience the
real world after the zombie

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.960
apocalypse.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.315
In this game, players need
to explore the real world,

00:26:13.315 --> 00:26:17.680
battle walkers, form alliances
with other survivors,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.660
and build safe havens.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.780
Let's take a closer look.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.610
Here you're seeing the
world inside the game.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.790
And you can see that it's
abandoned and crumbling.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.280
So this sort of
gives you the sense

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.430
that you're in the
zombie apocalypse

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.140
and allows you to see
your familiar world

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.090
in an unfamiliar context.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.260
Here's what Next Game
said about their map.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.810
"From the get go, we wanted
to heavily customize the map.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.900
We have a unified look
throughout the game,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.740
which is important for creating
an immersive experience.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.960
We love the buildings
and landmarks the most!

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.570
Especially in
bigger cities, it's

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.380
unbelievable how rich and
recognizable they are.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.510
They truly make our
game feel alive.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.150
And there's so many things
we want to do in the future.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.950
We've barely
scratched the surface

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.957
with what the map
can provide us."

00:27:09.957 --> 00:27:11.540
One cool thing to
note here is the way

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.690
they squashed the buildings
as the player approaches.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.720
I think this gives the map a
really open feel, while you

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.970
can still see the real
world heights of buildings

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.190
further away.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.700
Now notice that our player
here is surrounded by walkers.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.360
Next Games has used the
Playable Locations API

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.810
so you create a lot of
variance in their missions.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.690
It was really
important to them to be

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.510
able to change game play
as much and as often

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.790
as they wanted to
to actually match

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.970
their players' daily routines.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.180
So Next Games used
our API to put points

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.470
where players already were.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.850
One big surprise
for Next Games was

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.600
that every country in the world
comes with its own bespoke set

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.520
of considerations.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.880
So as one example,
consider Finland.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.140
Finland is where an
Next Games is based.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.020
And in Finland,
they have a concept

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.880
called the freedom
to roam, which

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.920
means that anyone can freely
enter any forested area,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.510
no matter who owns it, as long
as it's not someone's backyard.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.710
This results in vast,
playable areas in Finland.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.840
On the other hand, in the US,
you don't want people entering

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.690
cornfields that are
privately owned-- or in Asia,

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.070
rice paddies--

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.560
and trampling and ruining
the crops because they're

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.870
hunting zombies.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.060
So what this means is
that it's not actually

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.270
enough to know that
a place is a forest.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.500
You have to know
what a forest means

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.260
in that context and country.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.510
And it's not enough to know
that something is a field.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.240
You have to know if it's
a field of grass that's

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.780
great for walking or if it's a
delicate rice patty that could

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.720
be ruined by zombie hunters.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.910
This is a really big
challenge, but it's

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.280
one that's made easier with
the Playable Locations API.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.780
All of these games
are coming soon,

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.989
along with lots of others.

00:29:05.989 --> 00:29:07.530
We can't wait to
play them and to see

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.340
what you'll build, as well.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.680
So I'm just going to step
back and summarize now.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.440
With this offering, we want
to make it easy for developers

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.210
to do four things.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.010
First, create dynamic
experiences at global scale.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.530
You'll have access to
hundreds of millions

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.350
of 3D buildings,
points of interest,

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.040
landmarks, roads, and parks
to form the foundation

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.900
of your game world.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.960
And this all relies on that
same model of the world

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.050
that Google Maps has
been building since 2005,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.300
so you'll have fresh and
accurate data no matter where

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.600
your players are.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.720
Second, completely
customize your game world.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.050
You can turn an entire
river into a lava flow,

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.800
fill parks with trees, oceans
with waves, whatever you want.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.510
You can do simple things like
change colors or textures.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.000
But you can also be
much more involved

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.700
and swap entire
features out for prefabs

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.730
like you're seeing here.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.990
Third, design game play
around real world places.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.730
We talked about this a lot.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.000
Find the right locations
for each type of mission,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.700
character, and in-game reward.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.860
Drive your players
to popular places

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.530
or take them off
the beaten path.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.510
That choice is up to
you, and either way,

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:33.000
will help you create your unique
game play at global scale.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.430
And finally, deliver rich
experiences at huge scale.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.110
Relying on Google's
infrastructure

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.650
and serving capacity means
faster response times,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.020
scale on demand, and
the peace of mind

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.140
that your games are
going to just work.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.240
We're really excited
about the possibilities,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.410
and I hope you are, too.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.540
And with that, I'm going
to hand it back to Rose.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.674
Thank you.

00:30:56.674 --> 00:30:57.578
ROSE YAO: Awesome.

00:30:57.578 --> 00:30:59.097
Thank you, Clementine.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.030
Thank you, Clementine,
for showing us

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.790
just how this product works
and the problems we're

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.680
solving for game developers.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.600
I have to admit, I've
been pretty addicted

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.490
to helping with the
zombie apocalypse.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.610
So you'll find me
routinely on my commute

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.580
and at home watching TV
and helping clear zombie

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.630
infestations.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.470
And I hope you guys will join
me soon, because I need help.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.600
As I mentioned in
the beginning, we

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.450
realize that this is
the type of product

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.350
that we can do more and more
of as industry spawn up,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.640
really focus on, how do we
interact with the real world?

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.920
We're excited to partner
with you guys developers.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.560
We're excited to do more
solutions like this.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.320
If your imagination is
running wild, so is ours.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.110
So please come talk to us.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.660
So if you want to sign up
and build a game with us,

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.500
please go to our website,
cloud.google.com/maps

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:58.750

a quick form to tell us what

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.740
you're building.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.960
The form is pretty simple.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.626
But don't worry.

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:04.240
We'll be in contact to ask
you more about your game

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.890
and to help you get started.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.200
We're really excited
to work with you guys.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.007
But this is new
territory for us.

00:32:10.007 --> 00:32:12.340
So we're starting by working
with a smaller set the game

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.147
studios.

00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:14.980
That doesn't mean that
we won't be in touch.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.880
So please, summit your contact
info and be patient with us.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.370
And to talk to us
in person today,

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.310
we will be having
office hours at 1:30.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.002
So at that, Clementine
and I just wanted to say--

00:32:27.002 --> 00:32:28.210
CLEMENTINE JACOBY: Thank you.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.570
ROSE YAO: Thank you, guys.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.820
