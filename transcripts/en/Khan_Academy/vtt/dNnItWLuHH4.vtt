00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.850
Fill in the table
with whole numbers

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.120
to write 0.25 in different ways.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.060
So one way to look at it
is just this 2 in 0.25

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.640
is in the tenths place, so it
literally represents 2 tenths.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.870
While the 5 is in
the hundredths place,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.350
so it literally
represents 5 hundredths.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.240
So that's one way
to represent it.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.220
But then we can start
to rearrange value

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670
amongst these two place values.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.190
For example, what happens
if we only have 1 tenth,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.930
then how many hundredths
would we have to have?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.650
Well, 1 tenth is 10 hundredths.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.500
So if we take the 10 hundredths
that we took away from here,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.510
and give it to the
hundredths place,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.070
you're going to
have 15 hundredths.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.980
And you could verify that
1 tenth plus 15 hundredths

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.710
is equal to 25 hundredths.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.490
Or another way you could say
it is 10 hundredths plus 15

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.950
hundredths is equal
to 25 hundredths.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.860
Now another way you could do
it, you could have no tenths

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.570
and do it as all hundredths,
because 2 tenths is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810
the same thing as 20 hundredths.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.010
So 20 hundredths plus 5
hundredths is 25 hundredths.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.370
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.051
These are a lot of fun.

00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:15.550
Fill in the table
with whole numbers

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.630
to write 20.1 in different ways.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.290
So here, the table, the two
columns are tens and tenths.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.040
So I guess the assumption
is, is we're not

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.610
going to give anything
to the ones place here.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.210
And in the original
example, we didn't

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.340
have anything in the
ones place either.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.420
So we could write the 2 in the
tens place is literally 2 tens.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.760
And the 1 in the tenths
place is literally 1 tenth.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.110
But let's think about what
happens as we regroup value

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.450
from the tens place
to the tenths place.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.890
So if we only have
1 ten, then we

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.510
have another 10 to
play with that we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.205
have to express in
terms of tenths.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.710
1 ten is the same
thing as 10 ones, which

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.700
is the same thing as 100 tenths.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180
So we're essentially
giving 100 tenths.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.700
Notice, we have an extra 10
to play with, 10 of value.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.370
That is the same thing as
100 over 10, or 100 tenths.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220
And we already had 1 tenth.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.572
So 100 tenths plus 1 tenth
is going to be 101 tenths.

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:18.780
I know it's really confusing.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.210
We have tens and tenths.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.720
So now let's go again.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.550
What happens if we take all
the value in the tens place?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.000
So now we have 2 tens,
or 20, to play with.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800
Well, 20 is how many tenths?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.740
Well, you have 10 tenths per 1.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.080
So 20 is 200 tenths.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.230
And so you take the 200
tenths that you took out

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.620
of the tens place.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.040
Add it to the 1 tenth.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.350
And you have 201 tenths.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.820
Let's do one more example.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.840
So let's write 2.1 in
three different ways.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.130
So here it's between the
one and the tenths place.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.040
So we could write it as 2 ones.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.790
And 1 tenth.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.670
We could also write it as 1 one.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.180
And now we've seen
this game before.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.880
We have one extra
1 to play with.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.230
So that's going to be 10 tenths.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.230
Plus the 1 tenth that
was already there,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.020
gives us 11 tenths.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.330
Or if we have no ones, well, 2.1
is the same thing as 21 tenths.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.980
The 2 represents,
literally, 20 tenths.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.730
And then you have the 1 tenth.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.410
So 20 tenths plus 1
tenth is 21 tenths.
