00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.469
Once users have accessed
your homepage or

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.640
your application, you'll likely want
the user to register for an account.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.300
But this isn't always the case.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.170
You should keep in mind that
registration doesn't have to be the next

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.410
immediate step in your process.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.210
You should think carefully about
the entire user experience,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.940
the product you're offering, and

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.390
when you want registration to happen, if
you want registration to happen at all.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.450
Registration on Udacity's site is fairly
simple with just a couple fields or

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.740
you could also login using Facebook or
Google.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.759
For more detailed
examples of sign ups and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.060
onboarding, check out useronboard.com,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.910
You can walk through examples such as,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.420
Gmail to see all the design elements
that guide first time users.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.220
These details include animations
text annotations, tool tips, and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.000
cause to action, all of these lead the
user to successfully using the product

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.220
for the first time.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.010
Now, there are many ways to build out
a successful onboarding experience.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.200
And our best piece of advice is
to test your ideas with users

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.290
using wireframes and mockups.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.900
We'll cover how you can do this with
a design sprint in the next lesson.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.680
To get a real sense of
why testing is important,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.570
check out this article
about Yammer sign up flow.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.100
The company found very
counter-intuitive results by adding

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.180
just one step to the registration flow.
