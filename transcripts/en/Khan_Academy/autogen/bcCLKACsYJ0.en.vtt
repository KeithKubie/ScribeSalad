00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:03.046
 Let's say that we have a 9/10 fraction 

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:08.046
 And I want to add to it fraction 1/6 

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.039
 How much is the sum of their sum? 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.827
 When you first look at these two fractions, you'll say 

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.602
 "I have different denominations here 

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.599
 It is not clear to me how to bring them together " 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.038
 The way is 

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:23.546
 Find a common denominator 

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:26.181
 To convert both of these fractions into 

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.536
 Two fractions have the same place 

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.498
 So how do you think about finding a common denominator? 

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.125
 Well, the common denominator between them would be 

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:36.478
 The common multiplier of these ten and six fractions 

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.638
 Thus, what is the common multiplier of number ten and number six 

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.436
 And often for simplification we find the smaller common multiplier 

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.502
 A good way to find the smallest common multiplier is to start with the largest existing ones 

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.312
 Is the ten, is the ten divided by the six? 

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:50.978
 No ... Well, will the twenty be divided on the six? 

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:56.005
 No ... Is the 30 divided by the six? Yes .. Thirty are divided on the six 

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:57.722
 So all I will do is multiply the ten 

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.556
 Let's say: "What is the smallest multiplier of number ten 

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.644
 The denomination is accepted on the number six "to be equal to the thirty 

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.639
 Thus, we can rewrite the fractions 

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:07.605
 As a number on the thirtieth 

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:10.296
 9/10, how we can type it as a number 

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:11.898
 On the other hand? Well, I'll hit the place 

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:15.984
 I will hit the place in number three 

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:19.617
 All I've done is hit the place in number three 

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.088
 If I did not want to change the value of the fraction 

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:23.586
 I will do the same thing in the rugs 

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:26.186
 That is, I will multiply the numerator in number three 

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:29.854
 And because I hit the numerator in number three 

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:31.433
 It is located in number three 

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:32.954
 The value of the fracture will not change 

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.751
 Nine hit three equals twenty-seven 

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.549
 Again, 9/10 and 27/30 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.964
 Represents the same number 

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:43.564
 He only wrote the fraction with a denominator of 30 

00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:45.631
 I can also type fraction 1/6 

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.100
 In a place equal to 30. Let's do it 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.621
 1/6 is a number of thirty, what is this number? 

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.724
 I encourage you to stop the video and try to think about it 

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:53.850
 I encourage you to stop the video and try to think about it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.149
 What will we do to move from the six to thirty? 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.248
 We'll hit him in the five 

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:01.628
 Therefore, if we hit the place in the five 

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:04.623
 We will also beat the rugs in the five 

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.623
 One hit five equals five 

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.749
 Thus, the 9/10 fraction is like 27/30 fraction 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.453
 A fraction of 1/6 is like a 5/30 fraction 

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:20.226
 Now we can bring them together 

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:21.817
 it is clear that 

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.267
 We have a certain number of 30 parts 

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.335
 In addition to a number of other 30 parts 

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:30.062
 Thus, 27/30 plus 5/30 will be 27 

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:35.062
 It will be 27 plus 5 

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.201
 27 plus five on thirty 

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.583
 Of course it will become equal 

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:47.361
 For breaking 32/30 

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.321
 If we want to simplify this break 

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.805
 We have common factors between 32 and 30 

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:00.196
 Both are divided by the two 

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:03.505
 Therefore, if we divide the ridge and place on two 

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:06.118
 The division of the numerator into two is equal to sixteen 

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.902
 The denomination of the denominator on two equals fifteen 

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.640
 Thus, it is equal to 16/15 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.215
 To write it as a fractional number, the division of sixteen to fifteen is one 

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:17.574
 And the rest is one 

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.255
 If this represents the number 1/15 1 

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:22.534
 Let us put another example 

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:27.018
 Suppose we want to collect 

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:31.881
 1/2 to 

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:36.881
 11/12 

00:03:36.893 --> 00:03:38.033
 I encourage you to turn off the video 

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.864
 To see if the answer could be found 

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:42.502
 As we have seen previously, we want to find 

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:43.883
 Common denominator 

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.102
 If the fractures have the same place 

00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:46.264
 We can combine them directly 

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.527
 But we want to find a common place 

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.222
 Because the properties are now unequal 

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.468
 If we want to find it is the multiplier 

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.794
 The smaller common multiplier of number two and twelve 

00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:58.164
 We will find the smaller common multiplier for two and twelve 

00:03:58.164 --> 00:04:00.264
 Like what we did before, we'll start bigger than 

00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:01.901
 These two pillars are twelve 

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:05.291
 Now we can say twelve hit one equals twelve 

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.949
 The Twelve is the smallest multiplier of the same 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.632
 And accept the division on the two? Yes sure 

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:12.790
 Twelve accept the division on the two 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.855
 Thus, the twelve is actually the smallest common multiplier between the two and the twelve 

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.213
 We can write both of these fractions 

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.013
 As a number on the twelve 

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:21.625
 1/2 is a number of the twelve What is this number? 

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:24.446
 Well, let's go from the two to the twelve we hit in number six 

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.104
 Also we will multiply the numerator in number six 

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:30.588
 Now see that 1/2 fraction is like 6/12 fraction 

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:33.954
 One is half of the two and six is ​​half of the twelve 

00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:38.485
 How can we write the fraction 11/12 as a number on the twelve? 

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.855
 Well, it is already written as a number on the Twelve 

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:43.258
 If 11/12 you have twelve 

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:45.029
 Therefore, we will not change the fraction 11/12 

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:48.268
 So now we can combine 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.350
 If this equals six 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.820
 Equals six plus eleven 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.510
 Six plus eleven on twelve 

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:06.021
 On a dozen, if we have 6/12 plus 11/12 

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:09.318
 Become six plus eleven on twelve 

00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:15.087
 Equal to 17/12 

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:16.504
 If we want to write it in the form of fractional number 

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.487
 The division of the seventeen on the twelve equals one 

00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:24.487
 The rest is five if this equals 5/12 1 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.710
 Let us also solve another issue 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.007
 Strangely, this is fun 

00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:31.043
 Suppose we want to collect 

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:35.894
 3/4 to 

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:40.584
 We'll collect 3/4 to 1/5 

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.974
 1/5 

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:44.659
 How much is the sum of their sum? 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.157
 Again, stop the video 

00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:47.870
 And see if you can solve it 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.291
 Well, here we have different temples 

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.052
 We want to find or want to rewrite the fractions 

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.457
 In the same place 

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:54.792
 Therefore, we must find a common multiplier 

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:57.095
 Ideally, we have to find the smallest common multiplier 

00:05:57.095 --> 00:05:59.738
 What is the smallest common multiplier between the four and five numbers 

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:01.862
 Well, we'll start with the largest number of items 

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.718
 And look at its multiples 

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.061
 Until we reach a number that is divided by four 

00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:10.064
 Five can not divide by four 

00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:13.622
 Ten can not be divided by four or can not be divided by four completely 

00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:14.702
 We will not care about them 

00:06:14.702 --> 00:06:17.059
 Fifteen are not fully divided on the four 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.763
 Twenty are divided by four, in fact twenty are four in five 

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:23.514
 If what we can do we can write 

00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:27.460
 Both of these fractions are in the form of a fracture that possesses the denominator of 20 

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:32.266
 If we can write 3/4 as a number on 20 

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:35.319
 Therefore, let us go from four to twenty in the place 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.949
 We'll hit five 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.466
 Also we will do it in rugs 

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:41.398
 Three hit five equals fifteen 

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:44.183
 All I did for the transfer from four to twenty in the denominator, is multiplication in number five 

00:06:44.183 --> 00:06:45.820
 And we do the same in rugs 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.736
 Three in five equals fifteen 

00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:52.658
 The fraction 15/20 represents the same fraction 3/4 

00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:55.004
 1/5 is a number of twenty, what is this number? 

00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:58.358
 Well, let's go from five to twenty we'll beat in four 

00:06:58.358 --> 00:06:59.995
 And we do the same thing in the rugs 

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:03.861
 When the numerator is hit in four, the fracture becomes equal to 4/20 

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.181
 Therefore, we rewritten 3/4 plus 1/5 

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.815
 To 15/20 plus 4/20 

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:12.973
 How much is the sum of their sum? 

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:17.932
 Fifteen plus four on twenty equals 19/20 

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:22.024
 It's 19/20 and it's over
