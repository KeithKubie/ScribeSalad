00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.741
- [Voiceover] Consider the
molecules represented above

00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:05.924
and the data in the table below.

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.118
We have the structure up here for nonane,

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:12.678
the structure for 2,3,4-trifluoropentane,

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:13.795
which is really hard to say

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:17.296
so I'm gonna abbreviate that, TFP.

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:21.493
And we have this data in the table.

00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.672
So nonane, and 2,3,4-trifluoropentane

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:28.331
have almost identical molar masses,

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:32.127
so 128 versus 126 grams per mole,

00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:36.272
but nonane has a significantly
higher boiling point.

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:40.125
So we can see that nonane
has a boiling point of 151,

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:44.279
versus 89 Celsius for our TFP.

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:47.292
Which of the following statements

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.956
best helps explain this observation?

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:54.874
Before we look at our answer choices,

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:56.977
let's think really fast
about what it means

00:00:56.977 --> 00:01:00.087
to have a higher or lower boiling point.

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:04.290
The boiling point tells us how much energy

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.290
we have to add to break
the intermolecular bonds

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.765
between all of our molecules.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:16.505
So a higher boiling point means that

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:21.459
you have more intermolecular forces

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:24.115
to overcome.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.904
So what we're really asking here is,

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:31.957
which of these answer choices explains

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:36.415
why nonane has more intermolecular forces

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.346
amongst the molecules, compared to TFP?

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:46.631
So, answer choice A says,
the carbon-fluorine bond

00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:50.318
is easier to break than
the carbon-hydrogen bond.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.298
And we know this is a wrong answer,

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:54.236
because this has nothing to do

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.535
with intermolecular forces.

00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:58.334
When something boils, you're not actually

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:01.423
breaking any of the covalent bonds,

00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:04.749
so that doesn't explain anything
about the boiling point.

00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:09.573
Answer choice B says that
the carbon-fluorine bond

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:13.892
is more polar than the
carbon-hydrogen bond.

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:15.982
So we can see that TFP does have

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:18.362
these carbon-fluorine bonds,

00:02:18.362 --> 00:02:22.821
and we know that a
carbon-hydrogen bond isn't

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:26.059
all that polar, and fluorine
is pretty electronegative,

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.918
so this is true.

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:29.084
This statement by itself is true.

00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:32.392
So this is true,

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:37.716
but does it explain the
boiling point trend?

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:41.443
And the answer there
is, it actually doesn't.

00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:45.262
So we're saying that if
the carbon-fluorine bond

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:48.106
is more polar than these bonds here,

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:51.663
we're saying that

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:53.888
if TFP

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.565
has more polar bonds,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.540
that would normally suggest it has

00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:14.740
stronger intermolecular forces,

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:18.333
which would mean you would predict it

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.119
to have a higher boiling point.

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.651
And so, that's the opposite of what

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:24.753
we're actually seeing here.

00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:28.086
Even though our TFP has

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:30.223
more polar C-F bonds,

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:32.128
it actually has a lower boiling point,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.528
so this observation, which is true,

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:38.109
still doesn't explain

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.284
what we're trying to explain. (laughs)

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.023
So choice C says, the
carbon chains are longer

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:51.568
in nonane than they are
in 2,3,4-trifluoropentane.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.849
So if we just look at the pictures here

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.071
of the structures, this is also true.

00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:01.024
In nonane we have these
one, two, three, four, five,

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.124
six, seven, eight, nine carbons.

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:07.239
We have nine carbons
versus one, two, three,

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.450
four, five carbons.

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:16.027
So, how could we link
this to the boiling point?

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:19.429
We know that even though
the molar mass here

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:24.429
is the same, the length of the chain

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.028
is actually related to

00:04:29.028 --> 00:04:32.070
the London dispersion forces.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.994
So as the length of the chain goes up,

00:04:35.994 --> 00:04:40.681
that actually means that the
London dispersion forces,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:46.880
so the intermolecular forces that happen

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.472
when you get these tiny
instantaneous dipoles,

00:04:52.405 --> 00:04:54.570
those forces also go up.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:03.202
So, we're saying, okay,
this has a longer chain.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:07.544
Therefore, it will have more
London dispersion forces

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:10.835
because these molecules
are better able to interact

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:13.749
with each other with their
instantaneous dipoles,

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.767
and that means these forces go up

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:18.508
and the boiling point should go up,

00:05:18.508 --> 00:05:20.274
and that's what we're trying to explain.

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:23.990
So C is the correct answer,
but lets' look at D anyway,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.181
just to make sure we didn't
make any bad decisions.

00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.481
So, just checking.

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:31.815
D says the carbon chains are further apart

00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:33.858
in that sample of nonane than they are

00:05:33.858 --> 00:05:36.714
in 2,3,4-trifluoropentane.

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:39.187
Well, we don't actually
know if this is true or not,

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:41.520
but let's see, if this
statement were true,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.197
would it lead to the boiling
point trend we're seeing?

00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:48.413
If the carbon chains are
further apart in nonane,

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:51.849
further apart would mean,
the further apart they are,

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.550
the weaker the intermolecular forces.

00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.654
So this would mean, nonane has weaker

00:05:58.654 --> 00:06:02.439
intermolecular forces,
and that would suggest

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.022
it would have a lower boiling point.

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:08.940
So a lower boiling point.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.740
And again, this is not what
we're trying to explain.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.400
We know it has a higher boiling point,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.532
so this also doesn't explain,

00:06:16.197 --> 00:06:17.918
that doesn't explain the boiling points.

00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:18.927
So the answer is C.
