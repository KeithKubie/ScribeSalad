Now let's recap a bit. First we talked about encoding, which talked about

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:08.258
automatic processing and effortful processing. And we also talked about levels

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:13.304
of processing. And here, we discussed structural, phonetic, and semantic levels

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:18.182
of processing. We also talked about common ways to encode information deeply

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:24.034
using a mnemonic device. Next we talk about consolidation, where we know that

00:00:24.034 --> 00:00:28.460
sleep is important. Then we moved on to storage and talked about three ways

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.705
that we can store information. Using hierarchies, schemas, and associative

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:39.180
network. Now finally we have retrieval, which is simply recovery of information

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.630
stored in memory.
