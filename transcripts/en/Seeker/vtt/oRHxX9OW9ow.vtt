00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.500
[TRACE] Right now, scientists are attempting
to grow ears, kidneys, blood vessels, livers,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.500
even hearts.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.240
In fact, at the moment there are some people
walking around with lab-grown bladders.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.450
But this is rare.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.460
In the U.S., over 80 percent of transplanted
organs come from the deceased.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.239
The rest are donated by the living — except
for a small number that are grown in laboratories.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.600
However, this could all change fairly soon.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.280
In the not too distant future, you might have
a spare heart, kidney or liver grown for you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.809
in a lab.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.289
And someday there could be warehouses full
of new organs.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.380
So how close are we to farming human body
parts?

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.640
[TRACE] Last year, there was a record number
of organ transplants in the United States

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.050
- over 30 thousand!.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.710
Which sounds like a lot, but the waiting list
for organ donation is over 100-thousand.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.960
There just aren’t enough organs to go around!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960
[DR.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.950
ANTHONY ATALA] In a 20-year period, the actual
number of patients on the transplant list

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.520
has gone up six-fold, 600 percent...So, really,
there's a dire need for organs for patients.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.509
At the moment, the main way to get an organ
is from a donor, but what if we could just

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.920
cook up our own from scratch?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
[DR.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.570
ANTHONY ATALA] We have placed lab-grown organs
into patients already, we have a number of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.520
tissues we have implanted into patients.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.060
And the goal is to increase the number of
patients that can benefit from these technologies.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.189
[TRACE] And Dr Atala knows.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.590
He led the team that developed the first lab-grown
organ to be transplanted into a human in 2006.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.940
It was a bladder which, to be fair, is a pretty
simple structure.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.280
But what about organs that are more complex?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.740
[TODD McDEVITT]: Each of them actually, even
the ones that may look simple, have their

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.390
unique challenges to them

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.409
[DR. ANTHONY ATALA] there are some things which
are harder to make than others.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.179
For example, there's a level of complexity
as we look at tissues with flat structures

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.040
such as skin being the least complex.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.780
They're flat, mostly one major cell type.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.520
Tubular structures, like blood vessels, are
the second level of complexity.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.190
Hollow non-tubular organs, like the stomach,
the bladder, are the third level of complexity.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.580
And by far the most complex are the solid
organs, like the heart, the lung, the kidney,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580
the liver.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.480
[TODD McDEVITT] As they get more complex in
terms of the numbers of cells involved and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.910
the structural features, the complexity of
those.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.100
The brain is certainly one that many people,
I think, would say is among the list of higher

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.780
tissues or organs to try and create.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.280
[TRACE] Now, there are scientists who are
working on growing brains in the lab, but

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.040
so far they’ve only produced miniature,
partially functioning brains, about the size

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.930
of a piece of popcorn.But these aren’t being
grown to implant into humans, they’re being

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.370
used for medical testing.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.580
Like, seeing how the Zika virus affects the
human brain.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.890
Now, how are scientists doing all this?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.320
Well, growing organs and organ tissue comes
down to our good friend, the stem cell.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.410
Stem cells are the basis of all the cells
in our body.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.770
They’re like children, and can grow up to
be anything.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.770
[DR.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.280
ANTHONY ATALA] To grow a tissue, or an organ,
one of the very first challenges to overcome

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040
is really how to get the cells to grow.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.030
[TODD McDEVITT] The pluripotent cell has the
potential, at the earliest state, to turn

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.120
into heart and liver and lung.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.760
Not just the tissue, but all the different
cell types: the heart muscle cells, the blood

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.730
vessel cells--all of those necessary cells
that you need to form a complex tissue or

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.280
organ.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.370
[TRACE] Our old friend the stem cell is powerful.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.070
It’s already being used to grow things like
skin and tracheas

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.060
[TODD McDEVITT] One thing we're interested
in is using the power of stem cells to try

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.150
and grow or coax the cells to form the tissues,
largely on their own so what are the minimal

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.450
cues, the minimal information we need to provide
to let them do something they’re already

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.440
capable of doing.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.260
[TRACE] But we want to know about growing
a complete organ, or let’s say, an entire

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.850
farm of organs and that’s where things get
a little crazy.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.269
Right now, scientists are creating organs
and body parts using 3D printers.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.030
They make a biocompatible plastic scaffold,
stems cells are placed onto it, and then they

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.349
pop that whole thing into an incubator that
mimics the conditions of the human body.

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.349
[DR.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.020
ANTHONY ATALA] Through the 3D printers we’re
really trying many different types of tissues.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.669
We use, basically, your typical, imaging software
program that’s available at every major

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.020
hospital where you can really three-dimensionally
configure what the organ really looks like

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.590
and then to develop our own software program
that can then download the information from

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.840
an x-ray, then you can print a structure to
fit that specific defect in that patient

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:03.120
[TRACE] While we can print simple structures,
solid organs are more complex - engineers

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.810
need to figure out how to connect blood vessels
and tissues within the same organ.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.810
Which ain’t easy.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.810
[DR.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.080
ANTHONY ATALA] The most difficult organs to
create are the solid organs.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.650
But the future really is can we actually create
structure so we can put in,to either augment,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.919
or replace these solid organs.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.229
[TRACE] Then we have to overcome another huge
obstacle.

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.302
Even if we can make these organs, how can
we produce them on a large scale and farm

00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:31.302
them?

00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:34.300
How do we meet the demand of thousands and
thousands of patients.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.979
It’s a process that could to take decades.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:46.090
[TODD McDEVITT] So, realistically speaking,
I think that widespread manufacturing and

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.259
availability of large organs that are produced
in a lab or reactor setting: we're still a

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.830
long ways away because of some of the challenges
that we face in growing them reproducibly

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.020
to that size.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.270
Where I see in the shorter-term success--five,
ten year period--is that, can we make small

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.270
pieces of them?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.729
Can we make lots of them?

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:05.729
[DR.

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.460
ANTHONY ATALA] In terms of solid organs, it's
still gonna be a while.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.040
In terms of the less complex organs, such
as flat, tubular and hollow non-tubular organs,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040
we're already there.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.780
We're putting these into patients now.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.690
[TODD McDEVITT] One of the big ones of the
moment is the manufacturing.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.449
Can you make enough of this and can you make
it repeatedly enough so that it’s deemed

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.449
safe?

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.490
You can’t just make it once and it be very
different the next time.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.449
That’s not acceptable.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.800
[TRACE] So we’ve come a long way.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.560
But seeing row upon row of hearts, livers
and kidneys being grown and delivered to you

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.629
via drone?

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.199
That’s still the stuff of sci-fi for sure.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.680
So take care of that liver.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680
Or don’t.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.889
Who am i, your dad?
