You are getting sleepy, very, very sleepy...your
eyelids are getting heavy... you’re falling

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.720
into a deep state of hypnosis…

Hey there hypno-sisters, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.579
Now, you’ve all seen those magicians who
call up audience members to the stage, hypnotize

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.339
them, and they dance around like a chicken
or take off their pants.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.460
But if you live in the United Kingdom, you
might have no idea what I’m talking about.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.690
Because TV stations in the UK are prohibited
from broadcasting an entire hypnotic routine,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.210
fearing that viewers at home may become hypnotized!

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.710
In fact, in 1952, the UK passed the Hypnosis
Act, which levies up to a 1,000 pound fine

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.829
on those who practice unregulated hypnosis
for entertainment purposes.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.879
So… is there legitimacy to hypnosis?

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.160
Well… what is hypnosis anyway?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.670
The Society of Psychological Hypnosis, which
is an actual division of the American Psychological

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
Association, defines hypnosis as “A state
of consciousness involving focused attention

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.860
and reduced peripheral awareness characterized
by an enhanced capacity for response to suggestion.”

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.580
What we know as modern day hypnotism originated
out of pure animal magnetism.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.750
No, seriously, the term “animal magnetism”
was the original name given to the supposedly

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.610
manipulatable force exuded by all living animals,
as posited by Dr. Franz Friedrich Anton Mesmer

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.820
in the 18th and early 19th century.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.910
His efforts at using animal magnetism for
healing, which was also called “mesmerism”,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.310
which is the same place we get the term “mesmerize”
from, was an early form of “hypnosis”.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.970
But according to psychologists like Robert
A. Baker, hypnosis is simply a learned social

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.730
behavior, where participants are playing a
role and mostly using their imagination.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.840
However, a new study out of Stanford University
actually lends credibility to the idea that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.270
maybe hypnosis isn’t all just self-convinced
make-believe.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.020
The study looked at 57 subjects, split roughly
into those with very low and very high susceptibility

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.200
to hypnosis.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.340
The participants were put into an fMRI machine,
which measures which parts of brain fill up

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.640
with blood, and they found that when subjects
of both low and high susceptibility were hypnotized,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
there was reduced activity in the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex and increased activity between

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.920
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the
brain’s salience network.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
Got it?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
Great, moving on.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
What?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920
Oh, okay.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.920
So for those of you who don’t know all the
different parts of the brain and what they

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.850
do and how that whole mess works: Basically,
these parts of the brain are directly responsible

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.670
for focusing attention, controlling movement
and emotion, and regulating just how self-conscious

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.670
you feel.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.820
So, the parts of the brain correlated with
planning and executing tasks, and the part

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.490
that causes self-reflection interact less
when a person is hypnotized, making them not

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.040
so self-conscious about jumping up and down
like a chicken on stage.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.580
So hypnosis is real?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.480
Well yeah, in a way.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.180
Hypnosis is a state of consciousness similar
to meditation, which is totally real.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.760
In fact, despite its bad rap, hypnosis is
used in hypnotherapy.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.450
Practitioners say that the biggest benefit
is that the shift in brain activity, as shown

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.610
by the Stanford study, helps patients look
at their issues in a different perspective,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.060
and that by itself is hugely helpful.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.350
A meta-analysis of hypnotherapy effectiveness
in studies on addiction and medical conditions,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.670
as well as anxiety, showed that while untreated
patients improved about 27% of the time, hypnotized

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:44.750
patients improved 74% of 
the time.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:04:11.099
Clearly, somehow 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.440
hypnosis works.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.030
WAKE UP!
