00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:08.370
(piano riff)

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:12.420
- [Man] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.920
bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:20.534
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.237
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:28.450
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.533
yet filled with optimism,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.859
we grow up slowly,

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.146
we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:38.574
we empathize,

00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:39.574
and deceive.

00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:42.434
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.184
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:50.189
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.016
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:54.683
and how we got here.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.040
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.123
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:18.496
(electronic riff)

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:37.847
- I'm gonna give you a little
bit of a break from the brain,

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.379
and focus on the face.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:44.691
So, a central, if in fact
not the central question

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:46.591
in modern biology is to understand

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.202
the genotype-to-phenotype connection.

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:52.566
In other words how does
information encoded by the genome

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.743
reveals itself through
the developmental process

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:58.691
to produce specific phenotypes.

00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.866
And the flip side to this question

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.429
is to understand how
variation between the genome

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.926
during evolution produces
phenotypic variation,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.994
either between species,
or between individuals

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:12.931
within the same species,

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.348
and how come such common genetic variants

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.955
can determine disease susceptibility

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.664
in complex human diseases.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:25.978
I'm sure most of you
heard by now that most

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:29.667
complex disease and
trait associated variants

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:32.764
map to the non-coding parts of the genome,

00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:35.014
so not to our genes per se,

00:02:35.908 --> 00:02:38.168
the protein coding parts of the genome

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:40.387
but to the vast non-coding
space that comprises

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:42.720
over 98% of the genome.

00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:47.081
Moreover, evidence begins to emerge

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.564
that these variants are enriched within

00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:52.988
cis-regulatory elements,
but especially within

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:56.992
a specific class of regulatory
elements called enhancers.

00:02:56.992 --> 00:02:59.425
So, these are modular genetic sequences

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:03.005
that can activate gene
expression at large distances,

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.550
and are typically specialized
to activate gene expression

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.775
in a specific tissue context.

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:13.012
And the idea here is that
this genetic variance,

00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:16.470
or single nucleotide
polymorphisms within enhancers

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.817
can produce either weak or
strong enhancer alleles,

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:24.405
which in turn can lead to
quantitative differences

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:28.572
in gene expression, and
influence downstream traits.

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:31.803
We learned from the EVO-DEVO community

00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:33.868
working on model organisms that

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:37.013
starting this regulatory
landscape evolution of closely

00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:40.733
related species can be an
extremely powerful tool

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:44.787
in uncovering genotype
to phenotype connections.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:48.151
So, for example elegant
work from Sean Carrol,

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:49.695
David Kingsley, and others,

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:52.011
unequivocally demonstrated the change

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:56.146
in enhancer sequence can
dictate change in phenotypes

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:58.441
such as wing pattern in Drosophila,

00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:01.463
or skeletal changes in stickleback fish.

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:04.353
And we were very interested
in expanding this type

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:07.934
of EVO-DEVO thinking into
humans and other primates.

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.546
But of course, as it's
already been mentioned,

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:13.945
some of the key developmentally,

00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:16.492
and evolutionary important cell types

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:19.887
cannot be studied directly
in embryonic context

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:21.956
from humans and other great apes,

00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:24.289
for obvious ethical reasons.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:29.960
But it has already been introduced

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.576
that now with induced birth,

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:34.903
but in stem cell models
we can study cellular,

00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:38.053
and molecular mechanisms
underlying phenotypic divergence

00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:39.567
in higher primates.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.861
A few years back we referred
to this general strategy

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:45.115
as cellular anthropology

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:49.512
So, one of the phenotypes
that we are most interested in

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:53.830
is human face, and also human
craniofacial development.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.309
We know that craniofacial
variation both within and between

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.559
species is largely genetically encoded,

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:05.151
so we have unique facial
features that are distinct

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:08.329
from those of other great apes,

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:11.055
but also there is a lot
of individual variation

00:05:11.055 --> 00:05:13.456
in facial form, both within the humans,

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:17.756
but also in our close
evolutionary relatives.

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:20.396
So, the question is what
are the cellular origins

00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:22.204
of facial variation?

00:05:22.204 --> 00:05:25.237
It turns out that most
of our face and head

00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:26.989
is derived from the single cell type

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:29.328
called cranial neural crest cells.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:33.444
These are very unique cells
that form early in gestation,

00:05:33.444 --> 00:05:35.151
at three to five weeks,

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:38.474
they're induced in dorsal
anterior part of the neural tube,

00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:41.260
and then they migrate long distances,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.061
and their destination
they can differentiate

00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:47.322
to a large variety of cell
types including bone cartilage,

00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:51.391
connective tissue, cranial
nerve, and pigment cells,

00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:55.299
and as a result in fact, most
of the craniofacial complex

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.043
is derived from the neural crest.

00:05:58.043 --> 00:06:01.130
Moreover, similar work
from Nicole LeDuarin,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.177
and others showed through
cross species transplantation

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:08.127
experiments in avian
embryos that these cells

00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:10.928
autonomously carry much of the information

00:06:10.928 --> 00:06:14.219
on species specific facial morphology.

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.962
So, these cells are important,
but how can we access them

00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:19.629
from humans, and other primates?

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.393
As you already probably realized,

00:06:23.393 --> 00:06:25.780
this is a tricky proposition,

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.921
so there's a transient
embryonic cell types

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.358
forming at three to
five weeks of gestation,

00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:33.144
we cannot access them
directly from the embryo

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:36.940
but thanks to the IPS and ES technologies

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.960
we can derive them in vitro,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.201
and indeed that's what my lab has done

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:42.781
over the last several years,

00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:46.948
established protocols
to obtain in vitro cells

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.029
with bonafide characteristics

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.505
of the cranial neural crest cells.

00:06:51.505 --> 00:06:54.966
More recently Sara Prescott,
former graduate student

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.928
in the lab, working
collaboration with Rusty Gage

00:06:57.928 --> 00:07:01.194
extended this model to a chimpanzee,

00:07:01.194 --> 00:07:03.926
and here really were a few key features,

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:06.921
were to reduce heterogeneity
of the population,

00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:10.338
and properly stage human and chimp cells,

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:15.264
because unless you do that,
the developmental differences

00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:18.959
are gonna dominate over
species differences.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.090
Moreover, we also went to great lengths

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.642
to ensure that not only
molecular signatures,

00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:27.415
but also cellular
properties of these cells

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.519
represent bonafide neural crests cells,

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:32.344
so for example, we can
transplant these cells

00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:34.089
to the chick embryo neural tube,

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:36.039
and they will engraft, migrate,

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.407
and assume correct positional
identities in the embryo,

00:07:40.407 --> 00:07:41.930
and they also retain this

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.597
very broad differentiation
potential characteristic

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.370
of the crest.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.376
So, now with this model in hand,

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:52.128
we used epigenomic strategy
to systematically annotate

00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:53.946
regulatory elements.

00:07:53.946 --> 00:07:57.068
So, just to give you an
idea for those of you

00:07:57.068 --> 00:07:59.649
who are not so familiar with epigenomics,

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:02.842
one active enhancer is to share

00:08:02.842 --> 00:08:05.343
certain common chromatin features,

00:08:05.343 --> 00:08:08.767
and we can use technology
like or ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:11.710
to map these features genome wide

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.956
in an unbiased manner
in a specific cell type.

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:18.384
Then we can correlate
these changes in epigenomic

00:08:18.384 --> 00:08:21.692
patterns with changes in gene expression

00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:23.525
determined by RNA-seq.

00:08:25.313 --> 00:08:28.813
So, to do this, Sara took in-vitro derived

00:08:30.547 --> 00:08:33.480
neural crest cells from
multiple independent

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.813
chimp and human individuals,

00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:39.485
and performed mapping of
transcription factors,

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:43.895
and general co-activators,
analysis of hypersensitivity

00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:48.374
by ATAC-seq, and also analyze
certain chemical types

00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:51.342
or histone modifications that
are present on nucleosomes,

00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:54.704
when regulatory elements are active.

00:08:54.704 --> 00:08:57.260
And based on the simple
chromatin signatures,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.702
she was able to map
enhancers that are active

00:09:00.702 --> 00:09:03.898
in the neural crest cells,
and also distinguish them

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:07.285
from other classes of regulatory elements

00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:09.891
such as promoters, and
then ultimately link to

00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:12.878
differences in gene expression.

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:14.849
One thing I really need to mention

00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:17.611
is that not only we can map
these regulatory elements,

00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:20.935
but that quantitative
comparisons of chromatin

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.530
signatures at these elements

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.206
can be used to infer
differences in their activity.

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:28.590
So, it's not only where
these enhancers are,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.423
but we can compare quantitatively

00:09:33.141 --> 00:09:37.347
tags of chromatin signatures
to infer how different

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:40.719
they are in their activity
between the species.

00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:43.456
So, this forms the basis
of what I refer to as

00:09:43.456 --> 00:09:45.182
comparative epigenomics,

00:09:45.182 --> 00:09:47.536
an idea here is simple,

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:50.626
that we're comparing in the same cell,

00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:53.015
that between two closely related species,

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:55.137
so most of these epigenomic patterns

00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:57.557
that we recover should
be invariant between

00:09:57.557 --> 00:09:58.929
the two species.

00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:01.124
But the idea is also that
we will be able to see

00:10:01.124 --> 00:10:04.457
some differences, quantitative differences

00:10:04.457 --> 00:10:08.473
in those chemical tags
that mark active chromatin,

00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:11.503
which will be indicative of the difference

00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:13.362
in regulatory activity,

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.536
which then hopefully will also be able to

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:18.515
link to differences in gene expression.

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:21.708
So, that's the idea, how does
the actual data look like?

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:24.488
Well indeed most of
the epigenomic patterns

00:10:24.488 --> 00:10:27.767
are invariant between human and chimp.

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:31.001
But we also see at the smaller subset

00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:32.861
of regions we see differences,

00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:37.403
as indicated here in
this chimp-biased region,

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:41.420
or indicated here in this
human-biased enhancer region.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.166
So, we can quantify
them, these differences

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.871
across the whole genome,

00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.670
and compare different
individuals of the same species,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.627
so different humans or different chimps,

00:10:51.627 --> 00:10:54.064
and that variation is shown here in red,

00:10:54.064 --> 00:10:56.649
or we can compare between the species

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.706
between human and chimp,

00:10:58.706 --> 00:11:00.446
and as you can see there is more variation

00:11:00.446 --> 00:11:04.064
between the species, shown here in blue,

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:06.180
than within the species,

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.638
and we'll refer to those falling outside

00:11:08.638 --> 00:11:11.176
as either human-biased or chimp-biased

00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:13.646
candidate enhancer regions.

00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:18.216
Importantly, we can also
see these regulatory changes

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:20.810
with changes in gene expression,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.795
so in other words, genes near
the human-biased enhancers

00:11:24.795 --> 00:11:27.212
tend to be human-biased in expression,

00:11:27.212 --> 00:11:29.692
and those near chimp-biased enhancers

00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:31.640
are chimp-biased in expression,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.133
and that's of course important

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:36.900
because gene expression
differences ultimately matters

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.585
for exerting phenotypic differences.

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:43.141
Moreover, these are not
just some random genes,

00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.052
but in fact when we do ontology annotation

00:11:46.052 --> 00:11:47.751
for these biased genes,

00:11:47.751 --> 00:11:50.282
we see that they're
associated with development

00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:53.855
and malformation of various
craniofacial structures,

00:11:53.855 --> 00:11:57.666
including those structures that
are actually quite divergent

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.985
between human and chimp.

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:03.077
But now an important question to ask

00:12:03.077 --> 00:12:05.390
is where do these interspecies differences

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.791
in enhancer signatures come from?

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:10.836
Are they due to differences
in the trans-regulatory

00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:14.320
environments of the human
and chimp neural crests

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.877
or different in transcription
factor networks,

00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:18.735
things like that?

00:12:18.735 --> 00:12:21.496
Or are they due to differences in enhancer

00:12:21.496 --> 00:12:25.681
sequence itself, so
cis-regulatory changes?

00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:28.099
And to distinguish between
these two possibilities,

00:12:28.099 --> 00:12:30.927
we designed the following assay.

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:34.111
We synthesized the library
of orthologous regions

00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:37.440
that were either
human-biased, chimp-biased,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.322
or invariant in our epigenomic data.

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:42.873
And then we cloned this
library to a so called

00:12:42.873 --> 00:12:45.507
self transcribing enhancer reporter vector

00:12:45.507 --> 00:12:47.982
forming a basis of the STARR-seq

00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:50.669
as he described two years
ago by Alex Stark's lab.

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.382
And which relies on
the ability of enhancer

00:12:53.382 --> 00:12:56.099
to activate it's own
expression at a distance,

00:12:56.099 --> 00:12:58.540
and then drive it's own expression,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.803
and serve as it's own barcode.

00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:02.310
And we took this library,

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.131
and introduced it to either chimp,

00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.493
or human neural crest cells.

00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:09.029
From this, we learned
two important things,

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:12.529
first of all, bias in epigenomic signature

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:18.227
translates into the bias in the ability

00:13:18.227 --> 00:13:21.381
of these sequences to
drive gene expression,

00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:24.687
in other words what we
predicted as human-biased,

00:13:24.687 --> 00:13:27.814
which you should be seeing
here was human-biased,

00:13:27.814 --> 00:13:30.582
and what we predicted as chimp-biased,

00:13:30.582 --> 00:13:32.644
was chimp-biased in general

00:13:32.644 --> 00:13:36.154
in ability to drive gene expression.

00:13:36.154 --> 00:13:38.018
And the second important conclusion

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:40.954
was the direction of
the bias was the same,

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:44.689
whether we tested our library
in the context of human,

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:47.022
or chimp neural crest cells,

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:50.915
and what this tells us is that the bias

00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:54.183
is encoded by the sequence
of enhancers themselves,

00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:56.816
rather than imposed by the differences

00:13:56.816 --> 00:13:59.435
in trans-regulatory environments.

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:02.816
So, if it's in the sequence,
and the trans-regulatory

00:14:02.816 --> 00:14:04.823
environments are more conserved,

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:07.876
we can go as far as to the
trans-regulatory environment

00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:11.876
of the mouse to gain some
insight when and where

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.565
during development these
enhancers maybe active,

00:14:16.565 --> 00:14:18.875
and here I'm showing a couple of examples

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:23.370
of this, where we're looking
at the human-biased enhancer,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.323
and we're cloning orthologous sequence

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.787
from either human or chimp

00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:29.787
to the LacZ enhancer reporter vector,

00:14:29.787 --> 00:14:32.840
and testing in the context
of the mouse embryo.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.202
And why there is a shared expression

00:14:35.202 --> 00:14:38.535
in the olfactory placode associated gain

00:14:40.387 --> 00:14:44.137
in multiple domains
within the head and face.

00:14:46.993 --> 00:14:49.324
And here is another example,

00:14:49.324 --> 00:14:51.196
again a human-biased enhancer,

00:14:51.196 --> 00:14:53.392
this one is more pan-neural crest,

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:56.229
and again you see the gain of activity

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.635
for the human sequence,

00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:02.060
and this one is actually
quite blazing in the face,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.278
whereas the corresponding
chimp sequence is not active.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:08.693
So, this is interesting because it shows

00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:11.241
that we can systematically
identify enhancers

00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.764
that change their regulatory activity

00:15:13.764 --> 00:15:16.606
during recent human evolution,

00:15:16.606 --> 00:15:18.511
and we can even learn something about

00:15:18.511 --> 00:15:22.412
their spacial-temporal
activity during development.

00:15:22.412 --> 00:15:24.991
But what this type of
work will not tell us,

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:28.001
is whether these enhancers
are actually responsible

00:15:28.001 --> 00:15:31.880
for driving variation
in facial morphology.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.597
And while we can model
some of these aspects

00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:36.267
of variation in the mouse,

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.471
again mouse is not an ideal system

00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.543
for studying human facial variation.

00:15:41.543 --> 00:15:44.109
So, to try addressing this question,

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:48.196
we thought about harnessing
glorious normal-range

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:49.783
human facial variation,

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:53.810
which you can see just
looking around this room,

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.221
and our ability to know evasively,

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:59.035
and quite precisely quantified.

00:15:59.035 --> 00:16:02.595
And to do this we teamed up
with a group of anthropologists,

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.804
engineers, and human geneticists

00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:08.934
who developed a very novel methodology

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.831
for unbiased facial phenotyping,

00:16:11.831 --> 00:16:15.260
and I just want to mention
at least three names,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.184
Peter Claes, Mark Shriver,
and Seth Weinberg.

00:16:19.184 --> 00:16:22.079
And what Peter has done is developed

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.380
this very precise method
to quantify facial shape,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.960
which relies on 3D facial scans,

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.293
that are then mirror imaged,

00:16:31.236 --> 00:16:35.403
and then remapped into the dense
mesh of 10,000 coordinates.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:42.380
So, essentially, in other words,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.759
each face is translated
into 10,000 coordinates,

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:50.258
then averaged to remove deviations
from bilateral symmetry,

00:16:50.258 --> 00:16:53.382
and then aligned across
many, many participants

00:16:53.382 --> 00:16:55.968
in the study to establish correspondence

00:16:55.968 --> 00:16:58.376
of these 10,000 coordinates.

00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:02.211
And this allows for
unbiased facial phenotyping,

00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:04.632
and quantifying shape variation

00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:07.268
over global-to-local facial segments,

00:17:07.268 --> 00:17:11.169
starting from very global
effects on facial variation

00:17:11.169 --> 00:17:15.336
to effects on very specific
aspects of the facial shape,

00:17:16.172 --> 00:17:18.865
as highlighted here in yellow.

00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:21.272
And this type of analysis has been done

00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:25.799
on many, many participants
over 2,000 participants

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:29.288
replicated on the independent cohort

00:17:29.288 --> 00:17:31.302
of another 2,000 participants,

00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:36.072
and having genotype information
for these participants

00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:39.559
allowed us to perform genome
wide association studies

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.808
to identify candidate variants

00:17:41.808 --> 00:17:44.244
that may be associated
with different aspects

00:17:44.244 --> 00:17:45.823
of facial variation.

00:17:45.823 --> 00:17:47.324
While I don't have time to go

00:17:47.324 --> 00:17:49.218
into the details of that study,

00:17:49.218 --> 00:17:51.482
I just want to show you one example

00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:54.244
that I think is really quite interesting.

00:17:54.244 --> 00:17:57.142
So, this example of one
such genetic variant,

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.436
the lead SNP on Chromosome two,

00:17:59.436 --> 00:18:03.172
that we linked to variation
in lower face morphology,

00:18:03.172 --> 00:18:05.692
particularly the jaw shape.

00:18:05.692 --> 00:18:09.358
So, when we look underneath this SNP

00:18:09.358 --> 00:18:11.093
at our epigenomic data,

00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:13.357
we see that it falls smack in the middle

00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:15.329
of an active neuron crest enhancer,

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:17.789
but what is really interesting about it,

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:21.012
is that the same enhancer
is actually chimp-biased

00:18:21.012 --> 00:18:22.785
in activity.

00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:26.098
Moreover, the very same SNP was associated

00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:28.140
by another group earlier this year

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.965
with susceptibility to
non-syndromic cleft lip,

00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:34.294
and palate in Europeans as shown here.

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:37.848
So, we were really quite
excited by examples like that,

00:18:37.848 --> 00:18:40.444
because what this suggests that perhaps

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:42.693
overlapping set of regulatory elements

00:18:42.693 --> 00:18:45.644
can influence variation
at multiple levels,

00:18:45.644 --> 00:18:49.568
both between the species,
within the species,

00:18:49.568 --> 00:18:52.401
and then when combined with either

00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:55.837
environmental pertubation
or other variants

00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:58.933
influencing disease susceptibility

00:18:58.933 --> 00:19:02.071
in common disease like cleft lip palate.

00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:03.791
So, we're starting to think that

00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:06.525
it's going to be about the
quantitative differences,

00:19:06.525 --> 00:19:08.841
and about the combinatorial effect

00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:12.569
which really will ultimately
separate those three scenarios,

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:15.932
the differences between within-species,

00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:17.588
and disease states.

00:19:17.588 --> 00:19:19.593
And with this thought,
I want to leave you,

00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:21.995
and thank people involved.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.386
In particular Sara Prescott,

00:19:24.386 --> 00:19:27.788
who now moved onto Harvard as a post-doc

00:19:27.788 --> 00:19:31.896
was an extremely talented and
open minded graduate student

00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:35.224
who took on, and started all
the evolutionary projects

00:19:35.224 --> 00:19:36.635
in my lab.

00:19:36.635 --> 00:19:38.302
I want to acknowledge Tomek

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:41.095
for most of the genomic data anlaysis

00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:42.725
that I've shown you today,

00:19:42.725 --> 00:19:45.623
and really thinking about
how we can quantitatively

00:19:45.623 --> 00:19:48.956
compare human and chimp epigenomic data.

00:19:50.543 --> 00:19:54.641
I'm also grateful to
Rusty, and Carol Marchetto,

00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:56.573
about whom you already heard today,

00:19:56.573 --> 00:19:59.916
for really sharing those chimp IPS cells

00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:01.219
very early in the game.

00:20:01.219 --> 00:20:04.262
Our mouse genetics
collaborator, Licia Selleri,

00:20:04.262 --> 00:20:08.017
and also a human
phenotyping and GWAS team,

00:20:08.017 --> 00:20:11.128
Peter Claes, Seth
Weinberg, and Mark Shriver.

00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:12.779
Thank you very much.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:15.398
(applause)

00:20:15.398 --> 00:20:18.231
