from the Google Maps developer relations

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600
from the Google Maps developer relations
 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.900
from the Google Maps developer relations
team and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
team and I'm going to show you how to
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330
team and I'm going to show you how to
use map padding with the Google Maps

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
use map padding with the Google Maps
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720
use map padding with the Google Maps
Android API let's say you have an

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
Android API let's say you have an
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000
Android API let's say you have an
application that has a map and you want

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
application that has a map and you want
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310
application that has a map and you want
to add a sidebar to the map but you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
to add a sidebar to the map but you
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.790
to add a sidebar to the map but you
don't want to hide the map UI controls

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
don't want to hide the map UI controls
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.759
don't want to hide the map UI controls
or the Google logo let's see what

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769
or the Google logo let's see what
 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.070
or the Google logo let's see what
happens if you add a sidebar without

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080
happens if you add a sidebar without
 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.049
happens if you add a sidebar without
adding map padding this little demo app

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
adding map padding this little demo app
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.740
adding map padding this little demo app
has a sidebar on the right and as you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
has a sidebar on the right and as you
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.820
has a sidebar on the right and as you
can see the find my location control is

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830
can see the find my location control is
 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.740
can see the find my location control is
at the top right but it's obscured by

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
at the top right but it's obscured by
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.320
at the top right but it's obscured by
the sidebar and similarly the map zoom

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330
the sidebar and similarly the map zoom
 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.030
the sidebar and similarly the map zoom
controls are at the bottom right and

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040
controls are at the bottom right and
 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.160
controls are at the bottom right and
they're completely hidden so what I've

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
they're completely hidden so what I've
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869
they're completely hidden so what I've
done with this application is add a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
done with this application is add a
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.509
done with this application is add a
button called padded and if I touch the

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
button called padded and if I touch the
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.969
button called padded and if I touch the
padded button the application calls a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
padded button the application calls a
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.690
padded button the application calls a
method which adds 30 pixels of padding

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
method which adds 30 pixels of padding
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030
method which adds 30 pixels of padding
on the right-hand side of the map so you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
on the right-hand side of the map so you
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039
on the right-hand side of the map so you
can see that the UI controls are now

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
can see that the UI controls are now
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080
can see that the UI controls are now
nicely displayed slightly to the left of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
nicely displayed slightly to the left of
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630
nicely displayed slightly to the left of
my sidebar the map still takes up the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
my sidebar the map still takes up the
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.520
my sidebar the map still takes up the
entire view but the user controls and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
entire view but the user controls and
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.609
entire view but the user controls and
the gestures behave as if they're only

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
the gestures behave as if they're only
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830
the gestures behave as if they're only
using up the smaller visible portion of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
using up the smaller visible portion of
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.160
using up the smaller visible portion of
the map so I'm going to tap the find my

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
the map so I'm going to tap the find my
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.959
the map so I'm going to tap the find my
location control and you can see that

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969
location control and you can see that
 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.719
location control and you can see that
the little blue location indicator is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
the little blue location indicator is
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429
the little blue location indicator is
nicely positioned in the center of the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
nicely positioned in the center of the
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.770
nicely positioned in the center of the
map it's taken met padding into account

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
map it's taken met padding into account
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.830
map it's taken met padding into account
now if I touch the normal button which

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
now if I touch the normal button which
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260
now if I touch the normal button which
removes map padding from my map and then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
removes map padding from my map and then
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050
removes map padding from my map and then
touch the find my location button again

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
touch the find my location button again
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880
touch the find my location button again
you'll see that the location indicators

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
you'll see that the location indicators
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590
you'll see that the location indicators
move slightly to the right and it seems

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
move slightly to the right and it seems
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200
move slightly to the right and it seems
to be off-center and that's because it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
to be off-center and that's because it's
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.059
to be off-center and that's because it's
taking the whole map into account

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069
taking the whole map into account
 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.209
taking the whole map into account
instead of just the visible portion okay

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
instead of just the visible portion okay
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.879
instead of just the visible portion okay
I'm going to touch Sydney and position

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889
I'm going to touch Sydney and position
 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:06.889
I'm going to touch Sydney and position
the center of the map in Australia so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
the center of the map in Australia so
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.419
the center of the map in Australia so
that there's a nice lot of blue see

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
that there's a nice lot of blue see
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100
that there's a nice lot of blue see
around and that means that you can see

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
around and that means that you can see
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930
around and that means that you can see
the Google logo at the bottom left of

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
the Google logo at the bottom left of
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.330
the Google logo at the bottom left of
the screen now it's worth noting that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
the screen now it's worth noting that
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.199
the screen now it's worth noting that
your application needs to show the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
your application needs to show the
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.540
your application needs to show the
Google logo if it hides the Google logo

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
Google logo if it hides the Google logo
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030
Google logo if it hides the Google logo
then it's not in compliance with the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
then it's not in compliance with the
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.070
then it's not in compliance with the
Terms of Service of the Google Maps API

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
Terms of Service of the Google Maps API
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.980

s so if you need to add UI controls at

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990
s so if you need to add UI controls at
 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.960
s so if you need to add UI controls at
the bottom left of your map map padding

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
the bottom left of your map map padding
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.490
the bottom left of your map map padding
is a good way to make sure that the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
is a good way to make sure that the
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.580
is a good way to make sure that the
Google logo appears ok let's take a look

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
Google logo appears ok let's take a look
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.640
Google logo appears ok let's take a look
at the code it's very simple use the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
at the code it's very simple use the
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.130
at the code it's very simple use the
Google map set padding method to add

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
Google map set padding method to add
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410
Google map set padding method to add
padding around the edges of the map the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
padding around the edges of the map the
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.210
padding around the edges of the map the
method takes four parameters to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
method takes four parameters to
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.100
method takes four parameters to
determine the padding on the left top

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110
determine the padding on the left top
 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.350
determine the padding on the left top
right and bottom edges and the parameter

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
right and bottom edges and the parameter
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.510
right and bottom edges and the parameter
names are easy to remember left top

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
names are easy to remember left top
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.210
names are easy to remember left top
right and bottom camera updates such as

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
right and bottom camera updates such as
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.640
right and bottom camera updates such as
resetting the map will automatically

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650
resetting the map will automatically
 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.560
resetting the map will automatically
take care of the padding so you don't

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570
take care of the padding so you don't
 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690
take care of the padding so you don't
need to calculate the offset yourself

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
need to calculate the offset yourself
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090
need to calculate the offset yourself
and you can dynamically change map

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
and you can dynamically change map
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.250
and you can dynamically change map
padding at any time the details are in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
padding at any time the details are in
 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.010
padding at any time the details are in
the documentation also take a look at

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
the documentation also take a look at
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.020
the documentation also take a look at
the Google Maps API demo app that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030
the Google Maps API demo app that
 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.400
the Google Maps API demo app that
shipped with the Google Play services

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
shipped with the Google Play services
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.800
shipped with the Google Play services
here's a link to the documentation about

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810
here's a link to the documentation about
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.990
here's a link to the documentation about
the demo app it has a more complex

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
the demo app it has a more complex
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330
the demo app it has a more complex
example than the one I've shown you for

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340
example than the one I've shown you for
 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.410

animation to slide your sidebar in and
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.699
animation to slide your sidebar in and
out the padding demo is called visible

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
out the padding demo is called visible
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.820
out the padding demo is called visible
regions in the demo app menu thank you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830
