00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:54.959
While of course 
how long one could survive without food and

00:00:54.959 --> 00:01:00.679
water varies dramatically based on exact scenario,
on the more pressing issue of water, it would

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.390
appear that if someone stopped consuming this
life sustaining liquid at all (including not

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.020
getting any from food), their death would
generally occur within a maximum of about

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.069
14 days.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.350
This grim figure has been gleaned from data
collected from the notes of terminally ill

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.270
or end of life patients in hospitals who forgo
artificial sustenance and their bodies are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.990
slowly allowed to die.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530
In many of these cases, the individual is
either bedridden or in a coma, meaning their

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.149
caloric and water needs are potentially minimized,
so this seems a good rough upper limit.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.240
Unfortunately for our thoroughly average 5
ft. 9 inch, 195.5 pound everyman named Jeff,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.090
who is about to find himself in rather dire
straits, death for him is likely to occur

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.439
much faster.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.310
Beyond the fact that he’s likely to be more
active than a person in a coma, these figures

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.029
don’t necessarily immediately apply to him
because of something known as adaptive thermogenesis.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:03.060
Adaptive thermogenesis is the term used to
describe a unique quirk of physiology, which

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.640
is often colloquially referred to as “starvation
mode”.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.790
In a massively overly simplistic nutshell
sure to trigger more than one medical professional

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.441
out there, when the body is put on a restrictive
diet for a significant length of time, it

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:23.510
adapts to function less optimally, but at
least still function, lowering the sustenance

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.599
requirements it needs in a variety of fascinating
ways that would take an entire video of its

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.599
own to cover.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.099
Since terminally ill people and people in
comas are typically already in this state

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.859
when their sustenance is completely cut off,
their bodies will, in some cases at least,

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.680
likely survive longer than poor Jeff who,
if he was randomly cut off from sustenance

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.950
without warning in a survival situation would
probably not make it more than about 3-4 days.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.510
Of course, Jeff could last longer if he ate
something because many foods contain quite

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.690
a lot of water, his most pressing need.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.890
While body parts are among those food items
that are jam-packed with H20, that liquid

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.790
was already in Jeff anyway.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.849
So there is going to be no benefit to consuming
his own body part in this situation, unless

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.469
of course the limb just happened to have gotten
lopped off outside of his control and he wants

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.609
to recoup what he can from the lost appendage.

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.230
But let’s say that Jeff has an unlimited
supply of water.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.019
Now he just needs some food, which the human
body is literally made up of.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.140
Thus, Jeff targets those sweet, sweet calories
within himself.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.270
How many calories?

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.299
Figures on this can vary wildly based on the
individual in question as you might expect,

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.740
but for a ballpark average for such an everyman
as Jeff, he probably has about 80,000 calories

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.060
in him, at least, according to figures compiled
by one Dr. James Cole at the University of

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.780
Brighton.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:03.400
As for the legs, again with the caveat that
this can vary wildly based on a specific individual,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.900
for a ballpark average, each leg contains
around 7,000-8,000 calories (enough to sustain

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.610
Jeff comfortably for around three and a half
days).

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.120
If Jeff got really desperate he could cut
off one of his arms which would net him an

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.740
additional 2,000 or so calories.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.700
Another day of comfortable eating.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.550
Since he needs that other arm to perform surgeries,
cook, eat, etc., let’s say Jeff, who is

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.840
also now an expert surgeon, also removes a
lung, a kidney, 70% of his liver, his gallbladder,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.570
his appendix, spleen and his testicles (all
things that can removed from the body without

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.060
killing you if done properly).

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.752
We stopped just short of calculating the caloric
value of a human penis because, come on, we

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:49.469
have to leave Jeff something to do the rest
of the day while he awaits rescue.

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.400
Based on available figures from the aforementioned
British professor and, where needed, supplementing

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.349
his calorie content numbers with animals with
comparable organs to our own, this would all

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.270
provide roughly 3,000 or so calories, give
or take.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.250
Finally, if Jeff took the bones from his severed
limbs and boiled them in water, he could create

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.060
something akin to bone broth, which contains
about 130 calories per litre.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.320
It turns out that you can make about a gallon
of bone broth with around 7 pounds of bones.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.670
Your skeleton makes up about 15% of your total
body weight and your legs and a single arm

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.800
constitute just shy of 40% of your total weight.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.909
Taking Jeff’s weight which we’ve already
established as being 195.5 pounds, Jeff’s

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.070
legs and arm would provide around 12 pounds
of bone, or enough to make a gallon and a

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.250
half of bone broth.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.500
This amounts to in the ballpark of 900 calories.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.610
Being resourceful, Jeff isn’t going to stop
at limbs, organs, and bone, though.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.770
After all, a byproduct of eating produces
another food source- feces.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.979
Unfortunately, there’s no study that has
been done that we could find telling us definitively

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.130
the calorific content of human poop.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.410
That said, from limited studies we did find
on human poop’s nutritional makeup, and

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.950
from many more done on mice feces, it would
appear on average feces contains about 10%

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.820
of the calories eaten previously, with the
caveat that this does vary based on a variety

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.280
of factors- work with us here people.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.969
If you want a better number for the calories
in human feces when that human is eating human

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.700
legs, arms, and organs, you feel free to Google
to your heart’s content.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.370
We’re already a little uncomfortable with
how our search history looks after this one.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.740
In any event, if Jeff consumed in the ballpark
of the 2000-2500 calories per day to maintain

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.960
his original physique before he found himself
in his little predicament, his poop may contain

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.409
as many as 250 calories.

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.019
Contrary to popular belief, his poop would
also be reasonably safe to eat provided he

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:42.860
kept it fairly sanitary after squeezing it
out- the five second rule isn’t really a

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.860
thing.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.060
A dropped turd is most definitely going to
pick up some icky things from the floor.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.839
So, doing the math, if Jeff literally cut
off or removed every extraneous part of his

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:55.519
body save for a single arm, then ate his excrement,
he could conceivably find himself with a total

00:06:55.519 --> 00:07:01.539
of around 20,000-22,000 or so calories, or
around 10 days of comfortable sustenance.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.610
And, hey, with the loss of each extra body
part, there’s fewer calories needed to support

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.339
the remaining, meaning Jeff’s going to be
able to stretch things out even further in

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:14.469
this little fantasy land we’ve created.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.990
Of course, in a real life scenario, slicing
yourself up would by definition do severe

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.930
damage to your body, expose yourself to infection,
result in a loss of blood and hence reduce

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.460
your hydration level, and just generally place
a lot more demands on your body to keep on

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.890
keeping on- when traumatically injured, your
nutritional needs actually go up.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.029
And, in the end, your body already had you
covered.

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.150
You see, it turns out beyond attempting to
get more efficient about caloric usage naturally

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.900
if you stop giving the body enough to function
optimally, the human body is also amazingly

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.969
efficient at using stored sustenance in your
various bits, particularly fat, muscle, and,

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.470
to a lesser extent, bone.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.579
Sure, at the end of it, Jeff’s body fat
percentage might be on the lean side and his

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:01.960
lifts on the bench press may be vastly reduced
from their former no doubt beast-mode levels.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.940
But he’ll be alive and whole anyway.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.980
Thus, as with so many of life’s problems,
the solution was inside himself all along…

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.370
including the feces and urine which could
potentially give a very slight benefit the

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.720
first time if he wanted to muscle them down.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.519
So to sum up the answer to the question posed
by our new favorite reader, while certainly

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.780
your body contains a lot of useful calories
should you consume them directly, it turns

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.589
out it’s already really good at more or
less eating itself without you needing to

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:32.919
cut anything off.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.860
That said, should you be stranded with a pleasantly
plump companion in such a survival scenario,
