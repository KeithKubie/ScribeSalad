00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.290
Let's say the user presses the Home
button on the remote control

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.100
while playing back media.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.330
On the left, we see something called
a Now Playing card and is useful for

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.440
keeping media playing in the background
while the user navigates elsewhere

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.410
on their TV.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.230
Notice that the Now Playing
card appears front and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.440
center right here in
the recommendations row.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.340
And if the user would like to
jump back into their content,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.219
they can simply select it.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.150
For the Now Playing card to work,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.730
you must use a MediaSession
to play your media.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.580
We've already seen how the MediaSession
worked earlier in the Android Auto

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.000
section of the class.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.590
Here I am inside the Playback Activity
section of our sample.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.650
The Now Playing card will appear
automatically as soon as you set

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.630
the MediaSession to active.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.410
So this is a feature you get nearly for
free.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.580
There's just one thing you have to do,
and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.394
that's to keep the Metadata of the
currently playing media item current.

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:49.170
You can see how this is done
inside the updateMetadata method.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.120
Once this is done, the contents
of the Now Playing card will be

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.930
updated automatically
using this information.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.550
So remember to call this method
whenever a new media item is played.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.050
And here's a quick tip.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.500
Remember to release the MediaSession
object when playback stops.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.290
And that's it.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.380
You can see a couple of more
details in the instructor notes.
