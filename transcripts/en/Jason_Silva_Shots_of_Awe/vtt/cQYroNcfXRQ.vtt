[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.585
So there's a great essay called
"The Genomic Bodhisattva,"

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:24.550
and it chronicles the work of
philosopher David Pearce, whose

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.270
"hedonistic" imperative
is the treaties that

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.095
calls for the abolition
of human suffering using

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:32.464
a cocktail of new
nanotechnologies

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:36.510
and psychopharmacologies to
reverse-engineer subjectivity,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
hack perception to create
gradients of bliss,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.070
ecstatic transcendent
mind spaces

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.260
of imagination
unbounded that would

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.340
make our day-to-day
existence seem trivial,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.580
prehistoric by comparison.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.210
These new modalities and these
new languages of experience

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.890
will be accompanied by states of
cognitive ecstasy, exhilarating

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.760
neuro-storms of intense
intellectual pleasure.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.660
Every moment will
be autopoietic.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.540
It'll be like creating God.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.770
And it just sounds so
freaking exhilarating.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.370
And this notion that
human beings seem to have,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.314
this attachment to
suffering, this belief

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:19.230
that it adds character
and so on and so forth.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.660
I get it, but I don't know.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.390
There's something kind of
alluring to think that we might

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.360
be able to create possibilities
for ourselves, dimensions

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.485
in which this thing of
suffering no longer exists.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.820
Just a thought.
