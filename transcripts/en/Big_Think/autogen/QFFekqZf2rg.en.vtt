a leader and you know I think there's
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.500
a leader and you know I think there's
every reason to think that the talent

green energy that they have to solve
these problems and that's going to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380
these problems and that's going to
 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.960
these problems and that's going to
actually make them very very another two

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970
actually make them very very another two
 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.620
actually make them very very another two
over the next few years

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630
 
 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.730
 
I think the US has a schizophrenic view

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740
I think the US has a schizophrenic view
 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.800
I think the US has a schizophrenic view
to the growth that's happening in

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810
to the growth that's happening in
 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.420
to the growth that's happening in
developing countries like India and

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430
developing countries like India and

China India and China both taking jobs
 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.190
China India and China both taking jobs
from America in a way and so that seems

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200
from America in a way and so that seems
 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.370
from America in a way and so that seems
very threatening on the other hand there

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380
very threatening on the other hand there
 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.320
very threatening on the other hand there
is an awareness that actually China and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330
is an awareness that actually China and
 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.970
is an awareness that actually China and
it particularly is providing a lot of

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980
it particularly is providing a lot of
 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.980
it particularly is providing a lot of
the money that America is using to to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990
the money that America is using to to
 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.330
the money that America is using to to
spend and enjoy a high quality of life

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340
spend and enjoy a high quality of life
 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.920

so a lot of Treasury bonds of walk by

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930
so a lot of Treasury bonds of walk by
 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.110
so a lot of Treasury bonds of walk by
the Chinese and there is an underlying

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120
the Chinese and there is an underlying
 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.240
the Chinese and there is an underlying
recognition that when countries like

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
recognition that when countries like
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.180
recognition that when countries like
India and China come out of poverty the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
India and China come out of poverty the
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.710
India and China come out of poverty the
world as a whole gets wealthier which

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720
world as a whole gets wealthier which
 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.270
world as a whole gets wealthier which
means we all win it's a win-win

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280
means we all win it's a win-win
 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.330
means we all win it's a win-win
situation and so the next five years are

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340
situation and so the next five years are
 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.010
situation and so the next five years are
going to be about adjusting to a world

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020
going to be about adjusting to a world
 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.950
going to be about adjusting to a world
where America is not the dominant

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960
where America is not the dominant
 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.090
where America is not the dominant
economy anymore but it's still a very

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100
economy anymore but it's still a very
 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.970
economy anymore but it's still a very
important economy and it has to find a

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980
important economy and it has to find a
 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.070
important economy and it has to find a
more satisfactory relationship with

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080
more satisfactory relationship with
 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.900
more satisfactory relationship with
these emerging economies and that's

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910
these emerging economies and that's
 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.300
these emerging economies and that's
going to mean a bit of giving a bit of

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
going to mean a bit of giving a bit of
 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.090
going to mean a bit of giving a bit of
take and on both sides but I think there

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100
take and on both sides but I think there
 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.030
take and on both sides but I think there
will be ultimately a better relationship

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040
will be ultimately a better relationship
 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.320
will be ultimately a better relationship
between America and China and India

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
between America and China and India
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.060
between America and China and India
because it will become a more equal

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
because it will become a more equal
 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.170
because it will become a more equal
relationship and I think gradually the

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180
relationship and I think gradually the
 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.270
relationship and I think gradually the
public will understand in America that

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280
public will understand in America that
 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.430
public will understand in America that

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440
is not a threat fundamentally the
 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.950
is not a threat fundamentally the

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.180
America if it sorts out his own domestic
issues which are largely about

issues which are largely about
 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.950
issues which are largely about
retraining the labor force so that

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960
retraining the labor force so that
 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.590
retraining the labor force so that
people can do jobs that aren't done more

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600
people can do jobs that aren't done more
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.860
people can do jobs that aren't done more

go before it's a good as it could be

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630
go before it's a good as it could be
 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.290
go before it's a good as it could be
china there's a lot of brainpower a lot

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300
china there's a lot of brainpower a lot
 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.379
china there's a lot of brainpower a lot
of engineers there and this is still a

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389
of engineers there and this is still a
 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.080
of engineers there and this is still a
period of humanity of human history

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090
period of humanity of human history
 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.659
period of humanity of human history
where there's a great deal of potential

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669
where there's a great deal of potential
 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.810
where there's a great deal of potential
for innovation and so I think there are

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820
for innovation and so I think there are
 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.939
for innovation and so I think there are
great opportunities there the issue is

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949
great opportunities there the issue is
 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:29.029
great opportunities there the issue is
that labor markets are becoming globally

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039
that labor markets are becoming globally
 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.529
that labor markets are becoming globally
integrative which means that the price

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539
integrative which means that the price
 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.840
integrative which means that the price
of Chinese labor and of Indian labor is

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850
of Chinese labor and of Indian labor is
 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.140
of Chinese labor and of Indian labor is
increasingly moving up to global levels

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150
increasingly moving up to global levels
 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.540
increasingly moving up to global levels
and therefore if if they if they unless

relative to what you could do in America

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.630
relative to what you could do in America
 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.719
relative to what you could do in America
is not going to be just simply a matter

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729
is not going to be just simply a matter
 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:49.510
is not going to be just simply a matter
of cost-cutting it's gonna be about

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520
of cost-cutting it's gonna be about
 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.589
of cost-cutting it's gonna be about
figuring out a way that they do things

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599
figuring out a way that they do things
 

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.990
