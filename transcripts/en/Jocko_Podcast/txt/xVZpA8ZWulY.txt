Speaker 1:          00:00          Do you consider shooting a martial art and how has your firearms training been like or unlike martial arts training? Well, shooting is absolutely a martial art. Yeah. I mean maybe not the way people pictures of martial arts nowadays be. Oh, because when you picture a martial art people picture, you know a guy with a Guiana. Yeah, doing karate. That's, that's right. That's the generic picture. To me that's not, that's not martial arts. Actually to me martial arts is the art of war. The Art of the individual warrior skills that it takes. And firearms are absolutely a martial art because it's something that you train. It's something that you get good at. It's something that you need to maintain your skill at. And it is absolutely a martial art. And to me

Speaker 1:          00:59          it's another piece of the puzzle. It's another thing that you should, you need to know how to do. And just like tactics that go along with shooting are an important part of being a warrior. You need know how to shoot in. The training is very similar in my mind to martial arts training in that it takes, you know, repetition. You have to know what the basics are and you have to repeat those basics and then you get more advanced and it's, it's about movement and getting efficient with your movement. And then you want to train it very similar to the way that you train mixed martial arts or martial arts in general. And that is, you know, you're going to have different frat levels and how you get to deal with them and you want to deal with your weak side, you know, you can, you shoot with your off hand in various environments in the low light, in the dark, in the rain, in the, you want to mix it up.

Speaker 1:          02:00          So you're used to all of it. You want to be used to people at close range, you want to be used to people at a further range. And then once you get all those mechanical skills down, then you want to train your mind around this thing. You want to train your mind around this skill so that your mind knows how to utilize this skill when things are unexpected and when there's chaos and when there's mayhem going on. And that's, that's one of the things that I really like about simunition training or paint ball training or laser tag training is it allows you, it allows you to have somebody else shoot back at you, which is just like, you know, just like rolling in Jujitsu or sparring more Thai or sparring MMA is you have to react to the person. It's no longer just a Kata, right? It's no longer just shooting paper targets that don't shoot back and don't move.

Speaker 1:          03:03          So you, so I love to take it. Once you've got the skills down and then you learn, you've got the fundamentals down, then you take the advanced fundamentals and then you begin to train to simulate combat. And this is oc tell Ya, I had these, um, I got these laser tag guns for my son and I just got two of them at first. But that escalated very quickly because they were awesome. There are these little nerf laser tag guns and you could shoot each other at, I dunno, maybe a hundred meters, which is a pretty good shot, is like a pistol. And so when I got these, and as soon as I got two of them and I realized how good they were, I bought two more so I could go against my son and his friends and they could go against each other. And I taught my son like all the basic military maneuvers that he would need to know.

Speaker 1:          03:59          And this is when he was maybe eight years old and he would play this game all the time, you know, in. So I taught him out of covering move, I taught them how to get elevated positions. I taught him how to do individual movement techniques where you don't show your face at the same spot, like twice in a row. Every time you get up you move a little bit. And he, he realized that that's how you win in these little games and they're real. Those are the real tactics. And so I had a speaking, speaking of speaking of the Marine Corps, I had a friend that, uh, was, was came over to the house one time and he was, you know, a marine and we got in the conversation and all of a sudden, you know, my son comes out with the laser tag guns and my son's like, oh, you know, do you want to go?

Speaker 1:          04:55          And the guy's like, you know, yeah, of course, let's do it. So my son looks at him and says, indoor, outdoor. And you all of a sudden you could see there was something going on and the guy goes outdoor, outdoor. So my son that you press the button on the thing and it counts down for 10 seconds and then it's on. So, so you go find cover or something like that. So yeah, so 10 seconds, my son hits the thing, my son takes off out the door. So I'm watching the guy to guy, this guy is doomed because you know, you're going against the training.

Speaker 1:          05:29          So the guy comes out and, and it's dark, right? But the guy comes out of the door and I'm watching him and he's kind of crouched a little bit and all of a sudden his gun, because it all is in this one system, it's all takes place inside the gun. You don't wear a helmet, you don't wear anything. You actually are shooting the other person's gun. Oh. And when it shot, when you, when he gets shot, he goes, existed does and shakes and a red light flashes. So he walks out and sure enough, my son had run around the block at an elevated position and as soon as he came walking out, my son sort of drilling him and the guy's like, he freezes. It's interesting that he freezes. He doesn't even think to myself, oh, I'll take cover. No, he just froze and got drilled and then as soon as it's easy standing there, he's kind of looking around, looking around, looking around.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Finally he sees my son, he starts to point the weapon up towards my son. My son just disappears. And then the guys, the guy starts kind of walking over in that direction. And then 15 seconds later, my son pops up on his flank and drills them again from behind another fence in a hole in the wall. And anyways, he ends up killing them. And then the guys, okay, let's go again. And my son beat him like three times in a row. And it's because he had the basic, the basic skills, basic infantry men skills is what it was, you know, he would shoot and then move. And that's what it boils down to. So that kind of thing is, is very important in as far as being a martial art. And you should train, you know, that's another thing, you know, I said this to Sam Harris when I was on his podcast, you know?

Speaker 1:          07:05          Yeah. Maybe there's no chance because you live in, uh, in the bubble and you live in a great neighborhood and you're well protected. You have alarm system in your house and all that. And maybe you're never gonna have a problem. And that's great. I mean, there's always a chance. I would never believe that. You're never gonna have a problem, but there's always a chance that somebody is going to crunch, that's evil's going to enter your world and you want to be ready for that. Now, if that makes me sound paranoid, okay, let's just say you're not paranoid and you don't think it's ever going to happen, but it is still highly valuable to train in these situations because they make you a better person. They make you sharper, they make you smarter, they make you more prepared. If something does happen, it's just good to know this stuff and it makes you a better person, more reliable.

Speaker 1:          07:57          It's a real skill set. You know, I always was kind of bummed out about basketball or football or baseball because those are the, there. There are life skills involved in Amman. I don't wanna say that, but the skill itself of throwing a baseball, of shooting a basketball, of throwing a football is not as valuable as a skill as number one. A martial artist, you know, moy, Thai boxing, wrestling, Jujitsu, because those are real applicable, applicable to life. 100% and this is the same thing with shooting a gun. I mean, that is a real applicable skill that you may need at some point in your life, and you should have it, you know?
