00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.300
Hey, what's up guys today? I'm here with Ty from the Moto Loco Workshop

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.509
He came down from Arizona, and he brought me a special gift. What did you bring?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.840
I brought some Arizona bark scorpion these little scorpions are really tiny but the venom that they inject when they sting you is so

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.690
Powerful that it will cause severe pain [and] adults for up to three days people who have been stung relate the experience

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.299
To an electrical jolt most people in Arizona get stung at least once in their lifetime [with] this one

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.400
I [heard] probably one of the most poisonous ones in America

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.179
[man] over to my friend's house caught about a jar full of them and brought him over

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.110
He's got them on ice and why is that?

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.889
[oh] like kind of hibernate during the [wintertime], and I've seen him come back alive after three months in the freezer

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
[I] don't know man these guys look pretty knocked out you think we can get [them] to come back to life

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.789
[I] hope so there is like no movement whatsoever

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.339
[still] pretty cold for now [all] right so check this out guys. We got one of these scorpions out on a plate and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.879
Hopefully, it doesn't spring back to life on us while we're working with them, but ty's got a UV flashlight here

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.279
And you can see if you shine the flashlight onto the scorpion you can see he just starts to glow that is so cool

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.018
And apparently all scorpions [or] [at] least most of them will have [some] kind of a fluorescent

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.450
characteristic about them enough to creepy

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.589
Oh will creep me out is he be just like jumped up on your face right now you creep

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
Yeah, all right there. We go. I'm just [gonna] shove this guy into my hand hopefully he doesn't

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.479
Spring to life as I do oh

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.290
That is insane. I feel like I'm seeing his leg moving. [I] don't know if that's just like a response from my hand or what?

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.629
If I tried to flick them off he could really grab on hard good knee yeah. They've got some pretty good pinchers

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.040
they can hold on to the wall pretty good they walk across the ceiling to a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.080
Okay, I'm getting a little bit freaked out. [I] swear. I saw his leg moving

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.350
We're gonna add the rest of the family

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.280
Actually looks really cool

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.360
So there's a cool random fact guys scorpions glow under Uv light so if you live in a really hot desert a area

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.129
Where you have scorpion problems, just grab one of these flashlights. Take it out on your [back] [yard] at night and light them up

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.320
[oh], dude. That looks so sweet

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.550
They'll start glowing when you expose them to [blacklight] or even natural moonlight

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.699
And the blue-green glow comes from a substance found in the highland layer

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.729
Which is a very thin but super tough coating in a part of the scorpions

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.449
exoskeleton called the cuticle nobody really knows why scorpions

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.959
Glow the way they do, but because they do it makes it really easy for us to find them

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.249
Go out at night when they're really really active and just shine and round and they'll light up and stand out like a sore thumb

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.640
Yeah

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.429
If you leave any boots outside or really in the garage or anywhere where?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.470
Scorpions can be you want to shake out your pants. Shake out your boots shake out anything you don't want to get stung in

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.100
Apparently these things will crawl into like really tight crevices a sixteenth of an inch is all and you'll see the cracks in your walls

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.279
The cracks in your doors if they want to be in your house. They will be

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.239
They've got some weird little beady eyes on top of your head. You've got some black marks, and maybe some other eyes on the front

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.040
It's crazy. I want to light hits them. They [just] they really do glow. It's awesome

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.759
Oh, it's kind of scary when you go out there, and they [just] start running across the fence

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.360
Oh, yeah

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.749
I can imagine if these things were moving if they were a liar they'll be quite the show

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.299
They don't seem to notice you unless you move something around [them] so you can get right up on them get a stick a half

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.899
Inch away from them and then just get them and that is because scorpions have very bad eyesight and so inside your house

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.450
They'll tend to crawl on the walls if you want to catch them in your house

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.850
you can put some of those little glue traps down by the walls and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.139
Better chance of catching their guys our scorpions are officially dead. They are not moving

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.419
They're not coming back to life so we thought it'd be fun to maybe try one more experiment and put these things in a vacuum

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.420
Chamber just to see what would happen to them this guy over here

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.680
Just made a vacuum chamber this thing right here, and you can see how to make this on his channel

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.150
[it's] not going to hurt him at all right?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.150
They're already dead, but already dead [so] [let's] [flip] and switch fire this thing up and see what happens [to] scorpion in the vacuum chamber

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.880
You can see their abdomens are treating but not enough to make them burst

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.440
And it kind of makes them a little more creepy all right go ahead and release the pressure

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
Hey

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.499
That right there is a stuff nightmares are made you know we should do is take some these to that glowing dark laser tag

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.090
Put them on the wall instead of laser tag arena. He doesn't look much [worse] for wear

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.239
I mean other than the fact that he's dead, but how crazy is that?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.459
Looking at the Carpet can't really see anything shine a black light on it boom

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.559
If you find one of those in your house it really stands out doesn't it as long as you have a black light?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.889
Have you ever met anybody they got [stunned] by one of these Mm-hmm?

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.260
People 70 a girl neighbor told me that his whole leg was numb for a few days

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.459
Had people that told me [that] they got stung in the toe and I couldn't feel any other toes for

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.510
[yesterday]

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.819
My sister-in-law got stolen, and she had to go get an anti-venom shot. Oh really

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.920
It was interesting as I move this lighter, and it almost seems like it's got a fluorescent paint on it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.679
I mean it almost doesn't look like it's part of the scorpion at all

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.340
It looks like it's just painted on very peculiar the sides don't glow

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.859
That's kind of why it looks like it's painted on it

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.760
Looks like it's got airbrushed on the top and [bottom] so let's take a look at that flashlight

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.959
[tell] me a little about your flashlight where it is this flashlight [was] probably only about $20

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.690
And it's got a hundred leds in it down in Arizona

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.459
You can pick these up at gas stations an ace hardware really anywhere the bigger ones

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.220
They're a little more costly, but these are the ones to get you'll you'll see a scorpion for 20 30 feet away

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.119
All right cool guys the fun little experiment we learn something new scorpions under black light will fluoresce not really glow in the dark

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.840
Scorpions

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.790
But fluorescent scorpions get yourself Uv light you can go out there. You can find them all kill em

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.319
All you can protect your family your friends your neighbors. It's almost like Magic

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.499
So big thanks to my cousin ty for making the trip out here from Arizona

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.079
Is the [Mana] [local] workshop? He does all kinds of cool stuff?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.909
what would do you want to see how this vacuum chamber works and how to assemble one yourself you go check that out on a

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.179
His channel the link in the description below [okay]. Thanks for joining us for this video guys

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.609
Hope you learn something you'll see the next one. Talk to you then right?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.749
Scorpion woman's wait

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200
you
