We all want to be normal but our picture
of what is normal is in fact really

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.849
unhelpful. So many of the things were
told that are weird are in fact

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.369
completely average and widespread. For
example, if you fear you married the wrong

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.680
person; get sick with envy when a friend
succeeds; fantasize about your wife's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.699
sister; want to cry when anyone
criticizes you; dislike the way you look;

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.430
panic at the thought of going to a party;
worry a great deal about farting in public

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.670
feel you might vomit during a meeting
out of fear have ever had a lustful

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.950
thought about a member of your own
family

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.809
bump your head while trying to get into
a taxi are turned on by some pretty

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.420
strange people are stories in the news

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.840
frequently visit adult websites regard
yourself as a fraud worry about not

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.670
making it to the bathroom in time

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.580
walk into doors lamppost, rearview
mirrors, callers or that other people can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.689
see your private parts; still think about
a relationship that ended badly

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.199
eleven years ago

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.700
Then you can quietly congratulate
yourself you are deeply normal

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.420
We suffer so much and so unnecessarily because our
picture of what is normal isn't true to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.640
how most of us actually are

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.920
We get
disgusted and ashamed of ourselves for

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.520
no reason

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.439
There's nothing strange about
being compulsive, manic, anxious, sexual or

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.280
even more mad

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280
Being odd is normal

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
and that's ok

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.480
It has become hard to say anything; especially on
social media that won't upset someone

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.670
