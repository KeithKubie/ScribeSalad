shot the whole film there it would have
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.249
shot the whole film there it would have
been much simpler but we wouldn't have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
been much simpler but we wouldn't have
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780
been much simpler but we wouldn't have
been able to take out the walls of the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

complete control of the lighting for the
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.370
complete control of the lighting for the
different times of day and we wouldn't

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
different times of day and we wouldn't
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.539
different times of day and we wouldn't
have been able to pick out all of the

gonna go ahead and say I think having a
set was worth it and then we filmed the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
set was worth it and then we filmed the
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749
set was worth it and then we filmed the
movie and that was hard I was trying to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

editing work went into fine-tuning the
cut and also doing all of the visual

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040
cut and also doing all of the visual
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.500

effects in fact I think there might

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510
effects in fact I think there might
 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.930
effects in fact I think there might
actually be more visual effects in this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940
actually be more visual effects in this
 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.030
