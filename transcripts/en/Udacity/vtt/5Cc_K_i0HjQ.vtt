There's several types of mutations we can learn about in this

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.450
lesson. And instead of me just telling you what they are. I'd

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.180
rather show you and see how good you are on picking up

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.120
on exactly what they are. Let's just take this normal human sequence

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530
that I picked randomly from the human genome. Let's make some

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.880
changes to this original sequence. And I want to see if you can

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.060
match the change that you see over here in the individual sequence

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.970
with the type of mutation that we're going to cover in this lesson.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.470
I've numbered the types one through five. When you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.060
think you've matched up the right mutation to the right

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.240
sequence here just go ahead and put that number

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.680
in the box over here. See how you can do.
