[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:06.700
DANA VETTER: So you'll
go on the far side.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.890
Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.970
Can you hear me?

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.420
Hi.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.275
BRAD PAISLEY: Hi.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:13.760
DANA VETTER: What a
warm introduction.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.610
My name is Dana Vetter.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.080
I work on music programs
on YouTube.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.150
And I am thrilled to be joined
by Brad Paisley.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.050
BRAD PAISLEY: Hi.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.020
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.020
DANA VETTER: Not much
introduction needed--

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.780
I think we have a lot of fans
in the audience-- but

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.860
acclaimed singer, songwriter,
guitarist, musician,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.090
critically acclaimed,
awards, et cetera.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.990
So thank you so much for
joining us at Google.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.930
BRAD PAISLEY: Is that
where we're at?

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.520
DANA VETTER: We are at
the Googleplex here.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.240
So let's just get started.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.330
So I know you just got
off the plane.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.260
Let's just dive right in.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.420
You're about halfway
through your tour.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.100
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.800
DANA VETTER: About--

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.030
BRAD PAISLEY: It seems
like it, yeah.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.990
DANA VETTER: I think, yep.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.210
And so you're here
in California.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.090
We're thrilled to have you here

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.785
performing locally tonight.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:55.940
But I want to actually
talk about somebody

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.070
else's tour for a second.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.140
A couple weeks ago, you joined
The Rolling Stones on stage--

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.930
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.320
DANA VETTER: --in
Philadelphia.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.910
BRAD PAISLEY: They
need more press.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.810
Let's do that.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.950
DANA VETTER: Well, I just want
to know, how did that happen?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.180
Like, did they call you?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.380
Like, what is that
moment like?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.180
BRAD PAISLEY: They're
desperate.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.330
DANA VETTER: They're desperate,
[LAUGHING].

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550
BRAD PAISLEY: They're
trying really hard

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.030
to matter in music.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.620
And that's been what their
whole tour is about.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.540
They have had a lot of people
do that in various cities.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.690
They're the consummate
sort of jam band.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.000
I mean, they really are all
about getting up there and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.920
playing music and bringing it.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.970
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.110
BRAD PAISLEY: And then, on top
of that, what's it sound like

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.830
to collaborate?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.480
What's it like to bring in
other formats of music?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.950
And throughout the tour, it
sort of ran the gamut of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.870
people that sat in.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.890
And we had a few
country people.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.800
We had a lot of rock and
rollers, a lot of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.230
blues guys, you know.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.530
And you're seeing their
influences,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.420
which is kind of cool.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.910
And then--

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.440
I'm not one other influences--
but I am influenced by some of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.580
the same people they
are, you know.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.550
They actually have a very
heavy country base--

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.450
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.260
BRAD PAISLEY: --you know.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.310
They were a great country band
when they wanted to be, on

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.010
certain songs.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.940
And there's this common
language with us.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.600
I've gotten to know Ronnie
Wood pretty well.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.180
I'm starting to get to
Mick pretty well.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.800
And it's like you realize that
guitar is sort of the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.860
universal--

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.970
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.990
BRAD PAISLEY: --language
of music.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.465
Especially the guitar players
have this really sort of

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:25.560
foreign thing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.690
My wife, as an actress,
is envious.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.523
Because she's seen me jump in
with everybody from The

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:35.530
Rolling Stones to BB King, to
you know, like Keb' Mo' is a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.070
friend of ours.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.390
And I'll just get up
in the middle of a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.950
blues night with him.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.740
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.460
BRAD PAISLEY: She's like, it's
like you speak French.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.530
DANA VETTER: Right, right,
right, right.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.830
BRAD PAISLEY: It's like
this foreign language.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.250
And you guys start, and then
we get backstage, and it's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.070
like, what pedal is that
that you're using?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.990
Well, that's brand new.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.630
It's this new analog delay,
and it's wonderful.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.155
And the next thing you know,
you're off in this--

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:54.210
DANA VETTER: Right,
another language.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.180
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah, this French
competition that she

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.652
doesn't understand.

00:02:57.652 --> 00:02:59.780
DANA VETTER: Well, it's
interesting, because you're

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.930
one of these amazing country
artists who's a great

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.120
singer/songwriter.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910
But like you said, you're
a killer guitar lead.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.960
BRAD PAISLEY: I didn't
say that.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.256
DANA VETTER: Well, I'm
going to say that.

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:09.230
I'm going to say that.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.980
BRAD PAISLEY: But
like you said--

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.350
DANA VETTER: Well,
right, right.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.240
So this--

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.250
BRAD PAISLEY: This is like,
between two ferns up here.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.660
DANA VETTER: It is.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.720
Between two screens here, so--

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.650
nap pods--

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.930
that's like, we have nap pods at
Google, which is a place--

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.490
BRAD PAISLEY: Nap pods?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.380
DANA VETTER: Nap pods.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.570
BRAD PAISLEY: We have
those on a bus.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.190
Those are called bunks.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:28.120
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.480
And so we were actually joking
about between two ferns and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.365
saying we should start one
that's between two nap pods.

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:33.110
It's where you go and
kind of take a rest.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.354
BRAD PAISLEY: All right.

00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:33.960
Bring 'em on.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.320
DANA VETTER: Anyway, we
can give you a tour of

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.170
the nap pods next.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.090
And I know that some of the
Grammys that you've won are

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.620
for some of the instrumental
stuff.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.700
So how do you balance, kind of,
that, you know, the guitar

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.170
interest and then also, you
know, your talents in singing

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.470
and songwriting?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.140
BRAD PAISLEY: My sound man
always accuses me of singing

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.020
to get to the next solo.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.770
Because truthfully, when you've
sung a song a million

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.910
times, like whether that be
"Celebrity" or "Alcohol" or

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.890
one of these songs that go back
a few years, you know,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.850
there are only so many ways
you can sing the verse--

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.680
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.710
BRAD PAISLEY: --before people
leave and think

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.670
you've lost your mind.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.440
He's changing the
melody too much.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.250
But, and here comes the solos.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.220
DANA VETTER: Uh, huh.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.260
BRAD PAISLEY: And for me, it's
like, I could add a little.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.660
I could go into a pentatonic
thing here and really make

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.000
that kind of cool.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.440
O

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.430
DANA VETTER: So that's
how you keep it--

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.280
BRAD PAISLEY: That's
really the gist.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.500
Yeah, and at our heart, my band
and I are a bit of a jam

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.280
band, in spite of the technology
that we use and the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.140
video we've got to sync up with
and the way that you've

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.510
got to keep the hits
also recognizable.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.220
DANA VETTER: Sure.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.780
BRAD PAISLEY: There's always
those moments in the show when

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.460
you can have free expression.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.250
And I think that's what
will keep me going.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.760
You know, remaining nameless,
there was a country artist

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.250
who's a big hero of
mine that I had a

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.420
conversation with once.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.210
And it was early in my career.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.750
And I said, are you playing
many shows this year?

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.260
And he said, yeah, I'm
doing, you know, I

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.570
don't know, 40 or 50.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.390
And he said, what about you?

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.600
I said, I'm doing 200.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.880
Of course, when you're
new, you do.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.570
You'll play 200 dates a year
just because you need to.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.245
DANA VETTER: You need to.

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:15.500
BRAD PAISLEY: And people
need to see you play.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.470
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.030
BRAD PAISLEY: And he said, oh,
golly, how do you do that?

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.490
And I said, well, you
know, I love it.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.180
And he said, give it time.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.590
BRAD PAISLEY: And he's right
about one thing.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.050
There's parts of it
that get old.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.390
But one thing that never gets
old to me is that I'm there

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.120
for sound check.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.140
I mean, I can't wait to play--

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.800
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.930
BRAD PAISLEY: --and jam and
see how my amps sound that

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.540
day, because every day is
different, and make my guitar

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.060
tech go nuts, because I've
got a new pedal I

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.995
want to try on a song.

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:51.700
And here he is, you know, and
something will go wrong.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.910
And a cable will get,
you know, because

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.590
I messed with it.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.310
But that's the fun of it.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.120
DANA VETTER: That's great.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.220
So let's talk a little
bit about the tour.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.770
At Google, we have this
thing called the Dory.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.380
And that's where we get
Crowd-sourced questions.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.180
So some of the questions I'm
going to ask you are from the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.240
audience, essentially.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.638
And everyone will vote on if
they like the question or

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:12.260
dislike the question.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.430
BRAD PAISLEY: And what
about the answer?

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.130
Do they vote on that?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.315
Because that's really going
to be disappointing.

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:18.560
DANA VETTER: So one question
they had is what's it like to

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.020
play in California versus other
places that you have

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.485
been touring?

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:26.870
BRAD PAISLEY: I would say-- and
I run the risk of making

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.930
other people mad--

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.770
but I would say this is
our favorite state--

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.440
DANA VETTER: Really?

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.660
BRAD PAISLEY: --four touring.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.120
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.090
DANA VETTER: You don't
say that everywhere?

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.930
BRAD PAISLEY: I don't
say that everywhere.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.450
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.600
You heard it here first.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.940
BRAD PAISLEY: I can't say that
about another state.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.320
I mean, it's fun
to play Texas.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.300
It's fun to play Georgia.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.720
But there's always cities in
those, and I won't name 'em,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.790
but there's always a city in
each of those states that I'm

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.260
talking about that you
dread a little bit.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.840
Because it's like they're a
little jaded or they're--

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.400
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.280
BRAD PAISLEY: But it is not the
case in California for us.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.845
DANA VETTER: Cool, OK.

00:06:53.845 --> 00:06:55.380
BRAD PAISLEY: There is not
a bad place we play--

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.100
DANA VETTER: Great.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.620
BRAD PAISLEY: --knock on wood.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.500
DANA VETTER: That's great.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.150
I love that.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.420
And so, towards the end of the
tour you're heading to

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.630
international destinations.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.620
And another question from the
Dory is, not many country

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.070
artists can fill as many seats
as you can internationally.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.430
And so--

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.070
BRAD PAISLEY: Feel
as many seats?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.975
DANA VETTER: Fill, fill--

00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:15.480
BRAD PAISLEY: Fill
as many seats.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.430
DANA VETTER: Butts in seats,
butts in seats.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.041
BRAD PAISLEY: Gotcha, got it.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:17.196
All right.

00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:18.225
DANA VETTER: Or feel.

00:07:18.225 --> 00:07:19.540
BRAD PAISLEY: Feel
as many seats.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.320
Yes.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.140
DANA VETTER: So what do you
attribute some of that to?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.340
Could you speculate?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.710
BRAD PAISLEY: I think
it's always songs.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.510
I think that the minute you
start to think it's you and

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.260
not the songs you're singing
is the minute

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.324
you're about to--

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:39.190
DANA VETTER: It's almost over.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.900
BRAD PAISLEY: --you're about to
pee in a bucket backstage

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.240
in a kitchen or something.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.390
You know, you're about to
get arrested speeding--

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.500
DANA VETTER: Ooh, a poker
reference there.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.240
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah, going
through your subdivision, and

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.570
then flip off the cop, and,
you know, I don't know.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.630
Because you're starting
to think it's you.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.400
You're starting to think you're
larger than life.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.730
And truthfully, it's
always about songs.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:06.000
Because I have always been of
the belief that any artist

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.840
that sang the 22 hits,
you know, 22 chart

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.320
toppers I've had--

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.560
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.570
BRAD PAISLEY: --would be a
star, probably as big, or

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.600
maybe bigger than me, you
know, in that sense.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.110
Because I'm lucky that I found
some that were wonderful.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.160
I'm lucky to have written a
few that really worked.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.590
And it really comes
down to that.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.562
People, when they say, that's my
story that you're singing.

00:08:31.562 --> 00:08:33.390
Or we used this at
our wedding.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.765
Or, you know, we played this
at a funeral, or we--

00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:38.980
that's how you get people
to go see you play.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.600
DANA VETTER: That's how you
get them in those seats.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.484
BRAD PAISLEY: Songs.

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:42.710
DANA VETTER: Songs.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.316
So speaking of songs that mean
something to people, I grew up

00:08:47.316 --> 00:08:48.430
in Kentucky.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.050
I love "Southern Comfort Zone,"
which is one of the

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.400
hits off of your latest
album, "Wheel House."

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.020
And I don't know if you guys
have seen this video, but in

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.825
the video, you--

00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:00.050
BRAD PAISLEY: The director
is sitting right there.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.895
DANA VETTER: Oh,
OK, a director.

00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:01.180
Where is he?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.802
BRAD PAISLEY: That's our
director Jim Shea.

00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:02.260
He directed me.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.280
DANA VETTER: So in this video,
you mic up a tractor.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.650
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.100
DANA VETTER: You've
got cameos from an

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.320
elephant and some giraffes.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.045
BRAD PAISLEY: Right.

00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:11.270
DANA VETTER: And you hit eight
countries in eight days, is

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.430
that right?

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.890
BRAD PAISLEY: We did.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.620
DANA VETTER: So where did
this idea come from?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.200
Tell me about this video.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.890
BRAD PAISLEY: That's one of the
most unique, fun things

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.180
we've ever attempted.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:27.740
And what that was, the song is
about, for those of you who

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.060
are watching that may not
know, the song "Southern

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.470
Comfort Zone" sounds like we're
saying about drinking--

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.545
DANA VETTER: Right, SoCo.

00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:37.280
BRAD PAISLEY: --alcohol in,
like, the back of the truck.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.200
But we purposefully, on this
album, set out to write songs

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.000
that sort of zigged when you
thought they would zag.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.096
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:09:45.096 --> 00:09:47.560
BRAD PAISLEY: You know, they
were supposed to be

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.720
unpredictable and new
angles on topics.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:59.000
And so the angle that we took
with it was you are literally

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.060
really the most thankful for
this place you're from when

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.200
you see the world.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.900
And you appreciate new
things about it.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.680
Like you come back from
a place like--

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.560
one of my charities I'm involved
with is Haiti-- you

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.700
come back from a place like
Haiti, and you're just excited

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.180
about the fact that
your faucets work.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.790
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.690
BRAD PAISLEY: You come back from
Paris, and you think to

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.320
yourself, where's that
bakery that's really

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.580
good, that's similar?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.560
It's not quite as good, but
it's similar to that--

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:27.999
DANA VETTER: --an inspiration,
right.

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:28.271
Yeah.

00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:29.340
BRAD PAISLEY: --that
place. yeah.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.920
Or Italy.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.240
And you're like, I heard a new
artisan coffee shop opened up.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.250
I'd like to see if they're doing
a cappuccino anywhere

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.530
near right, you know.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.938
And you come back enlightened
and with a new appreciation of

00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:40.740
where you're from.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.910
So how do you illustrate
that in a video?

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.840
Ironically, around the time we
were going to do the video, it

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.370
was time for me to
go to Europe.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.210
And we had a bunch of
tour dates in London

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.725
and Sweden and Norway.

00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.770
And I'm trying to think
of where else.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.210
DANA VETTER: France, I think,
was in the video.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.010
BRAD PAISLEY: Well, France
is in the video.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.900
We ended up just going there.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.300
We didn't play there.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.470
DANA VETTER: Oh!

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.500
BRAD PAISLEY: That was an
excuse to spend a day--

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.105
DANA VETTER: --to run through
the streets of Paris.

00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:07.870
BRAD PAISLEY: --running through
the streets of Paris.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.220
And so all I knew, when we
started the video, was I

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.670
called Jim.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.810
And I said, here's this idea.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.660
The idea is that it starts
with a tractor.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.895
The tractor is the groove
of the song.

00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:20.420
It established the click
track with that.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:20.990
I start the thing.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.120
We mic it with an acoustic.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.170
I hand the acoustic off.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.210
I walk out of frame.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.280
I'm throwing on a jacket.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.965
And I walk into frame
in, say, Stockholm--

00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:29.560
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.030
BRAD PAISLEY: --which is the
first up of the tour.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.860
So that was all I
knew about that.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.180
And then, we were going
to wind up back at the

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:35.680
tractor at the end.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.100
DANA VETTER: Fun.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.190
BRAD PAISLEY: So whatever
happens in the middle happens.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.360
And so I edited that using an
editing program on my laptop.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.220
DANA VETTER: Really?

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.760
BRAD PAISLEY: --as we would
shoot it, yeah.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.250
Edited that myself.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.780
DANA VETTER: You did?

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.570
BRAD PAISLEY: Yep.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.325
DANA VETTER: Wow!

00:11:47.325 --> 00:11:49.420
BRAD PAISLEY: We would
shoot during the day.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.620
We would go--

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.940
I'm a big tech nerd, so--

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.345
DANA VETTER: Love this!

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:54.260
BRAD PAISLEY: --very, very
excited about being here.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.068
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.520
BRAD PAISLEY: We would
shoot during the day.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.850
And we started in Stockholm.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.470
And we got to Stockholm,
and it's freezing.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.875
And I know the jacket.

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.920
And I had a whole case full
of jackets to choose from.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.650
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.780
BRAD PAISLEY: And I knew that
was going to be the--

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.440
DANA VETTER: --that you
were doing your own

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.050
wardrobe, as well?

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.950
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah, basically.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:11.235
DANA VETTER: This was like.

00:12:11.235 --> 00:12:11.840
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah,
that's all.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.830
We had no crew whatsoever.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.480
DANA VETTER: The Brad
Paisley DIY video.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:15.960
I love it.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.100
It's amazing!

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.640
BRAD PAISLEY: It really was.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.440
And all I knew is we were going
to get to Stockholm.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.850
And I was going to throw on the
same jacket I was walking

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.390
out of frame in and make it
match to where it looks like

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.910
one arm is in the jacket and the
next arm comes in as you

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.620
walk across a bridge over
whatever the river is.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.360
And then came this idea of,
well, I should run.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.340
If I'm going through Europe, I
mean, there's no way I'm going

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.390
to make it through all of
these countries walking.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.170
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.900
BRAD PAISLEY: So I take off
running through the streets.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.030
And then, I had Kendal, my
keyboard player in the band.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.460
I was like, OK, run bus.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.750
And we would get a taxi.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.205
And Jim would sit in, like, the
trunk of the taxi with his

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:56.120
camera as the taxi would
drive about 10 miles an

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.760
hour down the road.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.800
And I'm just running
behind it.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.442
DANA VETTER: Yeah, I was
wondering how all

00:12:58.442 --> 00:12:59.150
those shots, really--

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.340
BRAD PAISLEY: And I would take
off the jacket, and I'd, like,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.920
run beside the taxi.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.700
And I'd throw the jacket
to Kendal.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.610
And he would throw
me another one.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.840
And I would be putting it on
as I'm trying to sing.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.890
DANA VETTER: It really
looks like--

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.480
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.700
DANA VETTER: --the
video's real.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.740
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah,
and we would edit.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.950
And we would get to, like,
Dublin was the last city.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.760
And we get to Dublin at
the end of this week.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.090
And we had one day.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.780
And I'm editing.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.740
And luckily, I was editing
as we went.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.434
DANA VETTER: And you have
so much time when you're

00:13:18.434 --> 00:13:19.625
on tour, I'm sure.

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.040
BRAD PAISLEY: We have
at least flights.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.190
And you definitely have downtime
in the daytime.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.075
DANA VETTER: OK, OK.

00:13:23.075 --> 00:13:24.530
BRAD PAISLEY: You have
at least all that.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.810
And I'm sitting there editing.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.080
And I went, I never threw
the blue jacket off.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.530
So here I am.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.600
So we just treat it
looks like Italy.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.350
So here we go.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.350
We went out and found, like, a
cobblestone street in Dublin,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.810
tried to make it look like
the sun was out.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:38.350
DANA VETTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.050
BRAD PAISLEY: And threw
the jacket off there.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:40.860
DANA VETTER: Oh, my gosh.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.935
You had to do a little
reshoot.

00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:43.460
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah,
so it was a little

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.020
pickup shot, you know.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.975
DANA VETTER: I love that.

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:45.790
That's great.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.150
So, yeah, if you haven't
watched the

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.860
video, check it out.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.530
It's not your average
country music video.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.000
I've got to give you that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.750
BRAD PAISLEY: No.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.970
DANA VETTER: And a really
creative edit.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.720
I love the backstory.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.560
BRAD PAISLEY: There's a ham
of a giraffe in it.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.170
There's a giraffe that
is actually--

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.980
DANA VETTER: A what?

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.590
BRAD PAISLEY: A ham
of a giraffe.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.775
DANA VETTER: A hand?

00:13:58.775 --> 00:13:59.490
BRAD PAISLEY: It's a ham.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.600
I mean, this giraffe wants
to be on camera.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.285
DANA VETTER: Oh, a
ham of a giraffe.

00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:02.745
BRAD PAISLEY: If you
have a camera--

00:14:02.745 --> 00:14:04.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.270
BRAD PAISLEY: I don't mean
an inedible giraffe.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:13.070
It's more of a giraffe that
really wants to be a star.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.200
It's the giraffe at
the Nashville Zoo.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.410
His name is Congo.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.700
And it's the biggest dog.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.750
It's like a Great Dane.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.415
But, you know--

00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:20.940
DANA VETTER: But a giraffe.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.000
BRAD PAISLEY: --two
stories high.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.800
DANA VETTER: Yeah.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.620
BRAD PAISLEY: And if you
have a camera, that

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.440
giraffe goes to it.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:25.900
DANA VETTER: That's great.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.850
BRAD PAISLEY: It's
really bizarre.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.270
It was just really--

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.245
DANA VETTER: I'll have
to go re-watch--

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:28.900
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah,
he's in it.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.450
DANA VETTER: --and keep an
eye out for the giraffe.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.920
So that's a great story.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.450
So another single--

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.060
I think your latest single, "I
Can't Change the World."

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.410
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.630
DANA VETTER: So talk to
me a little about the

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.570
origins of that song.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:47.560
It soft of starts out with
larger issues and then comes

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.970
kind of to a personal level.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.250
BRAD PAISLEY: Well, when we
launched this single--

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.390
it came out yesterday--

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.310
so it's brand spanking --

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.960
DANA VETTER: Latest.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.580
BRAD PAISLEY: --new.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.560
Latest, yes.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.520
Latest as in, don't play
it in concert yet.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.630
They don't know it but
hopefully will.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.930
It sort of feels like, with
every single, you have a theme

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.550
that you follow, that you chase
as an artist, that will

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.130
take you four or five months at
least, to go up the chart,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.890
have people sort of start to
recognize it and really sort

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.400
of digest it.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.110
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.000
BRAD PAISLEY: And this is
an important one to me.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.930
The hook of the song, for those
of you who haven't heard

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.580
it, is I can't change the world,
but I can change yours.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.830
And you're singing it to
a girl in the song.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.780
It's a romantic notion.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.720
But the opening line of the song
is a bomb goes off in a

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.600
far off city.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.280
And you deal with the fact that
this world, basically,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.960
thanks to the 24-hour news cycle
and the connectedness of

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.130
technology, feels a lot crazier
than it ever did.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:49.760
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.500
BRAD PAISLEY: Whether that's
or not, I don't know.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.400
I mean, you know, I imagine
there were train wrecks in

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.380
Europe when I was a kid.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.570
But I never heard about it.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.460
If I did, it was a blurb
in the paper--

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.160
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.920
BRAD PAISLEY: --days later.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.470
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:07.210
BRAD PAISLEY: But we grieve in
real time, with things that

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.450
happen in Indonesia, things
that happen in Europe and

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.110
Afghanistan or you name it.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.810
And it's all very overwhelming
for a human being.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.315
I don't know if we're
equipped to sort of

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:20.980
internalize all of that.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.610
DANA VETTER: All of it, yeah.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.670
BRAD PAISLEY: You know,
all of us have our own

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.560
situations in our lives.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.600
And the singer of the song
reaches the conclusion that

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.550
his cause is this girl and that
he is going to make the

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.170
world a better place for her.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.880
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.110
BRAD PAISLEY: And in some ways,
it's a larger theme for

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.710
life, in the sense that we're
all sort of searching, I

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.940
think, for whatever it is that
gives our lives meaning.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.180
And I think that, truthfully,
if you want your life to

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.220
matter, then maybe save
someone else--

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.890
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:56.280
BRAD PAISLEY: You know?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.900
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.340
BRAD PAISLEY: Make else's life
better, and yours mattered.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.560
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.960
BRAD PAISLEY: You know,
and In that sense it's

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.500
a very large theme.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.955
But it's meant to be romantic.

00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:08.210
DANA VETTER: OK, great.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.819
So you started out.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.010
You grew up in West
Virginia, right?

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.079
BRAD PAISLEY: Yes, right
next to Kentucky.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.970
DANA VETTER: Right
next to Kentucky.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.970
Yep, my family's from Elkins.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.406
BRAD PAISLEY: Oh,
congratulations.

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:24.760
DANA VETTER: Anyway, in West
Virginia, you started out

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.530
playing at "Jamboree
USA," right--

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:26.910
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.820
DANA VETTER: --which was an
old weekly radio program.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.570
BRAD PAISLEY: Yes.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.470
DANA VETTER: So back then,
I think you played on the

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.000
program for many years.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.720
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.150
I started when I was
13 on there.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.050
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.030
And so back then, you know,
radio was a primary force.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.230
And it certainly continues to be
now, but as one of a number

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.670
of things in kind of the
music landscape.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.375
You have elaborate tours.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:49.320
You have YouTube.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:49.970
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.150
DANA VETTER: You have all
the social media.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.870
I mean, it's interesting that
we're sitting here at Google

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:00.360
today, where so much is digital
in technology and

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.380
video, and it's a far cry from
when life was radio and three

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.320
stations on the TV.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.760
So how do you balance all
of these outlets?

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.100
And what's your approach, kind
of, to bringing your music and

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.940
kind of also you through
social media

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.980
and things like YouTube?

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.160
BRAD PAISLEY: It's
interesting.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.920
You know, it's a constant
challenge to try and get

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.760
people's attention.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.890
I mean, you can put all of this
time into editing a video

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.370
where you run through Paris and
have all of these sort of

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.350
segues through Europe and trying
to sort of bridge the

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.120
southern mentality with the
sort of world view.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.790
And then, you're upstaged
by, you know,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.680
David at the dentist--

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:48.160
BRAD PAISLEY: --by a
little kid that's--

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.952
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:18:48.952 --> 00:18:50.390
BRAD PAISLEY: --on codeine.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.808
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:50.808 --> 00:18:53.160
DANA VETTER: You're like,
oh, we almost had it.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.540
BRAD PAISLEY: Right, right.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.140
Yeah, you know.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.630
Get it, or whatever.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.990
And so it's an interesting
time that way.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.510
But also you have so many
opportunities to get your

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.210
music out there.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.490
I think it's always about
connecting the dots.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.900
And I'm a very complicated
person.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.570
I'm very hard to figure
out in some ways.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.790
I mean, I have songs
that run the gamut.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.150
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.600
BRAD PAISLEY: And some of them
have made people mad.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.710
And some of them have been
completely misunderstood.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.170
And some have been, you know,
totally embraced.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.670
And my fans have a really good
idea of who I am, I think, at

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.130
this point.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.720
And the goal is to try and get
those people to misunderstand

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.980
me to find something there.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.640
And, you know, Twitter
is a great tool.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.460
You have YouTube, which
is such a great tool.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.870
Because you can be in the middle
of a tour and film, you

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.180
know, my drummer, I don't know,
throwing up behind his

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.200
drum kit when he gets
food poisoning.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.025
And the next thing you know,
that's bigger than the video

00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:48.250
we just made--

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:48.940
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.660
BRAD PAISLEY: --or something.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.010
And it's a great way to connect
the dots and let

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:54.960
people feel a part of it.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.810
Because they just want to feel
a part of something, I think,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.470
in this world.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.620
I don't really know if we
do it exactly right.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.540
But if you have any ideas, this
is the room to ask on how

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.230
I can make it better.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.890
DANA VETTER: Well, I think you
have a lot of content, I

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.510
think, on all of your
social platforms.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.850
And it seems that your videos
are creative, and you're

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.570
finding a lot of ways to
engage with people.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.430
So I think it's great.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.370
One thing, actually, I want to
ask, and then we'll take a

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.260
question from the audience.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.270
So on YouTube, you know about
this thing on Google and

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.430
YouTube-- we have Autofill,
right-- which populates some

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.780
frequent searches.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.105
And this is one that I found.

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:35.850
And the Autofill is Brad
Paisley pranks.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.170
And it has--

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.840
BRAD PAISLEY: Oh, there's
a bunch of that, yeah.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.450
DANA VETTER: --Brad Paisley
pranks Blake Shelton, pranks

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.950
Carrie Underwood, pranks
The Band Perry.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.750
It goes on and on,
this long list--

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.870
I don't know if you
guys can see it--

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.300
all the way to Brad Paisley
pranks wife.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.180
I mean, a lot of your
songs are funny.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.600
BRAD PAISLEY:

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.550
Pranks wife by proposing.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.160
DANA VETTER: A lot of your
songs are funny.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.280
And you clearly have a pulse
on humor and pop culture.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.990
But what's the story
with these pranks?

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.705
Did you grow up as
a prankster?

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:05.830
Are you always watching
your back on the road?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.890
Like, what's the deal?

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.380
BRAD PAISLEY: I am
watching my back.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.250
Chris Young, as you know, is our
opening act here tonight.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.310
And he is just out
of the hospital.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.740
He had a staph infection.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.130
And it was a scary thing.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.340
But I talked to him this week,
and he's doing better.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.260
And I had heard rumors that he
might have to do his show

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.210
sitting down this evening,
which I was,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.270
like, this is awesome.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.290
Get water guns.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.900
DANA VETTER: What a welcoming.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.750
BRAD PAISLEY: You know, I'm on
one of these people, that, I

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.970
like you if I'm picking
on you.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.345
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:21:37.345 --> 00:21:39.660
BRAD PAISLEY: --and was
always that way.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.370
And I've always been a bit
of a prankster, I think.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.300
And I don't always come
off like that.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.900
But man, I could have worked for
the CIA, I'm telling you.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.380
DANA VETTER: You're a sleuth?

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.840
BRAD PAISLEY: --because my mind
just thinks that way,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.190
like, oh, you know what
we could do to mess

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.581
them up, you know.

00:21:54.581 --> 00:22:01.020
And we've done everything from,
like with Kellie Pickler

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.560
opening for us, we created
a fake intro video.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.396
She had a video that was the
typical, Kellie Pickler is--

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:11.490
you know-- was on "American
Idol." And that

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:12.600
was her intro video.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.630
And we changed it with a video
called "You Be the Judge."

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:24.340
I took photos off WireImage
and doctored her to where,

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.000
like, the early photos of her on
"American Idol," we made it

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.380
look like a 12-year-old boy
on the upper torso.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.760
And then the post photos, we
made her look like Dolly

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.680
Parton and interviewed a plastic
surgeon and had his

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.070
opinion, Dr. Emerson Biggins.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.220
BRAD PAISLEY: And he gave his
opinion on whether or not she

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.450
had sought--

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.735
DANA VETTER: Enhancement.

00:22:47.735 --> 00:22:49.220
BRAD PAISLEY: --enhancement.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.410
And then, it just left the
audience with questions.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.870
So please welcome
Kellie Pickler.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:54.673
You be the judge.

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.730
DANA VETTER: You be the judge.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.220
BRAD PAISLEY: And that
was her intro video.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.847
And she had to walk out wearing
the tightest tank top

00:22:58.847 --> 00:22:59.510
you've ever seen.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.222 --> 00:23:02.650
BRAD PAISLEY: And she's, like,
cussing me out backstage.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.380
DANA VETTER: Of course,
of course.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.490
BRAD PAISLEY: But we're
good friends.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.290
And she took it really well.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:06.390
DANA VETTER: It's so funny.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.300
BRAD PAISLEY: But that's the
kind of stuff we do.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.870
And it goes back to
when I was five.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.970
I pulled the ultimate
prank on my mother.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.770
My dad's here.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.150
I pulled a prank on mother when
I was five years old.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.040
She told me I had to be-- and
this is so wrong, but

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.310
it's so who I am--

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.790
I had to be in bed by 10 o'clock
on New Year's Eve.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.590
I was five years old.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.212
I knew that all the action
happens at midnight on New

00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:29.240
Year's Eve.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.860
DANA VETTER: Right.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.340
OK.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.990
BRAD PAISLEY: But she told my
grandpa, who is my best

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.650
friend-- and he's watching me--
and her father, Put him

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.260
in bed at 10:00.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.590
We're leaving and going to see
his uncle in the morning at,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.150
like, 8:00 AM.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.390
I don't want him tired.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.020
And I'm mad, because I wanted
to stay up and see the ball

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.660
drop, you know, in New York.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.750
And they leave.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.280
And my wheels are spinning.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.260
How can I stay up
til midnight?

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.240
DANA VETTER: How
can I stay up?

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.000
BRAD PAISLEY: And finally
he asks me one time--

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.090
he goes back around.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.780
My dad used to have this
bar in the house--

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.780
and he sees the bar.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.030
And I think he might
be having a beer.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.380
And he asks me, he says, Brad--
and we used to have

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.498
deep discussions-- does your
mom ever drink alcohol?

00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:13.920
And I said, all the time.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.465
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.465 --> 00:24:17.980
BRAD PAISLEY: And he said,
what do you mean?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.170
I said, all.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.820
Sometimes, Dad has
to carry her in.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.920
BRAD PAISLEY: I don't know
how I knew that.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.990
And he's like, really?

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.083
And I went into detail about the
nights when she's slurring

00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:29.560
her speech and everything.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.380
DANA VETTER: No, this is a
YouTube video for that.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.260
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah, I should
recreate it with

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.710
little child actors.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.590
And anyway, they get
home at 1:00.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.330
And I'm standing there and arms
crossed in the kitchen,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.920
wide awake.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.960
He's kept me up for evidence.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.610
And she walks through the
door and says, what

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.910
are you doing up?

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.700
And he says, never mind him!

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.600
DANA VETTER: What
are you doing?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.320
BRAD PAISLEY: I didn't raise
you like this, Woman.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.304 --> 00:24:57.120
BRAD PAISLEY: And then, she's
like, well, what are you

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:57.460
talking about?

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.300
And he's going off.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.500
My mother never drinks.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.840
But she used to love Kahlua
in her coffee.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.420
And so I go find a bottle
of Kahlua in the bar

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.580
and show it to him.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.110
And he doesn't know Kahlua is.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.560
He's an old, like,
Kentucky redneck.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.370
He's looking at it.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.950
Its 80 proof.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.750
That's all he needs.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.370
This is hers.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.400
And then, he goes off.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.460
And my dad's saying, you're
out of line, Warren.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.910
And I remember this.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.750
And he goes over to her.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.590
He says, you did this to her!

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:27.510
BRAD PAISLEY: He storms
off down the alley.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.260
She goes upstairs crying--
and my dad, or,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:30.920
no, he's still there.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.030
My dad says to me--

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.980
or she's saying, Brad, tell
him you're lying!

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.794
And I look at him and go,
I wish I could, Mom.

00:25:40.794 --> 00:25:42.964
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:44.400
BRAD PAISLEY: And then
she goes upstairs.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.320
He goes down to his house.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.440
And I had to call him
and apologize and

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.750
tell him I was lying.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.613
And I got in trouble.

00:25:50.613 --> 00:25:51.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.600
DANA VETTER: Oh, Happy
New Year, right?

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.190
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.130
That's me.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.680
DANA VETTER: So funny.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.070
So we don't have
much more time.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.070
I think we'll take one question
from the audience.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.590
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll make
it good then.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:02.800
One comment and one question.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.610
Number one, I love your shirt,
because I think you have all

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.010
the Google colors.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.840
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah,
no kidding.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.820
DANA VETTER: Oh, thanks
for doing that.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.860
AUDIENCE: You did it on
purpose, I'm sure.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.500
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.720
AUDIENCE: Number two, here to
hear Google really big on

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.920
work-life balance.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.280
And you sound so busy, with
writing songs, singing songs,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.920
all of your tours.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.540
So can you give us a little
advice on how you do it?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.280
BRAD PAISLEY: I sleep
very little.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.690
And that's not good advice.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:29.830
But, I think that it seems
busier than it really is when

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.590
you are in the public eye.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.200
So I have people say, you must
never see your family.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.580
But I saw them yesterday,
before I flew out.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.880
And I'll see 'em again before
the weekend's over.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.290
And then, I'm home
for four days.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:47.885
And I'll cram.

00:26:47.885 --> 00:26:53.260
And it's sort of like if I'm
home four days out of seven on

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.990
any given week, I make sure
those four days are a heavy

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.530
majority for my kids and wife.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.620
And in that sense, I spend more
time, maybe, with my kids

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.980
than somebody who has a 9:00 to
5:00 day job, that doesn't

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.900
get home til 6:00 or so.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.330
And their kids probably
go to bed at 8:00.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.280
So they have, maybe, two hours
at the end of the day, where

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.585
they got to catch up.

00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:21.620
And in my case, you know, we
have days together that are

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.620
all-day events.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.910
And then, it's sort of like when
the family goes to bed,

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.690
I'll write or I'll work.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.500
And there's chunks of time
where I work really hard

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.400
making an album for six months,
where your mind is

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.260
sort of hazy and you're out
there thinking about it.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.150
And then, there's other times
when I'm doing less.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.440
And it is a challenge.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.760
And wives are good at reminding
you your balance is

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.180
off a little bit
in a good way.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.160
And your kids are good at
reminding you of that, too.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.510
You know, in the middle of the
writing, I'll be typing a lot

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.440
of things in a phone or a tablet
or something, and my

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.350
kids will say, you never
look up from that.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.440
And then, that's a sign.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.390
It's like, OK, wait a minute.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.750
I need to put that down.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.120
Life is a balance, though.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.990
And you are your balance.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.430
You are that person,
you know, I think.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.960
You can't say, well, no,
I'm really their dad.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.850
I just never see them.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:21.370
Then, you're not.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.750
You know, you have to
find that, I think.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.200
DANA VETTER: So what's
next for you?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.540
Are you the type of songwriter
where you have a lot kind of

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.720
going on, you're writing on the
road, and you have a lot

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.370
of material, like, for
your next album?

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.730
Or are you focused right now
on the tour now, the "Beat

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.560
This Summer Tour" and
"Wheelhouse," and then you'll

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.140
take a break?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.505
What's kind of next for you?

00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:47.900
BRAD PAISLEY: I'm not writing
songs much right now.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.490
Because I think that you
have to recharge.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.540
I heard a great songwriter
once say you need input.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.170
You know, just like any
computer, it needs input to

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.360
have any sort of output.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.730
And you have to live a little
bit and observe especially,

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.980
read, which I just
learned to do.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:06.810
BRAD PAISLEY: It's a
whole new world.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.030
I mean, I'm learning right along
with my six-year-old.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.900
No, really, it's about that.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.550
And so this is more of
a absorption time--

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.230
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.060
BRAD PAISLEY: --for me.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.270
But we have some really cool
things we're about to do.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.300
I can't really announce
it yet.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.880
But we're working on a really
large way of illustrating this

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.350
new single in a way that is
bigger than a music video and

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.070
is more of a strong sort
of case for what the

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.130
point of the song is.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:38.260
And, you know, in that sense,
that's the fun part about

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.220
being in music, is I think
music now can be this

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.670
multifingered thing, where you
have all of these various

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.060
channels that you get to do
if you are successful.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.400
People know your name.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.930
They're interested in what
you're doing for some reason.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:59.690
And anything you can do to help
the point of something

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.390
you believe in is fun--

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:02.110
DANA VETTER: Um, hm.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.120
BRAD PAISLEY: --you know,
in that sense.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.180
DANA VETTER: So when should we
look out for this new thing?

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.660
BRAD PAISLEY: I think
in a week or two--

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.400
DANA VETTER: Oh, soon!

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.280
BRAD PAISLEY: --we'll start
talking about it, yeah--

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.052
DANA VETTER: Great.

00:30:10.052 --> 00:30:11.980
BRAD PAISLEY: --if
all goes well.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.980
DANA VETTER: OK.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.550
BRAD PAISLEY: We're sort of in
talks to do something cool.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.190
And if you don't hear about
it, then it didn't happen.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.160
DANA VETTER: And something
fell through.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.810
BRAD PAISLEY: Right.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.040
DANA VETTER: Well, I think
we're about out of time.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.470
We're going to go give you a
bit of a Google tour now.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.880
But thank you so much
for joining us.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.355
BRAD PAISLEY: Thank
you very much.

00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:32.045
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:30:32.045 --> 00:30:33.535
BRAD PAISLEY: Thanks for
doing what you do.

00:30:33.535 --> 00:30:36.010
DANA VETTER: Thanks for
taking the time.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:40.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.660
BRAD PAISLEY: I never knew it
took so many people to put,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.780
like, white and blue search
results up on a screen.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.190
It's, like, crazy.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.092
AUDIENCE: Like Texas.

00:30:49.092 --> 00:30:51.080
DANA VETTER: There's thousands
more of us, too.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.770
BRAD PAISLEY: Yeah, I bet.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:52.640
AUDIENCE: Like she just said.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.555
BRAD PAISLEY: Thank you.

00:30:53.555 --> 00:30:54.805
DANA VETTER: Thank you.
