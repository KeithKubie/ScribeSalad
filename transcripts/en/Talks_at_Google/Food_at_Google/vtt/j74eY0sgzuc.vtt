00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.380
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, and
thank you for coming today.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.550
This is a great collaboration
between the Authors Discussion

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.435
Group and the Food team.

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.940
We have Chef Margarita here,
from Chihuahua, Mexico.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.970
Today we're talking, or she will
be discussing, various recipes

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.510
from her book,
"Mexico-- the Cookbook,"

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.800
which covers pretty much most
of the regions, or states,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.690
in Mexico.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.517
So without further
ado, Chef Margarita.

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:37.100
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Thank you.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.510
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.930
Well, thank you very much.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.400
Good afternoon.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.530
I'm very glad to be here,
sharing with you all

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.040
this experience from
living such a long time.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.450
And I will start
with telling you

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.640
that this is a recipe from the
Yucatan, in which the marinade

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.010
we're going to prepare can be
used in mostly any protein.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.390
It can be used with chicken,
with fish, with shrimp,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
with pork.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.246
It will be delicious prepared
with almost anything.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.900
We'll start with-- let me see.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.010
We'll use the heat,
but if I take it away

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:41.640
from the plate, the heat, it
will not roast the banana leaf.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730
So I'll turn it upside down.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.306
And you will see how
it changes color.

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:53.980
Look.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.710
Look.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.910
Are you looking?

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.410
Look.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.060
It turns bright green-- look.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.200
And it becomes flexible.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.120
Look how nice.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.920
Look.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.310
OK, and now it's flexible.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.550
Look.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.810
And it doesn't break.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.355
Otherwise, it breaks.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.160
We are going to prepare the
marinade, which is achiote.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:06.110
This achiote is annatto
seed dissolved in vinegar,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.150
and make a paste,
together with dry roasted

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:22.330
garlics, fresh garlics, spices,
cinnamon, bay leaves, peppers,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.330
allspice berries.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.370
And we'll make it liquid
with orange juice.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.980
If we don't have sour orange
juice, as we use in Mexico,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.500
then you add the orange juice,
normal-- regular any orange

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.450
juice-- and vinegar.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.950
OK, so this is ready.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.970
We'll add epazote.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.251
Sorry.

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:14.750
OK.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.590
And we'll prepare
this with the fish,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.170
and we'll put it in
the refrigerator.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.980
And now we will
prepare the escabeche.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.747
OK, we need olive oil.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.220
The garlics-- they
have to be complete

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.590
so people can see them
and take them off,

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.770
if they don't want them.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:47.680
We'll add the cinnamon bark,
some peppers, some cloves,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.570
and some bay leaves.

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.784
[SIZZLING]

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.292
All these herbs
start protesting.

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:04.999
And red onion.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.320
Very slightly.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.340
We don't want them to get brown.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:38.570
We'll add the
vinegar, the chiles.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:57.550
But we have to-- in order
to have the flavor, but not

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.630
the heat, you have to make
little holes in the habanero.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.570
Mmm.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.610
And we'll add a
little bit of water.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.320
OK.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.280
Little bit of salt.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.460
And that's it.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.575
We have to leave this resting.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.480
OK, this is ready.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.350
Mmm, smells delicious.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.850
We leave this resting.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.970
So it will get a red color.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.080
If you want it more
red, you put the skin--

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.020
you know, this paper-like skin
that the red onions have-- put

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.010
them in a cheese cloth,
together with a slice of beet,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.430
tie it, and put it there,
so it will get bright red.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.220
Sometimes you are in a hurry,
so you don't have time to.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.380
OK, this is ready.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.860
Now we'll prepare the fish.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.190
Yeah, [SPANISH]?

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.760
Is that all?

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:47.830
OK.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.810
We'll have the fish, a
little bit of pepper.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:02.070
We use a lot of the
allspice berries,

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.260
and it's the only spice
that is from Mexican origin.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.380
The rest is from a
lot of other places.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:19.930
And the American ambassador
we had at that time,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.090
when he discovered
it, he tasted it,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:33.520
named it allspice, because
in its little berry

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.860
it has the flavor of the
black pepper, the nutmeg,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.650
the cinnamon, and the clove.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.830
That's why it's called allspice.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:52.570
So we have onion, tomato.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:38.262
[INAUDIBLE] And we will
add a little more salt/

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.870
Little bit of habanero.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:49.710
If you don't want habanero,
just omit it, or put one whole,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.740
without opening it, so
it will give the flavor,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.820
and it will not give the heat.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.320
OK?

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.970
That's it.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.960
We can send it to be baked.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.970
And this, if you don't
have an oven, no excuse.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.440
You put it on a comal.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.800
You don't have a
comal, a saute pan.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.530
Put it on a saute pan,
like this, put a few drops,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.940
like an ounce of
water on the bottom

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.280
so it creates the first
steam, and then cover it.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.010
It will be ready in 15
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.890
That's it.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.816
We have it finished,
so that-- OK, OK.

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:47.315
Questions?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.798
Be ready with your question.

00:12:52.798 --> 00:12:55.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.530
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Oh, yes.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.710
I do.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.230
No, no.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.310
In Mexico.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.470
Come to Mexico.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.520
I would love to be in LA,
because my son is here, but no.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.790
He works for the movie industry.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.930
But no, no, no.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.487
In Mexico.

00:13:14.487 --> 00:13:15.362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.142
MARGARITA CARRILLO ARRONTE: I
would be a liar if I told you.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.400
But I'm going to
tell you something.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:37.450
If they give you something with
yellow cheese, don't eat it.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.550
We don't even have it in Mexico.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.870
We call it American cheese.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.240
So they have to be honest.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.530
They have to give you-- they
know that you like fried food,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.650
so that's why they-- and
of course, taquitos and all

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.900
these things fried
are delicious,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.280
but it's not the only thing.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:08.010
You know, I normally never,
never fry the food I eat.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.260
But I try it in my menu.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.420
I have nothing fried but the
totopos that I-- we fry it

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.610
every day, and
then after frying,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.120
I put them in the oven
with lots of kitchen paper

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.660
so they let all the oil off.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.660
Because it has a very bad
fame of being unhealthy food.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.290
And it isn't.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.320
It's not fair.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.640
And there is a reason
why I understand.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.290
At the beginning, I was very
angry with Mexican people who

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.260
cross the border,
and for me, it's

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.400
a way of prostituting the food.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.490
They do prostitute the food.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:58.190
But I understood that they come
here searching for a better way

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.880
to live, because in Mexico
they cannot find it.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.520
We are too many.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.210
And they come here,
they work hard,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.580
and they open these
little places,

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.800
and they want to
be accepted madly.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.740
They need to be accepted.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.550
So they are willing to
adapt their traditional food

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.660
to the American taste.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.480
So that's why they
do it, because it's

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.930
the easier-- they didn't
come here to educate you.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.970
They came here to be accepted,
and to work hard, and to have

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.230
a better life.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.200
So that's why they are willing
to prostitute the food,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.720
but I don't.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:52.300
So that's why I wrote this
book, and in many-- there

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.070
are a few fried
recipes, like bunuelos,

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.250
and other things, some desserts.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.480
But mainly,
everything-- you know,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.700
the traditional
cooking techniques

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.500
of Mexican authentic food
is on the comal, steamed,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.480
boiled, in the pit,
through a hole in the oven,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.090
on hot stones.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.394
There are many other-- grilled--
many other ways, but not fried.

00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:29.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.050
MARGARITA CARRILLO ARRONTE:
Well, to begin with,

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.150
they don't find the
same ingredients.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.060
It's the most important reason.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.640
And something else.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.480
This is-- and you
will understand this.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.030
You're young, intelligent guys.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:14.609
You will understand that
when the Spaniards came,

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.420
they brought the pigs with them.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.290
They brought the lard, and
they brought the olive oil,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.700
and the frying technique.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.440
And it was expensive.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.810
Mexicans couldn't afford it.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.030
Only rich people
could afford it.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:34.660
So it became a way of
status, a sign of status.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.515
Only rich people could
eat with these elements.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.610
There is even a saying in
Mexico, from colonial times,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.920
that when you haven't seen a
friend for a long time-- oh,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.520
have you seen Chochito Perez?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.020
Oh, no.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.070
But you know, they
even cook with lard?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.700
They are doing so well that
they even cook with lard.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.990
So it became like they
are so wealthy now,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.650
why, they can cook with lard.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.040
And that has happened here, too.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.250
When they come here,
they have a better life,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.130
and they can cook with oil.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.130
So the most remembered
things-- you know,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.400
food is completely
mingled-- Mexican food

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.260
is completely mingled with the
culture, with the religion,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.030
and especially is
with the feelings.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.350
When you are sick,
you immediately

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.590
remember what your mother cooked
for you when you were young.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.585
You were little.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:40.460
You remember it well.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.170
So food, as it becomes
something mixed

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:49.680
with the feelings, and
the homesickness, and all

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.240
these things-- they want
the most popular street food

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.410
that reminds them of the food
from Chiapas, or from wherever

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.364
they are.

00:19:01.364 --> 00:19:02.874
So they cook.

00:19:02.874 --> 00:19:03.749
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.730
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Achiote?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.480
Annatto.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.750
It's a bush that gives
a bright, red flower.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:22.020
But in the heart of it has
like a pod, like an open pod.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.310
And you open this
pod, and inside it's

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.630
like a corn kernel,
a little corn kernel.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.360
And instead of white kernels,
it has red bright kernels.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.860
And it's the annatto seeds.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.830
And everybody
there, what they do

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.180
is put them in a jar with
vinegar or sour orange juice,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.695
and let them soak.

00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:45.990
But they are going to use them.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:55.110
They mix them with dry roasted
garlic, cinnamon, black pepper,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.110
with spices.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.722
And they have their achiote.

00:19:59.722 --> 00:20:00.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.990
MARGARITA CARRILLO ARRONTE:
You can buy it here.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.050
MARGARITA CARRILLO ARRONTE:
Yes, the color is--

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.660
and the food looks
delicious, and the flavor.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.400
And you can buy it in all
Mexican or South American

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.180
stores.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.705
Yes?

00:20:12.705 --> 00:20:13.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:17.861 --> 00:20:19.444
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Of course.

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:20.319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.990
MARGARITA CARRILLO ARRONTE: OK.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.630
A lot of-- I could tell you
that the most important thing

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.670
is the practice.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.430
So don't be disappointed
and not try again.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.930
Try again.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.640
Your dog will be very happy
eating horrible tortillas,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.320
but well cooked.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.800
And just mix the masa
harina with-- if you're

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.130
making like a kilo
of masa harina,

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.440
just have a bolito
like that, of my size,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.290
not yours-- you know, like this.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.540
50 grams of wheat flour.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.510
Mix it there, and add warm
water, tepid water that you

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:11.820
can put your little
finger, and count until 10,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.240
without burning yourself.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.520
Don't go, one, two,
three, four, five, aah!

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.060
No.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.580
Just warm water.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.830
And mix it.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.880
Enough water.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.620
And it has to be a little
bit sticky at the end,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.700
but then it's perfect.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.810
And you just make the little
bolitas, put them in the press.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:42.560
And the flat pan, the comal,
has to be thick and very hot,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.770
hot enough to seal the
tortilla right away.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.820
But as you don't
have any practice,

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.490
and you will burn
your fingers if you

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:58.760
try to turn the tortilla,
have one of those spatulas,

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.470
and turn it.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.440
And that's it.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.750
Why didn't they work out well?

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.829
They broke?

00:22:03.829 --> 00:22:04.704
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.190
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Practice.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.543
Yes, and the dough
has to be wet.

00:22:14.543 --> 00:22:15.418
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:18.955 --> 00:22:20.330
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Masa.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:25.930
It has to be corn, but not from
Colombia or-- because that's

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.620
not made from nixtamal.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.150
It has to be masa harina
from Mexico, Maseca

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.670
or-- what's the other name?

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:47.720
Maseca or-- I don't remember
the name of the other.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:55.200
But it has to be corn,
nixtamalized flour, corn flour.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.740
That's the secret.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.670
If it's too white, then
it's not the good one.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.210
It's light sand color.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.270
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Buy a Mexican one.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.350
And don't hesitate
to add enough water.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.990
And if it's too wet,
add a little bit more,

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.660
and no problem.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.500
It's not like flour
harina that you

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.670
will develop the
gluten, and all this.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.380
No, this hasn't
got that problem.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.160
And it's very, very delicious.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.210
Don't add any salt to it.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.800
OK?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.770
Well, something else.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.270
It's important.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.580
Here-- I didn't make
enough marinade,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.540
but normally you have a
lot of marinade left over.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.360
What you do is you boil it,
reduce it, and then add it

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.890
to the fish, or to the
chicken, or whatever.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:03.590
And what you have to do is serve
with-- where's the escabeche?

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.930
You put it on top,
OK, on top, on top.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:12.280
And a little bit more
olive oil, and you serve it

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.630
with fried plantain.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.945
And the plantain,
where are they?

00:24:18.945 --> 00:24:20.430
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.263
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Yes, over there.

00:24:22.263 --> 00:24:24.410
The blackened, the better.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:31.020
You will never eat a--
this plantain is not ready.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.821
Touch it.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.110
It's very hard.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:42.880
It has to be black, more black,
much more black than that.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.920
OK, if you-- beans.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.490
Beans.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.850
In the southeast of Mexico,
and the south in general,

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.230
we always eat black beans.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.830
In the north, we
always eat brown beans.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.380
Yes, yes.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.900
A little bit of olive oil.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.315
You have to help
yourselves from here.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:24.730
And you can have
your achiote ready.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:30.140
Once you dirty your
blender, you buy

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.940
a big piece of achiote
paste, and roast garlic,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.680
and fresh garlic, and
dry roasted cinnamon,

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.730
and pepper, and oregano--
everything blended

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.520
with vinegar.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.895
And you make a paste,
like a lighter paste.

00:25:45.895 --> 00:25:51.865
Put it in your fridge, and
you keep it there for months.

00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:54.350
That's it.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.966
Yes.

00:25:54.966 --> 00:25:55.841
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:02.248 --> 00:26:03.706

MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Oh, yes.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.480
We ate a lot of fish.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.339
Yes.

00:26:09.339 --> 00:26:10.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:17.650
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: Well, it

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.490
was before the Spaniards came.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:28.190
It was in the 1900s--
no, the 1500s.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.880
But then they came, and they
brought all the animals.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.695
So they mixed.

00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:36.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:45.650
MARGARITA CARRILLO
ARRONTE: I'm not-- well,

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.360
we have a different
system of eating.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.619
What we do, we have a
very good breakfast--

00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:52.660
not coffee and doughnuts.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:58.130
We have eggs, beans,
a heavy breakfast.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.000
And then just a lunch--
you know, chicken.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.200
Kids take to school a
sandwich, or something.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.770
Then we have a very heavy meal
at lunch time, 3:00-- 2:00

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:17.500
or 3:00 in the afternoon-- but
heavy soup, vegetables, fish,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.570
whatever, dessert,
and everything.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.870
And then in the
evening, a light dinner.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:29.640
We have like a quesadilla, or
a bowl of cereal, or a yogurt,

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.760
or something light
in the evening.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.970
It's a different system.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.650
But the most important
meal is-- yes,

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:43.030
and we have fish, and a
lot of vegetables, yes.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.710
But please, it's getting cold.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.980
So I don't know, what's
the mechanic here?

OK, there are plates.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.610
And please help yourselves.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.200
Otherwise it's going to be--

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.000

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.850
