00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.716
- It is obviously a thrill
and a real honor to be here

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:10.100
with all of you, with you Jack,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.745
and recognizing not only
your accomplishments

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:16.398
but obviously all your family
has done for the country,

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:18.403
and with Mayor Brown.

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:21.761
There is no time, that
at least I can remember,

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.844
in American life, when the sacrifices

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.508
of what public servants do
every day has been more obvious

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:32.303
than in the last month or so,

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:36.005
so thank you and obviously, to you Jack,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.362
for all the contributions of
your family to American life.

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.945
For me being here today,
I think symbolizes

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:48.599
not so much my own or BPI's own

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.478
accomplishments or achievements,

00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:56.561
but finally after many
years, after a generation,

00:00:57.764 --> 00:01:01.264
the central civil rights issue of our time

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.586
in the United States
finally coming to the fore

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.509
in the public imagination.

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.328
And I can't imagine a better
place for that to happen

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:15.455
than the John F. Kennedy Library,

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.872
who obviously above all else,

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:22.851
John Kennedy in the last
100 years of American life,

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:27.018
symbolized to Americans an idea
of optimism for the future,

00:01:28.837 --> 00:01:30.997
and a sense that we had the capacity

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:33.247
to achieve things together.

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:37.951
And yet, over the last 30 or 40 years,

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:42.102
our biggest investment
domestically in American life

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.582
has not been in the things which someone

00:01:44.582 --> 00:01:47.499
like President Kennedy prioritized.

00:01:48.372 --> 00:01:52.539
In education, in healthcare,
in housing, or civil rights.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:57.359
Our largest investment
has been in punishment,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.727
particularly in prisons.

00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:03.810
And over the course of
someone my age's lifetime,

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:07.249
or Mayor Brown's lifetime,

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.666
we have at the municipal
level, the state level,

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.833
and the national level,
incarcerated more and more people

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.752
for longer and longer periods of time,

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:21.186
often at younger and younger ages,

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:25.546
and for smaller and smaller
infractions of the law.

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.546
And we've done that and made prisons

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:33.603
the central public
institution in our lives,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:38.108
in our civic lives, and we've
done that and simultaneously

00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:41.452
gone out of our way to
make those prisons worse.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:44.621
Make them less hopeful,
make them places where

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:47.878
less can be achieved for people
in prison and their families

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:52.045
and their communities during
incarceration and post release.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.486
So, what we've done at Bard,

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:59.679
as you've seen in this video,
is create an institution

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.203
which was not necessarily innovative.

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:05.127
There was college
opportunity in every state

00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:07.040
and federal prison
across the United States

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.207
for a generation, until 1994,
with the Clinton crime dome.

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:16.517
And so what we've done at
Bard is build an institution

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:20.517
which really sets the
tone and sets the standard

00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:25.670
for the return of real
educational opportunity,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.337
and real hope, and real meaning,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.705
in our prison systems
across the United States.

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:35.468
And the students that
you've seen in these videos,

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.779
it's so important to remember,

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.209
are not analogous to,
are not in someway like,

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.209
but they are exactly the same people

00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:50.214
who our last generation
of most distinguished

00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:53.562
social scientists, and
leaders in governments,

00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:57.868
and in education, described
as super predators.

00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:01.535
Who we built a giant
multi-billion apparatus

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.601
to keep away from us.

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.579
And this cynicism that
was involved in that

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.746
was not limited to some
imaginary terrible people.

00:04:15.457 --> 00:04:17.533
We were all culpable in it,

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:21.185
and the kind of cynicism
that led to those decisions,

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:24.478
I think were not limited
to law enforcement.

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:27.478
They also included the great leaders

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:30.734
of the most important secular,

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.815
liberal institutions in American life.

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:36.482
And those are our
colleges and universities.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:42.954
There is not anyone in
this room who thinks that,

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:47.121
in my opinion, that any of
our college and universities

00:04:48.032 --> 00:04:51.898
are doing what they need to do to prepare

00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:54.660
this next generation of
Americans for the challenges

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.676
we face in the 21st century.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:01.343
So at Bard, our idea
is how do we refashion,

00:05:02.264 --> 00:05:06.080
how do we smash the way
we've done college admission

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.741
in the United States, and engage
as many kinds of Americans

00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:14.657
as we possibly can in the
most ambitious, most rigorous,

00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:19.006
most dignified kind of a
education we possibly could?

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.858
And so the kinds of students you saw here,

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:25.556
just to name a few, our friend Jewel,

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:29.723
who you see released from
prison in this video, decided,

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.664
was so inspired by continental
literature and philosophy,

00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:37.146
decided he wanted to learn German

00:05:37.146 --> 00:05:39.097
so he could read Hegel, and Heideggar

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:41.266
in the original, right?

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:44.558
And Sebastian who you see,
talking in such a beautiful way

00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:47.475
about his inner life in this video,

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:51.717
right now is writing a senior thesis

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:55.985
on the impact of Japan's invasion of Korea

00:05:55.985 --> 00:05:57.772
and that's how that has born out

00:05:57.772 --> 00:05:59.559
in Korean culture over the years.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.696
And at our last BA
graduation, two years ago,

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.478
at Eastern Correctional Facility,

00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:07.061
a full half of those graduates,

00:06:08.376 --> 00:06:12.276
incarcerated men of all
ages, a full half of them,

00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:14.526
were majors in mathematics.

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:19.589
How far does that go to
puncture the liberal prejudice

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:23.488
that's, you find in every part of life,

00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:27.655
of who's interested in what
and who's capable of what.

00:06:29.352 --> 00:06:31.949
And we were very lucky a few years ago,

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.538
we've benefited from the friendship

00:06:33.538 --> 00:06:36.257
of the Archdiocese of New York,

00:06:36.257 --> 00:06:39.180
and we spent some time with the cardinal,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.189
Cardinal Tim Dolan, and he said something

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.553
that I try repeat
virtually everywhere I go.

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:49.303
Which is that the church believes

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:54.371
that God continues
creation through education.

00:06:56.692 --> 00:06:59.391
And as you know, in the Jewish tradition,

00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:03.558
we believe that learning
itself is a form of prayer.

00:07:08.176 --> 00:07:10.694
And when I think of the accomplishments

00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:14.917
of your grandfather, Jack,
and of your accomplishments

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:17.276
already and to come, Mayor Brown,

00:07:17.276 --> 00:07:21.298
I think at this moment in American life,

00:07:21.298 --> 00:07:24.381
when we define success so exclusively

00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:29.384
about how much money or
notoriety we accumulate.

00:07:29.384 --> 00:07:33.551
And greed is the only value
that we share collectively

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.667
as a society, it seems.

00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:40.015
I think it's so important to remember

00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:44.182
that there are things we will
achieve, or fail at together,

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:50.105
politically, but to make
really truly lasting change,

00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:53.653
we need to have the courage
to believe in ourselves,

00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:55.773
and particularly young people,

00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:59.717
and put individuals at
the center of that change.

00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:04.669
And a return to the faith in
education and the power of it

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.956
in our opinion is the best way to do it,

00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:10.395
and the only way for us not to continue,

00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:14.202
and more importantly, not to
repeat the moral catastrophe

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:18.369
that mass incarceration
has become in our lifetime.
