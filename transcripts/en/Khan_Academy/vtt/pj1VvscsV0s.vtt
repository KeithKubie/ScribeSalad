00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.320
Consider f which is defined
for all real numbers.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.881
At what arguments x is f
of x not differentiable?

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:09.380
So to think about
that, I'm actually

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.350
going to try to visualize what
f prime of x must look like.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.960
So I'm going to do f prime
of x in this purple color.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.940
So if we look at f
of x right over here,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.530
it looks like its slope is
pretty much consistently

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.900
negative 2 over this interval
between x equals, I guess,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.380
it's like negative 8
and 1/2 all the way

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.280
up to x equals negative 2.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.780
It looks like the slope
is a constant negative 2.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.170
So if I were to
draw its derivative,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.476
its derivative would
look something like this.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.540
Its derivative looks
something like this.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.570
But then something interesting
happens at x equals negative 2.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.666
Right as we cross x
equals negative 2,

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.290
it looks like the
slope goes from being

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.320
negative to being positive.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.087
And it looks like
right out the get

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.420
go, if I were to estimate the
slope of its tangent line,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.410
it starts changing.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.500
It's not a line anymore.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.670
It's a curve.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.870
The slope of the tangent
line right at this point

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.770
looks like it's
around-- I don't know--

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.830
it looks like it's
around 3 and 1/2.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.440
Because if I were to draw a
tangent line right over here,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.810
it looks like if I move
1 in the x direction,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.560
I move up about 3 and
1/2 in the y direction.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.650
So I'm just trying to,
obviously, estimate it.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.210
So it looks like the
slope goes up to 3 and 1/2

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.710
right when I cross that point.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.240
And then the slope becomes
lower and lower and lower

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.800
all the way until I get to
this point right over here,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.770
all the way until I
get to x equals 2.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.850
And it looks like it continues
to get lower all the way

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.190
until you get to x equals 3.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.120
So it looks like the
slope of the line

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.520
is-- it looks like it's getting
lower at a constant rate,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.780
I guess I could say.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.321
So it looks like
it's doing something

00:01:56.321 --> 00:02:04.130
like this over this interval.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.350
But then right as x crosses
3, this becomes a flat line.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.130
The slope is 0 here.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.030
So right as x crosses
3, the slope becomes 0.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.900
So we immediately
see there are points

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.560
where it looks like
the slope jumps.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540
And at these points
we really don't

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.520
have a defined derivative.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.980
The slope jumps there as well.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.580
And so at what arguments
is f not differentiable?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.180
Well, it's not differentiable
when x is equal to negative 2.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.880
When x is equal to
negative 2, we really

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.320
don't have a slope there.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.090
Remember, when
we're trying to find

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.910
the slope of the
tangent line, we

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.290
take the limit of the
slope of the secant line

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.070
between that point and some
other point on the curve.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.060
If we did that as we
approached from the left,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.710
it looks like the
derivative is negative 2.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.260
If we do that from the right,
it looks like the derivative

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.460
is something like
positive 3 and 1/2.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.490
And so we're not getting the
same limit of the secant line

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.170
as we approach from the left and
as we approach from the right.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.275
And the same thing is
happening at x is equal to 3.

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:11.460
At x equals 3, as we
approach from the left,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.400
the slope looks like
it is decreasing.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.596
It is approaching-- I don't
know-- maybe around negative 1.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.970
But as we approach
from the right

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.660
it looks like the slope is 0.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.590
So we do not have the same
limit of the secant slope

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.940
as we approach from the
left- and right-hand sides.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.530
So at both of these points
we see the derivative jump,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.005
and it looks like f of
x is not differentiable.
