00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.340
Would you like to make some
money with your Android app?

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.580
But things are complicated.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.700
[INAUDIBLE] with credit card
and billing systems, right?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.200
Hi.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm Neto Marin, and I'm
here to help you understand

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
how to use and write
In-app billing in your app,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.170
to make it easier for
you to earn some money.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.690
There are several ways
to monetize your app.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.280
You could show
advertisements with AdMob,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.700
offer upgrades from
a Freemium version

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.100
or pay for premium features,
sell virtual goods.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.200
Also, you could use subscription
model for app or service.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.050
And for some of
these methods, you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.660
can use In-app Billing
to collect your money.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.370
In-app Billing is
a service hosted

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.590
on Google Play that lets you
charge for additional content

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.460
and upgrades in your app.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.650
When you integrate In-app
Billing with your app,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.400
you can use the API to request
product details from Google

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.840
Play, issue orders
for In-app products,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.440
and quickly retrieve
shipping information,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.930
based on a user's
purchase history.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.960
For users, Google
Play provides a check

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.150
out interface that makes user
interactions with the In-app

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.040
Billing service
intuitive and seamless.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.680
The In-app Billing
API does involve

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.860
some rules and best practices.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.310
You can use In-app Billing
only to sell digital products.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.610
For example, we're
talking products

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.360
including coins, extra
lives, special items,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.250
or additional levels.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.570
App features or content
such as ad-free version,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.860
or features that are not
available in the free version.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.140
Subscription services
such as streaming media,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.070
[INAUDIBLE] video, or
other media service.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.130
But there are
other products that

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.740
are not allowed
by In-app Billing,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.850
like retail merchandise
such as groceries, clothing,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.970
housewares, and electronics.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.390
Service fees, including tax
and transportation services,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.920
cleaning, food
delivery, and others.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.140
One time membership
fees or recurring dues,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.920
including gym
memberships, [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.970
or other fiscal products.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.990
One-time payments,
including peer

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.230
to peer payments, online
auctions, and donations.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.166
Or electronic bill payments,
including credit card bills,

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.580
[INAUDIBLE] and cable or
telecommunication services.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.800
For more details
about this policy,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.640
check out our support page.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.450
The first step of
implementing In-app billing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.570
is to define your products,
using the Google Play Developer

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.330
Console, including product
type, SKU, price, and so on.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.920
The Version 3 API supports
manged In-app products

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.170
and subscriptions.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.120
Let's see more details
about each type.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180
Managed In-app
products are items

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.820
that are tracked and
managed by Google Play.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.220
It means that Google
Play stores the purchase

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.260
information for each item.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.570
This information is persistent
all Google Play services,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.700
even if the user
uninstall an application,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.790
or if they change device.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.040
And with the Version 3 API,
you can consume managed items,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.590
and they could be
purchased multiple times.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.730
This is useful if you're
implementing a game,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.810
for example, where the user
can buy currency, food,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.950
or magical potions,
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.240
you are responsible for
provisioning these In-app

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.100
products to the users.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.400
For In-app products that
can only be purchased once,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.510
it's not necessary to
implement consumption,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.890
because after
purchase, these items

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.650
will be permanently associated
to the users Google Account,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.140
like a premium upgrade
or a level pack.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.860
The other type of product
offered for In-app billing

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.210
is subscription.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.280
Subscriptions allow you to sell
content, services, or features

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.190
on a recurring schedule,
with automated billing.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.720
When users purchase
subscription in your app,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.110
Google Play handles
all check out details,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.010
so you never have to process
any financial transactions.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.710
Subscriptions can be offered
for recurring billing,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.270
at your choice of intervals.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.400
Weekly, monthly, 3 month, six
month, annually, and seasonal.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.940
And you can even set
up a free trial period

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940
that lets users try
your subscription

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.060
content before buying it.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.120
Google Play supports free trials
for all subscription types,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.990
including seasonal
subscriptions.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.380
And promotions are a great
way to attract new users,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.060
or engage with users that may
have been away for a while.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.110
With Version 3, you
can use In-app billing

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.820
to create and manage
promo codes for products.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.610
As we can see, In-app
Billing offers many benefits

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.339
for you and your users.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.640
In the next video,
we'll go hands on,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.070
and I will show you how to
define products on Google Play

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.260
Developer Console, implement the
purchase flow, and much more.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.460
If you want to start
exploring on your own,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.740
check out the documentation and
our guide about In-app Billing

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.930
API.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.120
Thanks for watching, and
see you in the next video.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.670
Bye.
