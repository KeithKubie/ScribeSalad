00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.900
So my favorite context aware application is Netflix. So,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.930
I use the smartphone application to scroll through content

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.880
and find what I want to watch. Then I Chromecast

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.946
it to my TV. The application understands that context

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:14.913
switch. So my smartphone application then becomes my remote

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:17.309
control, as I'm focused on watching the content on

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.440
my TV. It's really cool how it switches between

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.885
a media player, and a remote control depending on

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:22.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.240
&gt;&gt; What you're doing with it.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; And my favorite context aware app

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.680
is, Agent. We mentioned this earlier. It's a fantastic

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.060
application that takes advantage of, really processing those signals

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.340
that are generated by a whole bunch of sensors.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.650
And making sense of them, so that I don't get

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.220
disturbed when I'm sleeping, when I'm in meetings and,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.020
and on and on. Not only that, but it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.800
uses location sensors and it even tells me where

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840
I might have parked my car. Which is really cool.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.010
&gt;&gt; And the, and the, and the coolest thing

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.020
is, I don't even have to interact with this application,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.180
for it to work for me. Which is another thing I love about it.
