we have a lot of activity going on at
Harvard at the present time but it's

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
Harvard at the present time but it's
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.330
Harvard at the present time but it's
hard to judge how many people are

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340
hard to judge how many people are
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.600
hard to judge how many people are
employed full-time or part-time by the

encyclopedia project we anticipate we'll

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
encyclopedia project we anticipate we'll
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.980
encyclopedia project we anticipate we'll
be able to draw down about 30 million

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990
be able to draw down about 30 million
 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.200
be able to draw down about 30 million
from grants that are mainly from the

from grants that are mainly from the

MacArthur um but I looking ahead a bit I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
MacArthur um but I looking ahead a bit I
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.310
MacArthur um but I looking ahead a bit I
would say maybe if you if you want a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
would say maybe if you if you want a
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.450
would say maybe if you if you want a
round figure I'd say about a hundred

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
round figure I'd say about a hundred
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.590
round figure I'd say about a hundred
people are a full-time or a large part

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
people are a full-time or a large part
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.470
people are a full-time or a large part
of part time and I would expect that to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
of part time and I would expect that to
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.549
of part time and I would expect that to
expand as funding becomes available and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
expand as funding becomes available and
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.709
expand as funding becomes available and
we really get onto the logarithmic stay

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
we really get onto the logarithmic stay
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810
we really get onto the logarithmic stay
on essays you know of the doing the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
on essays you know of the doing the
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.900
on essays you know of the doing the
mapping of the world but I would expect

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
mapping of the world but I would expect
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.940
mapping of the world but I would expect
that probably eventually a couple of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950
that probably eventually a couple of
 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130
that probably eventually a couple of
thousand it'll be a big science project

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
thousand it'll be a big science project
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.470
thousand it'll be a big science project
but I don't think it will compare in any

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
but I don't think it will compare in any
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.569
but I don't think it will compare in any
way in dollars spent to most of our

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
way in dollars spent to most of our
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.170
way in dollars spent to most of our
major space program it probably would be

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
major space program it probably would be
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390
major space program it probably would be
comparable to what was spent for the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
comparable to what was spent for the
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.920
comparable to what was spent for the
human genome project in ultimately it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
human genome project in ultimately it
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.320
human genome project in ultimately it
would be a couple of billion dollars

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390
