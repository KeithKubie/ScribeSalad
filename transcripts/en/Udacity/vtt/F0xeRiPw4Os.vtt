00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.301
Problem solving is extremely important to us, because not a day goes by that we

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.962
don't have to implement some type of problem solving strategy. Every test we do

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:12.260
that we don't necessarily know how to do forces us to solve a problem. There

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.152
are many strategies to solve different kinds of problems. For example, basic

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:21.700
mathematical problems use algorithms. And algorithms are step by step formulas

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.222
or procedures used to solve a problem. For example, you use an algorithm when

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:32.049
you're trying to do long division. These step by step procedures work really

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.452
well when there's a clear, yet unknown solution to a problem, these kinds of

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:40.852
problems are called, convergent problems. They have a known solution and your

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:46.393
thinking has to converge or narrow down on the correct solution. Other problems

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:51.746
have no known solution, or many different solutions. These are called Divergent

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.909
problems. This requires thinking that broadens and diverges to come up with a

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.611
possible solution. Now for these kinds of problems, A good strategy to use is

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:07.208
insight or the Eureka strategy. This involves lots of thinking, you might be

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:10.897
stumped for a little while, put the problem aside for a little while. Then all

00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:14.486
of a sudden the solution will just hit you. The problem to this, is it can't be

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:16.753
taught, like algorythms can.
