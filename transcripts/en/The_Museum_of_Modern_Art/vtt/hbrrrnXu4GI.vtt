00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.830
We are on the sixth floor at the Museum of
Modern Art, in the exhibition “Louise Lawler:

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:13.110
WHY PICTURES NOW” which covers the 40-year
artistic vision of the American artist, Louise

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.800
Lawler, who came of age in the late 1970s
as part of the Pictures Generation and currently

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.970
she's one of the most influential women artists,
known for her sustained feminist, antiwar,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
as well as collaborative and relational aspects
of her work.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.300
Louise Lawler's work is very much involved
with taking pictures of other artists' works

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.090
in private home collections, museums, and
bringing a certain lens and institutional

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.489
critique about how works are being presented,
how they are being displayed, what is the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.600
context and meaning and user value of artworks
once they leave the artist's studio.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.750
I think that one of the most interesting aspects
of her work is the way that she's constantly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.280
reframing, restaging, and repositioning her
work in the present, moving from photographs

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.990
to very little works that are paperweights
to tracings and to works that she calls "adjusted

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.900
to fit," which are works that are being stretched
and expanded to fit precisely the wall on

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.390
which they are being displayed.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:41.110
In 1988, Louise Lawler took a photograph at
an auction house, because what I should mention

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.180
is that, in fact, Lawler photographs, takes
her pictures in various contexts, in museums,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.780
in auction houses, in storage spaces, and
in collectors' homes, understanding how art,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.530
once it leaves the artist's studio, is being
used and that its meaning changes in function

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.300
of its used value.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.440
This picture was taken in 1988 at Christie's,
when a very important art collection, the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.560
Tremaine collection, was being auctioned and
one of the most iconic works at that auction

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.709
was this piece by Andy Warhol, which was the
round, golden Marilyn Monroe.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.620
In fact, what is interesting with Lawler is
how she contextualizes the photograph.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.130
And you can see here there is even the original
label from the auction house, which even indicates

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.840
the price for which the piece was being auctioned.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.740
The piece is rendered at the exact same size
as the original, 17 inches in diameter, but

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.640
the most interesting aspect of this work is
the relationship between titles and images.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.230
The work is titled "Does Marilyn Monroe Make
You Cry?"

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:18.840
An absolutely identical piece, which is right
across from this one, is titled "Does Andy

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.160
Warhol Make You Cry?"

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.540
So two images, absolutely identical with two
different titles, provoke different receptions

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.540
in the viewer.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:40.170
One obviously is referring to a very well-known
pop artist, a real author, the other one,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.890
to an iconic dead movie star.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.739
So the effective relationship is quite different,
although the image is the same and that is

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.720
only... the only difference is implied in
the title itself.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.129
This whole idea of theory of reception is
equally important to Lawler's works because

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.299
it understands that art, in fact, depends
on the framework on which it is presented,

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:13.610
that its meaning changes, morphs, shifts in
function of who looks at it and the reaction

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.220
that you have towards it.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.009
This is this photograph that is called "War
is Terror."

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.990
It is one of her most antiwar pieces.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.659
But the title obviously plays with the expression
or the term “War on Terror" that was devised

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:43.599
by the George W. Bush administration following
the September 11, 2001 attacks.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:51.330
Here, Lawler switches that preposition and
makes it active, "war is terror," rather than

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.349
“War on Terror," giving it a sense of urgency.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:02.349
This picture was shot actually in the guest
room of a private home in France, outside

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:11.919
of Avignon, where the owners decided to install
a photograph of Julia Margaret Cameron's from

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.059
1869 of her niece, Julia Jackson.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:25.339
Julia Jackson would eventually have seven
children, including the painter, Vanessa Bell,

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.349
and the author, Virginia Woolf.

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:36.339
Lawler is placing an emphasis on this kind
of a matriarchal lineage, pointing on one

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:44.939
hand to the strength of Julia Margaret Cameron
as the first, one of the earliest women photographers

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:52.680
to receive critical acclaim, then the antiwar
views of Virginia Woolf.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.309
She's basically kind of bringing together
both historic and contemporary strains of

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:00.740
feminism and pacifism.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.680
This is "Salon Hodler."

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:12.499
It is a photograph that Lawler actually took
in Switzerland in a private home of a private

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:22.219
collector and it shows the diptych love by
the Swiss artist, Ferdinand Hodler, at the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.249
turn of the 20th century.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:32.940
This exhibition, in fact, relishes on these
different types of looking, of moving from

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:41.580
"Salon Hodler" being perceived as a regular
photograph, a direct viewing experience that

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:49.750
you would have of direct rapport versus this
kind of jewel-like paperweight or rather like

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.050
a peephole viewing experience, where you have
to just lean and look into it.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.340
It's a one-to-one relationship, extremely
intimate.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:06.189
And here is "Salon Hodler," rendered just
as a tracing on a different scale and emptied

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:08.930
out of color.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.620
It has a very different feeling to it, more
like a drawing of sorts.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:20.470
She collaborated on them together with the
artist and illustrator John Buller.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:28.039
They have this very ghostly presence because
all that is being done is the outline of her

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:30.029
photographs that is being rendered.

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:35.210
They are devoid of any kind of color and look
more like coloring books.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:42.699
This idea of continuous representation of
reappropriation of her own work is absolutely

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:44.999
critical to Lawler's work.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:53.159
An image that you find in a photograph can
sort of morph into another image as tiny as

00:07:53.159 --> 00:08:00.289
a paperweight or as large as an adjusted to
fit work or as ghostly as a tracing.
