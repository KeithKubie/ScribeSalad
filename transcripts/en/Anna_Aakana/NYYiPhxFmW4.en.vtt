00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Growing up I always wondered what my super power would be,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.500
would it be telepathy?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.040
- (cat's mind) Fish

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.160
- (cat's mind) Fish

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.520
Fish Dude you already ate. - (cat's mind) Fish? - Hungress I don't have any

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:11.525
(cat's mind) Fish!

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:13.385
(cat's mind) fish...

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.115
(cat's mind) fish, fish, fish.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.655
Telepathy when you're a cat owner sucks - (cat's mind) fish - would it be time travelling?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.440
Todays video is sponsored by ChromeBook.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.780
Awww I've made so many branded babies with ChromeBook, what video is this?

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:29.760
How to get stuff done. [sigh] Our first collab.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.075
The next one is about being prolific it's pretty dope.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.605
Thanks girl! Are you from the future you look really good? Technically...

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.965
I'm the present and you're the past but thanks! I'm 40 now.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.465
Wait what. Perhaps telekinesis.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:45.945
Move.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:49.395
Like... Like here?

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:51.395
Little to the left.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.325
Here? - Little to the right.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:57.275
Just... Just tell me when.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:00:58.945
Keep going.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:00.805
Keep going.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:03.575
Anytime soon?

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:08.485
Ehh never mind just put it back where it was. But instead I got the greatest...

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.375
superpower of them all, prolificness.

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:14.475
Which I think is uh much more useful that telepathy cause  [chuckles]

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.985
I don't wanna know what goes on in anyones head, no thank you. First thing...

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:21.025
is having a clear vision. The new year is coming up...

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:24.165
which is the perfect time to outline your goals.

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:26.880
I love goal setting! You wanna think big picture.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840
My favourite way of doing this is either by a vision board or a...

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
bubble map, because it's a constant visual reminder of...

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:35.715
what you're trying to achieve long-term. And if you're like me...

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.435
and you get kinda in the motions of everyday tasks or...

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.355
you get really easily distracted and somehow lose hours and hours of your time.

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:44.355
It is very helpful to see a representation of your end product...

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:47.435
on a day to day basis. And with ChromeBook's ability to be a...

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:50.455
Laptop, tablet and tent, you can be productive, creative...

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:53.425
and restful, all without leaving the couch. For up to 10...

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.105
hours cause of that super sweet battery. Next...

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:59.115
commit to doing just a little bit each day. When you think of...

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.955
progress, imagine a bunch of cups in-front of you. Everyday...

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.895
you wanna do what you can to push each of these cups just...

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.800
a little bit forward. Somedays you'll push one a tremendous...

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
amount and that's awesome. But you never wanna get caught up with where that...

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.480
cup is and forget all about your other cups. So for me, this means...

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.575
scheduling even just 10 minutes a day to work on something...

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.255
is better than not working on it at all. Whether you put...

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.615
that in your Google Cal or keep a daily habit tracker, do not...

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:25.245
underestimate the power of a little bit every...

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.205
day. And if some of your goals involve other collaborators, I...

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:31.375
highly recommend streamlining the process, by creating a...

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:34.105
executable actions list for both of you. I am...

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:36.545
an avid user of Google Docs, not just because of it's sharing...

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.405
capability for people that I work with but if I am in...

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:42.205
someplace with no wi-fi, I can still edit offline and re...

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:45.255
sync when I connect to cat kingdom. And the final secret...

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:47.105
to being prolific is being persistent.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.755
Give your goals permission to take time cause when you're in it...

00:02:50.755 --> 00:02:53.815
for the long haul, your mindset is more geared towards fun.

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.755
You're less likely to be burnt-out if you just tackle little...

00:02:56.755 --> 00:02:59.545
pieces each day. And you'll be inspired by your vision...

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:02.475
of the future. I wanna say thank you again to ChromeBook for sponsoring...

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:05.425
todays video. The ChromeBook is sleek and lightweight...

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:08.485
it starts up in seconds and is fast, and my dad is...

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.475
constantly harassing me to give him mine. If you would like to learn more about

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:14.485
ChromeBook you can click on the link in the description below. I'm Anna Akana...

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:15.485
and Hungress is purring.
