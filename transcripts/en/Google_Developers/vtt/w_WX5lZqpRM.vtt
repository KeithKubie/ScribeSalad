00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:08.380
MALE SPEAKER: So welcome
back at Devoxx.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.420
I'm here today with
Chet and Romain.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.800
And we're here to talk
about, well, Android.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.190
Hi, guys.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.010
You've been here many years,
and this time, this year,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.220
you're here with a gift.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.250
You came with a present,
and it's 4.2.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.090
You actually made the release
for the conference.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.970
CHET HAASE: Just for Devoxx.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.980
MALE SPEAKER: Yes,
I know you did.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.020
ROMAIN GUY: And not just us, but
a lot of people back home.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.230
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.730
You're just representing
all of them.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.530
So 4.2 has a number of
end user features.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.882
Do you want to mention a few and
do you want to maybe show

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:38.310
the device?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.020
ROMAIN GUY: --show the device
to the camera here.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.440
So one of the biggest new
features is multiple users,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.680
only for tablets at the moment,
but you can create

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.220
multiple accounts, and each
account has its own settings,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.460
its own applications, everything
is separate.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.210
MALE SPEAKER: But you do
share applications.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.130
ROMAIN GUY: Yes, you
can install the--

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.070
yes and no--

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.640
if you install the same
applications on two accounts,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.470
we share the data.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.350
But it's different
applications--

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.260
applications are linked
to your account,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.150
to your Google account.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.130
CHET HAASE: But it doesn't have
to get downloaded twice

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.240
for two different users.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.990
MALE SPEAKER: So that's
a good thing.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.760
ROMAIN GUY: We do have widgets
on the lock screen, so the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.680
same widgets that you love on
the home screen, you can

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560
install them on the lock
screen as well.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.300
So you don't have to unlock the
device before you can do

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.995
something, like check your
calendar or listen to a song.

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:22.190
MALE SPEAKER: So you have access
to the camera as well

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.480
from the home screen?

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.480
ROMAIN GUY: On the
phones, yes.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.540
You have access to the camera.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.440
MALE SPEAKER: And do you want to
talk about the new features

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.435
in the Phone?

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:29.310
CHET HAASE: We can do that.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.020
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sorry, the
new camera features on the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.090
phone, or the camera
in general.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.060
CHET HAASE: So there's a couple
of features that are

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.960
worth calling out.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080
One is HD--

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.765
HD?

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:40.300
ROMAIN GUY: HDR.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.935
CHET HAASE: HDR.

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.280
I'm not a camera person.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.070
HDR.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.710
So you can take--

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.740
ROMAIN GUY: We invited
that guy?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.720
CHET HAASE: Why don't
you explain it?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.930
You're the camera person.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.250
I'll talk about Photo Sphere.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.360
ROMAIN GUY: So yes, we
have HDR on devices

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.515
that support it.

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:53.180
It's a high dynamic range.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.320
It helps you to takes picture,
when you have a high contrast

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.860
in the scene--

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.970
for instance, you have a backlit
person or backlit

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.300
scene, you can use HDR to bring
back all the details

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.360
that are in the shadows
or in the highlights.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.900
It works amazingly well.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.570
We also have the Photo Sphere.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.850
It's an extension of panoramas,
but now they are a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.710
full 360 degrees, so
a real sphere.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.220
And you generate photo, so just
a simple JPG that you can

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.950
share with anybody, but we have
special players on the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.940
phone and on Google+ online.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.800
And you have this interactive 3D
panorama, and you can play

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.470
with it and look around
and have this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.450
3D feel of the scenes.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.250
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I've used it.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.960
It's awesome.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.100
And I've seen people play
with it here, and--

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.690
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah, it's a lot of
fun to take those pictures.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.090
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a lot of fun.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.620
So quick settings--

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.980
there are few other features.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.720
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah, we have
a lot of other features.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.600
There's the new keyboard we have
just for typing so now

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.505
you just have to swipe
over the letters.

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:42.230
It's actually impressing,
like, it's amazing--

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.980
CHET HAASE: It's amazingly
accurate.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.410
You spell out these sentences
by gesturing.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.360
You think you're missing things
and it just interprets

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.780
the right word.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.485
It's really incredible.

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:52.270
MALE SPEAKER: So these are all
end user features, so we all

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.890
benefit from that.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470
What about developer features?

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.900
So I hear those things
about being able to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.630
drive a second display?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.020
CHET HAASE: Right.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.850
So we've got multiple displays,
and this is

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.110
interesting in a couple
of different ways.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.850
First of all, you can have
a multiple display.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.060
You can plug-in through say HDMI
to an external display

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.750
and the application can detect
all the displays that are

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.310
currently configured on the
device and can detect when

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.660
they're plugged in and
when they're removed.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.780
And then it can choose to play
different content on that

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.940
other display.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.650
And if it's protected content,
then you'll want to know that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.090
it's a secure line and secure
stream to that other device,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.150
and so you can query and say,
is this going to be a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910
protected stream?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.030
And then there's also the
ability to, on the Nexus 4, to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.800
play through wireless to HDMI.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.915
So you can have a wireless
HDMI connection through a

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.620
dongle that's a separate device
that you then attach to

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.960
your display device, your TV,
and then you can actually play

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.250
HDMI, but it's just going
wireless the whole time.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.230
And it looks like any other
external display device.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630
MALE SPEAKER: So from a
developer perspective, I have

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.080
two screens.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.290
It's not just mirroring
the exact same screen.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.690
ROMAIN GUY: No.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.150
By default it will
do the mirroring.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.680
But the application can request
to not do that.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.510
And then it's like you create
a simple dialog on the other

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.060
screen and you can use your
normal views, you draw with

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.980
OpenGL if you want.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.060
You can do anything you want
with that second display.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.480
MALE SPEAKER: So use cases
would be, of course,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.519
presenting, having a presenter
console, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.997
ROMAIN GUY: A great example is
what we ship today, the Play

00:04:18.997 --> 00:04:21.750
Movies application, we play
the movie on the second

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.060
display and on your home device,
on the host, on the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.670
host, on the tablet or the
phone, you see the play

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.950
controls, so you can
pause, play, seek.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.790
And you only see the movie
on the other display.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.525
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:36.320
Do you want to talk about
Daydream and what that is?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.320
CHET HAASE: Daydream's our new
screensaver-ish thing.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.140
You can create, these
applications that can play

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.900
when the screen times out.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.140
And so you can see beautiful
things, like the photos in

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.070
Gallery that are wafting by on
the screen, but they can also

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.790
be interactive.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.020
So if you actually want to--
some of those screensavers

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.690
that we ship are interactive.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.530
Like there's a photo table, you
see the photos going by,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.090
and you can tap on one of the
photos and it'll expand in,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.220
expand out, you can fling
it out of the way.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.050
There's another one
that's Currents--

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.495
it's a reader application.

00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:09.490
ROMAIN GUY: Yeah, it shows you
the news from your feeds.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.550
And if you see news that you're
interested in, you can

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.660
tap on it and you get more
details about it.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.320
And of course, it's
a public API, so

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.340
anybody can write a Daydream.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.280
It's very easy to do.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.000
It's very similar to writing
an activity or a normal

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.080
application.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.550
Again, you can do whatever
you want to.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.400
You have views, you have OpenGL,
you have the canvas.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.320
Very easy to do.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.570
CHET HAASE: You always wondered
what was happening on

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.700
your Android device
when it went to

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.985
sleep and now you know.

00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:32.600
MALE SPEAKER: Now I know.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800
Of course, so if it wasn't
obvious for people listening,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.150
this is an update to Jelly
Bean, so this is 4.2.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.540
Who is getting the
update and when?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.870
Do you know?

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.470
ROMAIN GUY: So [INAUDIBLE] has
already started yesterday for

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.420
Nexus and Nexus 7, and the Nexus
10 and the Nexus 4 are

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.270
coming out with 4.2
pre-installed.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.230
And the source code is available
in the Android Open

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.930
Source project.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.380
MALE SPEAKER: It's been
rolled out, or

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.310
maybe it's there already.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.280
ROMAIN GUY: It's
already there.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.090
CHET HAASE: The SDK came
out yesterday.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.570
ROMAIN GUY: The SDK
is available.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.250
The SDK, actually there's
a change in the SDK.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.690
We now bundle, the
ID in the SDK.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.130
So one download, you have
to plug-in the ID--

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.680
the SDK, all the tools,
everything is in one bundle.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.680
MALE SPEAKER: And this is
all synced on level 17?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.320
ROMAIN GUY: It's all
synced on level 17.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.930
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.100
MALE SPEAKER: Anything else you
want to point out from a

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.990
developer prospective or 4.2?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.880
ROMAIN GUY: Download of the
[INAUDIBLE] things--

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.480
we publish API difs, so you
can see the differences

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.843
between this new API level
and the previous one.

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:28.780
Go check it out--

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.060
a lot of little changes that
can be very useful to you.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.010
They're not big features so
we're not calling them out

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.200
here, but they might save your
life when you're writing your

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.240
applications.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.490
CHET HAASE: We also spent about
an hour talking about

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.510
this just a couple hours ago,
and that talk will hopefully

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.020
be available on [INAUDIBLE]
sometime soon.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.800
So there's a lot more detail,
especially about

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.740
the developer features.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.730
MALE SPEAKER: I also want to
take this chance to applaud

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.710
Google Developer Live.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.680
We have developer advocates
running office hours and

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.700
presenting and they will be
spending some time on the new

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.580
version of Android, of 4.2
in the coming weeks.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.340
So check out developers.googl
e.com/live/android.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.260
So, thanks guys.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.560
CHET HAASE: Thanks

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.110
ROMAIN GUY: Thanks
