00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.636
If you happened
to hear your angry uncle

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.805
banging his head
against a shed earlier,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.106
it's because tonight at the DNC,

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.341
Hillary Clinton
officially accepted

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.675
her historic nomination
for president.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.311
Jack, roll the clip!

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.147
-â™ª
-(laughter)

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:21.288
(cheers and applause)

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.630
Prepare
for <i>Game of Thron</i> pun.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.266
I can't believe she still
hasn't gotten in trouble

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.034
for Bran-ghazi!

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.869
-Oh. You guys.
-(audience groaning)

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:37.538
I know. So long ago.

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.507
And to add insult to injury for
the GOP, she ended her speech

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.743
by pouring wine
on Carly Fiorina's face.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:47.014
But, hey, Bernie Sanders seems
to be taking it well.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.785
(laughter)

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.721
(applause)

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.828
When he hit the ground,
he actually shattered

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.565
into a pile
of Werther's Originals. Uh...

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.267
(laughter)

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.204
Comedians, now that Hillary has
claimed the Dems' throne,

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.972
what's a good slogan
for Hillary

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.074
of House Clinton,
first of her name?

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.342
Mike Birbiglia, go.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.411
Uh, it'd be, like,
a bumper sticker.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.213
It says, like,
"Hillary Clinton.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.415
You guys remember
when Obama hugged me?"

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.950
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yup.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.985
Yup.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.088
(applause)

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.724
Gillian Jacobs, who is
struggling with her voice.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.328
Hillary--
literally, the only option.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.996
(laughter)

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.364
-(applause and cheering)
-HARDWICK: Your voice is good!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.132
BIRBIGLIA:
It is good.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.434
She couldn't talk
before the show.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.635
BIRBIGLIA:
Earlier today,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.337
she couldn't talk,
and then I realized,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.540
-she just doesn't want
to talk to me. -(laughter)

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.976
That's so weird. Everyone I meet
doesn't have a voice.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.511
-I don't understand.
-(laughter)

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.513
Tami?

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.715
Hillary--
breaking glass ceilings

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:56.950
since before Trump's third wife
was born.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:57.050
-HARDWICK: Yes, perfect!
-BIRBIGLIA: Oh.
