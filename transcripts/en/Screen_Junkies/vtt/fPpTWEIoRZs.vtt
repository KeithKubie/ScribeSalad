00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.140
From the director of Suicide Squad,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.100
the writer of Victor Frankenstein,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.080
and Trigger Warning Entertainment

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.540
comes an allegory about race relations

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.360
from the director of Suicide Squad,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.920
the writer of Victor Frankenstein,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.560
and Trigger Warning Entertainment.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.260
"Fairy lives don't matter today."

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.320
This is gonna be a bumpy ride, huh?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.040
Log into Netflix,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.440
your first choice for prestige television

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.180
and last choice for movies,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.060
to see a film that would've crushed at the box office

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.740
if buying a ticket were the same as something autoplaying after you pass out during Mindhunter.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.980
Don't lie, Netflix.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.960
I woke up to an Adam Sandler movie once.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.940
Those views don't count.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.100
See Will Smith like you've never seen him before,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.300
not as the wild card cop with a by-the-book partner from Bad Boys,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.280
or the wild card cop with a by-the-book partner from Men in Black,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.100
or the wild card cop with a by-the-book partner from I, Robot,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.440
or a wild card soldier with a by-the-book partner in Independence Day,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.840
or a wild card ex-soldier with a by-the-book partner in Wild Wild West,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.420
or a wild card mercenary with a by-the-book partner in Suicide Squad,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.820
but a wild card cop with a by-the-book partner...

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.500
who's...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.240
an...

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.260
orc.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.540
Whoa!

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.880
Explore a movie that's more than a cop drama

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.460
It's a...

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.960
*laughs*

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.900
complicated social metaphor that...

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.800
*clears throat*

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.320
explores what it means to be human.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.000
"We gonna titty-bar-gunfight-die."

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.280
*wheeze*

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.140
Sorry, couldn't keep it in there.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.540
Blending tired fantasy tropes with tired buddy cop tropes to explore a world of racial allegories.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.900
Where orcs are stand-ins for the historical mistreatment of black people.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.540
And... that's pretty much it.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.520
Orcs are black people and one of 'em is a cop.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.580
"I need to know if you're a cop first, or an orc first."

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.940
If the movie has anything else to say, I guess it's that Mexicans are scary?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.940
Yeah, this ain't Get Out.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.260
You've never seen a premise this interesting get so squandered.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.020
Where all of the creative possibilities of a fantasy world being part of our own for 2,000 years...

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.360
everything turned out EXACTLY the same.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.660
No seriously, our history is the same...

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.800
"Mexicans still get s*** for the f***in' Alamo"

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.020
Our businesses are the same...

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.220
"We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla."

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.940
Even our pop culture didn't change!

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.820
"Take your fat Shrek lookin' ass back to Fiona!"

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.440
How does Shrek still exist?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.620
Is it a documentary?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.380
There's dragons flying around but our buildings never changed?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000
What's this centaur cop doing?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.480
They never even mention that!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.420
You can't just add the word 'magic' and claim it's any different from a normal cop movie!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.520
"Magic Task Force."

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.380
"Right, the magic feds!"

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.460
*angrily yelling*

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.060
So gear up for the film that got burned by critics for either being too woke, or not woke enough.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.940
But wasted the cool premise of a modern day fantasy world,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.780
none of which will matter to Netflix.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.700
Because with an infinite amount of money, you can greenlight an infinite amount of stupid ideas

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.860
to keep an infinite number of people from ever going to a theater again.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.600
Welp, we had a good run movies.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.100
Now to never leave the house!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.120
Two reporters track down a story but one of them is a Balrog, which means she's Filipino!

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.580
A mild mannered vampire inherits a coffee shop, but there's a twist: Vampires are Guatemalan!

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.340
And uh, a frost giant... but he's a Jew.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.860
Now that one, that could be my Star Wars.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.440
Aw, she's alright, she's ok!

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.680
C'mon, everyone clap, if you believe!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.320
Oh no, she's dead.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.820
