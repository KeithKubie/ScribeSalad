00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.860
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.660
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.640
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.930
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.460
meet up with a Googler
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.930
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.990
and why they do it.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.740
And today, we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.000
Welcome to "Coffee
With A Googler."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
Today, I'm meeting
with Ryan Troll,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.760
who's a technical team lead.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.570
He's responsible for helping
you build better, faster,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.800
safer secure login systems.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.190
Welcome, Ryan, and thanks
for joining us today.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.710
RYAN TROLL: Glad to be here.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.126
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So tell us, what

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:39.370
is it that you do at Google?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.578
RYAN TROLL: I work with
teams around the globe trying

00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:44.100
to make sure that you, and only
you, sign into your account.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.890
We try to keep the attackers
out, and as a side effect,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160
keep your data as
safe as possible.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: So how is
it you go about doing that?

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.680
Can you share a little bit?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.420
RYAN TROLL: Sure.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.919
We look at everything we can
try to determine whether or not

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.344
it's really you signing in.

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:57.760
We can't go into
too many details,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.117
because, well-- the attackers
are listening as well.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:01.700
But we'll give an
example that's easy,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.610
that everybody can understand.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.510
Where'd you grow up?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
grew up in Ireland.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.090
RYAN TROLL: Ireland.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.330
So let's say that
one of your relatives

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.950
who's currently still in Ireland
travels to visit you here

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.520
in the States, and they come
to Google while they're here

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.900
to read their Gmail.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.800
As they start to sign
in, we'll look at that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.008
and say, well, you know what?

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.316
This person's never visited
the States before, never

00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.690
signed in from here before,
or they've done it very, very

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.620
infrequently.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.120
We should ask a few
other questions,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.080
make sure it's really them.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.740
So we look at
patterns, et cetera,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.070
like that, to make sure that the
person logging is really them.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.210
This way, we would stop
an attacker in the States

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.640
from trying to, in this case,
log in as your relative.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.940
RYAN TROLL: Now, we've invested
a lot of time and energy

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.805
into making sure that
our web sign-in flows.

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:45.550
The thing you see every day
when you go to log into Gmail

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.182
are as secure as possible, and
revolving that day in, day out.

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:51.640
However, it's a
little harder to do

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.307
that for our programmatic
sign-in flows.

00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:55.265
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what
makes it so difficult

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.580
to do programmatic access?

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.430
RYAN TROLL:
Programmatically access

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.150
does not offer a
web interface for us

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.380
to extend and expand to allow
users to provide extra data.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.940
So, let's do a little
history lesson here.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
love history lessons.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.040
RYAN TROLL: Great.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: Bring it on.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.840
RYAN TROLL: Years
ago, we-- we, Google--

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.340
decided to offer a
bunch of public APIs

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.547
and allow users to begin to
write really rich applications.

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:16.880
These could be web applications.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.030
Nowadays, they're
smartphone applications.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660
We wanted those applications
be able to have access

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.210
to your calendar, contacts,
personal data, et cetera.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.910
In order to do that,
those applications

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.480
had to be able to run as you.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.340
The easy way to do that was to
give that application your name

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.230
and password, and that
application would provide

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410
that name and password
to Google through an API

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.540
we called client login, and
in return, get a credential

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.730
they could use to
access your data.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280
This has worked for years.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.280
Many, many, many applications
have built on top of that.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.630
Many, many attackers have used
that to maliciously gain access

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.700
to accounts as well, because
it's an easy way to script

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.840
turning, comparing a
username and password

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.590
and make sure it's correct.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.470
We can look at that
request coming in,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.000
and maybe decide that we
don't want to service it,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.950
because we think it
might be an abuser.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.030
But all we can do,
programmatically, is say no.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.550
We can't go and ask further
additional questions.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.860
This is a bit of a problem.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.410
It's something we
can do on the web,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.910
but we can't do it
programmatically.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.869
Got it.

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:16.556
Now, you mentioned
client login there,

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.639
and I know client login
is something that has been

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.152
recently deprecated, right?

00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:21.860
RYAN TROLL: Three
years ago, we announced

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.151
that client login was deprecated
and that we were going

00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.500
to turn it off in April, 2015.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
It's been turned off.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.550
We no longer allow developers
to write applications

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.470
that collect names and passwords
and submit them to Google.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.690
Instead, we've been encouraging
for years, developers

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.070
to use a OAF as a means
of building applications

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.810
that have access to your data.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.500
OAF, emerging standard, has come
around over the last few years.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.510
It's a fantastic way
to, as an application,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.740
obtain access to
users data because it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.095
doesn't require you
to collect and store

00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:54.740
a username and password.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.820
More importantly,
as an application,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.440
you can request exactly
what data you want.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.960
Now, if you have downloaded
an application that's,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.950
for example, a
contact manager, it

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.600
allows you to add
and remove pictures

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.390
for your contacts, et cetera.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.690
That application only has
access to your contacts.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.719
Three years ago,
with client login,

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.760
the same application would
have had your password

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.070
and actually been to
do anything-- send mail

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.500
as you, et cetera.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.769
Whereas as a user,
you now get to know

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.710
exactly what every
application does, and can,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.340
if you wanted to,
through the magic of OAF,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.910
actually say, that application
should no longer work for me

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.550
and turn just one off.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.350
Got it.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.392
That makes it a lot more
secure, and a lot safer.

00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:36.058
RYAN TROLL: A lot
safer, and gives users

00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:38.620
a lot more control over who's
accessing what-- something we

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.140
really are invested in.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: With
the deprecation of client

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.390
login-- and I know
it's something

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.670
you've been talking
about for some time--

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.070
but there was a recent blog
post pointing developers

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.490
at new resources
that they could find.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.240
Could you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.948
RYAN TROLL: Sure.

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:55.760
We did a final farewell to
client login in April of 2015.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.200
We had been working on
that for about three years.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.270
At that time, all
client login based

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.350
applications stopped
working, and we've

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.160
been encouraging developers to
move to a combination of a OAF

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.880
in order to obtain fine grained
access to user data and OpenID

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.070
Connect, which gives users the
sign in with Google experience.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.160
Both of these are documented
online in the account

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.510
cookbook we provide.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.020
Cool.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.310
The the link, we'll just
share it underneath, here.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.520
RYAN TROLL: Great.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.280
Cool.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.660
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Please click that.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.910
So given that security is
so important, and given

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.730
that it's really difficult
to roll your own security

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.750
infrastructure, do you have any
tips for developers or any ways

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.330
that they can get
started in building

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.456
good, secure, safe systems?

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:36.413
RYAN TROLL: Absolutely.

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:37.780
I'd give three big pointers.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.340
First pointer would be to
go and read up on OAF2.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.130
It's the emerging standard
for providing granular access

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.280
to user data.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.500
It's an open standard--
it's used by many sites

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.130
around the net.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.713
Once you know what
to look for, you'll

00:05:49.713 --> 00:05:51.110
see it's used everywhere.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.006
I don't want to name
any sites that use it.

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.380
The second one is
OpenID Connect,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.060
which is really the
standard-- emerging

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.840
standard-- behind the sign
in with Google experience.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.300
Once again, many, many
sites are using it.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.500
The third technology
I'd suggest looking at

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.110
is something we call the
Google Identity Toolkit, which

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.030
is a generic set of libraries
that help facilitate identity

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.340
management across providers
allowing you to build

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.260
your applications without having
to spend all your time thinking

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.049
about, how do I manage
user passwords, et cetera.

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:19.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks, Ryan.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.923
I've learned a lot
about client login.

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:22.540
I was wondering
what to do about it.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.840
I'll take a look
at those resources

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.440
that you've mentioned.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.856
I've been reading a little bit
about the Identity Toolkit,

00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.521
and there's some
great stuff there.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.020
Thanks for watching this episode
of "Coffee With A Googler."

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.170
I hope you learned as
much as I did today.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.466
If you want to learn more
about developing with Google,

00:06:35.466 --> 00:06:37.340
take a look at the Google
Developers channel.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.370
There's lots of great episodes
of "Coffee With A Googler"

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.830
