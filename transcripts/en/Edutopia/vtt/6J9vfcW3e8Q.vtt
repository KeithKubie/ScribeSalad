00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:06.906
&gt;&gt;Ben: Everybody who makes something
really, really wonderful gets there

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:10.066
through a process of making something
that's really not that great

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.126
to start with, and then slowly
improving it, taking feedback,

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:17.266
getting new ideas, in what I think is
a process that's a little bit closer

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:17.976
to the real world.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.016
&gt;&gt;The decisions that you need
to make today are decisions

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.666
about what's gonna get into the game
and what's gonna need to be left out,

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:41.036
in order for you to finish
in time for the fifth graders

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:44.706
to actually play these
games in a week, okay?

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:47.346
&gt;&gt;In this project that
they're working on right now,

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:49.226
is the biggest one of the year.

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.416
They're making an educational
video game

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:56.276
for a particular fifth grade
class that we went and visited

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:57.616
at a local elementary school.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.506
&gt;&gt;Oh, oh, it's when the corn pops
up and it's ready to harvest.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.966
Do you have to actually
activate on each one?

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.726
&gt;&gt;And so we went and interviewed
the students and got to know them

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.336
and found out what kinds
of music they listened to,

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.446
what movies they like, the cartoon
characters that they follow,

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:14.486
the video games that
they already play.

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:18.886
Students also interviewed the
fifth grade teacher and found

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.506
out what the learning objectives are,

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:24.596
the California State fifth
grade content standards.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:28.006
And so by going there and really
seeing what their classroom was like,

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.356
we were sort of immersed into
their world, and we understand

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.066
that we're creating
something for them.

00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:34.826
&gt;&gt;Why are we hitting
the out of memory here?

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:36.016
You've hit it.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:36.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Images.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:37.376
&gt;&gt;Ben: Because of what?

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:38.306
&gt;&gt;Student: Too many images.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:42.136
&gt;&gt;Ben: Too many images, or the
images themselves are too big, right?

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.056
&gt;&gt;Ben: The software that we
use is called Processing,

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:48.176
and it's actually a project that
was initiated at the MIT Media Lab.

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.226
It uses the Java syntax.

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:53.936
The thing that Processing provides
is a built in graphics library

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:56.666
and a really easy sort
of development process,

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.036
so you don't have to compile in it.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:01.846
You just push play, and then
your code immediately turns

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.056
into something that's
happening on the screen.

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:12.216
&gt;&gt;Student: It's pretty
interesting to do, I mean like,

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:17.656
if you want to be a computer or a
scientist and it's a good starter.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:21.646
&gt;&gt;Ben: We form teams and the teams
go through a brainstorming process

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:23.466
and an idea refinement process.

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:25.176
&gt;&gt;Right now, I have teams of three.

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:28.906
The different roles that the students
take on are the technical lead,

00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:31.526
and that's the person who's
gonna be sort of most responsible

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.256
for the programming, the art lead,
the person who's gonna be responsible

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:37.976
for not only the concept art,
but actually the production are,

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:41.056
the actual, you know, pixels that
go on the screen during the game,

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.976
and then a project manager.

00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:45.626
&gt;&gt;Student: Half the map's
gonna be like a city.

00:02:45.626 --> 00:02:48.696
Other half is gonna be like
a grass playing type of area.

00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:51.826
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm the project manager,
which is basically telling these guys

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:55.576
when the project is due, like what
we need to catch up on, the schedule,

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:58.076
what kinda pace we're gonna be on.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:00.776
&gt;&gt;Ben: Instead of having there
be a designated designer role,

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:02.526
it's actually that
everybody is the designer.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.136
&gt;&gt;Student: I took like an image
of a horse shrinking down.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:08.496
Then I remade it into
a pixelated horse.

00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:10.756
&gt;&gt;Ben: There's thirteen teams

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.706
and there's some pretty
interesting stuff going on.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:16.706
There's a game called Cookie
Attack and it's about fractions.

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:21.626
I think this is a real achievement in
terms of responding to the audience.

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:25.426
&gt;&gt;Student: We noticed that
the fifth graders, they--

00:03:25.426 --> 00:03:29.546
this kind of like violence and we
kind of incorporate it into our game,

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.076
where they have to answer the
questions to get the cookies

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:35.776
and they have to use the
cookies to shoot the monsters.

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:41.996
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm better at
programming than all the other stuff,

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:45.186
so I did the programming
and then Miranda,

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:49.396
she's better at Photoshop,
so she did the graphics.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:55.246
And then Angel, her part was to
separate kind of like the jobs

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:58.666
and then find some concepts.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:01.646
&gt;&gt;Ben: Just recently, actually,
that fifth grade class came here

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:05.926
to Galileo and visited us, and we
had a chance to show them some demos

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:09.606
and some prototypes of the games
that my students are working on.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:15.256
And my students took that feedback to
really help them shape their games.

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:16.106
&gt;&gt;Student: Was this
in the same thing?

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:17.826
&gt;&gt;Student: No, this is
screen number three.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:18.786
This one, you exit in.

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:20.336
&gt;&gt;Student: No, no, oh.

00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:22.726
&gt;&gt;Student: I really wanna know
if they get bored of the game

00:04:22.726 --> 00:04:26.696
or if they're having fun with it,
because it makes me feel happy

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:31.736
if they like the game, but if
they have some bad feedback,

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:34.886
then I'd have to work on
it some more, you know.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:41.346
&gt;&gt;Ben: By doing a project
that has a real audience,

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:44.976
I think it provides a little bit more
motivation to really put the effort

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:48.306
into making it good and that
allows them an opportunity to find

00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:50.456
out that you don't just make
something good the first time

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:50.796
you try.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:53.406
And software that's
running on computers,

00:04:53.406 --> 00:04:56.286
whether it's on your Smartphone
or on your desktop computer,

00:04:56.286 --> 00:04:57.156
or on a website somewhere,

00:04:57.506 --> 00:05:00.916
that software dominates
a lot of our reality.

00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:04.856
So having some idea of how those
things work, I think allows you

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.326
to be just a more informed citizen.
