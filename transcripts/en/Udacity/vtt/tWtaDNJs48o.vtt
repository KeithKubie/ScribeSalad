00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
In the forecast fragment, 
we create a position variable.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.936
Whenever an item is clicked, 
we update the position.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:08.082
Then, in the onSaveInstanceState method,

00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:10.180
we store the position in the bundle.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.132
If the app gets killed, 
then we can restore

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:14.094
the position from
the Saved State bundle.

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:15.923
This is on the onCreateView method.

00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:17.912
The reason we store 
in a global variable

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:20.423
is because the list view 
probably hasn't been populated yet.

00:00:20.423 --> 00:00:22.570
We wait for the onLoadFinished
callback to happen

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.036
when the cursor is swapped.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:26.492
Then, we can tell the list view
to set selection on that position

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.760
and that position 
will be scrolled into view.
