MICHAEL OXTON: First
of all, we just want

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.640
to thank everyone for coming.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.620
We're super excited to share
our story with you all.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.370
So thanks for taking the time.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.750
What we want to talk about today
is sort of a history of Night

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.340
Shift Brewing through the lens
of what we have just called,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.920
Create Better.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.130
We've sort of refined
what our company

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.820
stands for to the
point of calling this--

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.509
or calling it,
Create Better, which

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.460
has led us to sort
of consistently

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.264
improve our business.

00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:38.180
It's kind of about
learning from our failures.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.721
And we're just kind
of hoping to walk

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.410
through our history
with that lens in mind

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.750
and just kind of talk
through our story.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.700
A little bit about who we are--

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.590
we are the three founders
of Night Shift Brewing--

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.640
I'm Michael, this
is Mike, that's Rob.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.410
We collectively own
about 80% of the company.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.720
So we are the
board of directors.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.000
We make the decisions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
We set the vision for it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.820
And we started it.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.519
So we're actively
involved day to day

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.550
and we're also driving some
of the long-term vision.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.340
I just want to note Rob is
also the president of the Mass

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.160
Brewers Guild, which has
been really impactful not

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.400
just for our business, but
also for business and breweries

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.250
in Massachusetts.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.500
So that's been super exciting.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.760
So first, I want to
talk about failure,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.160
because our past is full of it.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.760
And I think it's
important context to set.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300
This is me I think just
transferring some beer back

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.300
in 2013 and totally
failing at it.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.270
So I think what's
important to note

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.510
is our failures are often
some of the reasons we've

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.550
been successful, because
we've had to learn from them.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.540
And it's kind of forced us
to make creative mistakes.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.290
So I just wanted to walk through
a few of them and just kind

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.492
of recap some of the
things that we've

00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:51.950
screwed up over
the years that have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.722
taught us some serious lessons.

00:01:53.722 --> 00:01:56.180
First off, we just didn't have
any professional experience.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.013
We made a lot of mistakes
because we weren't

00:01:58.013 --> 00:01:59.740
in the industry beforehand.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.730
We're just home brewers.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.760
I do think having that
perspective kind of gave

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.400
us this a fresh set of
eyes on the industry--

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.780
and sometimes I think we
made more creative decisions

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.710
but also a lot of mistakes.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.180
At times, especially
in the early years,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.600
the quality of our beer
was sometimes iffy.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.840
It was good enough, definitely,
to get us where we are.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780
But we did have corks that
would pop out of bottles,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.280
bottles that would gush.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.380
There's a video on
YouTube of a guy opening

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.610
a bottle of our beer and
it explodes everywhere--

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.920
which we play at staff parties.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.390
And we've drained a lot of beer.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.681
We won't put out beer that's
no good-- or that's good--

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.680
or that's no good.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.580
And it's forced us to develop
a much better lab, better

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.450
equipment.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.610
We learned a lot
through initially

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.450
having some iffy beer.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.550
Inventory and freshness
issues were definitely

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.440
things we struggled with--

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.420
or at least struggled
with in the past.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.250
As you grow, you have
more and more beer

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.400
you have to figure
out how to store it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.120
and how to keep track of it.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.820
We've had to learn ways
to sort of deal with that

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.580
and develop cold storage
and better processes

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.820
for managing all of our beer.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.480
Especially early, we
barely made payroll a lot,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.150
and it was really scary.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.080
But that forced us to create
more fiscally responsible

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.140
approaches to our
budget and have a better

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.370
control of our balance sheet.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900
When we started, it was
just the three of us.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.110
And we didn't really have
a staff development plan,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.901
because we weren't
worried about developing

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:39.190
anyone other than ourselves.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.100
We're now at 126
people, and that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.300
has forced us to think about
how we're developing people

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.730
and their future is
not just our own.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.480
And we most recently
hired an HR director

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.350
which was super exciting.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.820
And then just
finally underplanned,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.320
over budget, and
abandoned projects.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.571
We have plenty of
those behind us,

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.070
but I think what's
important to note

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.400
there is we just learned to ask
better questions to put better

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.280
projects in front of us.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.370
All right, so why we hope you're
going to listen to us anyway--

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.176
we're a passion-driven business.

00:04:11.176 --> 00:04:12.800
We started with a
really strong passion

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.650
and I think we still
have that today.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.412
It's what drives us to wake up
every day and do what we do.

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:19.620
We're still very independent.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.790
We own collectively
80% of the company.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.400
The rest is friends and family.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.670
We've been profitable every
year since we started--

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.710
150 times volume growth
since the very beginning.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.677
It's been amazing to
see and we don't even

00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:35.760
think about it very often.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.720
We just kind of keep going.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.700
But we sort of do
have that behind us,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.830
and it's been awesome.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.720
Like I said, we
employ 126 people.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.870
We try and offer
them great perks.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.540
We started with this approach
of going deep, not wide.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.810
And we still have maintained
that in our market.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.820
We were just in
Massachusetts when

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.300
we started and we're mostly
still in Massachusetts today--

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.160
just a little bit out of state.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.260
We still have strong
sales and velocity.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.780
And, as we're going
to talk about today,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.860
we're on a mission to shift
our industry and create better.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.790
So a little visual history of
Night Shift through the lens

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.260
of Create Better.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.770
Five years of home brewing
behind us-- we started in 2012.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.160
We had $150 capital raised
between friends and family,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.520
three staff, 1,500
square feet in Everett

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.160
in this small, dingy
little construction space

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.010
that we turned into a brewery--

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.070
and lots of passion,
lots more ignorance.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.470
This photo was taken
at 4:36 AM at the end

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.790
of a really long brew day.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.272
That was our first
day ever brewing.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:42.605
So it was just like one of
those moments we've captured.

00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:44.438
MIKE O'MARA: First day
brewing commercially.

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:47.570
MICHAEL OXTON: First day
brewing commercially, yes, true.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.900
And here is a day
brewing as home brewers.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.550
So this is our
Somerville kitchen.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.210
The three of us just standing
there looking like Muppets.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.630
And then we turned
pro and that shot

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.760
was taken for the "Improper
Bostonian" in 2012.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.610
This is our brewery
back in 2012.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.470
This is like a clean day for us.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.320
So I just want to talk
through a few of the things

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.420
that we focused on to
sort of create better

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.610
when we were beginning and then
I'll hand it off to these guys

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.318
to walk us through
the rest of the years.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.480
We started with all
cork and cage bottles.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.580
We hand labeled them,
we hand-wrote on them.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.370
We were really going
for a very premium look.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.860
We were trying to stand
out in the marketplace--

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.940
elevate beer to sort of
like a wine-like status.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.950
It gave us higher margins
and I think it did help

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.900
us stand out--

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.770
and a personal touch--

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.640
writing on every single
label is a huge pain

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.390
but people, I think,
appreciated it.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.340
And eventually, we
moved away from that

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.576
into cans, which we'll
get to fairly soon.

00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:54.200
But it was an
interesting way to start,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.760
because it was this
Create Better mentality.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.140
I also just want to note--
we started with volunteers--

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.515
some of those guys
in the picture

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:04.010
there were just
volunteers helping us.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.140
None of them we
employ anymore, but we

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.890
did hire a bunch of our
volunteers from the beginning.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.850
And that's just been
super rewarding to be

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.370
able to take people that were
volunteering and just lending

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.010
their time to us and bringing
them on and sort of help

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.230
grow the company
with them together.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.180
So the other I would
say like big thing that

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.680
helped us stand out
in the beginning

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.270
was 100% shifted beers.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.020
It was like nothing can go in
a bottle unless it shifted.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.930
We even said, we will
never brew an IPA.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.180
That's a thing.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.550
Which is so weird
because now our focus

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.460
is really hoppy beers.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.430
But in the beginning,
it was all shifted--

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.770
viva habanero was the rayo
with habanero peppers.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.560
That was sort of one of
our trademark flagship

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.140
core beers in the beginning.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.190
It got us attention.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.480
It really established us
as an innovation brand.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.550
Ultimately, it was
unsuccessful, just

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.720
because we decided to switch
to more drinkable beers--

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.885
hoppy beers that encouraged
more repeat purchases.

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:04.635
ROB BURNS: Genius.

00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:06.420
MICHAEL OXTON: It's genius.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.020
It's brilliant, but
it was a great way

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.500
to get our name out there
and spread the word.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.570
The sour barrel-aging
program that we started with

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.900
is still alive to this day.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.300
It was sort of an extension
of our shifted approach.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.920
I mean, we still
produce Ever Weiss.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.410
Shifted is basically
no traditional--

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.770
not just traditional
ingredients of water, malts,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.040
hops, and yeast.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.659
So anything else that we could
think of like cinnamon sticks,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.350
fruit, habanero peppers--

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.220
we got weirder than
that, but, yeah.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.240
Ever Weiss is a beer that
actually stuck around.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.299
We started with
it and that one's

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.110
grown into of a core
offering of ours.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.900
And I think trying to do
barrel-aged sour beer has,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.130
again, forced us to learn about
interesting processes that

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.070
are really complex.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.450
And we made a ton of
mistakes along the way.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.310
And now we can put out
this awesome sour program

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.560
that's grown with us.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.230
We started with
plastic fermenters.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.790
It was not a good idea looking
back, but it was cheap,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.720
and we didn't have
a lot of money.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.520
So it's so shameful to say,
but we had a normal ale room,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.400
which was just conditioned
with an air conditioner

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.440
and then like a sour
Cezanne room which

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.420
was just a space heater.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.840
And that's how we
controlled temperature--

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.420
which is just not
recommended at all.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.010
But we made it work.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.750
And the beer quality was good
enough to get us out there.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.250
We did ultimately
make the decision

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.390
to move to stainless steel
when we could afford it.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.510
And that allowed us to really
expand our style offerings.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.600
It actually allowed us to
really get into hoppy beers,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.480
improve our quality a
lot, and set the direction

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.220
for the future of the company.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.680
One of the core decisions I
think we made in the beginning

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.810
was to not sign
with a distributor

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.730
and just do it ourselves.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.562
We'll get to it a lot more
later, but at the time,

00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:04.020
we were just looking at the
distributor partners out there.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.580
We didn't see anyone that
we wanted to work with

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.880
and Mass franchise law
basically locks you

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.300
in a contract for life.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.100
So we didn't want to do that.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.390
And so we said, we'll just
throw beer in a Subaru,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.830
drop it off, and handle
all the sales ourselves.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.170
It allowed us to keep
30% margin, which

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.430
was good for profitability.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.747
But probably more
importantly, it

00:10:27.747 --> 00:10:30.080
allowed us to develop really
deep relationships with all

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.810
of our accounts and get to
know what our customers'

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.810
needs were-- like hear
on a regular basis now

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.620
what's happening in the market.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.120
Our tasting room was not part
of the business plan really

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.770
and it's become core
to who we are today.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.510
We started with 90 square feet.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.630
We thought some people drop in
here-- probably not very often,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.130
because we're in a
sketchy warehouse.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.590
But if they want
to come in, cool,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.700
and we'll sample
them on some beers.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.580
As our reputation grew, we
just got busier and busier.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.780
We expanded our hours.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.580
I think we were just Thursdays
and Saturdays to start.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.610
And open every day of the
week was soon a thing.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.610
We expanded into our production
space, which was dangerous

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.452
and not a good idea.

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:16.910
But when you have people waiting
out the door, what are you

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.930
going to do?

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.290
And then we ultimately
learned like, OK,

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.880
when we move-- which
we know we have

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.550
to do-- we have to build a
bigger tap room because this

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.207
is more important than
a 90 square foot space.

00:11:29.207 --> 00:11:31.040
And then the last thing
I want to talk about

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.120
is just the decision to
put the owl everywhere.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.029
I actually drew our
logo back in 2010

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:39.320
when we were just homebrewing
and it was just something

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.260
to slap on bottles as
like our homebrew labels

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.270
and give it to friends.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.850
And when we made
the business, it

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.900
was just like, oh, this
is our logo-- cool.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.110
We decided to be a
logo-oriented company.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.600
Not a lot of breweries
were doing that

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.920
and we decided that's going
to be what's everywhere.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.380
It's a hop and an
owl at the same time

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.270
and it's kind of a
nocturnal creature,

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.610
so it felt like it made sense.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.315
And we've grown with
that and we've just

00:12:07.315 --> 00:12:09.440
made that a bigger and
bigger part of our branding.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.990
And I think that's
been a huge part of how

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.060
we've grown and
created messaging

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.900
around our logo and the owl.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.780
Transitioning from our
early early, early years

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.270
in 2012, 2013 to 2014 and '15,
I'll pass it over to Mike.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.310
MIKE O'MARA: So the
next couple of years

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.040
was kind of a big
transition for us.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.360
We moved to a new brewery,
as Michael alluded to.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.590
We went from 700 barrels in
2013 to over 4,000 barrels

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.960
by the end of 2015.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.620
Kind of had a renewed focus on
quality, evolved our branding,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.470
and went through a few
expansion projects along the way

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.540
that themselves had a
couple of rough patches

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.520
that we learned from.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.270
And then really
continued to establish

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.360
our strong local
presence and following.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.030
In 2014, we expanded
our tap room.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.230
That was a new thing.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.510
It wasn't in our business
plan to begin with.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.330
Kind of threw that
business plan out

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.707
and like, OK, we're
focusing on the tap room.

00:13:08.707 --> 00:13:10.540
It's going to be an
awesome place for people

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.970
to come and hang out
instead of coming

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.690
to a dingy, creepy warehouse
that didn't have true working

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.740
bathrooms.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.190
So this was a very
nice upgrade--

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.190
real bathrooms included.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.830
Just kind of a side by
side-- our original brewery,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.180
which was about 60 gallons per
kettle there to our new brewery

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.890
which required
steps to get up to--

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.470
about 600 barrels per batch--

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.650
so a pretty sizable increase
in production size there.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.730
And then there's a couple
of pictures of our lab.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.470
So we also invested
a lot in quality.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.290
Because if we're dumping
beer that isn't good enough

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.400
to go out to the market--

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.580
which is good for
our reputation,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.480
but bad for our bottom line--

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.390
so we had to do something
about that in order

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.430
to continue making
world class beer.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.190
We invested heavily in our
lab and equipment and people

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.140
to run it to make sure that
everything from the day we're

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.360
brewing it to the time
we're packaging it

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.130
is analyzed along the line
and made sure it's quality.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.499
And we're going to be
able to ship what we make

00:14:17.499 --> 00:14:19.290
and be really proud of
it at the same time.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.360
So increasing the quality
and consistency there

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.140
is pretty key.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.750
In addition to that,
transitioning to cans

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.970
is kind of two parts there.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:35.300
One was cans are better for the
beer-- they don't let light in.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.220
They don't let as
much oxygen in,

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.710
so it increases the
shelf stability.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.010
So that increases the quality
of the beer just in the package

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.120
format change.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.200
We kind of saw early on
that the craft beer market

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.226
was shifting away from
bottles which goes totally

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:53.600
against what we were trying
to do with the cork and cage.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.510
But that's what
people started to buy,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.510
and we latched onto
that very early on.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.570
And as soon as we did,
we noticed velocity

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.220
increased tremendously.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.700
And we think a big
part of that was--

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.230
it's kind of hard to sit down
for a night and commit to 25

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.640
ounces of a 7% beer where it's
much easier to snap a can off

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.080
of a four-pack and drink 16
ounces of it and then maybe

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.670
drink the rest of the
four-pack if you want--

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.570
but you have options.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.290
And then along with the
cans, it was an opportunity

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.450
to kind of re-envision
the branding.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.270
And originally with
our logo, we kind of

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.340
had the owl and Night
Shift Brewing all kind of

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.447
squished together with a box.

00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:41.030
And this offered an
opportunity for us

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.859
to revisit that and
really focus on the owl.

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.900
The owl was going to be
everywhere to begin with,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.830
so why not just make that the
prominent thing on the can?

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.115
The owl is pretty
cool and recognizable.

00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:53.240
So we did that and we
started with a Whirlpool can,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.400
with just the silver can
which looks pretty cool,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.150
and the morph can.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.524
And then you can see it evolved
into a more playful thing

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:00.770
with the Santilli Whirlpool.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.270
And along with that,
we shifted away

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:06.300
from doing our shifted beers
with weird ingredients only

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:12.354
and our no IPA philosophy
to doing IPAs and pale ales.

00:16:12.354 --> 00:16:14.270
And Santilli and Whirlpool
have become our two

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.061
best-selling beers.

00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:18.380
So we're not afraid
to change our mindset

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.530
and get stuck in our
ways so to speak.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.760
And a really awesome example
of our IPA evolution is Morph.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.880
It was kind of born
out of necessity.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.620
We weren't very good at hop
contracting or forecasting

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.840
what we were going to
sell in the future,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.730
so we kind of took what we got.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.880
And Morph was a way to do that
and we had a consistent brand,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.614
but each batch was
different from itself.

00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:45.030
So we saw an
opportunity in that--

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.404
it's like, well, we can kind
of use this as a test market

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:49.640
because we didn't have a
flagship IPA at the time.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.490
And we would analyze
sales data in the tap room

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.820
and collect feedback directly
from customers in the tap room.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.490
And we used that to turn Morph
into our flagship IPA, which

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.540
is Santilli.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.950
So we kind of secretly
crowdsourced our flagship IPA.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.578
And then in 2016, we entered
that into the World Beer Cup

00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:11.119
and it ended up
winning bronze, which

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:15.640
is pretty awesome validation
for that process there.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.310
Continuing the evolution towards
quality and making things

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.190
happen to go from
a keg seat-belted

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.765
into the back of a Subaru.

00:17:23.765 --> 00:17:25.790
ROB BURNS: That's my
Subaru that I still drive.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.591
I drove it here today.

00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:29.490
MICHAEL OXTON: It
smells like beer.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.573
MIKE O'MARA: Yeah, it
constantly smells like beer.

00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:32.520
It's never going away.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.270
We upgraded to a
sprinter van, which

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.190
helped us increase the amount of
beer we could drop per account,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.060
which increased efficiency.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.862
And then finally now
we have a fleet of--

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.320
well, we still kind
of have a fleet

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.170
of Subarus floating around, but
we don't deliver beer in them

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:48.670
anymore.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.628
Now we have a fleet of
refrigerated box trucks.

00:17:50.628 --> 00:17:52.220
So everything is
cold from the time

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.020
we package it to the
time we deliver it

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.720
and put it on the shelf.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.940
Just kind of focusing on
efficiencies and qualities

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.430
and making sure the beer
is the best it can be.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.000
And in 2016-2017,
new equipment--

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.990
of course, brewery expansion's
happening, tap room expansions

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.740
and continuing to add people.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.430
Here we've got our
tap room expansion.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.700
So this is a new
room and ended up

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.060
making this really cool
event space with the tap room

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.310
and what we call the annex--

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.620
which ended up being like
an event space for us.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.985
Continued to add new
equipment, new canning line--

00:18:27.985 --> 00:18:28.860
our own canning line.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.660
We were using a mobile canner.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.630
Again, we could focus and
do our own quality control

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.420
on that canning line and not
have to rely on somebody else--

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.480
more capacity with bigger
tanks, more efficiencies

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.160
with more equipment
outside-- grain

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.849
silos we could order
by the truckload

00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:43.890
instead of by the pallet.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.210
And it's always awesome
to get validation.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.605
We always thought we had it.

00:18:53.605 --> 00:18:55.230
We always thought we
had great culture,

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.680
we had quality beer, great
beer, people liked it.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.220
But to enter these
contests and win awards

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.270
and look at our Yelp reviews--

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.950
it's always good to see that--

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.340
and Google reviews.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.556
Yeah.

00:19:08.556 --> 00:19:10.430
ROB BURNS: The best ones.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.624
MIKE O'MARA: Of course.

00:19:12.624 --> 00:19:14.040
It's always good
to have that kind

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.160
of like different perspective
and outside-in validation

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.304
of that, OK, yeah, maybe we
are doing something right.

00:19:20.304 --> 00:19:20.970
That feels good.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.640
Let's continue to try
to do something cool.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.140
And along the way, we've
had to hire more people.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.300
So we had about 65 employees
at the end of 2017.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.080
I think we mentioned
we have 126 now.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.900
We've had struggles,
but we've gotten smarter

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.910
about how we keep the
culture, gotten smarter

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.990
about how we hire people.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.060
We invested in a
program that helps

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.952
us looking at
people's personalities

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.160
to make sure that the right
fit, get the right people

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.450
in the right role--

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.900
the right people in the right
seat of the bus so to speak.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.930
So we've gotten smarter at
hiring people over the years

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.190
and continue to add
great people to the team

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.110
and keep them around
with what we provide

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.420
and with culture and benefits.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.630
During that time, we also
started a distributorship.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.400
So I'm going to let
Rob take that away.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.330
ROB BURNS: Sure.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.050
so in October 2016, we launched
our own distribution company.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.090
We were running out
of space in Everett

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.950
and we needed a new warehouse.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.450
And we'd been doing
it for ourselves

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.199
and we thought we were
kind of good at it.

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:22.710
So we were hearing from
a lot of other breweries

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.810
that they were frustrated
with the same options

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.670
that we were faced at one point.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.500
And a key tenet to our
distribution company

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.680
was even though franchise
law exists in the state today

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.100
that we wouldn't hold fellow
like-minded brewers to that.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.310
If things weren't working out,
we'll take it professionally

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.170
and we can part ways
and it will be better

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.910
for both sides of the fence.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.910
NSD has grown significantly
over the last year.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.240
We started the year
with 600 accounts.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.820
We now have 1,600
accounts that we service.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.330
We pretty much go from
Springfield, East Hampton,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.600
Amherst area all the way out
to Martha's Vineyard now.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.690
We've really, really added
a lot of capabilities

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.066
to our logistic side
of our operation.

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:05.190
And not only that, when we
started the distribution

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.300
company, we were beer guys--
so let's only sell beer,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.730
which we sell 18
different breweries now.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.760
This year we also added
on wine and spirits

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.190
as well as non-alcoholic
beverages like cold brew

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.160
and teas and things like that.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.380
And we just recently also
got our import license.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.690
So one of the things we're
going to tackle in 2019

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.480
is start importing
alcohol from Europe--

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.240
starting with some
wines from France.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.100
But all under the same
lens of let's look

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.470
for small, like-minded producers
who are doing something

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.500
a little bit different, who
have either innovative packaging

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.320
or cool products
that are small batch

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.830
that we can really take a
hold of and represent well.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.940
We set out to sell
beer for other people,

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.210
and we wanted to make
sure we were good at it.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.017
We didn't want to
make a false promise

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:51.600
to these other
breweries, because they

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.730
are small people like
us that put their heart

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.330
and soul into their businesses.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.440
This is a presentation from
one of our key suppliers

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.320
to Steel-- they're a brewery
out in Normal, Illinois.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.620
I visited-- it's very normal.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.080
They make great
sour beers in cans.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.080
And we are actually their number
one distributor along the East

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.120
Coast-- from Maine to Florida.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.870
We are their best supplier
that moved the most volume.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.490
This is just a fun little
slide that we put together once

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.100
to kind of show that we wanted
to be more than just a beer

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.170
company, that we wanted
to be a beverage company.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.586
And that anytime
of the day, we're

00:22:23.586 --> 00:22:26.580
selling something
that's awesome.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.400
Most of these are all local--
the first three non-alcs are

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.620
all locally owned
Massachusetts businesses, which

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.830
is pretty cool.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.040
And then the brewing side,
we continued to innovate.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.110
This beer came to life--

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.450
we're pointing today as well--

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.666
came to life kind
of back in 2016

00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:42.540
when the brewers, after
a hot day of brewing,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.499
wanted something light
and refreshing to drink.

00:22:44.499 --> 00:22:46.789
And they were drinking like
Miller High Life and stuff.

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:47.550
And I was like--

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.900
eventually we were
like, why the hell are

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.399
we drinking other
people's beer when

00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:52.725
we have all the equipment
to make that beer

00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:54.100
and we can probably
do it better?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.990
So let's do it for ourselves.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.800
And that's what we did.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.940
And we did that
for a couple times

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.467
over the year and a half period.

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:03.300
And then we started
testing it in the market

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.140
and people were actually
responding to it.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.599
So we decided with that
combined with the feeling

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:10.890
that we were getting tired
of going out into the market

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.990
and taking down breweries--

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.725
IPA draft lines and
those are breweries

00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:16.350
that we like to hang
out with-- that we

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.430
share similar challenges
and successes with.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.290
It was like, I love the
guys at Jack's Abby.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.360
Why am I taking down
their draft line?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.220
Let's go after the guys
that we don't like.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.890
And let's go after
the biggest guys.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.250
And we're sort of using the
term macro nuisance now.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.690
And it's also important to say
that the light beer category is

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.610
the largest category in beer.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.410
And it's one that,
for whatever reason,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.535
craft brewers decided that
they didn't want to play

00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:44.260
in-- that was anti-craft.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.210
And so we sort of fenced off
the biggest part of the pool

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.590
and let the biggest
people win in it.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.240
So why not try to be the
smallest guy taking share?

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.720
We continued to also change
our packaging options.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.620
These beers used to be in 750
milliliter champagne bottles.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.090
We talked about these earlier.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.030
These are sour beers that
are fermented with bacteria.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.060
We got a separate canning line
so that we could put the beer--

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.060
live bacteria into
the finished goods.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.950
That's something
atypical of what

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.990
a lot of the sour beers that are
out there in the market-- those

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.210
are usually kettle sours,
which they kind of cook it

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.320
to kind of almost
pasteurized the product.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.980
These are living beers.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.690
And we also kind of
try to play around

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.540
with the innovative labeling and
we use really cool photography

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.180
techniques to kind of showcase.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.996
And they look very different
from our core lineup.

00:24:31.996 --> 00:24:33.870
This summer, we also
open up two beer gardens

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.280
along the Esplanade that were--

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.660
that were a pretty fun place.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.170
We have a patio in Everett.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.030
I don't know if
you've ever been,

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.446
but it is basically
you're sitting

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:43.050
on crappy asphalt in
an industrial park

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.390
and it's not a very scenic spot.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.420
So we set out to find the
best spot in Boston to drink

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.190
and we worked really hard
to get this location.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.285
It was a wild success.

00:24:52.285 --> 00:24:53.910
One of the cool things
that we did here

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.460
too was we could be most
profitable if we only

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.090
sold Night Shift Beer here,
but that wasn't who we are.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.850
We called it the
Owl's Nest and it

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.265
was a celebration of Night
Shift Brewing and our friends.

00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:07.140
And so we poured a lot
of other people's beer

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.550
here that we made lower margins
on, but it was important to us.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.160
This is just a fun little
slide of our barrel-age edge

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.360
production over the last seven
years and kind of showcases

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.774
our rapid growth.

00:25:19.774 --> 00:25:21.690
We started with 200
barrels in our first year.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.120
This year, we'll do
a little over 30,000.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.300
Our business plan had that if we
did 10,000 barrels in 10 years,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.560
we'd be wildly successful and
we would probably call it quits.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.520
Now we don't know where the
limit is and how far we'll go.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.110
But I think one
important thing is

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.290
we've always set out to brew
to demand not to hit a number.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.450
We're not beholden to
a VC or private equity

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.150
where we need to
hit certain targets.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.300
We're brewing really
slightly behind demand

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.300
so that we can always have
the best product on the shelf

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.030
and we're not chasing
anything that's not real.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.102
I think all this is kind
of inside feedback on how

00:25:58.102 --> 00:25:59.560
we thought we were
creating better.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.130
But I think the real
proof is will customers

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.900
recognize that and
open up their wallets

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.530
and pay for the product.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.500
These numbers are
IRI data, which

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.580
is a syndicated data that's
from cash register sales.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.351
These are all from
Mass liquor stores.

00:26:14.351 --> 00:26:15.850
One thing that we
did to get smarter

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.540
was actually buy data
instead of guess.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.720
So this isn't our
internal sales numbers.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.690
This is actually what people are
ringing up at cash registers.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.180
And it's not every single
transaction that happens,

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.140
but it is indicative of what
is happening out in the world.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.050
And we set out to make-- once
we decided to make hoppy beer,

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.719
we set out to make
the best hoppy beer.

00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:37.260
And this chart shows
that we actually

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.940
are the number one
hoppy beer provider

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.730
in the state of Massachusetts,
which is pretty crazy.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.710
That middle column is velocity.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.220
That really tells us how often
does a customer pick our beer

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.540
over other people's beer?

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.150
And you can see we're almost
at 2 to 1 ratio over kind

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.610
of our next closest peers, which
is pretty incredible to see.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:58.260
Our sour can series is
classified as a specialty beer.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.850
It is the number
two specialty beer

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.997
in the market just behind
Budweiser Amber Lager--

00:27:01.997 --> 00:27:03.580
I don't know who's
drinking that crap,

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.520
but clearly a lot of people are.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.040
We like to showcase here that
our velocity is a lot better

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.760
than theirs.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.030
We're in just less stores
than Budweiser is in.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.440
If we were in more stores,
we'd probably be beating them.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.220
Nightlight-- we set out to be
that kind of macro nuisance

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.070
and we released it
about 26 weeks ago.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.530
So right now, we're
basically in the top six

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.780
of light beers, which
we're pretty shocked

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.950
to see that we're beating
out big global breweries

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.114
with multimillion dollar
advertising campaigns

00:27:35.114 --> 00:27:36.780
and that we're actually
playing somewhat

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.720
successfully in this
market without, really,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.930
any advertising budget at
all other than Instagram.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.704
So that's been fun to
take away mindshare.

00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:46.620
And some of these guys
are down almost as much

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.870
as we're up, so we like
to think we're directly

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.400
stealing from their pie.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.980
If you look at just craft
beer across all styles

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.962
in Massachusetts, we're
number three right

00:27:54.962 --> 00:27:56.670
now-- just a few
hundred thousand dollars

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.076
behind Harpoon.

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:00.450
But, again, we're beating out
a bunch of national brewers

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.575
that have much more resources
that have been around

00:28:02.575 --> 00:28:04.660
much longer than us.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.180
This is ranked by
velocity again.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.730
So, in the state, we are
the second-fastest beer.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.520
So this helps us a lot
in our selling story

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.020
when we go to market.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.980
If a liquor store is deciding
to carry us versus, let's say,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.220
Dogfish Head, we'll sell
three times more volume

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.500
than Dogfish Head will
in that same store.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.560
Then if you bring in
the national brewers--

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.850
or the global Brewers
again, we are a top 10 brand

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.502
in the state, which
is pretty incredible.

00:28:29.502 --> 00:28:30.960
This is, again, a
testament to kind

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.210
of our deep, not wide
philosophy of really trying

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.364
to get our brand in front
of Massachusetts consumers

00:28:36.364 --> 00:28:39.030
and make it just as recognizable
as some of these other big beer

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.510
brands.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.820
We really only package our
beer in 16-ounce four-packs.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.320
So another way to
slice the data set

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.690
is to look at packaging format.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.560
And if you take all beer across
all global brewers in the state

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.860
that play in the liquor stores
and look at only 16-ounce

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.220
four-pack sales, we are
by far the dominant--

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.980
I like to say the king.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.340
We're toppling Budweiser
pretty heavily here

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.490
and we're a far
market leader compared

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.980
to our peers in the state.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.617
Just really, again,
kind of humbling

00:29:05.617 --> 00:29:07.950
for us to see that this kind
of idea from our Somerville

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.830
kitchen has actually
like really taken off.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.770
But, nonetheless,
we're not done yet.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.660
We're setting out in 2019 to
try to create even better.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.690
We're building Boston
Tap Room on Lovejoy Wharf

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.800
right next to the garden.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.860
We'll have a brewery in there,
a kitchen, and a coffee bar--

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.120
which is something--

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.964
kitchen and coffee bar
are all new for us.

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:27.630
It will really be our
innovation factory

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.150
and a lot of our new ideas
will be first developed there

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.520
before scaling up and going
out to the wholesale world.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.670
We're, again, continuing
an even better workplace

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.870
adding more benefits,
adding more resources,

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.290
adding more internal training--
that's super important.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.540
We're trying to make ourselves
the best place to work,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.540
although I don't know if
we can compete with all

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.344
your amenities, but we'll try.

00:29:46.344 --> 00:29:47.760
I think we do have
more free beer.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.650
We're continuing down
that macro nuisance line

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.670
and we're going to launch
Limelight this year,

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.196
which is definitely a direct
shot at Bud Light Lime.

00:29:57.196 --> 00:29:58.320
We think it will be better.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.240
It will use better
lime ingredients.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.870
And if it's at all as
successful as Nightlight,

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.310
we think we'll have another
big winner on our hand.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.080
We're continuing to
invest in production.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.760
We'll continue to
add more sour styles.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.330
There'll be a fourth one-- kind
of the mix Ramble Weiss, which

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.480
will be a blackberry
sour with lemon.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.430
And then the next
two big questions

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.350
for us is what do we sell?

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.070
90% of our beer in
Massachusetts and only beer

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.791
that we make can we grow
beyond Massachusetts

00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:31.290
and replicate what we've done
in this state in other states.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.123
With the regulatory
environment, you kind of

00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:35.100
have to reinvent the
wheel in every state.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.601
They all have
different liquor laws,

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.600
which makes it really
confusing and challenging.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.220
But can we replicate the brewery
and the tap room experience

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.290
somewhere else and
can we also replicate

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.870
our wholesale operation
in other states?

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.210
And those are kind of
the two big undertakings

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.600
as we look future.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.470
And then the third one is,
should we do other beverages

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.110
and take the same sort of
lens of creating better

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.280
to other beverages?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.060
Could we do it for spirits,
coffee, wine, cider,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.940
kombucha-- whatever we're
excited and passionate about

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.180
and kind of take what the
lessons we've learned from beer

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.230
and apply it elsewhere.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.810
And I think our
final note is just

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.260
every day we try
to create better

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.930
and I think you
guys do the same.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.540
And we appreciate your time.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.964
And we can open up to any
questions and answers.

00:31:18.964 --> 00:31:26.374
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:26.374 --> 00:31:30.250
AUDIENCE: Let me ask
you a timely question.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.790
A certain other brewery
in the Boston area

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.630
is having some very widely
publicized labor issues

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.400
right now.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.310
Seems like they made some
pretty appalling cuts

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.040
to the wages of some
workers and now seem

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.210
to be like boomeranging way
back in the other direction.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.720
Maybe this is just two people
who made some bad decisions,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.780
but it seems like the
first time that attention

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.280
has been drawn to the labor
practices of craft brewers.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.560
I'm sure you guys are
thinking about this a lot.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.170
I'm wondering what
the implications might

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:10.770
be in terms of wages in the
industry, general employment

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.695
practices.

00:32:12.695 --> 00:32:14.820
Is this going to have any
kind of widespread impact

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.490
or is it just a kind of
one shot thing that's

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.886
going to die out in a few days?

00:32:19.886 --> 00:32:21.630
ROB BURNS: I mean, I
don't want to speak

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.330
to the specific situation of the
brewery you're referencing to.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.030
But, traditionally,
the beer industry

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.120
hasn't been one that's
been a good place

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.800
to make a living wage.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.710
We've always set out to try
to create a place that people

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.715
should earn an income.

00:32:35.715 --> 00:32:37.770
If you ever read through
some of my older--

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.760
I usually banter on
beer advocate forums.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.190
I've justified our
higher priced beers

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.730
around paying our people
more and the higher

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.430
cost of doing business
in the Boston metro area.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.560
That's important to us.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.050
As the Mass Brewers
Guild, we are certainly

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.360
open to doing some sort
of compensation studies

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.170
so that we can all benchmark
how we compare to our peers

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.360
and make sure that
everyone understands

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.860
kind of where the market is.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.290
We obviously can't get into
the anti-competitive territory

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.410
of price-fixing
wages, but I think

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.620
there is more that could be
done to make sure that everyone

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.779
is compensated correctly.

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:17.070
I think the three of us never
started this to get rich.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.200
That's not our motive,
and we've always

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.540
felt that we should share
the success with people

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.500
who create it.

00:33:25.664 --> 00:33:27.330
AUDIENCE: Talk a
little about packaging.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:33.464
You talked about going from
corked and caged 750s to cans.

00:33:33.464 --> 00:33:35.130
Why did you end up
on the 16-ounce cans?

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.130
I know it's what everyone
is doing, but why 16 not 12?

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.181
I personally find 16 to be kind
of more than I usually want.

00:33:42.181 --> 00:33:43.680
ROB BURNS: It's
definitely something

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.300
we went back and forth on.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.530
I mean, we showed a picture
where we first did do 12s.

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.030
And the kind of initial feedback
was that it would be cooler

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.113
if they were in tall boys.

00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:55.710
And I would certainly
credit a lot of that

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.810
to the Alchemist
and Heady Topper.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.210
I feel like they kind of
paved the way of like this

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.217
is where the cool kids go.

00:34:03.217 --> 00:34:04.800
But I do agree-- we
do make Nightlight

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.250
in 12 ounces, which is our first
return back to the 12 ounce.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.270
And for the first like
three or four months,

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.830
the 16 ounces were king,
but now the 12 ounces

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:17.469
are kind of taking over as far
as the preferred package type.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:18.989
And we're definitely
now considering

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:21.460
should we move other beers
into either both formats

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.560
or back down to 12.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.210
AUDIENCE: How about like
the 9% ones in 12 ounce?

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.460
MIKE O'MARA: I agree with you.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.219
That's a little much for me too.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.670
I also just want to add
it seems that the 16 ounce

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.870
format is somewhat of a
New England phenomenon.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.260
You venture outside of
New England and it is--

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.239
you still see a lot
of 12-ounce bottles,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.530
you see a lot of 12-ounce cans.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.071
And one of the other
aspects was, OK,

00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:51.570
we use the same amount of volume
and the same amount of time

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.250
to fill the bigger format.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:55.210
It cost us less in the long run.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.830
It's slightly small, but a
bunch of those things combined

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.819
kind of led us to this
to be like, OK, we

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:03.110
need to compete in this market.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.010
16 ounces are a New
England phenomenon.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.750
Let's at least play
around with it.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.600
ROB BURNS: Data-wise too, we
have some of our distro brewery

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.529
partners that sent
us 12-ounce cans

00:35:11.529 --> 00:35:12.820
and they didn't sell very well.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.680
And we asked them,
can you put them

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.780
in 16s and we'll see
if it sells better?

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.430
And some of them
did do that for us

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.975
and the 16s did sell better,
which is just kind of crazy.

00:35:21.975 --> 00:35:23.850
Especially ones from
out of state we're like,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.860
well, everyone wants
12 in our market,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.400
we're not going to make
something special for you guys.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.441
But when the velocity
increased, it was worth it.

00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:33.060
AUDIENCE: So with the craft
beer scene growing so much,

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.130
has that changed,
I guess, the way

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.660
you guys look at
what you're doing?

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.990
I'm sure when you started out
it wasn't as big of a fad,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.449
but nowadays you see different
places popping up all

00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:44.490
over the place-- which is
great for the consumer,

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.281
but I just wonder if
it changes the way you

00:35:46.281 --> 00:35:47.430
look at things at all.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:53.128
And also do you have any other
favorite non-Night Shift beers?

00:35:53.128 --> 00:35:55.459
MICHAEL OXTON: Sure,
I'll start this one.

00:35:55.459 --> 00:35:57.750
I mean, one of the breweries
we consistently look up to

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.600
is Allagash.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.740
Beautiful branding, incredible
beer, great leadership,

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.270
really good QA QC program.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.930
They seem to sort of check
all the boxes in terms

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.370
of an excellent brewery.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:16.260
And so they've sort of become a
great model and staple for us.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.310
In terms of how we
look at the industry,

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.610
I mean, I think Rob kind
of touched upon it earlier.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.230
But I do think if you look
at overall industry trends,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.810
beer is somewhat flat.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.625
We're not.

00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:30.000
And so we definitely
feel like we

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.041
can continue competing
and growing and innovating

00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:33.720
on the brewery perspective.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:39.600
And adding a tap room allows us
to connect with consumers sort

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.010
of in our space--

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:47.280
so doing that in Boston is
just building on the tap room

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.000
success that we've had and sort
of diversifying our portfolio

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.420
between wholesale involvement
and sort of on-premise tap room

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.980
involvement.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.400
But looking into other
beverages is something

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.654
that we consistently--

00:37:00.654 --> 00:37:02.070
or have consistently
talked about,

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.340
but it's starting to become a
more and more real conversation

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.330
as we look at what is the
future for not just Night Shift

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.655
Brewing, but Night
Shift the family.

00:37:11.655 --> 00:37:14.940
AUDIENCE: So when you guys
do collaborative beers,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.810
how do you decide where
the beer is brewed?

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.600
MIKE O'MARA: That's
a good question.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.350
I don't know if I know
the answer to that.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.610
ROB BURNS: I think
it usually depends.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.330
Sometimes we coordinate
around travel--

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.510
whether it's somebody going
on vacation or somebody

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.420
is coming for like Extreme
Beer Fest by Beer Advocate.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.710
Hey, why don't you come a day
earlier and we'll hang out?

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.210
A lot of those collaborations
are really a great opportunity

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:43.500
for breweries to swap inside
techniques and methods

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.910
and processes that is kind
of the real secret value

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.034
behind those.

00:37:49.034 --> 00:37:50.700
They're, of course,
really fun, and it's

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.820
fun to kind of mash up either
the styles that breweries

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.810
are known for or their label
art and stuff like that.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.640
And we do a fair amount of
them, but they're definitely not

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.620
big revenue generators for us.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.870
MIKE O'MARA: I'd also say
a lot of the collaboration

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.350
that we've done have kind
of gone back and forth.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.265
It's kind of like a serial
collaboration, if you will.

00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:12.390
So one time we'll do a
collaboration at Night Shift

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.525
and then we'll sell that
beer through our tap room.

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.650
And then the next time
we'll travel to that brewery

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.760
and do a collaboration
over there

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.990
with them so they
get a chance to sell

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.240
that beer through their tap
room and things like that.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.850
So it's a true collaboration.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.700
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
about the new flavor process.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.840
So like now that it's not
just three of you working on--

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.450
let's throw this in there
and see what happens.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.790
You mentioned you have a new
blackberry sour coming out

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.420
I think.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.770
How many people are
involved with that?

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.228
Or how do you decide
on the recipe?

00:38:39.228 --> 00:38:40.920
How do you kind of
push that to market?

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.950
MICHAEL OXTON: We used to be
involved in every single recipe

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:44.790
because it was ours.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.370
I mean, I think
when we launched,

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.350
every single one was
in a notebook somewhere

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.700
that we had homebrewed a bunch.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.260
And we brought it to market
and watched it evolve.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.330
But as we've hired
a team, we have

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.850
people that can make beer
that's way better than any of us

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.349
could.

00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:02.760
So we entrust our people.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.240
We definitely have input on
where do we want the vision--

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.370
or where do we see the
company going from a vision

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.100
perspective of like, all right,
we want to get more into sours,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.220
so let's develop those recipes
and sort of set that direction.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:20.820
But our production team,
which is actually--

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.690
what's the size
in terms of staff?

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.816
ROB BURNS: I think it's
like a dozen-plus people.

00:39:24.816 --> 00:39:26.190
MICHAEL OXTON:
OK, yeah, so I was

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.660
going to say like 15 people.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.300
They crush it every single
day and so we trust them

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.510
to nail it, execute, innovate.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.580
We sort of have our
wholesale market beers

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.452
and then we have
our tap room beers.

00:39:38.452 --> 00:39:40.410
And we've actually kind
of blended a little bit

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.600
over the last year in putting
more small batch stuff

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.034
out into the market.

00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:45.450
But we see a lot
of our innovation

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.730
happen with those
smaller batch releases.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.670
We have smaller tanks that are
basically exclusively reserved

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.670
for that.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.590
And then the brewers are
basically just given free will

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.680
to come up with whatever you
think is interesting and cool--

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.310
put it out, see how it performs.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.460
And then we scale
up appropriately

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.710
based on success,
feedback, all that stuff.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.230
It's a really fun,
creative process.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.930
And, again, our team
is trusted to do it

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.905
and we just kind of sit
back and go, awesome.

00:40:12.905 --> 00:40:13.780
That's the direction.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.962
Keep going.

00:40:14.962 --> 00:40:18.650
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about
your new light beer offering.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.090
I'm curious why no
other craft breweries--

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.680
or very few other
craft breweries--

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.060
seem to be going down this road.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.170
And I'm also curious what the
different challenges are as far

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.425
as both technically brewing
and marketing this kind

00:40:31.425 --> 00:40:32.550
of very different offering.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:36.090
MIKE O'MARA: So I think
there is a couple of reasons.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.880
There are a few craft
breweries doing it.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.665
Some of them are the
bigger craft breweries.

00:40:41.665 --> 00:40:43.290
And I think part of
the reason for that

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.320
is it's kind of a daunting
task, because the market is

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.880
pretty much cornered by
like Bud Light, Miller Lite.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.140
So they've already kind of
got a huge head start on that

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.130
and it's hard to kind
of break into that.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.800
We've had success and gotten
lucky with our branding.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.700
And it is something that people
I think we're looking for,

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.540
but I think that's one of
the bigger reasons for that--

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.320
that coupled with they
demand a lower price point.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.410
People go out and they buy
a light beer that's 4%.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:22.680
They don't expect to pay
$15, $16 for a four-pack.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.380
They expect to pay a lot
less for a 12-ounce 12-pack.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.601
So that's part of it too because
a lot of other craft breweries,

00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:35.100
including us-- and that's one
of the reasons why we held off

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.550
on actually going full
force into it for a while

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:42.240
was because it is lower margins.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.130
And it's a tougher
beer to brew--

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.240
there's not much other
flavor to hide behind

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.530
if you don't brew it right
or don't have great quality

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.770
control, things like that.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:52.515
So kind of all those
things combined--

00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:54.640
I mean, I can't speak for
any other brewery really.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.550
But I would assume
that those are

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:01.610
all big reasons for them not
really entering that market.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:04.010
ROB BURNS: And I'll
just add this data only

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.450
shows two pack types.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.980
Bud Light is packaged in so
many different glass bottles,

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.430
18-packs, 24-packs, 30-packs--

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.860
that if you look at that number
that's almost nine million

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.780
here, I think it's
in 26 weeks-- it's

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.730
something like
almost 50 million.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:24.290
So while we're making a dent,
we're nowhere near the Goliath

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.440
that is Bud Light.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.802
That beer is going down--

00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:29.760
every year they're selling
less and less of it.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.210
But it's a big hurdle to attack.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.100
It's something like, I
think, 40% of the beer

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.829
drank in the state is Bud
Light, which is ridiculous.

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:39.620
MICHAEL OXTON: I just
want to add one thing

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.300
based in your question.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.910
I think we've almost put
it in our brewery's DNA

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.340
to ask questions like
what you just asked,

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.350
which is like why
isn't anyone doing--

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.030
like why aren't more
people doing that?

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.010
And if that question gets
asked around the brewery

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.676
and we can't come up
with a good answer,

00:42:53.676 --> 00:42:55.160
it's just like, OK, go there.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.220
Go in that direction.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.897
That's really interesting
and at least explore.

00:42:58.897 --> 00:43:00.480
And that's kind of
we're trying to do.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.580
ROB BURNS: And it's
a similar thing

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.350
to starting our own
distribution company.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.090
Everyone told us
that's way too hard.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.380
You guys can't figure it out.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.350
Brewers can't just run
a distribution company.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.810
There's guys who's
done this for decades--

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.779
multi-generation businesses that
are billion dollar revenues.

00:43:14.779 --> 00:43:16.570
Just give it to them,
they'll get it there.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:18.986
And it was like, no, we're
going to try to do it ourselves

00:43:18.986 --> 00:43:21.000
and we're going to do
it better than you.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.441
We don't always do it
better, but we try.

00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:25.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks for all the
good beer over the years.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.670
Can you talk about your
improvement process

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.900
after you release a beer?

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.650
I swear that
Whirlpool has gotten

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:31.775
more bitter over the years.

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.767
So I'm curious like
once you release a beer,

00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:35.350
do you actually go
back and look at it

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:36.700
and try to improve the recipe?

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.169
Or do you try and keep it
as consistent as possible?

00:43:39.169 --> 00:43:40.710
ROB BURNS: I would
say there's always

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.280
a little bit of
evolution in the beers

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.090
as time goes by as
the brewers tweak them

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.180
and try to get them
better and better.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.260
Obviously taste is
subjective and not

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.660
all the times it is better.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.610
The other component
I'll add is that it

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.800
is an agricultural product
at the end of the day.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.170
Mosaic hops from year to
year do not always taste

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.160
the same, which is a challenge.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.560
And some of the tweaking
is derived from that

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.410
around crop variability.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:13.842
But we do have a
tasting program where

00:44:13.842 --> 00:44:15.300
different versions
of Whirlpool are

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.830
tasted against benchmark
batches versus how

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.360
they're aging on shelves.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.230
And if a product is skewing
out of what everyone deems is

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.990
Whirlpool, then we
re-evaluate what went wrong

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.150
or what changed and
things like that.

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:34.170
But it's definitely hard
to keep it as consistent.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.710
I mean, for all the shitting
on Bud Light I've done,

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.541
they do an amazing job
getting that right,

00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.790
and that's something that
we can't quite compete with.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:47.790
But we try our best and we do
have QA QC processes in line

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.311
to try to mitigate any drift.

00:44:51.311 --> 00:44:52.560
MIKE O'MARA: Thanks, everyone.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.360
ROB BURNS: Thanks, everyone.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.410
[APPLAUSE]
