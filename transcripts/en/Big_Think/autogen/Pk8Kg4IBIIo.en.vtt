for a long time I think there has been

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
for a long time I think there has been
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.670
for a long time I think there has been
this unfortunate sense that you got the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
this unfortunate sense that you got the
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.980
this unfortunate sense that you got the
science geeks over here and you got the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
science geeks over here and you got the
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.100
science geeks over here and you got the
cool art kids over here and that sort of

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
cool art kids over here and that sort of
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.770
cool art kids over here and that sort of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
extends further on into life where
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.299
extends further on into life where
there's a sense that these two worlds

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
there's a sense that these two worlds
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.870
there's a sense that these two worlds
are somehow separate and the fact of the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
are somehow separate and the fact of the
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.970
are somehow separate and the fact of the
matter is role in it for the same reason

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980
matter is role in it for the same reason
 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.590
matter is role in it for the same reason
we're all just trying to figure out the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600
we're all just trying to figure out the
 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.880
we're all just trying to figure out the
deep truths of reality I mean think

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
deep truths of reality I mean think
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519
deep truths of reality I mean think
about a role thrust on to this weird

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
about a role thrust on to this weird
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.520
about a role thrust on to this weird
planet going around the star and we've

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
planet going around the star and we've
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319
planet going around the star and we've
given we're all give it a little bit of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
given we're all give it a little bit of
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.420
given we're all give it a little bit of
time and we don't know what to do with

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
time and we don't know what to do with
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970
time and we don't know what to do with
our time what's important why are we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
our time what's important why are we
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610
our time what's important why are we
here right I mean it sounds wubu but I'm

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
here right I mean it sounds wubu but I'm
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200
here right I mean it sounds wubu but I'm
talking about really when you think

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
talking about really when you think
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.400
talking about really when you think
about your life what matters and in the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
about your life what matters and in the

about your life what matters and in the

end of the day scientists do what they
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
end of the day scientists do what they
do because they're searching for the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.090
do because they're searching for the
deep laws the deep understanding of how

deep laws the deep understanding of how
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.939
deep laws the deep understanding of how
we got here and where we may be going

these two communities come together and
 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.789
these two communities come together and
allow the underlying insights of science

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
allow the underlying insights of science
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.350

to inform the poetry of art then there's
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.320
