1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,510
All right, people. This is the
Big Bananas, bonkers Rubin Report,

3
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:13,070
end of the year clip show recapping some
of my favorite moments at 2018 before

4
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:13,821
we hit the clips though,

5
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:17,790
I want to take a quick moment to thank
all of you guys who listen, watch, share,

6
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,860
and support the show.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,700
You guys are the engine that have kept
us totally independent for over two years

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,380
now and trust me, we're just getting
started. 2018 was by far our biggest year,

9
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:30,800
yet as the intellectual
dark web went mainstream.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,010
I toured over 80 cities all over
the world that Jordan Peterson.

11
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,630
I also returned to stand up comedy,

12
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:39,230
check the link down below for upcoming
dates and we continued to have the

13
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:43,070
conversations that I believe can
restore some sanity to the universe.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,760
I've actually never felt better about
the direction we're headed and with your

15
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,780
help, we'll continue to grow. So
here's my one sentence. Sell job.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,710
Help us remain totally independent
and fan funded by going to Dave

17
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,480
rubin.com/donate. All right,
that's it. Now more importantly,

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,010
thank you and enjoy some of my favorite
moments with some of my favorite people

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,070
from 2018 but you were on with Kathy
Newman on it's Canada channel for UK,

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,410
UK Channel Four, sorry, four.
Yup. And there there is,

21
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:16,130
I mean everyone that's watching this
has probably seen this already have,

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,770
you should go watch it yet if you
haven't, you should go watch it. But,

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,760
but in effect,

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,350
basically she tried to make an argument
that you have heard a good Julian Times

25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:24,591
before,

26
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:29,591
but why does your right to free speech
supersede a trans person's right to feel

27
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:33,830
okay with themselves are saying even
the way she phrased the question was a

28
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,980
little confused and conflated,
but well the thing,

29
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,430
but the reaction to it w w your,
your answer was great,

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,990
but it was the reaction the regular
people watching at home. Then we're going,

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,020
this is nonsense. This is just abject. No.

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,730
The only thing that's really made it viral
is the fact that she recognized it in

33
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,540
the moment and what she was
saying [inaudible] where
you could see the light go

34
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,330
on briefly and she just went,
wait, what did I just say? Yeah,

35
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,080
and there was no escape. It was, yeah,
it was pretty. It was pretty grand. Yeah.

36
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,900
Well the funny thing about her argument
is that it's Pr was predicated on the

37
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:05,600
idea that somehow people have
a right to be comfortable.

38
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:10,430
It's like that's just not a right you
have in life all the things you can say

39
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,900
that you don't have a right to in life.
Being comfortable is number one,

40
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,460
which you made that point. Yeah,
you can offend me right now.

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,140
So the thing is is if you,

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,350
if you're right to be comfortable
trumps my right to talk,

43
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:25,160
then I don't get to talk ever
because I'm going to say things.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,400
If I'm actually talking, I'm
going to say things. If they're,

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,880
if they're profound things, if they're
contentious, things are truthful things,

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,660
I'm going to say things that if they don't
disturb you are going to disturb you.

47
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:36,590
And if they don't disturb you,

48
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,450
there's someone that's going
to be disturbed about them.

49
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:42,830
So what's the answer to that? Everyone
can be comfortable in the silence,

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,400
but that doesn't also doesn't work because
then we can't exchange ideas were not

51
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:49,820
comfortable in the silence.
We're isolated and Dan didn't the silence.

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,340
So it's a completely
incoherent perspective.

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,110
I will say the last time
I was on your program,

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,100
the only time I was on before I remember
you asking me what I thought of the

55
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,160
left and I quipped

56
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,550
uh, what left? I haven't seen
him in. Who knows how long. Yeah.

57
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,210
That turns out not to have been
right. They, they exist. I mean, yes,

58
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,050
I hadn't seen them.

59
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,330
But one of the funny things about my
trajectory is that having been, you know,

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,240
the experience was very much like
being ejected from the left. Yeah.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,060
And I got ejected from the left and a
lot of people on the right embraced me,

62
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:19,894
which was weird.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,140
And then even weirder was the discovery
of all the other people who had been

64
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,890
ejected from the left. And so the point
is, this is sort of a cryptic left,

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,710
you're talking to the
right. Exactly. Well and so,

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,890
so the point is the discovery that
there are a lot of people who you might,

67
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,280
if you just looked them up online you
would come to the wrong conclusion about

68
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,550
where their sympathies lay
that that's interesting.

69
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,060
And I think the conversation between
those of us who have been, you know,

70
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,760
catapulted out and those of us who have
landed on the right is going to involve

71
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,790
the recognition that in fact we are all
suffering from a kind of political PTSD

72
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,570
and that in fact many people who are on
the right are there because they've been

73
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,190
traumatized by really low quality,
dangerous leftist thinking.

74
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,270
Um,

75
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,270
but that that does not make their
right of center position natural.

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,710
I'm not saying there are no
natural positions over there,

77
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,610
but many people who are there are there
because they have run from things that

78
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,450
they've heard on the left.

79
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,400
And once we give up on the idea that
anybody on the map today has the answer

80
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,820
with respect to the policies that we
are supposed to embrace once we say

81
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,130
actually everybody's policies are
a failure. If we were to enact uh,

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,100
the libertarian program,
it would fail for game theoretic reasons.

83
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,050
If we were to enact the socialist program,

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,920
it would fail for game theoretic reason.
Same thing, right? So the point is, okay,

85
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,680
fresh sheet of paper
with respect to policy.

86
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,910
Now there's a lot for us to talk about
starting from values and there are a lot

87
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,200
of people who if you ask them to list
their values apart from policy would fall

88
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,470
out on the left. So, um, wow.

89
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,310
Is it an interesting moment that that
conversation may be about to get started

90
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,620
and to be in a position
to actually influence it,

91
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,650
I must say is a pretty exciting one of
the things that I found out that was sort

92
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,150
of amazing about your history,
you,

93
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,610
you briefly mentioned your right
before we started, you were a Marxist

94
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,290
time in your life. Most people will find
this hard to believe, but it is true,

95
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,110
but it's not that unusual.
Uh,

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,030
most of the leading conservative
thinkers of our time time, uh,

97
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,830
did not start off as conservator.

98
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,040
You've got a couple like a Bill
Buckley and the George will,

99
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,660
but I'm in Milton Friedman was, it was,
it was a liberal and a Keynesian, uh,

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,730
high Eq was a socialist. Ronald
Reagan was so far left at one point,

101
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:41,400
the FBI was following him,
you know, uh, so, uh, the,

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,140
there's a huge movement, uh, from the left
to the right as people get older. Yeah.

103
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm, I'm well aware, as I mentioned to
you earlier, as a former progressive,

104
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,740
I understand that that
movement in the modern sense.

105
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,840
Do you remember sort of
what you were thinking,

106
00:05:55,841 --> 00:06:00,050
what appealed to you at that
time about Marxism? Yes. I mean,

107
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,100
there was no alternative being discussed.
Um,

108
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,970
my first job was as a Western
Union Messenger and a,

109
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,540
I would come home on some nights.
I would take the fifth avenue bus,

110
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,860
which cost all of 15 cents in those days.
But I figured I'd splurge now and then,

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,680
and I would drive. It would go
all the way up, Fifth Avenue,

112
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,060
pass all these lord and Taylor
and all these fancy places.

113
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,590
And then we were across 57th street pass,

114
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,430
Carnegie Hall and down Riverside Drive.

115
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,090
And that was the sort of the
Gold Coast area. And then yes,

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,120
I came across this long viaduct and
that turned into 130 fifth street.

117
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,630
Suddenly there were the tenements
and I went, why is this?

118
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,690
I mean, it's so, so it's so different and,

119
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,180
and nothing in the schools
or most of the books, uh,

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,990
seem to deal with that and walks,
dealt with that. Uh, so it's, it's,

121
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,990
it's like winning an election when
there's only one person running.

122
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,120
So then what was your wake up to?

123
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,790
What was wrong with that
line of thinking a fact?

124
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm not one of those who thinks things
are worse now than they've ever been.

125
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,660
I mean, this is a country where we've, we
fought over a big issue for a long time.

126
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,350
The revolutionary war of course. And
then of course, we had the war of 1812.

127
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:16,910
We had the civil war, World
War One, World War II, Vietnam,

128
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,580
Korean War, nine 11 people hated Ronald
Reagan. Thought he was a warmonger.

129
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,530
Uh, George Bush. Uh, what was
it? Bush lie, people died. Uh,

130
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,270
there's tension in this country.
There always has been a,

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,910
for a very long period of time. We get
along better now than ever before. We've,

132
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,570
I said,
man,

133
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,110
I don't think you can understate the fact
that we elected and reelected a black

134
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,850
president in the 50s.

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,900
The polls show that the percentage of
white Americans who will be willing to

136
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,510
vote for a black person, no matter
how well I call it for qualified,

137
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,620
was in the single digits.
Uh,

138
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,390
and now I think only three
or 4% of Republicans and
Democrats say that under no

139
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:56,540
circumstances would they vote for a
black person, for president. In fact,

140
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,460
if greater prejudice against
the Mormon, uh, and again,

141
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,340
warning for a woman than it is voting
for a black person now. So, uh,

142
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,570
America is a very different
place than it used to be.

143
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,990
And for the left to act like it's not
insults the men and women who worked hard

144
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,920
to get us to where we are right now.
It's actually really

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
true to say that Obama was basically as
honest as a politician can be and still

146
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,080
be a politician. I mean, I think you have,
I'm sure he lied about things, right?

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,380
Yeah.

148
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,380
But there's no story on Obama being
just this depraved person behind closed

149
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,170
doors who get, who's
a, who's a con artist,

150
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:37,760
who gets away with everything that he
can get away with a WHO's trailing along

151
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,240
list of key business and
interpersonal casualties.

152
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,660
Who will tell you if you put them on
camera or you can't get them privately?

153
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,800
He's the worst person they've ever met.
Right? That's his president now. Right.

154
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:52,580
It's just that it's a completely
different personality. Um,

155
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,300
and uh, I think that, I
think so whatever happens,

156
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,500
let's say good that let,

157
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:03,270
let's say we're living in
a universe where having a,

158
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,740
a uniquely narcissistic,
selfish,

159
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,100
shallow personality in this
position of power works out.

160
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,560
Well,
let's just say that I mean a lot.

161
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,540
So let's just take your wrecking ball
theory. He's kind of swung through here.

162
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,840
He's disrupted everything. You
know? I do view him, as I said,

163
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,330
I've said before as a kind of
evil Chauncey Gardner character.

164
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,970
I don't view him as this sort of mastery.

165
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,620
I think Scott Adams is
completely out to lunch on this.

166
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:31,770
I don't think he's this genius
manipulator. I mean, he's got,

167
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,260
he's got some talents obviously,

168
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,990
but I think it's much less
calculated bolus calculator.

169
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,830
I don't think him contradicting himself.
Two sentences later, right when he says,

170
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,450
you know this amazing letter,

171
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,000
you'd all like to read this letter
and then he says two sentences later,

172
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,420
I haven't read the letter. That's
not calculated. He's just not,

173
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,930
doesn't have the car.

174
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,220
He can't take the cognitive overhead
to even figure out what you know,

175
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
what was logically implied by the
last thing you said? Right? So He's,

176
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,600
the truth is he's not,
he lies all the time,

177
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,430
but worse than line.

178
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,850
And this is the great distinction that
philosopher Harry Frankfurt made in his

179
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:13,380
book on Bullshit. Worse than line is
that he's bullshitting all the time.

180
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,560
And the difference between
line and bullshitting is it.

181
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:20,340
If I'm going to lie to you,
I'm paying attention to what I know.

182
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,200
Right.
I know what is true.

183
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:27,201
I know you know what is true and I'm
trying to insert ally into the space

184
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,870
provided in a way that you won't notice.
Right?

185
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,070
Like I'm having to keep track of reality
in order to lie to you successfully.

186
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,060
I understand your logical expectations.
I understand that.

187
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,790
If I tell you that,
you know,

188
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,970
I was an hour late here
because the traffic was so bad.

189
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,610
I can't say in the next sentence. Oh, I
left an hour late from my house. Right.

190
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:54,360
So like so, um, uh, so the bullshit
or isn't doing any of that,

191
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:59,361
that bullshit or is just talking right
and therefore has renounced the reality

192
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,560
testing he has to do to lie
successfully and he's just,

193
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,800
he has the burden is not on him to make
any sense at all in the end. And um,

194
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,540
that to an amazing degree,
not entirely.

195
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,190
I think he does actually lie strategically
sometimes, but to an amazing degree.

196
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,860
And this is what I think is so
harmful about his presidency.

197
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:24,861
Whatever happens with North Korea or
anything else that we might care about to

198
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,220
an amazing degree.

199
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:31,221
He has revealed that half of our
society will accept somebody who is just

200
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,100
bullshitting all the time about
things. Great and small. I mean,

201
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:42,810
it doesn't matter how important
or how inconsequential
porn stars, you know, what,

202
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:44,700
you know,
what just happened with the g seven,

203
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:47,510
you know what was said behind closed
doors, what he's going to say to,

204
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,240
to a you some maniac with, with nukes. Um,

205
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,980
there's just a,
we've

206
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
completely forsaken any expectation of
a reality based conversation and many

207
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,180
people seem to revel in it.
Many people seem to think this is just,

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,470
this is just good fun. This is
like, this is, you know, the answer.

209
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,120
It's a bit of the wrecking ball theory.

210
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,140
Gone to some nihilistic extreme where
it's just, let's just, you know,

211
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,640
let's just burn it all out.
Having gone through the looking glass,

212
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,450
having gone through the direct, you know,
to borrow a phrase from the far left,

213
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:27,451
but the lived experience of actually
being at the center of a mob at the center

214
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:32,410
of riots and then watching as the world,

215
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,560
the mainstream media and others tried
to do a public relations spin on it and

216
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,400
tell a totally different story to live
that and to watch the institution that

217
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:46,810
you love to become totally disloyal to
you and to watch many people whom you

218
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,090
respected, um, hide.

219
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,413
Yeah,

220
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,710
you can't unsee that.
It's valuable.

221
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,150
And the fact that we're sitting here
talking together and that many of us in,

222
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,290
you know, the intellectual dark web
and, and this and this bigger group are,

223
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,450
are speaking and saying actually the
culture of fear that is society wide is

224
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,284
real.

225
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,470
And so I'll say the first time I
met my students after the November,

226
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,760
2016 election after Trump was elected,
evergreen is a very left place.

227
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,380
Olympia is a very left place.

228
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,290
Pretty much everyone on
campus had that glazed eyes.

229
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,640
Slack Jawed look that people in most
progressive enclaves will be familiar with

230
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:30,700
from that time, from those few
days, right. Myself included,
even though, you know,

231
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,950
I was no Hillary fan,

232
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:36,850
but I didn't see that outcome coming and
I certainly didn't vote for Trump. I, um,

233
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,090
we got to class and my co faculty
whom I admire greatly, uh,

234
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,990
just proceeded with her lecture on horse
evolution and I'm looking around the

235
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,800
classroom going,
no one here cares about horses.

236
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,940
There is not the day.
Um,

237
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,160
so she ended up at early and we had lab
a couple of hours later and before she

238
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:03,220
let them go, I said, hold on, if anyone
wants to stay, this is no longer class,

239
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,360
but if anyone wants to stay,

240
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,360
I would be happy to lead a
conversation about what just happened,

241
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,950
what just happened to our country.

242
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,690
And about 40 of our 50 students
stayed and skip their lunch hour.

243
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,020
And we went right to anatomy lab that
afternoon from, from this conversation.

244
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,180
And what I said to them was,

245
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,050
do not for a minute believe that
racists and sexist elected Trump.

246
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,000
Think about how many times you have had
to censor yourself on this campus when

247
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:33,001
you had an opinion that was even slightly
different from the accepted dogma.

248
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,710
And that conversation not
only brought life to the room,

249
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,900
but afterwards I had several
students come up to me,

250
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,690
some of them in tears
telling me stories about,

251
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,520
one of them had lost a job on campus
for speaking and opinion that was not

252
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,280
accepted. One of them had an, another
story of another friend who lost a job.

253
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,420
Others talked about their
self censorship and um,

254
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,190
that and all of these people, again,
we're far left, not that it should matter,

255
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,580
but these weren't even people who are
conservatives or who held conservative

256
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,320
views.
So that,

257
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,180
that is the larger culture of fear
that is hardly restricted to evergreen.

258
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:13,280
But as society wide that we're,

259
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,460
that we're speaking about and the people
are responding to because in you at

260
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,303
Google,

261
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
at Starbucks and in cubicles in campuses
but far be on campuses across the

262
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,910
country and across the weird country
is at least this is a problem.

263
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,970
Shapiro, will you bake Ruben a
wedding cake? Huh? Okay. So, I mean,

264
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,960
my answer is I'm married already,
right. But an anniversary,

265
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,000
it's my anniversary last
week and anniversary cake
would have been nice. Right.

266
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,900
So I,
so the answer is no,

267
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,500
and the reason I won't is because
it's a religious Jew. I, yeah.

268
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,250
I do not participate in activities
that I believe are sinful. But again,

269
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,170
we live in a free country
and Dave knows this.

270
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,750
He doesn't have to care
what I think about sin and,

271
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,720
and as long as I'm not bothering Dave,
I don't see why it's a problem. Yeah.

272
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,520
So it will, I will. I did. Does Dave
have a husband? Yeah. I mean like, okay.

273
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,420
And Are we friends?
Yeah.

274
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,530
And Are we going to go out to dinner
sometime in the near future? Yeah, but,

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,460
but there's a difference between me just
being friends with Dave and me actively

276
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,510
participating in an event that
I feel is religiously sinful.

277
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,660
And I think that is how most religious
Christians in most religious Jews feel.

278
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,510
And while that's awkward, yeah,
we're still friends in spite of it,

279
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:24,430
which is why we're friends.
If your friends in spite of it,

280
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,760
then there'll be a bad thing. We'll look
when I, when I did your interview show,

281
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:29,320
which by the way, I mean, yeah, you Jack,

282
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,480
the idea of an enter your show front
of me. It's all right. It's true.

283
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,470
But nobody had done it before me.
But what you said that to me in,

284
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,610
and I truly mean this, like if you
think what I'm doing is sinful, like I,

285
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,340
I know it sounds Glib,
but I don't care. I,

286
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,370
and this is my view is you don't have
to can right. Free Country, right?

287
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,650
Like that's the thing and it's
like, look, look, there is,

288
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,450
of course someone's going to go,
well wait a minute.

289
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,680
If you really think his marriage is
simpler saying of course they'll,

290
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,740
they'll may be a place that in the nature
of our friendship maybe that we can't

291
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:00,551
quite get to,

292
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:03,370
that I would be able to get to with
someone that didn't think for sure.

293
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,910
That is very possible. And, and it,
and it goes both ways, right? Like,

294
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,800
I then look at you and I go,

295
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,910
well [inaudible] you don't
want me teaching your kid
about the nature of family

296
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,860
perhaps, right? I mean like,
like there are some believers,

297
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,300
but you're probably a pretty good dad.
Like you know what I mean? Like what,

298
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,110
why is it that we're able to do this?
And most people can't do this.

299
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:26,260
That's what I'm curious to go home at
night and we can have our own lives.

300
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:27,130
I mean that's,
that's a real,

301
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,760
and I think part of friendship by the
way is that like we go home at night and

302
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,900
we just have our own lives. Yeah.
I'm not married to you. Right?

303
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,420
Like that's like my wife and I
have to agree on these issues.

304
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,730
You and I don't have to agree on these
issues in order for us to share our

305
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,750
common space together.
And that's really the important thing.

306
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,300
Your wife and you have to agree on these,
on all of these issues or just the, the,

307
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,400
the sort of, the more foundational
and the foundational ones.

308
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:48,970
But I do think that you know how you raise
your kids religiously and with regard

309
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,560
things like sexual morality does
actually have to be at the root of,

310
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,900
of how you teach your kids.
Yeah. So if you have deep,

311
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,140
if you have deep divisions with your
spouse on these issues, I think that,

312
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,360
and you're looking to build
a family anyway. Yeah.

313
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,050
Then I think that these are issues where
building on a bad foundation is a bad

314
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,210
move. So let me, okay, so if you
wouldn't bake me a cake, that's okay.

315
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,520
And now because it's 50, 50, I
can't bake you a cake, which I,

316
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,770
David's measurable chef and he would've
done it coaching the whole wow man. Yeah.

317
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,280
No, I feel bad. You would have done
it for you. You got me this clothes.

318
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,280
Putting that aside, you can't have
any of it's kosher cake now. Um,

319
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,470
if we were having an anniversary party,
would you come?

320
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,260
If I was inviting all the crew that we
all know and we were just an anniversary

321
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,150
party,
we're just having a party and a,

322
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,760
and I'll even throw in some kosher food
for you to make sure you don't have to

323
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,290
bring your own. Honestly,
I'd have to think about it.

324
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,410
I'd have to think about it in the same
way. So That's interesting to me. Yeah,

325
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,290
that's a different thing. Well,
not really, because again,

326
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,280
it's if you're a religious person,
and again,

327
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,240
take it from the religious perspective,
from the religious perspective,

328
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,920
the question is, are you glorifying
something that you think is sinful? Yeah.

329
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,460
So is it a party for something that
you think was originally sinful?

330
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,680
Can you participate in that?
So from a religious point of view,

331
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,760
that's an actual serious moral question.
Yeah. When I go out to dinner with you,

332
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,100
the answer is yes, right?
Because that's not actually like,

333
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,010
let's celebrate something that I
feel that you're doing is sinful.

334
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,320
But I'd have to, I'd have to
think about that one. I'm,

335
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,530
and I'm being in a perfectly straight
forward as possible. I want you to.

336
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:08,100
So it's the,

337
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,920
see that's so interesting to me cause
it's like if I threw a regular party,

338
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:14,370
just we were just going a party at my
house and all the guys [inaudible] like I

339
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,940
bake you a cake that had nothing
to do with the gay wedding. Right.

340
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,070
And that would go to a party with you.
That has nothing to do with gay marriage,

341
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,060
which will make me a regular cake. Could
I just have a Thursday? Sure. I'd give you

342
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,301
my baking socks.

343
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:28,540
I'll just buy you one [inaudible] Shapiro
cake and then I'm going to write it.

344
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,110
Then once I get it here, I can just
have a broader base of crap. I mean,

345
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:33,060
it's not gonna be good, but
it's, but it'll be there.

346
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,530
Silicon Valley at this point has
a bit of a conformity problem.

347
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,850
It has a bit of a way in which
people are, you know, too, too much,

348
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:46,200
all thinking the same way. It's just like
the, there was, you know, the, the apple,

349
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,960
I saw this,
this meme on the Internet the other day,

350
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:52,200
where was sort of the
silicon valley in 1997,

351
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,670
Colin think different than Silicon Valley,
2018 colon think the same.

352
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,610
It's like you want to ask the question,
why is it, why is it so, so way?

353
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,940
I think these things are, are, you know,
they're, they're somewhat over determined.

354
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:07,080
So I would say a part of
it is, um, is that, uh,

355
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,160
it's probably the most educated part of
the country in terms of how much time

356
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,150
people spent in college.

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,260
And I think one of the downsides of too
much education is that you get the most

358
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:20,460
brainwashed. And so it's, it's, it's the
most educated can also mean that it is,

359
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,330
it is the, it is the most
brainwashed. This is probably
also true of the founders,

360
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:28,770
but certainly of, um, of many of the
rank and file people who are, um,

361
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,330
you know, if you're sort of like a
really good engineer or, um, you know,

362
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,850
really good at some specific thing,
um,

363
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,000
your education typically does not
involve you thinking that much about,

364
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,200
about politics. And so, uh,

365
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,460
it's not necessarily from
deep ideological conviction.

366
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,600
It's often more as a fashion statement
than as a question of, of power. So, uh,

367
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,660
and so one of the things that's always
a little bit hard to score is that even

368
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,950
if you took a survey and silicon valley,
it's, it's, it comes out as, you know,

369
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,800
quite far to the left,
you know, weirdly, um,

370
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,200
uniform weird sort of group think.

371
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,680
It's a super hard to know where
the people really believe this,

372
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,040
whether they're with, they're
just going along. And so I,

373
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,870
I think it's pretty liberal, but, um,
but of course not as liberal as it looks.

374
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,770
And that's, that's in a way worse because
it means people are too scared to,

375
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,890
to articulate things. I think
diversity's a good thing. I think,

376
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:25,000
especially in a diversity of
ideas is, is, is, is to be valued,

377
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,080
but you don't have real diversity when
you just have a group of people who look

378
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,640
different and, uh, and think alike.
And so it's, it's, it has to meet,

379
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,670
it has to be more than just,
uh, you know, than just, um,

380
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,260
having the extras from the space cantina
scene or something like that. Right. And,

381
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,900
uh, and that's, and so
that's always, that's always,

382
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,430
so it's always like an internal critique,

383
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,450
the diversity methods that it's not
about diversity at all. It's about,

384
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,130
it's about a conformity.

385
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,600
But the point is we're going to have
to live with each other as a nation and

386
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,100
we're going to have to love each other.

387
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:02,550
And there are a lot of people with
this mimetic complex in their mind.

388
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,980
This is why I went and I talked to Kanye.

389
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,940
I thought what Kanye was gonna do was
de Trump a Phi Magda with people who

390
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:16,290
wanted their towns in Ohio and western
Pennsylvania to start working again.

391
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,080
People who, uh, you know,

392
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,500
we're drinking themselves silly feeling
that they were part of the American

393
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:23,880
dream.
And got sidelined,

394
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,100
we are going to have to find common cause
and it's just not that hard. You know,

395
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:33,360
it's just not that hard to have a friend
who's Hugh is different than yours is

396
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:34,740
not that hard to have a friend.

397
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,280
You and I have serious political
differences at this point.

398
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,470
It just doesn't cause me
to want to silence you.

399
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,820
And so my claim is is that even though
they're aligned and even though they know

400
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:48,654
they're lie,

401
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,190
you've got to experiment with love and
forgiveness to the best of your ability.

402
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,650
And I can't tell you
that I never lashed out.

403
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:02,100
I think I lashed out a little bit at
Rebecca Lewis because she was lying.

404
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:07,101
She said it will never not be funny
that the entire intellectual dark web is

405
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:10,260
only located on Youtube.
Oh really?

406
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,470
So the 12 rules of life isn't a book that
exists and the waking up podcast isn't

407
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:19,290
something that has no video.
Even if it exists on Youtube,

408
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,380
people listen to it off of youtube is
that it's not true that we don't have any

409
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,930
events. Of course Rebecca
Lewis is lying. She knows.

410
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:29,430
She's like data and society is lie. These
people all know that there are a lie,

411
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,560
but they think that they're lying for
some beautiful reason to keep our country

412
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,800
together, to make sure that we're
not in the hands of a tyrant,

413
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,420
to make sure that every child has
a shot at a beautiful tomorrow.

414
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,270
And I'm sorry that they're this confused,

415
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,620
but have some compassion because
they don't have the compassion.

416
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,570
When we hear about empathy,
okay, the onus is on us.

417
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,470
They don't have this great
empathy. They like, I,

418
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,920
I still care about trans people that
I can't care about white people. Okay,

419
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,113
that gives me a headache.

420
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,730
You're either empathic and you care
about people in general. Yeah. Or your,

421
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,830
it's selective empathy and you really
have a lot of hate in your soul.

422
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,930
So I set it Goddamn example
that that's my basic take,

423
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,770
which is you've got to love the people
who are allying thinking that they're

424
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:22,280
advancing the world's cause and you
have to love them out of their cult.

425
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,780
And if we're not willing to take that on,
then I don't know what we're doing.

426
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,940
But I can't always make this this
high bar that I'm setting for myself.

427
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,120
I will fail. I would lash out at somebody
but have a forgiveness narrative.

428
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,660
There is in general, no redemptive
redemption narrative on the left.

429
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,300
That's why it's not even a religion.
People say it's a cult.

430
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,210
It's religion without a redemption
narrative. There's nothing.

431
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,810
If what you're really excited
about the sticking it to the man,

432
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,980
whoever the man is,
you're not fundamentally a good person.

433
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:56,981
You're a person who's working through
your own personal anger and so my claim is

434
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,024
is that

435
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,060
love the people who are lying against
you and figure out what an incredible

436
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:09,320
power, incredibly powerful weapon that
is. Because at the end of the day,

437
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,570
after you knock them
senseless to the pavement,

438
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,200
you better offer them a hand up
and say, look, it wasn't personal.

439
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:18,470
It's just you were, you were
threatening our system and you know,

440
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:21,560
I felt like I couldn't communicate to
you while you were still in the call.

441
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,663
That's where I am.

442
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:22,901
Well,

443
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:27,901
there is a fear that if you acknowledge
that there are differences between

444
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:33,481
individuals or groups that you're
saying that one group is inferior.

445
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,640
So there's been a co they,

446
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,850
the idea that we have to be the same to
be equal has been a very prevalent and

447
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:50,460
strong idea. I don't know who
came where the idea comes from,

448
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,170
but it's, it's, um,

449
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,550
it's dangerous because if you,
um,

450
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,140
if you argue that no true
or quality can be achieved,

451
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,520
unless we're all the same, then no,
then we can't have a quality. However,

452
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,750
if you argue that no,

453
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:12,751
we are all morally equal and that
we deserve equal opportunity and,

454
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,470
uh, the equal, um, uh,

455
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,510
w we deserve equal opportunities to
live a happy, flourishing life. However,

456
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:27,470
there are differences between us.
Yeah. Then you can preserve that, um,

457
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,140
ethical principle.

458
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,920
So it's very problematic for people
who think that there can be no equality

459
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:39,790
between men and women unless we are
proven to be the same identical,

460
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,010
um, because the evidence doesn't
support this. The idea that we're

461
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,940
the same. Well, look, I've had
so many years doing this, Dave,

462
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,090
and I can't explain how I still love it.
I love the interplay.

463
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,670
You should love what you do.

464
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,260
Know why you learn something every day,

465
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,090
every day you learn.

466
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,990
So I can't be close minded
like I'm a liberal politically,

467
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,610
certainly in social issues,

468
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,580
but I'm not close minded enough to think
that you can't have an opposing view.

469
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,150
I like the argument. I liked the
discussion, but in interviewing, I never,

470
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,770
I mean my ego at the door,

471
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,490
I try not to use the word I to irrelevant
and I tried to get into what any

472
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:37,450
other, you know, Edward Bennett Williams,
the great lawyer told me once, I said,

473
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,790
what is the role of the
criminal defense lawyer?

474
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,300
He said to get one person on the
jury to walk in your client's shoes.

475
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,490
If you can get one person to walk in
your client's shoes, got a hung jury.

476
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,290
All he has to do is say,
I would've done that.

477
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,080
I've been in spaces at
Columbia for example,

478
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,170
or conversations where my being black.

479
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,350
It was obvious to me that
there is an assumption of,

480
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,950
of moral worthiness or have a kind of
heightened moral knowledge that I would

481
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:16,880
have as a black person that
a white person wouldn't have.

482
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,340
And you know,
I think,

483
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,820
I think I'm not the first to
make this analogy of course,

484
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:27,560
but the real religious analogy and the
analogy to original sin is pretty apt.

485
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,600
Um, because it, I mean the,

486
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:35,550
the way this has a lot to do with
black history also because the way I,

487
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,540
the way I see it,
they're kind of two ways to study history.

488
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:42,140
There's the conventional way, which
is, you know, you study World War One,

489
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,460
you study the causes and consequences
read different takes on, on,

490
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:50,180
on the significance. And once
you've studied all you need to know,

491
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,160
you move onto the next topic.

492
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,710
But then there's a religious way of
studying history, which is, I mean,

493
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,210
it's not enough to know the facts. We
have to go somewhere on Sunday, every,

494
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:04,400
you know,
every single week and learn,

495
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:09,170
talk about the same stories over and
over again. So this is, you know, it's,

496
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,740
it's the difference between how an
atheist learns about the life of Jesus and

497
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:16,490
how a Christian learns about the life
of Jesus Jesus and relearn it every week

498
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,950
for the rest of their life.
In my view,

499
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,280
how we're looking at the history
of race relations in this country,

500
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:23,300
the history of racism,

501
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,980
we are more and more putting it in the
religious category of history of where,

502
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,330
you know,

503
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,330
I can read a piece about the history of
lynching in the New York Times almost

504
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,490
once every two or three months.
Right.

505
00:29:37,491 --> 00:29:42,310
And lemon lynching is a decades old
crime at this point. And Abi, I mean,

506
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,230
Jesus, Great. Obviously it was a heinous
staying on on this country's legacy,

507
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,311
you know,

508
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:53,170
but then the number of deaths that that
is is the highest amount quoted in New

509
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,860
York Times with regard to how many black
people were lynched in this country is

510
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,830
around 4,000 right?
Every single year.

511
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,420
Twice that many black people
die of homicide. And I,

512
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,450
you just don't even hear about that.
In the New York Times.

513
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,970
There are 20,000 engineers,

514
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:16,150
engineers making between two and
$400,000 working right now just on Google

515
00:30:16,461 --> 00:30:16,820
search,

516
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,380
just on that one feature of Google
20,000 this is the most technologically

517
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:24,380
advanced and powerful organization
in the history of the world.

518
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,920
It's technology and capabilities so
far outstrip those to the Pentagon for

519
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,680
example,
where the Chinese military or the Russian,

520
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,150
the Russians or any other group,

521
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,510
this is the most powerful
technological entity in the world,

522
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:37,910
which has a choke hold on all
human information in English.

523
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,330
So that is all sort of
all you need to know.

524
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:43,520
I don't care if Jesus is
in charge of the country,

525
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:47,570
that's too much power for any
entity to have. And it's a,

526
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:50,870
it's a threat to the nation state
actually, and it's a threat to all of us.

527
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:52,160
So yeah,

528
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:57,140
I think whatever it takes is
what we need to do. Like now,

529
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,160
you know, I'm in his lightened meant
guy. But the thing is, is that we're not,

530
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,410
when I look backwards in
time, you know what, what,

531
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,210
what people like Harrison pinker
attribute to the enlightenment are,

532
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:12,140
you see as the enlightenment being the
latest flowering of a process that was

533
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:18,200
indescribably older than that is
exactly right. And then in the end,

534
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:21,800
in the historical sense, certainly
grounded in the religious traditions, but,

535
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,280
and then from my perspective,
grounded in something that's biological,

536
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:26,600
that's far deeper than that,
like,

537
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,610
like our true proclivity towards
admiration for competence and reciprocity.
