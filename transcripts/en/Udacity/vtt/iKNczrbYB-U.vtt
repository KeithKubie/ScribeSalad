00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's 3 x 10^-9. Let me show why.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.380
At the minimum, both contributions are equal.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.140
I'll explain why that is so in a second.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.490
So we find that the constant, C, x the value h minimum

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.260
equals the constant D x ε over h minimum.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.440
&gt;From which follows that h minimum is the square root of Dε over C.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.400
ε is multiplied by a factor of 10^-9,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.110
which means that the value of h min, for double position,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.110
is multiplied by a factor of square root of 10^-9.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.620
Starting from the value of h min for single position,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
we have to multiply by the square root of 10^-9.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.890
In total, this is 10^-8.5. And that's about 3 x 10^-9.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.510
An important remark: This model was made for the forward Euler method.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.540
If we have a method of higher order, if we have Ch square, or even Ch 4 in here.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.980
So from this result we learn that as we go from single to double position,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.440
we may be using a step size that's about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude smaller,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.560
and hence the error will be smaller by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.990
The price that we would be paying is that we have

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.010
in the order of 10^4 to 10^5 more computation

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.510
which looks a little prohibitive, but then again,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.490
with a method of higher order, you need half your steps than with the forward Euler method.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
So the affect of roundoff errors tend to be way smaller

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.090
with more advanced methods.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.250
In case you're interested, let me explain why these 2 contributions

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.330
are equal at the minimum.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.940
Otherwise, skip over the rest of this video.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.930
Substitute the step size h, by e^-u, with an appropriate value of u.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.140
Then the total error becomes C x e^-u + Dεe^u.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.930
Because we are dividing by that power.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.639
Now you can see that the 1st part becomes a falling exponential function,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.800
and the 2nd one becomes an increasing exponential function.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.200
Both fall, and due to symmetry, the minimum has to be where these 2 curves meet.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.260
A completely different approach to that problem is, of course,

00:02:21.260 --> 09:59:59.000
to compute the derivative and set it equal to 0.
