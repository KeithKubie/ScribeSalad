00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:14.570
This symbol first showed up in the 1770s,
appearing in documents of English-Americans

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.890
who had business dealings with Spanish-Americans.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.020
However, it wasn’t until the very early
1800s that it became popularized, around the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.270
same time as the first official U.S. dollars
were being minted.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.820
Previous to this, the symbol had already been
in use as an abbreviation for names of Spanish

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.250
currency, namely as an abbreviation for the
Spanish peso “p”.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.620
So how do you get from a “p” to the dollar
sign, “$”? When writing financial documents

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.260
referring to pesos, it was common to abbreviate
the peso, for instance, “1 peso” to “1

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.260
p”.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.230
However, when pluralized, as in “1000 pesos”,
it becomes “ps“.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.420
When writing up financial documents and having
to write “ps” numerous times, it started

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.280
to become common among the English-American
colonists to merge the “p” and the super

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.470
scripted “s” as one.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.890
The top half of this symbol then produces
something looking very much like a double

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.850
vertical lined dollar sign.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.159
In an even further bout of laziness, it became
common among the English-American colonists

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.270
to write the “p” with just one downward
stroke vertically slashing the “s”, thus

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.729
the ‘$’. In some of the earliest documents
containing this short hand, it was common

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.429
to see both the double slashed version as
well as the single slashed version in the

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.350
same document, referring to the same thing,
the Spanish peso.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.389
How then did this symbol that originally denoted
pesos spread to also denote the U.S. dollar?

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:42.259
Around the same time the U.S. was minting
its first dollar coins, in 1792, Spanish currency

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.819
was extensively circulated in the U.S. and
around the world.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.179
In large part due to this, the U.S. chose
to design the U.S. dollar coins to duplicate

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.910
the Spanish coins, in terms of matching the
material and weight, hence value (at the time,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.579
the coins were made of silver and valued after
the price of silver).

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.340
Doing this allowed the U.S. coin to be exchanged
for a peso in a 1 to 1 exchange.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.410
Thus, it was natural to use the same symbol
to denote the U.S. dollar as was used for

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:27.010
the Spanish peso.
