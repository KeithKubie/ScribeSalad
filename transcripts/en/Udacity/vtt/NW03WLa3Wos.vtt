Hi, I'm Peter Chapman, and welcome to the first Office Hours

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
for CS 262 Building a Web Browser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm your assistant instructor, and I'm filling in for Professor Westley Weimer,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
who's currently at a conference.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My name's Andy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm the assistant instructor for CS 212,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is Peter Norvig's class on the design of computer programs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I'm going to be filling in the role of the student today

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and asking Peter here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
all of the questions that you came up with in the forums.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's start off.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The first question we had, Peter, was why are we learning regular expressions at all?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why is this useful for a class on programming languages?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The class is structured around building a web browser,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and our web browser needs to interpret html.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The first step to do that is to identify the parts of html.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We want to identify which part is the beginning of a tag,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the end of a tag, what's a hyperlink, what's just text and words and whatnot.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We want to do that very concisely

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with the powerful tool that is regular expressions.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Regular expression just allows you to write some text,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and it very precisely and easily identifies

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
strings that can match, say, our tags or hyperlinks.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay, and I've seen the beginning of Unit 2,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and it seems like that gets reintroduced then.

00:01:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Yeah, we use it a lot throughout the course.
