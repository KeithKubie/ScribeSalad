00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: Thank you all for coming. This
is great. This was the biggest room we could

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.680
get on short notice and it's great to see
it so packed. So, in every generation, an

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:20.990
artist comes along that redefines the way
we look at art, you know. So, Jackson Pollock

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.981
did this and the immediate reaction was, "My
kid could do better than that"; and then,

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:33.050
people realized he was a genius. And Mark
Rothko did this and people said, "My kid could

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.910
do better than that." And then they realized
he was a genius. And Randall did this and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.840
people said, "Oh, wait, actually, my kid can
do better than that. Here's one she did when

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.640
she was eight." You know, I think it's pretty
good. Maybe you guys afterwards, just think

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:07.439
about it. But, of course, you know, we don't
watch xkcd for the artwork, we do it for the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.319
poetry, for the math, the drama, the romance,
the originality. You know, they're all so

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:20.210
original; well, not quite all of them. You
know, there was one--those of you who were

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.799
here two years ago may remember the great
fiasco, it's two years ago this week with

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.240
the sign-ups for the holiday party where some
of the records were getting dropped from the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.779
sign-up sheets and, you know, you may remember--so
I just want to say here what a genius he is

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:44.840
with this kind of stuff. But you may remember
this message that I sent in response to that.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:02:04.639
And, you know, I don't want to say anything
but it did show up a few months ago, a rather

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.070
similar--and what I learned from that, well,
you probably learned the same thing is, at

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.330
least, in my sequel, the semicolons are not
allowed into the input so that actually--that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:36.630
exploit wouldn't work.
&gt;&gt; MALE: Last week, we tried that but we came

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.630
upon some sort of difficulty.
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: Yeah, well.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.630
&gt;&gt; MALE: The standards can be changed a little
bit; but we also checked Windrop tables which

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.640
serve as add-in which was something. It was
either the late '80s or early '90s. That's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.870
it regarding the colon.
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: Well, anyway, so that's fine. There's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.010
accuracy in comics. And we got some stuff
for you. So, here, we got some t-shirts and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.420
you could see other people are making t-shirts.
We--Ellen made you a cake shaped like the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.994
Internet. I wanted to give you your very own
official Google ball pit ball. Does anybody

00:02:55.994 --> 00:03:16.130
else want to give him one? Okay. So let's
get started. At the end, we'll have time for

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.430
questions and cake. Use the microphones when
you have to but now let's welcome Randall

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:36.819
Munroe.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Well, first of all, thanks, everyone,

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.830
for having me here. I wasn't actually expecting
to give a talk when I was making the trip

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.470
out here. I was just coming through unrelatedly
and asked if I had an invitation to come by

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.480
and visit. And I emailed about that and said,
"Oh, you know, there are probably some people

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.231
who want to hear you talk here." And, apparently,
there are. So, before anything else, I want

00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.750
to take a chance to apologize. I don't know
who here works on the Google Maps--if anyone

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.630
works on Google Maps but a couple of years
ago, I was playing with this--I was looking

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.349
at this Web site and I'm a big fan of Maps
and I found there was some group, I forgot

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:26.740
who did this, but they did a map of London
with all the transit times in colors which

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.280
the map is this. And I'm curious what will
happen if I put the computer under here. Whoa!

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.419
Hey, it worked. Okay. So, some group did this
map where they are color-coded by time and

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.930
it shows, you know, how long it takes for
you to get--like here, this is for public

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.889
transit system. So here are the stations and
so on. And I said, this is a really cool idea

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:57.189
and I want to try this for the US for driving
times. So, I put together a script which would

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:02.990
take your starting position and go to Google
Maps and just pull up the page, not using

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.650
the API or anything, just pull up the page
for directions from here to point one, here

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.330
to point two, here to point three. So, I first
did this for my neighborhood around Newport

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.819
News which is down in Virginia, so starting
off in the center of the map up here, and

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.539
this is how long it takes to get around the
peninsula and over here. And these are transit

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.289
times in minutes. The idea is then I could
then convert this into a color map. And then

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.550
I said, "Well, this is kind of cool but it's
pretty low resolution." This is, you know,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.189
30 by 30. So, I started--but I found that,
you know, there's a time delay. It takes a

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.259
little while to ping. You know, it takes a
little while to get the map back. And I said,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.860
okay, to get a good resolution, I want to
do--I forgot what it was--several 100 by several

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:56.949
100 or ending up with, I think, a 500,000
pixel map. So, I wrote the script, you know,

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.870
split it up across about eight servers and
just started them all requesting segments

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.839
of this map. And, you know, that had been
running for a little while. And then I went

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:15.719
and read the terms of service. It didn't--I
think that as they were written at the time,

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:20.580
it didn't really explicitly prohibit what
I was doing but it was pretty clear that they

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.830
were saying, you know, "Don't do that." And
I noticed this when my servers actually stopped

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.349
getting results all of a sudden. So, I don't
know if I had tripped some filter or, you

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.059
know, what stopped working there. But I never
did get to finish that map. It occurs to me

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:43.129
that that would be a fun project especially
if, you know, you have access to these systems.

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.380
You know, you could have an app showing how
far it is from building 42 to everywhere in

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.600
the country driving. If you're doing it over
the country, by the way, you probably want

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.309
to normalize it; like, you know, the time--the
travel time divided by the as V as the curve

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:02.919
flies time, you know, or distance or something
like that, just so the map won't be just a

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.770
mountain, you know, fast here, you know, slow
far away. If anyone does that, I would love

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:16.080
to see what turns out. So you can just email
that to me. I figure--so, I've been doing

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.069
these comics and people have a habit of acting
out the comics. I first--I did a comic about

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.629
Cory Doctorow; you know, he wears red cape
and goggles when he blogs and a week or so

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:32.960
later, he was given an award. And he went
up on the stage; they presented him with a

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.029
red cape and goggles. I have done a comic
little before that about Richard Stallman

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:44.680
suggesting that he sleeps with the katana,
you know, just in case. And, sure enough,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.409
they sent him, some fans pitched in together
and sent him a katana. He had never heard

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:58.199
of the comic. He was very confused. And I
decided, okay, this is going to get out of

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:04.069
hand. So, shortly after all that, I did comic
about Janeane Garofalo jumping a motorcycle

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:08.800
off of the International Space Station as
it crashes over an island with a volcanic

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.280
eruption and Tyrannosaurus. And I said, okay,
if someone can make that happen, but until

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.809
they do that. The other thing I want to say
is about a comic I've done recently--I did

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:33.190
recently. It's sort of a warning. Let's see
if this works. Okay. I was playing with one

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.750
of these and it did brightness balancing;
you could move your hand around and get shapes

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.300
to appear but--and then I ended up playing
with the projector for a few minutes instead

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:49.840
of, you know, being usefully entertaining.
So, I did a comic a little while ago about

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.320
programming ability as a function of what
I'll call content. And you're now seeing here,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.240
here's your normal ability and as you get
progressively more intoxicated, it drops down

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:14.220
but then there's a spike. And the important
thing here is to precisely hit the spike and

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.170
as I mentioned in the comic, if you get a
little bit off of the spike, you'll end up

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:28.180
with Windows ME. Now, one thing that not too
many people noticed and I'm not sure of exactly

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:38.120
the numbers, but I gave as the bounce of the
spike, I think, a .29 or .28 and .39 or .028

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.880
and .039. I think that's--is that right? I
love--other people know my comics better than

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:52.440
I do. So if you take--what you can find with
that which not a lot of people picked up on

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.310
this and emailed me but if you want to get
your BAC right at the peak and if this--you

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.090
know, depending on what this is and what kind
of delta functions it says it can back and

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.850
make a big difference, you want to get right
at the peak. You--probably in the middle of

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:28.580
those numbers; you want to be about .1337.
Now, a

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:38.510
related issue is the question of solving the
Rubik's cube. I noticed awhile back that as

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:45.620
I got--I went to do Rubik's cube awhile ago.
There might be someone in here who has played

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.530
this one before. Once you've learned the sequence
of steps to solve it, it's not so much, you

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.840
know, a brain-twisting puzzle, it's more like,
"You know, okay, do you remember the sequences?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.210
Can you do this faster and faster?" So, the
question is how much does getting drunk get

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:07.750
in the way of that? And I tried this a year
or so ago. You know, I have a drink, you know,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.160
wait a bit, I videotaped myself solving the
Rubik's cube because I didn't trust myself

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.500
to, you know, take notes accurately, and I
found that when I got, you know, I could get,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.800
you know, I could solve the cube here and
my time back then was hovering near a minute

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.450
but it's now--which, I mean, isn't--the professionals
are, you know, down to the twenty-secondth

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.310
range. But--so, I was here at about a minute
to a minute-thirty, somewhere in there. But

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:41.000
I found that as I got more and more drunk,
you know, my time got worse but not by all

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.730
that much. You know, it seemed I could still
do it when I was stumbling, you know, falling

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:52.220
down drunk. It seems to be a lot more, you
know, muscle memory and shoe-tying. What I

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:58.870
found out was that I did have trouble finding
it and picking it up. And in the last stream

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.420
of the video, I took out--in the last run,
I spent a few minutes talking about how proud

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:12.630
I am, "Look what I found? I found this cube,
it's--I can do this," you know. Now, the problem

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.050
is we didn't actually get any hard data on
this. You know, I have these videos but I

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.850
didn't, you know, document--I didn't do a
good job of the science of this. I didn't

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.930
document, you know, how much am I drinking,
how much time has passed, what's my calculated,

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:34.910
you know, BAC; and some people decided that
was unacceptable. So, a couple of nights ago,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:44.620
we decided to fix this. So we got some alcohol,
some mixers, and a stop watch. We put together

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.700
a table and I solve the Rubik's cube over
the course of a couple of hours; you know,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.370
on precise timing, taking a shot, 20 minutes
take the second shot and start the Rubik's

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.880
cube, take ideally just a couple of minutes
to finish the Rubik's cube but maybe later

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:10.580
in the experiment longer. And we--by the end--so,
first of all, what we had, it was some cheap

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.140
vodka and random juice and, by the end, I
didn't--I was getting toward the middle of

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.560
the night and I was, "Okay, you know, this
stuff, this isn't quite a much as it was when

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.040
I started," and toward the end, I never wanted
to see vodka again. I got a little further;

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.860
I never wanted to see a Rubik's cube again.
But what we did find is that when we got to

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:38.700
the point where I refused to drink anymore,
you know, my time had gone up by maybe 10

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.870
to 15 percent. But it certainly didn't stop.
So, that's an interesting result. The Ballmer

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.550
Peak data--if anyone wants to do a similar
experiment while, you know, working on Google

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:57.900
Search and wants to send me their data they
get, that would also be pretty cool. Now,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.930
for the bulk of this talk, it's going--I would
just like to do Q and A because I find that's

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:10.000
generally the most fun part of things. So,
first--say, if anyone has any questions about

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.660
the comic, you can be formulating those. First
of all, I also--I apologize for the Google

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:23.150
Maps thing and I would like to thank you for
Google--Google has solved my problem of Your

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:36.240
Nation. Specifically--okay, there are--this
will make sense. There are men's bathrooms

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.370
which have, a lot of the time, urinals that
sort of stick out from the wall, there's no

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.240
barrier between you and the people next to
you and there's the whole shy kidney thing.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.870
You know, you're standing there and there's
everyone--there are people all around me,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:15:03.130
elbowing in on me, leaning over, you know,
staring at me so--which brings us to the Google

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.360
Apps aptitude test. I don't know how many
of you took this. It went out, I think, in

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.150
the back of Mensa a couple of years ago when
I'm still in college and it was a bunch of

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:18.550
very interesting questions: How would you
color some kind of an icosahedron using one

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.051
of three colors on each phase? How many different
combinations can you find? You know, really

00:15:22.051 --> 00:15:26.080
interesting questions. I think the follow-up
to that one was, and what colors would you

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.810
choose? So it was a good mix and I decided
to do this test but I didn't want to send

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:34.530
it in unless I've done it perfectly because,
you know, man, Google. And there was a problem

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:40.800
on there which involved an infinite grid of
resistors. I don't know if anyone here has

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:50.320
done this. So, the problem was you have a
lattice of one-ohm resistors. So, each of

00:15:50.320 --> 00:16:01.750
these links represents a one-ohm resistor
and this goes out to infinity. The question

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:10.070
is: What is the equivalent resistance between
two points that are a knight's move away?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:16.300
I worked on this for awhile trying to find
some, you know--starting with a few resistors

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.260
and then adding them on and trying to find
some way to build a sequence that then could

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:28.770
be rolled up into some kind a recursive call
and evaluated in one way or another. And I

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.660
could not do it. You know, I was stuck. I
worked on that for a couple of days. Then

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.660
I went to one of physics professors and said,
"Okay. I've given up on solving this myself;

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.430
but do you want to see if we can work through
this together?" We filled the blackboard with

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:47.370
trying to find different, you know, approaches
to a simple solution using resistor addition.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:53.450
We couldn't do it. So, at that point, these
resistors dancing through my head, you know,

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.480
"Oh, we could add a layer like this, then
another layer, then another layer. Okay, how

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.050
does that change the equation? You have the
terms here. Oh, no..." So, all those are going

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.829
through my head. I'm finally, I'm like, okay,
I need to go look this up. I looked it online

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.680
and they were actually only a few pointers;
someone saying, "Oh, I think you can you can

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.020
find the result here in this paper." So, I
go to the library, you know, check out the

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:17.030
Journal of Physics—-a couple of relevant
articles and find this puzzle was only solved

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.770
in the last 30 years or so. It was solved
once in the late '60s with an extremely complicated

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:28.459
approach and then generalized—-someone in
the '90s found a good solution to it which

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:33.090
used--which was a simple solution by which
it means it still used math way beyond anything

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:42.090
I had run into. So, I was a little bit irritated
that this, you know, modern physics research

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:49.100
problem had been dropped in the Google labs
tests around other much simpler problems.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:57.780
But the side effect of this is—-so--and
I never actually finished the test; but what

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:06.640
did happened was—-so when I go into a bathroom,
you have a urinal here, you know, and the

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:22.170
flush
and there will be tiles.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.780
So I walked into the bathroom, stand in front
of the urinal, people always cluster around

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.450
me—-why do people-—people stand around
me and I'll be thinking, "Oh, man, there are

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.620
these people," and then I'll glance ahead
at the grid and I'll sort of, you know, just

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.620
idly thinking about grid, you know, chess
moves or I'll think, you know, I'll look at

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.100
two points that happen to be a knight's move
apart and then start to think like, "Okay.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.860
Well, maybe I missed something important.
What if you go back, what if you build the

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:53.580
grid this way, build..." And, by that time,
I've tuned out everything else and I can finally

00:18:53.580 --> 00:19:07.550
urinate. So thank you all for that. So, now,
if we can do questions from the audience;

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:13.140
I think there's a mike up here. If you can't
get to the mike, I can just repeat your question.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.530
But does anyone have anything to start us
off? Sure.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:34.860
&gt;&gt; MALE: Talking about acting out comics,
do you expect me to be able to fly?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:42.620
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: So, I started writing my first
python code. Okay. So, the question is, with

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.900
regards to acting out comics, should I expect
him to be able to fly? No. I started doing

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.600
python. I wrote my first python code sometime
within the last week or so, and drew the comic

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.630
immediately after the day when I had written.
There's something called Project Euler, which

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:06.030
is online--and I just realized that--so it's
a programming competition site where it has

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.410
a bunch of simple algorithms problems which
can be solved within one minute with a fairly

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.290
simple piece of code. And they're fun. It's
a good way to practice algorithms. You know,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.140
now that I am out of college, I don't have
those assigns so it's a neat source and it's

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.640
sort of competitive; you know, you race with
your friends. I just realized that by mentioning

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:28.030
this here, I may be dooming my standing. But--and
so I said, "Okay. I'm going to take this as

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:33.340
a chance to learn python," and it really was
this breath of fresh air because I learned

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:41.330
programming on old school, like, it was some
DOS-C compiler. And then I did Perl, which

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.771
is a lot more, you know, flexible and everything
just works but at least as ugly. And then

00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:50.090
I tried Python recently-—and, you know,
I understand there are some things that it's

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:54.890
not as great for, you know, as edge cases
that—-someone was complaining about splits

00:20:54.890 --> 00:21:00.720
and joints but, other than that, it was just
like, I can just type the pseudocode here

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.490
and it works. You know, it executes. I mean,
as someone said, that if python is basically

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:16.520
executable pseudocode and if that's the case,
then Perl is executable line noise. But, yeah,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.190
from what I hear, it is a library that you
can import; you just have to find it form

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.970
the anti-gravity library, you just have to
find it in direct repositories. Maybe that's

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:22.970
how Cory Doctorow gets to the balloon. Anyway,
do we have any other questions?

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:29.180
&gt;&gt; MALE: I'm going to ask you two questions;
and Ellen wants me to ask, ask one and then

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180
I want to ask another one. So the one that
I want to ask is: Have you thought about doing

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:48.360
animated cartoons? And Ellen's question is:
What is your n log log n algorithm for searching?

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:59.550
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Do you know who the questioner
is?

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:15.630
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Donald Knuth? Well, it's really
an honor to meet you, first of all. So, okay,

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:24.590
the second question was the n log-—what
is my n log n or log log n algorithm for searching.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:36.530
I'm sorry. You'll have to bring that up with
Elaine. The other--we're going to move away

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:47.929
for talking about searching algorithms for
a moment now. No, I just implemented binary

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:53.450
search in Python a day or two ago and I was
happy with that, you know. And the other question

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:59.040
is about animated cartoons which is—-it's
something I played with. I feel like though--if

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.020
anyone here has heard of Don Hertzfeldt's
Rejected, it was like one of the earlier viral

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.050
videos which he actually did as a short film.
You know, he's very upset when it's replayed

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:13.480
on the Internet, which he thinks it's, you
know, a resample and low quality and he wants

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.470
it to be on a--he has, you know, strong opinions
about stick-figure art, which I can certainly

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.760
understand. But I feel like, if I stepped
into animation, he has already done that perfectly.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:28.800
You know, it's a different genre. But I feel
like—-he can stick to that as long as he

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.720
doesn't start doing still-stick figure art
and show me up, I won't step into animation

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:40.630
and try to muddy his waters. But it's a very
different genre. You know, I don't know anything

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:46.320
about animation and how it works. I've watched,
you know, I watch animated TV shows and I've,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:56.350
you know, Futurama that we all sort of grew
up on. But, well, I mean, I grew up on it—-I

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:01.130
didn't see any of these until college but
I still think of it as, you know, sort foundational

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:08.180
parts of our culture like The Simpsons. But
I actually read a whole lot of comics, I was

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:13.100
never into anime but I read—-I grew up on
Calvin and Hobbes, first of all. It was the

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:21.150
first comic that I discovered. And I actually
remember the moment that I found this book

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.400
on my parent's bookshelf and took it down
and I had really never seen comics before.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.891
So, you know, I flipped it open. I said, "Okay,
there are pictures of people and there are

00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:31.510
words attached-—okay, so they're saying
this words." And I remember reading that first

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:36.350
strip where Calvin says, you know, "So long,
[INDISTINCT], I'll check my tiger trap." And

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.290
from then on, I was pretty much hooked. I
read all the Calvin and Hobbes strips. I went

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.049
to the library. I read all of-—there's a
whole set of comics where I've read every

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:48.830
single strip they've published mostly more
than once, which includes, you know, Calvin

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.170
and Hobbes. There's—-maybe not Bloom County--Garfield,
I really went through all the Garfield strips

00:24:54.170 --> 00:25:03.690
up until 1997. There was Dilbert, a whole
slew of other comics. And Peanuts, except

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:10.640
I'm pretty convinced that no one has read
all of Peanuts--the guy did him himself for

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.660
close to 50 years and doing every comic himself
which is completely unheard of. You know,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.290
everyone who has been doing them that long
has a staff at this point except--I mean,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:27.559
Bill Watterson did them all himself and Charles
Schulz. So he's really impressive. I'm reminded

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:34.340
of the anecdote actually about someone coming
up to Donald Knuth here at a party, I think

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:44.100
it was supposedly Steve Jobs, you know, maybe
you can verify this because on Wikipedia--now,

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.620
this story is on Wikipedia because I looked
this up and I think there us a citation needed

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:58.580
tag attached to it. But the story is that
someone, you know, came up to him at a party-—Steve

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.500
Jobs was with Bill Gates and said, "It's a
pleasure to meet you. I've read all your books,"

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:09.059
and that, you know, he replied with, "It's
nice to meet you. No, you haven't." You know,

00:26:09.059 --> 00:26:15.110
or "You're full of shit," something like that.
So, has this ever happened? I mean, now, the

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.630
thing is this is original research so I can't,
you know, ask you and then put it on the article

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.630
but maybe if this is being filmed.
&gt;&gt; KNUTH: Well, people tell me that all the

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:41.380
time and it might have been Steve, I don't
know, but I only met him a couple of times

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.000
and, in each case, I was impressed by him
probably more than he was impressed by me.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.390
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Yeah. He says, he's been retold
the story himself a number of times and that

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:54.780
he's met those people-—he isn't sure exactly
how exactly how it happened-—on each of

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.590
the meetings he was much more impressed by
them than they were by him which--so, yeah,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:05.240
I don't know, I don't know about that. But
maybe that's just Steve Jobs reality distortion

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:14.010
field kicking in. So the question started
out somewhere over by animation—-we can

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:20.190
wander back there too. It's interesting. There
are some trains that have advertisements in

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.780
the train tunnels where they'll—-as you
are going by, there is a strobe of some kind

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.874
so that you see out the window of the train,
one frame, the next frame, the next frame,

00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:32.720
the next frame and it makes a little movie.
And I knew some folks, who will remain nameless

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.070
who hang around MIT and were looking for interesting
pranks and were seeing if they could commission

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:47.790
me to do a 300-frame animation, which they
could then put on cards and tile the walls

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:55.320
with one night in one of the T-lines actually
and get it so that when you drove by one morning,

00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.100
you'd actually see animation. So that might
be the one place where you will see an xkcd

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.040
animation. You know, I don't know who's going
to be doing this or where or what but it was

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:11.150
definitely something I've started thinking
about. So, do we have another question? Right

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.110
here.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: How much time did you spend on

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.570
this?
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: How much time do I spend on this?

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.990
Well, first of all, about 90 percent—there's
a theory that your workload increases to fill

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:27.860
the amount of time that you have and I have
found I managed to use up all my time doing

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:34.050
xkcd-related things no matter how much free
time I managed to give myself. But the actual

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:54.740
comics sometimes take...
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: You can take your choice.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:29:02.221
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Now, so, is this coming from people
who are watching elsewhere or are this people

00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:04.460
in here just typing up here because that's
easier than talking?

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.840
&gt;&gt; MALE: Both.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Both.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.570
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Okay. Well, so as for the time,
I've actually—-there are a few comics. You

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.420
know, most the time, I'll write it and I can
take anywhere from, you know, days to a few

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.960
minutes. You know, sometimes, it's like, oh,
I'll just be walking along, talking to someone

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.450
and suddenly stop and be like, "I need to
put an S-fuel injection in a baby's name,"

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:32.330
yes, and you know, that will be where the
comic comes. And then, sometimes, I'll spend—-I

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:38.070
do all the comics at a very high resolution
actually and I'll spend, you know, six, eight,

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.620
ten hours just putting it all together, you
know, deciding, "Okay. I'll put this guy here,

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:49.169
have the dialogue here"; do all the arrangement
of that and especially when there's any of

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:54.190
the comics with the shaded background, there
was the one about the guy doing--falling asleep

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:59.919
reading a lisp book and waking up, you know,
floating in space with the blue lights and

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:04.600
everything. And I remember, I said, "Okay.
And I'll just add some shading and that ended

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.549
up taking me close to three or four hours
to get it all right." You know, I finished

00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:12.190
them and I'm like, "Oh, it looks too dark
over here" and then go back and work that.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:18.040
So, you know, I'll start off with the incredibly
rudimentary stick figures and then somehow

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.370
manage to be perfectionist about that. And
so it appears that we have questions coming

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:29.410
along here. Okay, if a raptor would attack
me in this room, how would I escape? There

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:39.380
is a lot of glass. I've noticed this coming
in. Anytime you have--and

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.880
if you go back to the source material on raptors
which is the original Jurassic Park movie,

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:49.200
there is the scene where they get the door--Elliot
gets the door locked. You know, it's a Unix

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.200
system. I know this and she navigates through,
locks the door and then the raptor--you know,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.520
it's all oh okay, we're all saved and then
a few moments later, the raptor cuts through

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:05.250
the glass. So my big concern has always been
glass, that if you can get all the big picture

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.440
windows, if you can get somewhere you don't
have any of those, you can lock and bar the

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.320
doors and buy yourself some time. So, from
here, I'd be basically trying to move to where

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.220
there's less open glass windows which means
away from there. I see light coming from there

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:25.160
that might be sunlight so probably through
there. This is if I were alone. However, it

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:37.000
occurs to me that there is a lot--between
me and any raptors, there is a great deal

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.941
of flesh. So, it's like the old joke goes,
I don't actually have to escape the, you know,

00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:51.980
outrun the raptors, I just have to outrun
you guys. So that would be my strategy. I

00:31:51.980 --> 00:32:01.820
don't know. Well, so, a lot of time, I'll
just sort of--I would look towards the ceilings.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.030
When I went to school, there were very high-ceiling
rooms but then again, as Muldoon said, they're

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:16.000
astonishing jumpers so that's also a problem.
You have to get pretty high up. So as far

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.421
as I'm concerned, you know, Jurassic Park
I is the great movie and then Two--Two was

00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:29.429
pretty entertaining. It had Jeff Goldblum
and everything. Then Three, I never realized

00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:34.350
that--I never thought that I could go to a
movie in which dinos--the only thing that

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:40.660
happens is the dinosaurs are chasing to eat
people and not be entertained because, really,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.460
I was like I want--you know, I was thinking,
I just want them to drop the plot and just

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:50.520
have, you know, an hour and a half of dinosaurs
chasing--what I need is a movie that's an

00:32:50.520 --> 00:33:04.210
hour and a half of River Tam beating up dinosaurs.
Oh, men. What secret project do you hope Google

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:09.330
is working on? Do you have any sort of an
animation or movie department? Because, right

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:17.320
now, that has taken precedence over anything
else that I was hoping that you were doing.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.850
So I'm going to do a question from in here.
You're right here, yes.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.930
&gt;&gt; MALE: So my favorite--one of my favorite
drawings of yours is the science one.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:34.240
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Which science one?
&gt;&gt; MALE: And I was wondering if you have ever

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.900
gotten any negative feedback on that.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Once or twice, there's a--some

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.500
people have really worn the shirt. You know,
it's generally pretty well-received. People

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:46.570
don't tend to, you know, if they see something
that bothers them. They tend to just sort

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.789
of leave the person alone. I did have someone
who is on a train station, somewhere pretty

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:56.770
conservative, who said that they had been
stopped by, you know, a very upstanding looking

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:03.429
mother saying, "I'm offended. You wear that
shirt where my kids might see it, you know",

00:34:03.429 --> 00:34:11.470
and the person said, "Well, I'm not sure which
word are you offended by, bitches or science?"

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:19.350
But, generally, it's going pretty well, you
know. Now and then, I'll have someone who--and

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:24.280
this is especially with people, you know,
from a generation above me who say, you know,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:30.670
the bitches and worry about the sexism there.
For my--sometime in the last, you know, couple

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:35.429
of decades, bitches really translated to--it's
no longer really a term of strong gender connotations;

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:44.270
it's just an expression of sort of triumphant
superiority. But I think it has really drifted

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.179
away from its original meaning, you know,
and people don't think gender when they hear

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:53.800
that, at least, you know, the people who I'm
used to talking to--people my age. Let's see,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.980
that--so, overall, that shirt has been pretty
well-received. Sometimes, people write in

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:02.071
and say, you know, this shirt, you know, it's
just insulting to women how, you know, your

00:35:02.071 --> 00:35:06.740
readers might wear this but don't, you know,
I don't like it very much because I think

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.760
that women don't appreciate this and I can
always point out, you know, I sell--that shirt,

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.160
I think, might be are--the one that we sell
to more women proportionally than any other

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:42.261
shirt. So, you know, there's that. Okay, what's
this? How did this get here? This was like

00:35:42.261 --> 00:35:57.680
two nights ago on a piece of paper. I'm going
to talk with someone here. Okay, now, we can

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:05.099
see--okay, here is--so it starts off, I think
my best time came 1:11 so that's after I had

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:09.710
had--this is after the first drink had kicked
in and I had the second one. Possibly, I have

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:18.800
to figure out with the scales. I didn't type
this--I don't know where this came from. So,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.190
every now and then, and someone had mentioned
this, you know, "Your comics are so close

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:26.359
to my life, you know, are you somehow spying
on me to get all of these things?" Or I'll

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:29.290
have people write in every now and then saying,
"I know everyone says that but, seriously,

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:34.340
this latest comic, do you know someone I know,
are you spying on me?" I'm not spying on you

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:46.840
guys but, apparently, you guys are spying
on me. So unfortunately, we couldn't hold

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.690
the drink steady and we couldn't--what I really
wanted to do is do this with a BAC meter which

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.540
I've done to play with before--we didn't have
when we were doing this. I saw actually last

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.030
night, it went up on Woot.com right after,
you know, we had finished the project. And

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.830
so it was a shame--we could--I could repeat
the project with that although I think, the

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.950
morning after, I made some resolution. You
know, it says I'm never going to drink again.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:17.609
No, I'll probably drink again. I'm not going
to do the Rubik's cube project again. But

00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:27.140
I don't remember saying any of these things--wow,
okay. So here's our data which, you know,

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.880
we're putting together, you know, graphing
it. I'll probably use a BAC calculator of

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.940
some kind, you know, with my weight and try
to work out, you now, how much alcohol is

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.960
in the system and get the best data that we
can out of this. I don't know where you submit

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.020
this kind of thing for peer review. I guess
the--I was going to say the [INDISTINCT] Research

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:54.970
which is a wonderful publication. I actually
just go to the Ig-Nobel Prizes recently. I

00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:01.390
think it's something like the 30-something
first annual Ig-Nobel prizes. Do we have any

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.869
another question?
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Hey, so I think probably my favorite

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:07.871
comic is the one where, you know, a girl and
a guy busted on a guy on the Internet and,

00:38:07.871 --> 00:38:15.790
basically, they shoot up his computer with
an EMP blast.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:21.540
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: That's the first comic where I've
had someone stop me on the street and hug

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.369
me. I was really, like when I finished that,
I was like, you know, I feel strongly about

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:30.340
this because I've been in an iron seat for
so long and, you know, this just drives me

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:35.010
nuts the way, like you can come on, depending
on how gendered your nick is, you get treated

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.350
completely differently by people who should
know better, you know, by people who have--it

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.730
has been a generation since the biggest, you
know, the 60s and the feminism and so on,

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.910
and it's like it has turned ironic now, but
they still do it and it's not any better.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.730
And so that, and I was just--I spend a long
time on that one trying to figure that exactly,

00:38:54.730 --> 00:39:00.360
you know, how to say it as concisely as I
can, you know, in a comic. And I was really

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.220
worried that I hadn't, you know, it hadn't
hit, that people wouldn't get what I was saying

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:08.440
or think that I was to being to preachy or
something, but then the response has been

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.680
great. So...
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Yeah, I was just going to ask if,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680
like, all of your female friends, I don't
know how many female friends you had, but

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680
you're like, beating you over the friend.
Hey, you know...

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.680
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: I'm just saying because me and

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:30.220
all my female geek friends, like, "Oh, my
God, I love that comic. It's exactly what

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:37.480
I want to do." Yes, yes, exactly.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: How did you get to that drawing?

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:46.620
I did that drawing but--the paper for that
is at home. How did it get on the Internet?

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.080
It's interesting. Actually, the first IRC
Channel--oh, man, why am I telling this story?

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:57.000
The first IRC Channel I hung out in was actually
majority female. It was a strong majority

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.849
female. I was there socially. You know, I
had some friends who wanted into this but

00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:12.970
it was--so it was actually a fan fiction IRC
channel, erotic fan fiction. You know, I was

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.980
really, you know, I didn't really read the
fiction but I got to know the people there.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:21.160
They were all lovely people, you know, and
then I moved from there into the larger IRC

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.270
where it's a little bit more gender-balanced
or, you know, gender-skewed the other way

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:31.860
which is where I've been lurking since. But
it was always interesting, you know, and there's

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:36.510
that mean that's going around now, there are
no girls on the Internet in various forms

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.730
which, you know, it was sort of funny when
you joked about it for a second and now it

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:45.130
has become like a thing people think every
time a girl comes into a channel. You know,

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.720
anytime there's anyone with a feminine nick
and they make the joke about like a girl on

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:53.890
the Internet, that's impossible. And the people
who use IRC with androgynous nicks in any

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:58.440
of the channels where I am, just get treated
completely differently and that generally

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.960
sucks; and I think it's people who really,
it's not people who are so much prejudice

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.830
as that they don't know any better at this
point. You know, I think we've gotten over

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:12.160
a lot of, what sexes I'm used to be and we're
on to a much more modern, refined form of

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:18.970
sexism. But I think--and I feel like we're
actually at the point now where a gentle reminder

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.260
might be all that's needed to make a decent
change because that's what I was sort of hoping

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.089
to do with that.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: I thought the EMP kind of...

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:32.460
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Yeah. Well, a gentle reminder as
a first warning and then the second warning

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:44.990
is the EMP Canon. So, next question. The top
one. Hey, you said I could pick my own. I

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.010
actually noticed that Chris once said of Christ
Onset [ph] of Aikwood did a Google logo, at

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:56.200
one point, drew it out of the characters.
So let's see. I'm going to get, I'm going

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:02.120
to think about this one for a moment and I
wanted to go down, though, to one of these

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:07.869
other questions. Visit the office at Cambridge?
Okay, we lived nearby and we have Guitar Hero.

00:42:07.869 --> 00:42:18.930
Okay, I'm sold. Yes, so Guitar Hero Three
and Rock Band are both out now--I have been

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:25.599
looking at--okay, well, so, yeah, well, Rock
Band Three and Guitar Hero, I've played both

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:30.800
of them. The impression I get is that Guitar
Hero Three is not done by the same group as,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.680
I think, Harmonics. Like, most of them have
left and worked on Rock Band and then three

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:43.300
is actually the one that's--it's a lot more
produced by executives and marketing and not

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.670
quite so much fun. So I've been--and I've
enjoyed what I see at Rock Band a lot more

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:54.349
so I guess that's the one that I have to learn;
although I'm enjoying--I don't like learning

00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:58.580
new things, I don't know. So I've been playing
Guitar Hero Two over and over and trying to

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.550
get all those songs and I've got some of the
mod-ed songs. I've had a wish list for a long

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:07.530
time of songs that I wanted to see in Guitar
Hero. And they got a couple of them; Free

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.970
Bird is a great one. I've also thought that
Flight of the Bumble Bee would make a great

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:18.330
Guitar Hero song. It would be like Misirlou
but, you know, three times as fast.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:22.390
&gt;&gt; MALE: Put in your helmet and become real.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Yeah, well, some people are actually

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:26.560
now doing these mod-ed discs so I need to
find a PlayStation that can play those. What

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:34.030
I found--I find someone has done another one
off my wish list which is Dueling Banjos which

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.880
is, like, you know, three or four minutes.
So, okay, this is easy, you know. And I love

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.730
to play it for someone who has never heard
the song or, you know, doesn't know it because,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:47.831
you know, it's three minutes of just, you
know like, okay. And that goes on and on,

00:43:47.831 --> 00:43:52.480
and on and on and then, suddenly, "Oh, God
it's covered in notes, you know. And so I'm--hopefully,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.800
we get a chance to play that soon. And I also
wanted The Devil went down to Georgia. It

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.850
was another one on my wish list. And that's
in Guitar Hero Three but they've also--they

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.650
got all these crazy stuff they're adding,
you know, with, you do this combo to get this

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:11.150
thing and you have to play certain sequences
of notes--any there are lots of trigger bonuses

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.790
and you get random things and it seems like
they've complicated it a lot more from just

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:19.240
like--I just like to play the notes in the
original song. It's plenty fast on the guitar.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.410
That's the challenge I like.
&gt;&gt; MALE: It's downloadable in normal form.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:29.770
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: So let's see. Am I spying on you?
This was established. You guys are the one

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:38.690
spying on me. And what does xkcd really stand
for? Actually, so I've been using that as

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:43.960
just a unique point in the space of four character
strings to point to me. You know, I've been

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.830
using it as my name on every service box,
you know, since at least the 90s, and because

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.640
I got tired of changing my name every time
my interest changed. You know, I started out

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.890
when I was 10 years old when AOL first popped
up and I was on there as, you know, I think

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:04.150
I had, first, skywalker4 and then, anamorph7,
and then, you know, I picked other names that

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.900
had to do with, like Redtailedhawk6 or something.
And then, eventually, I was like I'm tired

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.480
of names that point to other things, you know,
that identify me with those things. I want

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.721
to get a string that will just point uniquely
to me that's not my name because, you know,

00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:23.310
that's kind of boring. And so I--and I decided
to just go through--to generate random strings

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:28.180
and find one that had a certain set of qualities
which included none of the letters could be

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:33.619
mistaken for other letters in either case
or, you know, numbers, so no L because L,

00:45:33.619 --> 00:45:40.780
lower-cased, can look like IR1; and it couldn't
have any obvious acronym decoding. It couldn't

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.089
be--or be an existing acronym, and it couldn't
be pronounceable because, then, it would sound

00:45:45.089 --> 00:45:48.080
like words. And, you know, it would sound
like a word and people would think of other

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.890
words like it. So I--and I searched though
a bunch of names that weren't taken—-until

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:56.210
I found one that wasn't taken on all the services
I wanted. So I've used that to sign up on

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:01.640
every service except I ran into—-I've ran
into--I ran into one that really--that really

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.530
bothered me that would not let me register
names under six characters.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:14.640
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: It's possible.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Okay. And then I figured now--but

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.810
the thing is, now, that doesn't uniquely point
to me anymore. You know, I had this whole

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.800
idea, "Okay. I'll have this--this will be
a unique identifier for me or for me only.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.030
Like, when I Google it, it will only turn
up things related to me or, occasionally,

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:33.170
a binary file that happens to ask you to xkcd.
You know, when I started xkcd, I remember

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:39.530
there were--when I started the comic, there
were, I think, something 3 or 400 Google hits

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:45.420
for the string xkcd, and about half of those
were message boards so things that I had something

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:51.730
to do within the last year or two, and the
rest data files that just happened to contain

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:58.170
the string and set into a larger set of random
strings. And so I've gotten to track my--the

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:05.590
comic's progress by xkcd search results climbing,
and they jump up and down wildly. I mean,

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.000
I don't know—-it's like, you know, they're
climbing and climbing, and then, suddenly,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.310
it will drop off sharply, you know, to half
the size, and I--it seems that someone was

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.450
tweaking the algorithm because people generally
take, you know, pages take a little bit of

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:23.200
time to fall off. But I think it's at something
like 2 or 3 million now, which is--and I noticed

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.340
recently—-oh, and then these Google trends,
I don't know if--I don't know if I'm on the

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:32.300
search results. What I did notice was after
I did the comic recently where I mentioned

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:43.710
a couple of the--oh, okay.
Right here was where I left NASA because,

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:46.770
at that point, I was like, "Okay. This is
big enough. You know, I can do this now."

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:54.630
Man. The comic officially started here. This
is something--I found this on Wikipedia, not

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:58.780
sourced or anything giving me, telling me
things about the comic that I'm pretty sure

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.940
aren't true like that I started in, you know,
May of 2005. I'm pretty sure I started at

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:09.990
September 2005, but--and then I put up a few
comics, you know, this was just my personal

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:16.380
site, stopped it and then restarted it seriously
here, and since then, it has fit an exponential

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.609
growth curve pretty well. We actually found
out it fits the logistic curve better of the

00:48:20.609 --> 00:48:25.579
basic curve you can fit it to; the visits
per, you know, day, visits per month. The

00:48:25.579 --> 00:48:31.530
thing is, each month, the logistic curve that
it fits is bigger. So I'm not quite sure what

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:37.250
to make of that. You know, clearly, we need
some more sophisticated analysis. And I'm

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:43.420
trying to remember, this is related to something.
I think that's the map of--the map of online

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.780
communities; that spike right there. We've
had a couple of comics that I put up that

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:54.650
just sort of like--that I got feedback within
a few minutes. I got some e-mails and I mean--I

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:58.839
was like, "Oh, boy, this is--this one--this
is going to be another one of those ones that,

00:48:58.839 --> 00:49:08.160
you know, shows everywhere." The first one
that happened was the Sudo Make Me A Sandwich.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.940
And it just blew my mind to see people who
were taking pictures, probably, none in here;

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:16.160
it's fairly strict about picture-taking, but
there was one about--there was one--someone

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.260
had drawn it up on the wall of Amazon—-at
Amazon, and it was, I think, at Microsoft

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.690
too although, I mean, Microsoft, why would
they be interested in Sudo? Didn't it come

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:30.520
out recently that the--not recently, a couple
of years ago that the server that Microsoft

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:36.560
is using to distribute one of the--to talk
about one of their server products was actually

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.260
using Apache.
&gt;&gt; MALE: No. But I think they're using Acamine

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.769
[ph] attaches.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Oh.

00:49:41.769 --> 00:49:45.820
&gt;&gt; MALE: It wasn't really then.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Okay. I didn't know what the back

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.000
story was behind it. Are you sure there's
Google in Braille?

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.740
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yes.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Nice. I did--I did actually learn

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:57.820
to read Braille at one point, you know, slowly
and--I had a little card in my wallet so when

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.030
I was--when I was waiting outside somewhere,
I would, you know, find the Braille signs

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:07.060
and just try to figure out, basically, decoding
it, like a substitution cipher, and to work

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.940
out what each of the characters mean. It's
tricky though because normal written Braille

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:15.470
does a whole bunch of packing where they'll
have several characters compressed into, you

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:19.340
know, every one character to stand for common
things like TH. I don't think TH might have

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.500
one; but, you know, other characters like
that which made it a little bit trickier,

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:28.770
but it's a lot of fun. And you can look for
discrepancies between the messages that are--that

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:33.190
are written in the Braille messages. Like,
for example, they say, you know, "For help,

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:36.520
push red button." That's when where I found
it, and then I read Braille, and it said,

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:40.320
"For help, push three-inch button." Because,
obviously, you know, if you're reading the

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.084
Braille, you're going to have trouble seeing
it's a red button. And that made a lot of

00:50:43.084 --> 00:50:49.510
sense. I just never really thought about that.
Oh, the Braille is, as I understand, fading

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:55.700
away now because of the Internet, and because
of computers are so cool that everyone can

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:01.349
just use Text-To-Speech for so much stuff.
And I know a couple of blind hackers who are

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:05.710
doing all these useful stuff that would have
been so much harder to do, you know, even

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:13.940
10 years ago, which is really cool. Now...
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: Question there.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:22.410
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Yes. So--oh, yes, I'm sorry. You
asked earlier.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.983
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: I guess I should have worn something
brighter. I'm just wondering how you feel

00:51:23.983 --> 00:51:24.983
about comic scrapers?
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Comic scrapers, I am happy for

00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:30.690
anyone to read the comic basically through
any means. You know, I--we encourage hotlinking;

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.640
unlike many other comics and many older sites
because--I think it's because people are finally

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:40.109
figuring out the easier you make it for people
to locate your stuff, the better you're going

00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:43.250
to do online. And, you know, people say, "Oh,
well, you have to come to this site. You have

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.680
to register to view this or you have to pay,
you know, this minor fee. Like, publicity

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.810
and wide readership is worth so much more
than any of the things you get out of that

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:55.740
that I just try to set things up so it's as
easy as possible for people to read the comic--to

00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:01.079
copy and read the comics anywhere, which is,
you know, the idea behind Creative Commons.

00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:06.190
I think, right now, the xkcd comic directory
is publicly indexable, which I didn't have

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:09.440
any real reason for that, but I figured, if
someone finds a way to play with that to make

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.460
the comics reachable through another thing,
great. You know, as long as they're linking

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.680
back to the site and pointing to where it
came from, I'm happy with—-I'm happy for

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:21.200
that, you know. I know that there's RSS readers
that just pulled down ridiculous amounts of

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.589
content and then leave them on your laptop,
and I'll do that when I'm flying on a plane.

00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:27.960
You know, I'll just pull down the last month's
worth of feeds from all those places and then

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.480
that would be my reading material. So I'm
happy with any kind of scraping that people

00:52:31.480 --> 00:53:15.520
want to do. You know, if there's anything
that we don't support, we're looking at implanting

00:53:15.520 --> 00:54:11.140
that.
&gt;&gt; NORVIG: WE have time for one more question.

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:46.839
What--were you going to do the doodle?
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Well, let's see. I would--so I

00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:54.730
had this problem that I ran into with and
effects the comic has had on my social life

00:54:54.730 --> 00:55:03.810
which is that when I meet new people, I don't
realize always, they already know all my jokes.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:08.270
And I will know nothing about someone, and
so I'll be going out, you know, and start

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.000
doing a story, you know. Yeah, when I'm hanging
out somewhere like this, I always choreograph

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.970
these elaborate fight scenes in my head, and
I'm like, we know. So I've always wanted to

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:22.190
see this movie that has—-that's just someone
fighting for... We'll have--we'll have someone

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:29.550
here who's just sort of concerned by this
whole thing. Yeah. And then, what can we have

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:33.540
someone doing?
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: [INDISTINCT].

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:46.890
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: We're going to have this. Let's
see. What is this person doing? So what's

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.650
another—-what's another weapon?
&gt;&gt; MALE: The nunchucks.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:56.470
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Oh, we need the nunchucks.
&gt;&gt; MALE: The stars.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:03.630
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: Has anyone played with those rings
that are—-it's like a cylinder with wavy

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.349
edges that you're supposedly can throw hundreds
and hundreds of yards?

00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:08.260
&gt;&gt; MALE: Yes.
&gt;&gt; MUNROE: I've been meaning to try that because

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.329
that--that sounds fun. There are all these
kids' toys now that actually--that actually

00:56:12.329 --> 00:56:46.079
work. You know, let's see. Does it have a
launcher or is it--was I doing it wrong? Okay.

00:56:46.079 --> 00:57:03.819
And he is thinking about cake. Let's see.
And then let's see if we can fit this here.

00:57:03.819 --> 00:57:12.480
Is this--is this gaffer tape, acrylic [ph]
tape or duct tape? And,

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:21.990
now, we'll have another concerned person here.
No, no, you know, what we have here is--so

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:40.410
she has been at it awhile so we'll have a
dead body.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:58:28.230
And then he is thinking about--here we go.
