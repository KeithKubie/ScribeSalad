00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:05.729
One of the most basic facts about the human condition is that we know ourselves from the inside?

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:13.529
But we know others only from what they choose or are able to tell us a far more limited an edited set of data

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:21.629
We are continuously and intimately exposed to our own worries hopes desires and memories many of which feel

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.899
Overwhelmingly intense strange vulnerable, or sad yet when it comes to other people

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.469
We're tightly restricted to knowing them through their public pronouncements to what they can or choose to reveal

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.749
The hints and clues we're left to play with are hugely imperfect guides to the reality of another person's existence

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.079
The result of what we termed this psychological

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.389
Asymmetry is that we almost always think of ourselves as far more peculiar

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.530
Shameful and alarming than other people we run into our

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.579
experiences of anxiety anger Envy sex and distress

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.619
Appear to be so much more intense and disturbing than those of anyone in the vicinity

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.189
We art of course in truth really so odd. We just know a lot more about who we are

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.529
The results of psychological asymmetry are loneliness and shyness

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.689
We are beset by loneliness because we cannot imagine that others long and desire

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.860
Envy and hate crave and weep as we do we feel ourselves cast out into a world of strangers

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:37.319
Inherently different from everyone we live alongside and potentially fundamentally offensive to all those who might know us properly

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.599
it appears in dark moments that no one could possibly both know and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.920
like us

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.540
We also get shy easily intimidated by people who we assume cannot share in our vulnerabilities

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.229
And whom we imagine would be entirely unable to relate to the petty

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.229
grand perverse or idealistic thoughts that pass moment by moment through our minds if

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.180
We reach important positions

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.629
We feel like imposters beset by an impression that our quirks separate us from others who have occupied

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.940
comparable roles in the past

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.859
We grow boring and conventional mimicking the externals of other people on the false assumption that this is what they might truly be like inside

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.070
The solutions to psychological asymmetry lie in two places art and love

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.469
art provides us with accurate portrayals of the inner lives of strangers and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.610
With Grace and compelling charm shows us how much they share in troubles and hopes we thought we might be alone in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.950
experiencing and love gives us an occasional deeply precious sense of security to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.270
Reveal who we really are to another person and the opportunity to learn about their reality from a position of extreme

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.740
secure proximity

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.510
To overcome the effects of psychological asymmetry we must constantly trust especially in the absence of any evidence

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.820
That everyone is likely to be far closer to what we are that is far

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.849
Shyer more scared more worried and more incomplete than they are to resemble the personas

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.100
They show to the world we are

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.780
Fortunately not any of us quite as odd or quite as special as we might assume or fear

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.540
At the School of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.760
To that end we've also created a whole range of products to support that growth
