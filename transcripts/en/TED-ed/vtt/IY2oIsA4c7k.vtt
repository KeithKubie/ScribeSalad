00:00:02.518 --> 00:00:06.337
The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.398
Turning and turning in the widening gyre

00:00:10.398 --> 00:00:14.310
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.579
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.099
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.749
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
and everywhere

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.939
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.510
The best lack all conviction,
while the worst

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.489
Are full of passionate intensity.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.928
Surely some revelation is at hand;

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:50.689
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:55.038
The Second Coming! 
Hardly are those words out

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.658
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:03.026
Troubles my sight: somewhere
in sands of the desert

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.698
A shape with lion body 
and the head of a man,

00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:10.658
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:15.199
Is moving its slow thighs, 
while all about it

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:22.239
Reel shadows of
the indignant desert birds.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:27.899
The darkness drops again; but now I know

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.529
That twenty centuries of stony sleep

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:35.208
Were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:39.857
And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:44.959
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
