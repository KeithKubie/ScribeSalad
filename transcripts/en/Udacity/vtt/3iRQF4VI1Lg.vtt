00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.280
Okay, why don't we work through an example. Let's say

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.220
we had a CSV file located at this directory, and that

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.080
it contained a number of columns. Among them are a player's

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.130
name. We call that column, name. There's also a column called

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.770
handedness, L for left-handed R for right-handed, and a column

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.770
for the player's career batting average, called avg. Write a function

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.350
that will read that data into a Pandas data frame, and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.310
then run Welch's t-test on the two cohorts defined by handedness.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.900
With a significance level of 95%, if there

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.040
is no difference between the two cohorts, return

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.890
a tuple consisting of true, and then the

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.580
tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest. If there is a difference,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.910
return a tuple consisting of false, and then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.710
the tuple returned by scipy.stats.ttest. So an example of

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.010
what your output might look like is false

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.390
and then the tuple 0.405, 0.006. Your code should

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.850
go here. Since we're using Welch's t-test, we're assuming our data

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.680
is sampled at random and that both samples follow a normal

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.880
distribution. We don't make any assumptions about the variance of both

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.750
samples. They may be the same, but they also may be different.
