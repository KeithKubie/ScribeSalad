00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's work through another
few scenarios involving

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.860
displacement, velocity, and
time, or distance, rate,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.050
and time.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.450
So over here we have, Ben is
running at a constant velocity

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.370
of three 3 meters per
second to the east.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.940
And just as a review,
this is a vector quantity.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.170
They're giving us the
magnitude and the direction.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.490
If they just said 3
meters per second,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.550
then that would just be speed.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.050
So this is the magnitude,
is 3 meters per second.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.480
And it is to the east.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630
So they are giving
us the direction.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.620
So this is a vector quantity.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.090
And that's why it's
velocity instead of speed.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.400
How long will it take
him to travel 720 meters.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.820
So let's just remind
ourselves a few things.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.389
And I'll do it both with
the vector version of it.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.180
And maybe they should
say, how long will it

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.660
take them to travel
720 meters to the east,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.599
to make sure, to make it clear,
that it is a vector quantity.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.890
So that it's displacement,
as opposed to just distance,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.570
but we'll do it both ways.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.250
So one way to think about it, if
we think about just the scalar

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
version of it, we said
already that rate or speed

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.060
is equal to the distance that
you travel over some time.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.420
I might write t there.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.960
But it's really
a change in time.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.251
So sometimes some people
would write a little triangle,

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:32.340
a delta there, which
means change in time.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280
But that's implicitly
meant when you just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.950
write over time like that.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.420
So rate or speed is equal
to distance divided by time.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.086
Now, if you know-- they're
giving us in this problem,

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:44.210
they're giving us the rate.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.460
If we think about the
scalar part of it,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.480
they're telling us that
that is 3 meters per second.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.759
And they're also
telling us the time.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550
Or, sorry, they're not
telling us the time.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.340
They are telling
us the distance,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.580
and they want us to
figure out the time.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.075
So they tell us the
distance is 720 meters.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.870
And so we just have to
figure out the time.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.699
we So if we just do the
scalar version of it,

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.740
we're not dealing with
velocity and displacement.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.650
We're dealing with the
rate or speed and distance.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.560
So we have 3 meters
per second is

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.857
equal to 720 meters over
some change in time.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.690
And so we can algebraically
manipulate this.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.850
We can multiply both
sides times time.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.240
Multiply time right over there.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.697
And then we could,
if we all-- well,

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:44.280
let's just take it
one step at a time.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:03:00.490
So 3 meters per second times
time is equal to 720 meters

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.930
because the times on the
right will cancel out

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.990
right over there.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.800
And that makes sense,
at least units-wise,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.480
because time is going
to be in seconds,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.620
seconds cancel out the
seconds in the denominator,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.710
so you'll just get meters.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.226
So that just makes sense there.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.600
So if you want to
solve for time,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.210
you can divide both sides
by 3 meters per second.

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:25.990
And then the left
side, they cancel out.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.320
On the right hand
side, this is going

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.170
to be equal to 720
divided by 3 times meters.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.670
That's meters in the numerator.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.870
And you had meters per
second in the denominator.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.520
If you bring it out
to the numerator,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.750
you take the inverse of this.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.840
So that's meters-- let me do
the meters that was on top,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
let me do that in green.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.715
Let me color code it.

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:50.570
So 720 meters.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.520
And now you're dividing
by meters per second.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.020
That's the same
thing as multiplying

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.649
by the inverse, times
seconds per meters.

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.190
And so what you're
going to get here,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.648
the meters are
going to cancel out,

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:04.770
and you'll get 720
divided by 3 seconds.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.890
So what is that?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.650
720 divided by 3.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.650
72 divided by 3 is 24.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.230
So this is going to be 240.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.010
This part right over
here is going to be 240.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.339
And it's going to
be 240 seconds.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.230
That's the only unit
we're left with,

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.670
and on the left hand side,
we just had the time.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.700
So the time is 240 seconds.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.214
Sometimes you'll see it.

00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:32.130
And just to show you,
in some physics classes,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.090
they'll show you
all these formulas.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.964
But one thing I really
want you to understand

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:37.380
as we go through this
journey together,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.050
is that all of those
formulas are really

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.500
just algebraic
manipulations of each other.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.700
So you really shouldn't
memorize any of them.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.325
You should always
say, hey, that's just

00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:48.080
manipulating one of those other
formulas that I got before.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.500
And even these formulas are,
hopefully, reasonably common

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.000
sense.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.166
And so you can start from
very common sense things--

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.100
rate is distance
divided by time--

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.660
and then just
manipulate it to get

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.911
other hopefully
common sense things.

00:04:58.911 --> 00:05:00.160
So we could have done it here.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.470
So we could have multiplied
both sides by time

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.400
before we even put
in the variables,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.540
and you would have gotten--
So if you multiplied

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.100
both sides by time here,
you would have got,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.400
on the right hand side, distance
is equal to time times rate,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.370
or rate times time.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.250
And this is one
of-- you'll often

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.350
see this as kind of
the formula for rate,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.740
or the formula for motion.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.030
So if we flip it around, you get
distance is equal to rate times

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.780
time.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.652
So these are all
saying the same things.

00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:32.360
And then if you wanted
to solve for time,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.290
you could divide
both sides by rate,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.020
and you get distance divided
by rate is equal to time.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.720
And that's exactly what we got.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.240
Distance divided by
rate was equal to time.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.150
So if your distance
is 720 meters,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.800
your rate is 3
meters per second,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.090
720 meters divided by
3 meters per second

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.350
will also give you a
time of 240 seconds.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.240
If we wanted to do
the exact same thing,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.705
but the vector version
of it, just the notation

00:05:57.705 --> 00:05:59.080
will look a little
bit different.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.050
And we want to keep track
of the actual direction.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.000
So we could say we
know that velocity--

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.870
and it is a vector quantity,
so I put a little arrow on top.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.320
Velocity is the same
thing as displacement.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.890
Let me pick a nice color
for displacement-- blue.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.230
As displacement-- Now, remember,
we use s for displacement.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.179
We don't want to
use d because when

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:24.970
you start doing calculus,
especially vector

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.680
calculus-- well, any
type of calculus--

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.275
you use d for the
derivative operator.

00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:30.900
If you don't know what that is,
don't worry about it right now.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.695
But this right here,
s is displacement.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.620
At least this is convention.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.020
You could kind of use
anything, but this

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.020
is what most people use.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.980
So if you don't want
to get confused,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.146
or if you don't want to be
confused when they use s,

00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:44.290
it's good to practice with it.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.510
So it's the
displacement per time.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.690
So it's displacement
divided by time.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.920
Sometimes, once again,
you'll have displacement

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.910
per change in time,
which is really

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.342
a little bit more correct.

00:06:54.342 --> 00:06:56.050
But I'll just go with
the time right here

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.690
because this is the convention
that you see, at least in most

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.590
beginning physics books.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.580
So once again, if we
want to solve for time,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.100
you can multiply
both sides by time.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.904
And you get-- this cancels
out-- and I'll flip this around.

00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:11.570
Well, actually, I'll
leave it like this.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.050
So you get displacement
is equal to-- I

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.579
can flip these around--
velocity times change in time,

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:23.120
I should say.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.328
Or we could just say time
just to keep things simple.

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:26.820
And if you want
to solve for time,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.375
you divide both
sides by velocity.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.750
And then that gives you time
is equal to displacement

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.629
divided by velocity.

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:39.670
And so we can apply that
to this right over here.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.070
Our displacement is
720 meters to the east.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.990
So in this case, our time
is equal to 720 meters

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.190
to the east.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.980
720 meters east is
our displacement,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.140
and we want to divide that
by the given velocity.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.310
Well, they give us the
velocity of 3 meters

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.610
per second per the east.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:12.470
And once again, 720 divided
by 3 will give you 240.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.885
And then when you take
meters in the numerator,

00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:17.343
and you divide by
meters per second

00:08:17.343 --> 00:08:19.676
in the denominator, that's
the same thing as multiplying

00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:21.790
by seconds per meter,
those cancel out.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.440
And you are just left
with seconds here.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.860
One note I want to give you.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.650
In the last few problems, I've
been making vector quantities

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.993
by saying to the
east, or going north.

00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:32.409
And what you're
going to see as we

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.130
go into more complex problems--
and this is what you might see

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.730
in typical physics
classes, or typical books,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.440
is that you define a convention.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.570
That maybe you'll say, the
positive direction, especially

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.660
when we're just dealing
with one dimension,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.500
whether you can either
go forward or backwards,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.684
or left or right.

00:08:49.684 --> 00:08:51.350
We'll talk about other
vector quantities

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.280
when we can move in two
or three dimensions.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.210
But they might take
some convention,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.780
like positive means maybe
you're moving to the east,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.890
and maybe negative means
you're moving to the west.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.220
And so that way-- well,
in the future, we'll see,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.610
the math will
produce the results

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.960
that we see a little bit better.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.140
So this would just be
a positive 720 meters.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.787
This would be a positive
3 meters per second.

00:09:17.787 --> 00:09:19.870
And that implicitly tells
us that that's the east.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.820
If it was negative, it
would then be to the west.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.770
Something to think about.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.978
We're going to start exploring
that a little bit more

00:09:24.978 --> 00:09:26.220
in future videos.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.889
And maybe we might say positive
is up, negative is down,

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:29.430
or who knows.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.888
There's different
ways to define it

00:09:30.888 --> 00:09:34.590
when you're dealing
in one dimension.
