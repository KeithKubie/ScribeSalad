00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer here is that greedy chooses 20 vertices. Why is that?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well first of all, greedy will choose the 8 vertices that I added down here because

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
they have the largest number of edges attached to them, which is this one, this one,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this one, you get the picture. So we'll choose 8 vertices down here. And then

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
after that the whole bottom part here of the network will be covered so it will then

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
proceed as it did before. It will choose these 12 here.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that makes a total of 20 vertices.
