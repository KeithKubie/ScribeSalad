00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.870
Over 99% of the animal species that have ever
lived are now extinct. And sometimes, an event

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.350
occurs causing changes so drastic that most
species are completely wiped out within a

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.519
short period of time. So here are the 5 most
incredible mass extinctions ever to occur,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.470
and a look at whether the 6th might be happening
right now.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.770
440 million years ago was the The Ordovician
extinction. At that time, most creatures swam

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.210
or crawled in shallow seas. As newly created
volcanic rock was worn down by water and wind,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.989
it reacted with CO2 and absorbed it. As a result, carbon
dioxide levels dropped, temperatures fell

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.129
and water got locked away as ice. This caused
ocean levels to drop and shallow seas to drain

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.359
and after several cycles of growing and shrinking
glaciers, about 86 per cent of species were

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.889
lost forever.

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:51.549
Then over millions of years the oceans slowly
repopulated with fish and the land was colonized

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.339
by early plants. These plants were then eaten
by the first crawling and flying insects.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.030
Then 374 million years ago these new plants
contributed to the next mass extinction. The

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.910
plants absorbed enough C02 to create another
round of global cooling. They changed soil

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.610
causing nutrients to wash into the ocean creating
enormous amounts of algae which sucked up

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.390
oxygen. More than half of ocean species essentially
choked to death. Although somewhere in the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.530
world, a small family of fish with foot-like
fins and lungs managed to scrape by. Over

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.470
the next 100 million years, these creatures would evolve into amphibians,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.410
reptiles and nearly all modern land animals.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.640
250 million years ago is the Permian extinction.
The single worst mass extinction in history,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
70 per cent of life on land and over 95 per
cent of life in the oceans was wiped out.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.750
Billions of tonnes of volcanic gases destroyed
the ozone layer and the average ocean temperature

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.480
hit 40 degrees celsius, which is hotter than
most hot tubs. Acid rain fell all over the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.420
planet, devastating life on land.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.070
Life had only 50 million years to recover
until the fourth mass extinction came. At

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.880
this time early small dinosaurs roamed the
land. A huge volcanic rift opened

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.800
in the middle of the planet; eventually splitting
the Americas from Europe and Africa, and forming

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.319
the Atlantic Ocean. The volcanoes spewed out
CO2, increasing temperatures and killing about

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.180
80 per cent of the species around at the time.
Yet in this newly emptied world dinosaurs

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.439
did extremely well and during the next 135
million years, they grew to become some of

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.370
the largest land animals the world had ever
seen.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.779
But all good things must come to the end. Many scientists believe that the extinction

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.359
of dinosaurs was caused by an asteroid the
size of a small town crashing into what is

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.029
now Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula. The impact
shot millions of tons of dust into the atmosphere,

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.420
blocking out sunlight and spelling an end
to all large dinosaurs. The small ones that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.909
survived evolved into birds. The world was
now primed for a small, scuffling, rat-like

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.129
creature, the ancestor of all modern mammals.
Within 50 million years, its descendants - from

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.599
wildebeest and whales to horses and us humans
- have diversified and grown to dominate nearly

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.200
every available environment on earth.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.249
So where does that leave us now, 65 million
years later? Well, human dominance of earth

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.879
has led to big changes too, except the changes
of today are happening over decades, not millennia.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.609
Carbon dioxide levels, implicated in so many
of the past extinctions, have climbed at least

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.139
25 percent in just the last 50 years, almost
no time in geological terms. In addition to

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.540
climate change, we’ve exterminated hundreds
of species by hunting, fishing, habitat destruction

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.329
and pollution. It’s been estimated that
current species extinction rates are between

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.450
100 and 1000 times higher than the natural
background rate, and that if all the species

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.129
that are currently threatened by declining
populations actually do go extinct, we may

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.109
reach the level of a true mass extinction
in just a few hundred years. And while all

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.359
the mass extinctions of the past have had
some survivors, it’s worth remembering that

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.680
the creatures at the top of the food chain
are usually hit the hardest. We may be setting

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.449
the stage for history to repeat itself, and
for some small, unexpected organism to replace

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.999
us as the planet’s dominant form of life.
