00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. We know initial velocity. We know acceleration since we're in the earth.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can use the same trick to know the velocity if the top of the trajectory is zero

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we're looking for the time--okay.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
These were variables correspond to this equation V = V at plus 80

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
plugging in my velocity at the top is 0 minus your velocity is 20 plus my acceleration

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is - 10 times time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If I solve this, I find that time equals 2 seconds. That makes tons of sense.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We know the acceleration due to gravity is 10 meters per second per second.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If I start off with the velocity of 20 meters per second going up, I'm going to lose

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
10 meters per second every second.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So it's going to take 2 seconds for this velocity to go down to 0 and that's the top of my trajectory.
