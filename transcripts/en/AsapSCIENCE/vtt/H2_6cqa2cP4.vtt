00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.560
Life: with an estimated 3.8 billion years
of existence in evolution on Earth, it's an

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.041
odd thing indeed. So, how did we get here?
And what would the Earth's 4.5 billion year

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:15.450
timeline look like, compressed into a normal
day of 24 hours? The story begins early in

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.860
the morning, around 4am, with the rise of
the first simple, single-cell organisms. However,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.380
these organisms are destined to spend quite
some time alone. At 1pm, a simple cell engulfs

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.990
another, creating a symbiotic relationship
and the first eukaryotic cells, or cells with

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.120
internal organs. At 6:30pm, these cells begin
to form colonies, and thus, the first multi-cellular

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.070
life develops. But it isn't until 8:30pm that
sea plants appear and 20 minutes later, we

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.379
suddenly see animal life erupt in an explosion
of inventiveness. Jellyfish, the first invertebrates,

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.220
trilobytes, incredible diversification begins
to take place. And just before 10pm, plants

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.699
begin to sppear on land, followed by land
mammals. By 10:24, the Earth is covered in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.699
carniforous forests, and the first winged
insects appear. Many reptiles dominate the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.459
land with less than an hour left, but a mass
extinction event allows dinosaurs to storm

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:15.939
the scene and remain until 11:41pm, when they
too suddenly vanish. And so begins the Age

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.429
of Mammals. In the last few minutes, apes
split from the old world monkeys. And with

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.930
only 1 minute and 17 seconds left before midnight,
humans emerge. All of the recorded human history

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.899
fits within a few seconds, an individual life
lasting barely an instant, all a combination

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.159
of 3.8 billion years of life. This AsapSCIENCEvideo
was made possible by the support of audible.com.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.359
With their help, we're able to continue making
fun science videos. And they want to give

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.989
you a free audiobook. Audible is the internet's
leading provider of audiobooks with more than

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:53.420

to get a free audiobook of your choice. Today's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.079
episode was inspired by the book 'A Short
History of Nearly Everything', in which Bill

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.939
Bryson explores the neatest bits of science,
my personal recommendation. Again, just head

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:14.350
over to audible.com/asap to download it for
free, or another audiobook of your choice.
