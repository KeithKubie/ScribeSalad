00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.780
LAURA LING: Lincoln Park has
achieved tremendous success.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.210
You guys are regarded as one
of the most respected rock

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.690
bands in the world.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.222
What do you think got you
guys to where you are today?

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.055
MIKE SHINODA: There's
elements of hard work,

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:18.200
and there's elements
of chemistry,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200
and magic, and luck, I'd
say at the bottom of it

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.940
all we have had to have a
foundation built on the music.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.880
We learned very early
on that we never

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.380
wanted to put
anything on our record

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.529
that we didn't feel
100% confident of.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.820
LISA LING: Tell me about your
solo project, Fort Minor.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.050
MIKE SHINODA: A lot of
people are confused by it

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.120
because it has a name.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.010
It's not just Mike Shinoda.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.860
For me, it's a place where
whether it's music or art,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.100
it's just me.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.010
LISA LING: So would you say
then that music and visual art

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.380
are your rituals,
things that you just

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.920
have to do and thrive on?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.580
MIKE SHINODA: If I
go for a few days

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.810
without doing something
creative, I get weird.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.190
I get crazy.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.275
Whether it's music or drawing,
painting, anything like that,

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.170
art for me, it's like
breathing in the sense

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.870
that I don't think about.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.844
I just do it.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.510
LISA LING: And what
do you feel when you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.294
have pen or pencil to paper?

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:10.460
MIKE SHINODA: There are
sometimes when I'm painting,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
drawing that I'm really
calm, and it's very soothing

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.250
to do it.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.940
And there are other times
when I'm hyper agitated.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.820
In my head, its like a cyclone
of noise, and it's loud.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.050
My mind wanders off
to some crazy place

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.480
and it just goes into that
dream state or something.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.860
And maybe that's why
it's so addicting for me,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.622
because I never know
what is going to happen.

00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:44.040
LISA LING: Can you tell me how
your visual art has influenced

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.970
you in this new song
with Fort Minor.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.410
MIKE SHINODA: The song
is an outsider song,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.730
and the words are really
from an underdog perspective.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.140
And in spite of that, the
tone is a very confident tone.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.370
I wanted to do something
with the art that

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.435
felt like it related to that,
and so I went down to Venice,

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:07.961
and did this mural on
1,000 record jackets.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.419
And I basically came up with
all these different characters

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.790
that I thought of when
I listened to the song.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.197
So I started drawing people,
and this is what I came up with.

00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:17.780
LISA LING: And so
are these, would you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.310
say, representations of the
underdogs in our society?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.490
MIKE SHINODA: Yeah, so it
was a gut feeling of this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.560
is who feels like the
song, and feels like what

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.640
I'm getting at with this piece.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.055
LISA LING: How
would you describe

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:32.245
the style of your artwork?

00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.370
MIKE SHINODA: My favorite
things to draw growing up

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.820
were basically
Nintendo characters

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.370
because I was
obsessed with that,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.490
and then eventually got into
movies, like Akira and Princess

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.660
Mononoke.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.730
But all of those
things kind of mesh

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.260
together to create
whatever it is that I do.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.795
I don't really know
what to call it.

00:02:51.795 --> 00:02:52.450
LISA LING: Shinoda.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.366
MIKE SHINODA: Shinoda.

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.632
 

00:02:55.632 --> 00:02:57.381
LISA LING: What do you
hope people get out

00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:00.004
of not only your music
but also your visual art?

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:01.670
MIKE SHINODA: When
I'm making something,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.830
sometimes I have a
very specific message

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.180
with some of the pieces,
and just like most artists,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.030
coping with your own story and
your own reactions and emotions

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.530
and things.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.510
In its best form,
it's like therapy.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.390
And then the other half is
what are people extracting

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.150
from whatever you've made?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.035
It's not done until somebody
else sees it and reacts to.

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.890
That's the other half
of the experience.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:38.557
 

00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:40.140
LISA LING: I hope
you enjoyed learning

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.670
about Mike Shinoda's creative
process, and his ritual of art.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.660
about a young man who was
bullied as a child that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.830
emerged stronger than ever.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.790
When you look in the mirror now
who's the person that you see?

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.360
YOUNG MAN: So I see a lot
more confident person,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.850
I see someone who's made a lot
of progress, and most of all,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.660
I see someone
who's on a journey.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.357
