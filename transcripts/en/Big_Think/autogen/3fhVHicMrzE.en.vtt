here to try to deflect this thing if it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
here to try to deflect this thing if it
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.030
here to try to deflect this thing if it
were if it were going to hit there this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
were if it were going to hit there this

one's not gonna hit the earth everybody

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
one's not gonna hit the earth everybody
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.840
one's not gonna hit the earth everybody
but if there were another one that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850
but if there were another one that
 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.210
but if there were another one that
we're gonna hit the earth you can see

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
we're gonna hit the earth you can see
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.390
we're gonna hit the earth you can see
that if you just tried to push it you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
that if you just tried to push it you
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.700
that if you just tried to push it you
probably wouldn't influence it properly

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
probably wouldn't influence it properly

you just make it scatter and you might

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600
you just make it scatter and you might
 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.830
you just make it scatter and you might
make things worse so that's why we at
