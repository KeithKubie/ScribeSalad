some things that we can tell from from

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
some things that we can tell from from
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.520
some things that we can tell from from
bones and from implements one of them is

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530
bones and from implements one of them is
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.690
bones and from implements one of them is
that the hominid teeth becomes smaller

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
that the hominid teeth becomes smaller
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.930
that the hominid teeth becomes smaller
and these are primarily the grinding

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
and these are primarily the grinding
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.220
and these are primarily the grinding
teeth and this is interpreted as a shift

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
teeth and this is interpreted as a shift
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.720
teeth and this is interpreted as a shift
to a diet that does not require so much

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
to a diet that does not require so much
 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.770

therefore there's a there's been a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400
therefore there's a there's been a
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.160
therefore there's a there's been a
tendon clusion that as hominids move out

of Africa they eat more more soft foods

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230
of Africa they eat more more soft foods
 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.620

presumably meat this is also accompanied

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
presumably meat this is also accompanied
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.949

of the intestinal tract again seeming to

to allow for a meat diet I know this may

come as a disappointment to the vegans

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
come as a disappointment to the vegans
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.500
come as a disappointment to the vegans
in the room who are convinced that no

therefore vegan culture has been the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
therefore vegan culture has been the
 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.800

ssin of the diet why would this be the

you eat in the vegetable world what we

you eat in the vegetable world what we
 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.110
you eat in the vegetable world what we
know is that big proportion of the

therefore there's abundant reason to

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.710
complexity so what was going on in Old
Europe and why didn't we know of course

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720
Europe and why didn't we know of course
 

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.770
Europe and why didn't we know of course
we go back to the 19th century and you

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:39.780
we go back to the 19th century and you
 

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.450
we go back to the 19th century and you
look at the areas that were involved

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460
look at the areas that were involved
 

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.850
look at the areas that were involved
which were primarily

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:42.860
which were primarily
 

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:48.310
which were primarily
Romania Bulgaria and of the southern

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320
Romania Bulgaria and of the southern
 

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.820
Romania Bulgaria and of the southern
most parts of Ukraine this was a very

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:52.830
most parts of Ukraine this was a very
 

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.790
most parts of Ukraine this was a very
unsettled and warlike period is a period

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:55.800
unsettled and warlike period is a period
 

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.830
unsettled and warlike period is a period
of the decline of the Ottoman Empire

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840
of the decline of the Ottoman Empire
 

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.890
of the decline of the Ottoman Empire
rise of very parochial nationalisms

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900
rise of very parochial nationalisms
 

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.860
rise of very parochial nationalisms
among the various peoples of Southeast

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:06.870
among the various peoples of Southeast
 

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.130
among the various peoples of Southeast
Europe it really wasn't a good time to

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140
Europe it really wasn't a good time to
 

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.010

simply go out with a shovel and start

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020
simply go out with a shovel and start
 

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.060
simply go out with a shovel and start
digging up in someone's village so that

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.070
digging up in someone's village so that
 

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.850
digging up in someone's village so that
was one reason perhaps that people never

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860
was one reason perhaps that people never
 

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.140
was one reason perhaps that people never
noticed this civilization there it also

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:24.150
noticed this civilization there it also
 

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.730

be the question of if you found

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740
be the question of if you found
 

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.240
be the question of if you found
something how did you get permission to

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.250
something how did you get permission to
 

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.810
something how did you get permission to
to take it to your Museum because who

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820
to take it to your Museum because who
 

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.570
to take it to your Museum because who
who was the government the government

who was the government the government
 

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:39.140
who was the government the government
and that could be a problem it turns out

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.150
and that could be a problem it turns out
 

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.390
and that could be a problem it turns out
that Old Europe was not suspected to

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400
that Old Europe was not suspected to
 

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.130
that Old Europe was not suspected to

time in place where a handful of
 

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.770
time in place where a handful of
archaeologists were invited from Russia

in the United States and to talk about
what they and their colleagues have been

what they and their colleagues have been
 

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:38.850
what they and their colleagues have been
doing for the last two generations and

doing for the last two generations and
 

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.980
doing for the last two generations and
lo and behold they said we have found a

will email it to you it's a stunning
 

00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:59.340
will email it to you it's a stunning
book because it tells you that

it's when you get the melting of the ice

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:35.600
it's when you get the melting of the ice

allows the land to sort of spring back

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:51.600
allows the land to sort of spring back

allows the land to sort of spring back
and so these rivers start to flow into

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.330
and so these rivers start to flow into
 

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.830
and so these rivers start to flow into

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.730
Sea was not connected with the world's

to have been a very fairly shallow lake

if you go back further into the ice ages

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:27.390
if you go back further into the ice ages
 

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.240
if you go back further into the ice ages
you'll find that the Mediterranean Sea

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.250
you'll find that the Mediterranean Sea
 

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:34.370
you'll find that the Mediterranean Sea
was almost dry when you look at cross

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380

sections of the Nile Valley you see that

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:37.860
sections of the Nile Valley you see that
 

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.790
sections of the Nile Valley you see that
you know here you have the Nile flows in

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800
you know here you have the Nile flows in
 

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.650
you know here you have the Nile flows in
the Mediterranean but if you look at the

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:42.660
the Mediterranean but if you look at the
 

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.710
the Mediterranean but if you look at the
cross section you find that at one time

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720
cross section you find that at one time
 

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.250
cross section you find that at one time
so flowing into the sea here flowing

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260
so flowing into the sea here flowing
 

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.070
so flowing into the sea here flowing

to the level of the Mediterranean Sea
 

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.880

because the Mediterranean Sea was almost
