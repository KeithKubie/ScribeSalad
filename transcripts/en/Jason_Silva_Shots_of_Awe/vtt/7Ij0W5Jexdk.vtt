JASON SILVA: It is
said that consciousness

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.890
is mediated by chemistry.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.890
Our moods are dances
of chemistry occurring

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.140
in our brains and bodies.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.980
And we can mediate
this chemistry,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.360
this psychopharmacology,
through the ingestion of drugs,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.030
but also through
the participation

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.810
in certain activities
through placing the body-mind

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.840
in certain spaces and places.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.980
A beautiful cathedral,
a beautiful museum,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.890
a beautiful building
or structure

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.280
can architect a particular
flavor of consciousness.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.550
In fact, even the placebo effect
is not really an illusion.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.490
Because real chemistry is
happening in our brains

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.660
when we believe that
what we're taking

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.170
is going to affect how we think.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.780
And so our moods are mediated
by mind, by world, by chemistry.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.600
And it makes you wonder
if the words of David

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.790
Pearce, the philosopher
who wrote "The Hedonistic

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.980
Imperative," should, perhaps, be
taken a little more seriously.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.840
He talks about designing
new mind-ware for ourselves.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.080
He talks about designer drugs
that will allow us to program

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.480
gradients of consciousness that
take us to spaces and places

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.610
in blissful mind-body states
that we cannot even fathom.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.660
I mean, he basically says we
can become paradise engineers.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.730
And that it is our
moral responsibility

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.380
to create these prescriptions
of mind for ourselves,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.900
to basically deconstruct
and engineer nirvana,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.440
to create virtual realities that
we can inhabit and believe in

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.230
and suspend disbelief within.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.550
And accept new
software for the mind.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.170
Upgrade.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.060
The post-human gets to
inhabit spaces of subjectivity

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.370
that will make the old world
seem barbaric by comparison.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.260
I think it is our responsibility
as the meaning makers,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.570
as the dreamers of dreams,
to turn all of interior life

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.830
into a poem, a living, dynamic,
living, breathing work of art.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.160
You see festivals like Burning
Man, these gatherings that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.870
bring in hundreds of
thousands of people

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.300
to try to turn the world, to
turn the stage in which we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.340
dwell into something more
beautiful-- something

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.830
with a little more
compassion, a little more

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.880
empathy, a little more
grace, gratitude, and bliss--

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.080
to decenter the
ego, to transcend

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.410
Maslow's hierarchy
of needs, and to go

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.340
somewhere deeper and higher.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.560
Is this possible for ourselves?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.160
There's experiments.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.610
We've seen people try
to do it-- creating

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.110
these heterotopias, these
temporary spaces in which it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.830
seems like it's possible.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.140
But then you watch
the news, the doom

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.570
and gloom, the
terrorist threats,

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.230
and you get a little
bit depressed.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.400
It makes me think that the
goal, that the mission,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.390
that the end game
might not be possible

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.900
because there's too many
people conspiring against it.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.720
But I remain steadfast
that we can't give up.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.120
Beauty will win.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.740
Love will win.

00:03:17.735 --> 00:03:21.180
Aesthetic arrest,
transformation, illumination,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.630
grace-- these are
the things that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.780
are worth fighting
for and working for.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.070
Yeah, I get depressed
sometimes when I watch TV.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.020
But then I want to
go make more videos

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.240
and put more beauty out into
the world and induce goosebumps.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.640
Rhapsody and rapture for all.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.630
That's what I want.
