&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Good morning.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: I'm
going to need you guys

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.370
to be really loud, okay?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.090
Because we're here to
open the Purple Stage.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.670
My name is Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.370
I direct Educational Outreach
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.160
and it is my pleasure
to welcome you

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.540
to the 2018 National
Book Festival

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.940
and especially to
the Purple Stage.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.870
And I'm thrilled that there
are young people as well

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.490
as younger people
in the audience,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.420
and I would love your
help this morning

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.530
in opening the Purple Stage,
because I want everybody

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.610
in this expo hall to know
that the Purple Stage is open,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.500
so will you please help
me yell a little bit?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.100
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Okay, so here we go.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.400
We're going to do this.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Oh, I heard a good one.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
That was good.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
Okay, so give me a P.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; P!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.900
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Give me a U.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.200
&gt;&gt; U!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Give me an R.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.800
&gt;&gt; R!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.100
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Give me a P.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.400
&gt;&gt; P!

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.700
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Give me an L.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.000
&gt;&gt; L!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.300
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Give me an E.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.600
&gt;&gt; E!

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.900
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: And
what does that spell?

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
&gt;&gt; Purple!

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.500
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yes!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.800
The Purple Stage is
officially open, woohoo!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.100
[ Applause ]

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.400
That was actually pretty good.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.700
Thank you.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
I was a little concerned.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.300
It was a little quiet.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.600
That was nice.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.900
Now it is my pleasure to
welcome our first speaker

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
to the Purple Stage.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500
Matthew Cordell is both an
author and an illustrator.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.880
He wrote Trouble Gum,
Another Brother, Hello!

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.490
Hello!, and one of
my favorites, Wish.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.210
Do you guys know that story?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.390
I love seeing nods.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660
That's that story
with elephants,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.110
and there's fabulous confetti.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.860
Okay, there's a line
in that book that goes

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.390
"Before we were ready
for you or waited for you

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.060
or made plans for you.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.230
Even before we knew we wanted
you, we wished for you."

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.200
And while the story is about
parents wishing for children,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.460
it actually to applies to those
of us who work at the Library

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.440
of Congress, and we wish
for a day like today,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.450
and we wish for all of you to
be here at the Book Festival.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.880
So, thank you and thank
you for writing that book.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.480
Matthew has also illustrated
the books of such renown authors

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.540
as Philip Stead, Rachel
Vail, and Gail Carson Levine.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.050
He lives outside of Chicago
with his wife, the novelist,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.780
Julie Halpern, and
their two children.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.840
He is also the 2018 Caldecott
award-winning author of Wolf

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.220
in the Snow published
by Feiwel &amp; Friends,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.960
and he is with us
today to read it.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.750
By the way, the Caldecott
medal was named in honor

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.930
of 19th century English
illustrator Randolph Caldecott.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.530
It is awarded annually by the
Association for Library Service

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.440
to Children, a division of the
American Library Association

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.470
to the artist of the most
distinguished American picture

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.770
book for children.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.470
It is a huge honor.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.760
After Matthew's reading,
assuming time allows--

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.330
which we think it will-- he
will take your questions,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.910
and he will be signing
books from 10:30 to 11:30

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.570
in signing line number 15.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.870
Welcome Matthew.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.170
Thank you.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.590
Thanks so much for doing this.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.890
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell:
Thank you [inaudible]?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.190
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yeah.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.580
[Inaudible] because
it's that one.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.880
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: This one?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.180
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Yeah.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.480
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: Okay.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.780
Okay, good morning.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.080
Thank you for all for waking
up early and being here

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.380
for the first presentation.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.960
I was a little worried.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.630
So, my name's Matthew Cordell,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.250
and I want to tell you a
little bit about myself,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.630
and then I'm going to read
Wolf in the Snow to you guys.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.330
I always like to start out when
I'm speaking to boys and girls.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.630
Raise your hand.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.930
Who likes to write stories?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.230
Yeah, grownups can raise their
hands as well [laughter].

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.530
That's good.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.430
Okay. Raise your hand
if you like to draw.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.080
Who likes to draw?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.380
Okay, good.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.680
Those are my favorite
things to do.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.250
I grew up drawing,
and, sort of later

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.550
in life, I started to write.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.390
So, I'm going to tell you
a bit about how I do that,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.440
how those writing and
drawing becomes a book.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.470
Oh, that's just the
first slide there.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.400
So, I live in Chicago area now.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.720
Is anybody from Chicago
by any chance?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.600
No? Okay, no one?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.110
[Laughter] But I grew
up in South Carolina.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.450
Is anybody from South Carolina?

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.910
It's a little closer.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.700
Yeah? So, I grew up
in South Carolina.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.280
And then, you know, growing
up in South Carolina,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.440
the thing about me is
I always loved to draw.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.590
As soon as I could, you know,
put a pencil on a piece of paper

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.720
and make pictures, I just
loved to sit down and draw.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.150
That's always been the constant
thing in my life is drawing.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.010
But now I live in
Gurnee, Illinois.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.850
Has anybody been to
Gurnee, Illinois?

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.150
[Laughter] You have?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.450
Wow. Okay.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.370
After college, I moved to
Chicago, and I lived there

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.900
for about six or seven years.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.310
I was about 24 when
I moved there.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.610
And then I got married.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.070
My wife and I moved
to a little--

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.940
It's a suburb of Chicago.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.390
It's about an hour
north of Chicago.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.810
It's called Gurnee.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.780
We're famous for having a Six
Flags Great America in our town.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.200
And my wife and I,
we have two children.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.920
This is our daughter Romy.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.780
And, Romy, she's 9 years old.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.080
She's going into fourth grade.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.470
Any fourth graders
in the audience?

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.920
Not a single fourth grader ?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.240
[Laughter] Does anybody
like Star Wars?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.390
Any Star Wars fans?

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.690
Okay, good.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.490
So, Romy was dressed as
a Star Wars character.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.860
Raise your hand if you know
what Romy's dressed as.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.350
Who's Romy dressed as?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.060
Rey. Yes, Rey from Star Wars.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.590
So, I'm a big Star Wars fan.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.290
I grew up loving Star Wars, and
I've sort of forced my children

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.620
into liking Star Wars.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.530
We were going to a
comic book convention.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.830
I don't know if you've
ever been to one of those,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.910
but you get to dress up
in interesting costumes

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.290
at a comic convention.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.550
So, Romy was dressed as Ray from
Star Wars, and our son, Dean,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.760
who's 5 years old,
he was dressed up.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.170
And that's what he was
dressed as [laughter].

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.560
Who's Dean dressed as,
any Star Wars fans?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.860
Who's Dean dressed?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.650
BB-8, yes, Ray's little
droid sidekick, BB-8.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.610
Okay, so now I'd like to talk
you a bit about where I work

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.820
and the things I do
when I'm working.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.320
Oh, one more picture of
a [laughs] family member.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.620
Sorry [laughter].

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.580
This is our cat Norbert
[laughter].

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.620
Named after a dragon from
Harry Potter my daughter

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.410
named Norbert.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.600
So, this is where
I work right here.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.700
Isn't that a very nice looking
place to work [laughter]?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.490
This is my studio.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.370
And it's in the basement
of our house.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.280
So, I actually like
to work from home.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.110
I can just get up and
go downstairs and work

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.850
without having to get in a car.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.780
And so, you know, does that
studio look clean to you?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.080
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.380
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: No,
it looks a little messy.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.710
Now, whenever I go around
speaking to boys and girls

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.930
at schools and at festivals,
I like to show them pictures

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.020
of my studio in its
sort of natural state,

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.480
and it gets pretty
messy while I'm working.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.160
And a lot of that mess,
it's not like gross mess,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.400
like food or dirty laundry.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.900
It's mess related to the
books that I'm making.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.830
So, there's sketches
and drawings

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.180
and different books
laying around.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.790
So, I like to show boys
and girls, you know,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.210
a space isn't always going

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.590
to be clean while you're
really busy working.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.450
And, you know, a lot of authors
and illustrators probably want

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.490
to explain how organized
and clean they are.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.370
But I like to show
them my studio sort

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.430
of in its very active state.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.880
So, just a couple other places.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.180
This is where I draw
my pictures.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.700
And I'm going to show you
the types of tools I use

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.630
in a little bit, but I do
all of my pictures sort

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.930
of the old fashioned way.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.370
Some illustrators now do
their pictures completely

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.250
on the computer, and
they will draw right

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.270
on the tablet screen
or a computer screen.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.530
But all my pictures are
done on paper with pens

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.150
and pencils and paints.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.080
But I do use the
computer a little bit.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.930
This is my computer desk.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.480
Now, I use the computer
mostly to write stories,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.850
but I also use the computer
when I'm talking back and forth

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.750
with the publishers of the
book and the publishers

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.680
of the companies that print and
send the books out to bookstores

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.980
and libraries everywhere.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.150
So, use the computer
every day for that.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.390
These are some of the picture
books I've done over the years.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.860
Now, some of these books here,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.130
the ones on the top two rows
there, except for Trouble Gum,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.460
those were books that were
written by another author,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.320
and I was asked by a publisher
to illustrate their book.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.340
But the other books you see on
the bottom row, those were books

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.730
that I wrote the story
and illustrated myself.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.320
So, I do a little bit of both
when it comes to picture books.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.250
And I also occasionally
illustrate chapter books.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.510
I've never written a
novel or a chapter book,

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.080
but occasionally I get
asked by a publisher

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.410
to illustrate the cover
and the inside pictures,

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.700
which are usually smaller
and in black and white.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.970
And the last type of book I
illustrate is a poetry book.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.580
Boys and girls, you
reading any poetry?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.650
A few of you, yeah?

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.980
Okay, poetry doesn't get enough
action, I feel like, these days.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.610
So, I really love poetry.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.610
I don't write poetry, but I do
get asked to illustrate, again,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.110
other people's novels
written in poems

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.670
or different collections
of poems.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.140
So, that's the last type
of book I illustrate.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.530
So, now I want to read to
you Wolf in the Snow, but,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.270
before I do that, I want to
just tell you a little bit--

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.740
And we heard a little
bit in my introduction--

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.170
about I won the Caldecott medal.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.460
Have you guys heard of the
Caldecott medal before?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.290
Raise your hand if you've
heard of the Caldecott medal.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.660
Okay, good.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.160
Occasionally, I'll go to a
school and there'll be no hands

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.050
that go up, [laughs] which
is a little, a little bad.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.850
But, okay, so there should
have been some text on here.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.310
But anyway [laughs].

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.160
I don't know why it's not there.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.600
So, the Caldecott medal,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.100
it means it's the best
illustrated American picture

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.440
book within that year.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.220
So, I won the Caldecott
medal for 2018.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.860
It was named after a
British illustrator many,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.370
many years ago, but the irony
sort of is that you have

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.360
to be an American citizen
to win the Caldecott medal.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.750
And the other thing
is that, I think,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.910
the very first Caldecott
medal was given

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.580
out in 1938, I believe it was.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.830
So, in all those years
and all the books

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.140
that have been published,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.300
only like 70 something books
have won a Caldecott medal.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.070
So, it's really,
really special thing.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.270
It was really exciting to
find out sort of a thing

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.730
that a picture-book
illustrator dreams that's going

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.340
to happen to them.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.550
So, it's been a really
exciting year for me.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.550
These are some Caldecott-winning
books

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.580
in case you're not
familiar with the Caldecott.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.250
You've probably seen
at least one or two

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.550
of these books in your life.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.930
That one on the bottom right,
Sylvester and the Magic Pebble.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.340
That's my favorite
Caldecott-winning book

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.770
by William Steig.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.440
And these are the types
of pens that I use.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.340
I use pens that you dip
into a bottle of ink.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.410
They don't have ink inside them.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.660
They're kind of old-fashioned
type of pens.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.610
And I do paint the
pictures in watercolor.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.750
These are my brushes.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.500
Okay, so now I'm going to read
the book Wolf in the Snow.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.500
And it's a wordless book.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.990
Have you guys ever
read a wordless book?

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.290
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.590
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: Okay, good.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.890
Yay [laughs], I get
a little cheer.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.190
Okay, so there's no text.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.490
The pictures tell the story.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.850
So, this is the first
picture we see.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.810
We see a girl in her
home with her family.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.110
It's snowing outside.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.540
And the girl, she's walking
away from home first thing

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.150
in the morning, saying
goodbye to her dog there.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.840
And we see the girl on this one
page, she's walking somewhere,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.480
and we see the-- What do we
see on the other page, there?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.780
We see wolves, yeah.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.110
So, we see a pack or
a family of wolves.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.040
Turn the page.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.600
Now we see the title
page Wolf in the Snow.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.900
And now we see the girl.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.200
She's leaving school.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.500
So, she was at school.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.800
She had gone to school.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.100
She's leaving school
for the day.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.830
More snow is seeming to fall
as we keep turning the pages.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.020
We turn the page again,
and what do we see again?

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.320
&gt;&gt; Wolves.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.620
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: We
see the wolves again.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.070
And there walking through the
snow you can see the breath

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.370
that you see.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.670
You can see your breath
when it's really cold out.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.730
More snow is falling.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.120
So, now the girl's
really fighting her way

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.250
against this wind and the snow.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.520
The storm is really
starting to pick up.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.670
And the wolves are fighting
now against this wind and snow.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:58.240
And what's happening to that
little wolf pup down there?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.540
[Inaudible] It's falling behind.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.750
It's getting left behind
by the adult wolves--

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.870
the noise or the
confusion of the storm.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.770
So, now, the girl,
she's fighting her way.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.560
She's trying to get
towards these trees maybe

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.920
to get under some trees.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.250
And then we see the wolf
pup is fighting its way

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.400
to get towards those trees.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.940
And now, for the first
time, we see the girl

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.480
and the pup in the same space.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.630
Now, if you ever encountered
an animal in the wild,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.040
even if it's a baby or a small
animal, you have to be careful

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.100
with any wild animal,
because they're unpredictable.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.450
They're not like our
dogs and cats at home.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.750
We don't know how
they're going to react

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.470
to people that they don't know.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.340
But this girl, she sees this
pup is down on the ground.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.420
It's in a submissive state
like that, and it's whining.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.790
So, she reaches down for the
pup to see if she might be able

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.240
to help it, and she
puts it in the snow.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.850
And what happens as it tries
to walk across the snow?

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.600
It sinks. Yeah, it
sinks in the snow.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.730
So, it can walk across the
snow, but it can't get very far

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.160
without getting stuck.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.880
So, she picks it up, and
the little pup howls.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.610
And then somewhere way
across the landscape,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.820
across the distance, she
hears another wolf howling.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.120
So, she has to decide.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.680
She could take this pup to these
other wolves that she hears

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.010
out there, which could
be kind of scary.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.580
Or she could leave the
pup here and she could try

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.950
to find her own way home.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.060
But if she left the
pup and just went home,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.590
I don't think it would
be a very good book,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.010
wouldn't be very
interesting [laughter].

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.470
So, she's going to save the pup.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.610
She's going to walk, and find,
and try to reunite this pup

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.910
with these adult wolves.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.210
So, she's walking.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.510
She going to follow the howling.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.120
And as she's doing that, she has

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.980
to brave all these other
elements of nature.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.660
She has to, you know, climb
up and down high hills of snow

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.890
and cross frozen streams.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.120
She encounters other
more aggressive animals

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.440
like this angry raccoon there
and, you know, screeching owls,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.060
scary sounds in the forest.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.440
And what's happening
as she keeps walking,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.350
what's happening
with the howling?

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.560
The howling's getting
bigger and louder.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.010
So, now she's climbing up that
hill, and it's bigger and louder

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.360
than ever that howling.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.650
And now for the first
time we see she finds one

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.060
of these big adult wolves.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.400
Now, adult wolves
are very big animals.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.610
They're much bigger than,
like, an average dog.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.480
So, just the size of a wolf

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.620
in the wild could be
a very intimidating,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.440
very frightening thing.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.520
And we see the girl.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.640
And she doesn't know how
the wolf is going to react.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.220
And the wolf doesn't know how
the girl is going to react,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.500
so they're just kind of
looking into each other's eyes

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.510
with this uncertainty.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.250
So, the girl drops the pup.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.480
And what happens when
the pup tries to cross

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.430
to see its mother wolf there?

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.730
&gt;&gt; It sinks.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell:
It sinks again.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.310
Yeah. But now the mother wolf
is able to pick up the pup,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.920
and she can carry
it off to safety.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.910
Now, at this point, the girl is,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.340
at the end of this
very long day,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.580
walking through this deep snow.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.740
Seeing these wild
animals, she sort of falls

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.970
over to catch her breath there.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.470
But she's got to
find her way home.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.680
So, she gets up and walks away.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.290
And we see in the bottom

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:08.140
of the picture there we see
the other wolves have returned.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.490
And that one black
wolf is watching her.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.430
It's maybe wondering where she's
going, and who was this girl

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.380
that brought our pup back to us?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.370
Now, she looks out
into the night sky,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.890
and what does she
see in the sky?

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.190
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] lights.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.490
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: She sees
some lights, yeah, flashing.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.750
There's some barking, so maybe
this could be her family.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.200
Maybe it could be another family
that could help her get home.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.190
So, she's going to
follow those lights,

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.050
but she's walking and walking.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.570
And now she's just so
tired that she falls over.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.720
And when she falls over here,
she's fallen into the covering

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.510
of those trees, and who's
come back now that she's?

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.810
&gt;&gt; The wolves.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.290
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: The
wolves have come back.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.250
And in these pictures, we see
the wolves surround the girl.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.230
And then they howl.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.120
Why do you think they
would howl like that?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.420
Why do you think
they would howl?

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.070
So, they could attract
attention.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.540
Maybe they want to
help this girl

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.060
like the girl helped
their family.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.950
So, they're howling there.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.250
In fact, it does it.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.550
It attracts attention.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.950
It attracts one of the people
that's out there looking.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.080
I mean, this could be
the mom or the dad.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.830
In my mind, it was the mom.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.790
And she shows up
with her flashlight.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.200
So, the mom and the
daughter together

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.590
and it's very happy moment.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.160
And then we see the wolves
at the top of that hill,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.060
and they're howling in
this very happy moment.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.010
Can you guys give me a nice big
wolf howl for this happy moment?

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.310
[ Howling ]

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.610
Wow, that's good.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.980
Yeah. Good, good [laughs].

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.270
And now the two lights.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.490
The two lights of the mom
and dad find each other

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.790
at the bottom of that hill.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.240
And then the book ends just
like it began with the mom

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.590
and the dad and the daughter
together in their home again.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.070
So, that is the end
of Wolf in the Snow.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.870
Thank you.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.450
[ Applause ]

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.250
And just really quickly,
I was going to tell you

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.410
about my next book that comes
out at the end of the month.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.710
This is very different book.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.370
I like to write sort
of serious books.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.430
I also like to write
more humorous books.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.610
And this book was really
based on my relationship

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.520
with my daughter, Romy.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.280
Her name is the girl
dressed in the Star Wars.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:25.940
So, Romy and I, we made
a book together one day.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.370
We just sat down and
drew and wrote a book.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.490
It was the Wizard of Oz,
and she wrote part of it.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.730
And so I wanted to make a book
about a dad and a daughter

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.210
who make a book, but, you
know, I wanted the daughter

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.810
to be this very headstrong,
very spirited personality

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.540
like my daughter Romy is.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.820
So, this girl, Alice,
she likes to dress up.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.500
She likes to take on
characters, but she wants

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.040
to be the strongest character.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.640
And she knows that the king
is at the top of the chain

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.200
of command, so she doesn't
care about being the queen.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.500
She wants to be the king,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.800
and the dad's going
to be the princess.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.340
So, this is Alice getting
dressed up in her king costume.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.710
So, she becomes the kind,
and that's King Alice, there.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.230
And then they proceed--
There's dad waking up.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.790
That may or may not be
based on me [laughter].

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.090
So, dad's waking up.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.090
What are we going to do today?

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.970
And dad's very tired.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.780
Sees that it's snowy outside.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.550
So, Alice says, "Can
we make cupcakes?"

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.800
And dad's remembering the
disaster that happened

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.140
when they made cupcakes.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.020
And this is a picture of
some fun that Romy and I had

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.220
in the kitchen one day
where she dressed as a clown

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.670
and threw a pie in
my face [laughs].

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.560
So, the book was based on the
different fun kind of things

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.650
that we do together as
a dad and a daughter.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.540
So, then she says,
"Can we play dress-up,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.410
and can I do your makeup?"

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.280
And dad's remembering
what that was like.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.580
And this is a picture.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.510
Romy actually did my
makeup one day [laughter].

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.190
So, she says, "Let's
make a book."

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.490
So, they're going
to make a book.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.790
And then they write a book.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.130
So, really the book is sort of
day in the life of this family.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.950
So, it's all the different
fun things they do.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.920
You know, they watch TV, at some
point, about unicorn buddies.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.740
And then there's a
unicorn stampede,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.330
and she hits her
dad accidentally,

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.180
and she gets a timeout
[laughter].

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.100
But they keep making the book.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.750
It's dinnertime and so on.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.670
And then they read the
book at the end of the day.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.960
So, that's King Alice, and
that comes out on September 25.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.260
So, look for that one.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.040
Thank you, yeah, yeah.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.790
So, that's the end we have about
five minutes for some questions.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.430
Does anybody have a burning
question they need to ask based

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.400
on some of the things
we talked about?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.020
My friend over here, yes?

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.320
&gt;&gt; How did you [inaudible]?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.440
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: How did I
come up with Wolf in the Snow?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.740
Good question.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.040
So, Wolf in the Snow.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.640
A lot of times when I write and
illustrate, stories are based

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.470
on something that happened
to me in real life.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.960
So, King Alice is
based on something.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.260
Some of my other books
were based on actual things

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.400
that I did or things
that my kids did.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.570
Wolf in the Snow
started out as a picture.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.400
It wasn't a story at first.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.390
I just had this idea
for a picture,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.540
and that picture was
a girl in a red coat.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.070
She was standing in the snow
across from a big, black wolf.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.930
And I didn't really know
what it was going to be.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.780
And I didn't know much
about wolves either.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.230
And I used to think wolves
were big, bad scary animals

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.160
that wanted to eat up humans,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.060
eat up people, very
scary beasts.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.170
And I learned about
wolves, and I learned

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.650
that they were not that at all.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.980
You know, they had that bad
idea about them for many years.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.570
But they really are
just families like us,

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.590
and they do hunt, but
they hunt other animals.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.920
And they're pretty
much afraid of people

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.240
because of the way
people have looked at them

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.920
and treated them over the years.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.040
So, I wanted to do a story
then about, you know, a person

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.860
and an animal who didn't
really understand each other.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.920
But they ended up
being in a position

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.870
where they needed
to help each other.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.060
And by doing that, they were
able to learn about each other

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.570
and become better
beings, creatures,

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.070
and people because of it.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.160
So, that's how Wolf in
the Snow came about.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.720
Really just by learning
about the animals.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.890
Yeah? You have a question?

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.190
[Inaudible] I'm sorry.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.490
What was your question?

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:35.860
Oh, okay. How did I draw
so good without messing up?

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.160
I love that question.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.280
Lots of practice.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.630
So, you know, like I said, I've
been drawing my entire life.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.580
And so I don't always
draw so well.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.220
Like, sometimes the
drawings are not very good,

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.970
and sometimes I have bad
days when I'm drawing.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.100
But you just have
to keep trying.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.400
You can't give up.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.130
So, if there's something you
like to do, if it's drawing

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.000
or sports or whatever it is that
you love, you're probably going

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.740
to keep having those bad days,
but if you stick with that thing

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.380
that you love, that's
really a cool thing just

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.470
to watch yourself get better and
better every year that goes by.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.280
So, for me, that thing
was always drawing.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.450
So, lots of practice, lots
of good and bad drawing.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.990
But, you know, just
being satisfied

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.270
with the good drawings
when they happen.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.690
Somebody else?

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.510
Yes? Question?

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:33.120
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.910
He said, "Why do I dip my
pens in ink instead of using

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.480
that pens that have
ink in them?"

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.650
So, the pens that I use, they
have these special tips on them.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.160
They're called nibs.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.810
And that nib is like a little
metal point, and it opens

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.870
up when you push down on it.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.360
So, you can get lots of
different thicknesses

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.510
of your line when
you're drawing.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:59.910
And so it makes the drawing
more interesting to me.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.260
If I was drawing with, like,
a pen, you know, a typical pen

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.940
that has ink in it like
this with a very fine tip,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.500
your lines usually
are pretty straight--

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.720
Not straight, but
they're pretty consistent.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.570
They're pretty much the
same as you draw with them.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.980
But I like for my lines
to be kind of scratchy,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.890
and they get thick at
times and thin at times.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.780
That's why I use
that special pen.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.860
You have to dip it in the
ink which is kind of a pain,

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.040
but it makes it look a lot
better to me, personally.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.340
Somebody else?

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.640
Anybody over here
have a question?

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.260
Okay, right here.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.920
Yes? What do I do
when I get stuck?

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.220
Yeah, good question.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.780
I get stuck a lot, you know?

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.720
And the best thing that I
can do is just walk away

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.620
from whatever it is and
even just going for a walk,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.450
and just getting away from it,
and getting some perspective,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.820
and thinking about other
things, and sometimes

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.320
that helps clear your head.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.810
So, when you come back to
it, you see it differently,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.110
and you can look
at it differently

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.620
and problem-solve it better
instead of just sticking

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.600
on that one thing that you're
really fighting to make work.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.950
So, I see we have one minute.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.270
Any grownups have any questions?

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.530
Grownups have to use
the microphone [laughs].

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.900
Or you can just shout it out.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.390
We have a minute [laughs].

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.430
&gt;&gt; How did you celebrate
[inaudible]?

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:26.730
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell:
Someone up here,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.260
how did I celebrate
the Caldecott?

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.150
I went to Dunkin'
Donuts [laughter]

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.280
and got some donuts
with my daughter.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.410
That was the very
first thing we did.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.360
Then we went to Disney World,
and then we went to New York

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.310
and saw the SpongeBob
Musical [laughter].

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.500
One more question.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.320
&gt;&gt; Do you always work
in pen and watercolor,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.390
or do you ever use
other mediums?

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.350
&gt;&gt; Matthew Cordell: I
pretty much only work in pen

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.770
and ink and watercolor.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.450
I'm really comfortable
with that,

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.160
and I feel like I'm still
learning in some ways,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.360
so I feel like I'm just
constantly evolving my process.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.560
Occasionally, I will
color something.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.080
I've colored a couple
books in Photoshop

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.120
with sort of flat colors.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.940
But to me, my most gratifying
way of working is in pen

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.090
and ink and watercolor.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.520
So, I'm seeing now I
have to wrap it up.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.450
So, one more round of applause
for me, please [laughs].

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.940
All right, okay.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.240
Thank you so much.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.540
Been a real pleasure.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.840
Thank you.
