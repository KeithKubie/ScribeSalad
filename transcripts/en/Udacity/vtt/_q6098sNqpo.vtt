00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.450
Let's break through the word count example by writing

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.780
a mapper and reducer in Python. Recall that the mapper

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.720
will take in a document. In this case, a collection

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.380
of words that appear in Alice in Wonderland, and will

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.580
return various intermediate key value pairs. In this case, each

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.410
word in the value one. These key value pairs will

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.480
then be shuffled to ensure that every key value pair

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.630
with the same key ends up on the same reducer.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.020
And each reducer will perform some operation

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.000
on all of the values corresponding to a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.160
particular key. In order to produce one

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.230
final key value pair. In this particular case,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.080
we're counting up how many times each

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.170
word occurred. So for Alice, Wonderland, Caterpillar, and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
Of, the final key value pair is Alice

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.320
one, Wonderland one, Caterpillar one and Of, one.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.890
Whereas two appeared twice, so the final key value pair there is Was two.
