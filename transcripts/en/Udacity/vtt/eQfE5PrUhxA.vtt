00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.350
Yeah, so, so we'd certainly need to do some

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.200
stuff in the HTML file and the CSS file to

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.510
make the button itself. But as for how it

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.190
actually works, most of that's going to go in, in the

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.760
&gt;&gt; In the JavaScript.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760
&gt;&gt; JavaScript files.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.930
&gt;&gt; Because this is more substantial than just changing how it looks. It's-

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.160
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.360
&gt;&gt; Really.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.950
&gt;&gt; because, because the button has to actually do something.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.875
&gt;&gt; Okay and that's what we'll do and listen two.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:21.590
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.470
&gt;&gt; Okay,but for now we'll stick with more of the HTML and CSS.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; Cool.
