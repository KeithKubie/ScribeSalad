RETO MEIER: Good
day, everybody.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.070
And welcome to this
week's show.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm Reto Meier.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm Ian
Needlessly Angry Lewis.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.360
RETO MEIER: This week, we're
going to be taking a look at

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.860
news reader apps so I can keep
up with that story about the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.195
dingo and the baby.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:14.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm going to
be drinking in all that stuff

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.110
on the latest whiskey news.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.480
RETO MEIER: This week on--

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.630
RETO MEIER: Today, we're looking
at news apps, News

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.070
Republic from Mobiles Republic
and The Verge from Vox Media.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.380
I'm going to be flying solo
today as Ian recovers from his

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.480
needlessly angriness.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.100
We'll then dig a little deeper
and learn some of the tricks

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.980
you can use to make your news
apps even more engaging.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.900
And in particular, we're going
to be looking at how to use

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.270
precaching and analytics to
really serve up relevant,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.300
timely news without draining the
battery or sucking up all

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.210
of your bandwidth.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.700
So news apps have always
been amongst the most

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.920
popular apps on mobile.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.850
So you'd expect that at this
point, they were pretty

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.560
well-polished.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.460
And to a large degree,
this is true.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.700
There's a great range of
polished, intuitive apps that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.890
deliver timely and relevant news
articles both in the form

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.300
of aggregators, like News
Republic, or single-source,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.460
optimized apps like The Verge.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.920
And so these are the sorts of
things which we come to expect

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.380
from any decent news
app these days.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.610
It shouldn't drain
the battery.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.540
It should deliver timely,
relevant news.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.580
And it should really have
an easy-to-use UI.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.580
At this point, the expectations
around the user

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.490
interface for a news app are
pretty well understood.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.690
We've moved beyond that really
simple ListView, forced

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.710
refresh type approach to
something much more engaging

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.000
with rich media.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090
And so that's the sort of things
which we're expecting

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.725
from our apps.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:45.640
Now, that means that user
expectations, because they're

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.260
so much higher now, it's no
longer good enough to have

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.970
something which is just a
janky ListView that only

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.810
updates when you hit Refresh.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.930
These days, users are really
expecting something more

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.300
refined, something that really
stands out from the crowd, or

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.785
it's but the work of but a
moment to head back to Google

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:02.810
Play and find something better,
something which has

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.690
more of the news that you want
in a much nicer user

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.520
experience.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.870
So there's a variety of
options to help your

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.140
news app stand out.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Now, some of my favorites
include the clever use of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.480
notifications and the ability
to customize my news feed,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120
even without having to log in.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.060
And so these are some of the
additional extras that we can

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.475
really use to boost your app.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.460
So smart notifications,
customization without logging

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.000
in, and, of course, widgets
as well, having a nice,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.540
resizable, engaging widget,
which is becoming, more and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.410
more, a must-have for
your news apps.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.280
So let's take a closer look at
two apps in particular, News

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.690
Republic and The Verge, before
looking at how you can

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.350
implement some of these more
advanced features yourself.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.220
Now, News Republic is currently

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190
my go-to news source.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.060
So it's fair to say
that I'm a fan.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.670
As you can see, their landing
page in Google Play is pretty

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.340
good, although I do wish that
they'd change their icon to

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.960
something a little more
distinctive rather than using

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.920
this variation of the old
rounded square approach,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.270
particularly as they
already have a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.330
really distinctive logo.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.450
And you can see that
within their logo

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.300
in both places here.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.390
It's got this News
Republic icon.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.010
And I think it would be really
interesting to explore that a

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.790
little bit further and see what
they could do to make

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.760
that a bigger part of both
the icon and the

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.300
overall feature graphic.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.620
Speaking of the feature graphic,
it's pretty good, but

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.690
perhaps a little bit too
detailed to really work well

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.880
when you shrink it down into
some of our smaller feature

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.720
graphic spots.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.900
I'd be really interested to see
a variation here that's a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.770
little bit more stylized,
perhaps losing the content of

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.990
the papers here while still
maintaining that same

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.140
stylistic look and feel.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.110
Similarly, within the logo
itself, maybe having larger

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.390
text, dropping the logo,
specifically,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.520
from the feature graphic.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.480
I think both of those things
could tend to make it a little

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.860
bit more engaging, particularly

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.050
as we make it smaller.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.200
But really, that's nitpicking.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.810
And a lot of the comments that I
have for News Republic today

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.200
are along those nit-picky lines,
because it really is a

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.290
really well-polished app.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.390
And they've done a great deal
of work here to make it

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.110
something that works really,
really well.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.990
So this here is my News
Republic home screen.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.620
And as you can probably tell,
I've customized it a little

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.579
with Google, Android, and UL top
stories all there on the

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.740
front page.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.200
Now, if we switch to the giant
phone, you can see that

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.520
they've implemented a number
of really nice transition

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.430
animations when switching
between topics.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.710
So I click here onto
top stories.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.230
You'll see it all flies out
before filling it all in.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.545
And you can see it's got that
nice intro in animation.

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:44.080
So every time you move around
the app, everything floats and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.470
flies with you, which
is really nice.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.220
Everything slides
in, slides out.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.530
You can see that again.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.500
Get rid of the interstitial.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.040
The interstitial ads do take
longer to display, which is

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.800
interesting.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.950
I guess if I had to make a
choice between the ads taking

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.440
too long to display or the news
articles, I would prefer

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.760
that the news articles
are faster.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.180
And that is the way that
it works, though those

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.150
interstitials can be a little
bit frustrating at times.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.780
So let's have a look.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.400
You can also see that once
you're within a particular

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.390
topic, they've implemented a--

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.250
once you're reading each
particular article, I should

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.090
say, the first time through, you
get told how to interact

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.800
with it, which is probably
a good thing.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.020
And you can see here, they've
got the standard view page and

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.380
model for swiping between apps,
which is really nice.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.360
And up here at the top here, you
can see the disappearing,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.050
reappearing tab headers.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.970
So you can see how far through
a particular topic you are,

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.850
which is really nice.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.320
It follows their standard UI
guidelines while putting its

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.880
own personalized take on that.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.200
And of course, probably one of
the most impressive animations

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.710
that they've got within the app
is there signature topic

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.330
search cloud that's implemented
really nicely.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.040
So if I click up here, their
search cloud icon, and you can

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.410
see I get this really nice
search cloud for all of the

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.410
topics which are discussed
within a particular article.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.920
So you can scroll along here and
then use this the way you

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.280
would scroll Wikipedia and say,
oh, actually, I want to

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.260
look at Google articles.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.260
You click on that.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.100
And it will take you straight
to that sublist

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.330
of the Google stuff.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.560
And you can do this as you're
going within each topic, or

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:36.150
within each article to further
dig within that topic group.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.200
And they've actually got a few
different approaches here.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.615
So you can have a square.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:46.310
Or you can have a scrolling
hoop, I suppose you'd say.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.500
So they've got some really
nice animations here.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.330
And it really creates a really
rich and engaging experience

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.490
which really encourages you to
keep exploring within the app,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.640
which is a really key thing
within a news app.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.040
You really want to keep people
jumping from article to

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.510
article, reading as much as
possible without exiting your

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.980
app because they're bored or
they've read what they've come

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.790
to look at.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.720
Now, in particular, I think News
Republic does two really

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.230
difficult things really well.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.290
So if we switch back to the
slides, I'll demonstrate what

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.420
I'm talking about.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.130
Beautiful.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.900
So what you can see, first off,
they've implemented a

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.030
really excellent breaking
news notification.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.590
This doesn't trigger too often
for me, maybe two,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.240
three times a day max.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.230
So it's not intrusive.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.760
It doesn't make me feel as
though it's running in the

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.290
background, draining my
battery all the time.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.270
But it does pop up.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.330
And it does remind me of
breaking news as it happens.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.220
And then the actual
implementation of the

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.560
notification is really,
really good.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.170
It's a rich notification
straight off.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.580
So it's got an image.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.260
It has a generous snippet of
news, so I can actually read

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.970
what that breaking news headline
is, and not just the

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.290
headline, but actually the
article lead to know whether

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.100
it's something which I
want to read further.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.190
And what they've done really
well to get that bonus point

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.010
is that they've actually let me
interact with it directly

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.210
from the notification.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.990
So you can see I can share
directly from here, or,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.710
indeed, indicate my mood, the
way that this article makes me

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.780
feel, which is another
killer feature for

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.950
News Republic here.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.370
They really encourage users
to signal the mood

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.620
evoked by each article.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.740
And they let me do this without
having to log in.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.260
So basically, once I start
up, I can log in.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.520
I can choose to give them
credentials so that my

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.220
preferences are persistent
across devices and logins.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.710
But without having to do
anything, I can straight away

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.890
start to interact and tell
them what my mood is.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.370
And why is this important?

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.740
Well, this lets them, then,
customize the things which I

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.480
want to hear about.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.820
So my breaking news
notifications, even the news

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.430
feed itself, can all be
optimized around the articles

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.820
which I interact with.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.730
In particular, it gives you
an idea of what kind of an

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.070
article it is, whether people
are surprised, angry, sad,

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.320
happy, which is useful
in and of itself.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.220
But apart from that, it's just
a signal that people are

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.870
interested enough in a
particular article

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.440
to engage with it.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.660
So that gives them really useful
analytics that they can

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.210
use for a number of
different things.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.010
Now, they can use that feedback
to either choose

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.390
which notifications
I'm using or to

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.436
customize the feed directly.

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:20.310
Now, overall, I think News
Republic have done these

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.460
things really, really well.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.280
There's really little jank.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.260
I really seldom find myself
waiting for images or articles

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.320
to download.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.510
And the UI offers some really
unique features, such as their

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.470
subject cloud, without deviating
too far from the

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.690
standard UI guidelines.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.370
I never feel like I'm lost
within the app, unsure of how

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.110
to do something or how
to get somewhere.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.130
It's all where I expect it to
be with the occasional happy

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.080
surprise of something I
wasn't expecting but

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.995
I'm happy to see.

00:09:45.995 --> 00:09:49.040
Now, there are a couple of areas
where I'd like to see

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.200
them adhere a little more
closely to the UI guide.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.240
And in particular, it's
really centered

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.320
around the action bar.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.080
So you can see here that they've
created their own

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.530
action bar implementation,
which is totally fine and

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.760
understandable if you want to
have backwards compatibility

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.210
and not have to have too many
different versions of the app.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.990
But some of their choices are
a little bit jarring to an

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.050
experienced Android user.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.145
So in particular, the overflow
menu is pretty nonstandard.

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:14.500
And you can see here, the size
of each menu item is

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.810
slightly too large.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.100
Separator lines are
a little too dark.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.030
And all the text is
right-aligned, which is off.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.980
They should all be
left-aligned.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.470
And they've added icons, which
is really nonstandard.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.570
So there's nothing particularly
wrong about the

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.250
way this looks except that
it doesn't look the

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.930
way I expect it to.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.520
So when I hit it, it creates
this cognitive dissonance

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.220
moment of, OK, this isn't
what I was expecting.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.550
And so whenever you're
surprising your users with

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.220
something that they're not
expecting, that can break them

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.720
out of their engagement,
make them second

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.960
guess themselves, almost.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.270
It's like, oh, did I
do something wrong?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.710
I was expecting this to happen
and something else did.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.960
You want to avoid those
circumstances where you're

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.010
forcing users to question their
own behavior as that's

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.770
going to make them less
confident, make them less

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.343
willing to explore your
app and find some

00:10:59.343 --> 00:11:00.593
of the hidden gems.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.890
And in fact, it goes that little
one step further within

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.790
the action bar itself.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.390
You can see that once you go
beyond the menu to the actual

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.380
action bar icons, in particular
the mood and share

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.640
icons, they're also a
little non-standard.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.085
They're a bit too dark.

00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:20.000
The overflow menu item itself
looks a lot like the standard

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.720
overflow menu but
isn't quite it.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.980
It's too dark.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.260
The dots are slightly too big.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.380
So again, we're talking really
slight variation, but just

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.510
enough to be a little
bit disconcerting.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.130
So it's fair to say
that all this

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.240
has been pretty nit-picky.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.220
But it's small details like this
that are like having sand

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.250
in your bathers.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.100
It's small, but constantly
irritating.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.780
So it would be great to see
the team, perhaps, work on

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.200
those things.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.170
But overall, a really
fantastic app.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.630
Like I said, I go to a
news app every day.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.520
So I'm a big fan.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.950
Now The Verge, as opposed to
News Republic, which is a

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.960
content aggregator, The Verge
is a single-source news app

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.850
that effectively wraps
a popular tech

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.680
news site, The Verge.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.680
And we figured that The Verge
spends enough time talking

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.340
about us that it might
be fun to talk a

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.080
little bit about them.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.130
So we'll start off with their
landing page, which is great.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.570
It's got a distinctive logo
which everyone recognizes.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.540
And its feature graphic
is really stand out.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.740
Now personally, I think they may
have overdone the padding

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.870
and transparency a little bit
so that the actual logo and

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.890
words are a little bit small on
the feature graphic here.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.390
I'd think about making that
a little more opaque and a

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.660
little bit bigger, just so that
when we shrink it down to

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.460
some of the smaller feature
slots on a phone, it's still

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.710
legible and recognizable.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.320
Now, single-source apps tend
to be a bit of a mixed bag.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.040
It's not uncommon to see
companies having an intern

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.770
wrap their RSS feed in a
ListView and call it a day.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.420
Because people are passionate
readers of a particular site,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.620
they will download the app
and use it no matter what

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.610
the UX and UI is.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.510
But it's just not going to give
them a great experience.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.470
And you got to remember that
your app, your Android app,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.660
your mobile app, is a
representation of your

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.170
website, of your brand,
more importantly.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.330
So if you're going to go to the
effort of building an app,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.160
you need to make sure that it's
something that represents

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.300
your brand in a positive way.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.450
Good news is that The Verge
have done that.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.350
It is a good app.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.750
They've done a great job.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.890
It's a simple design, but very
intuitive, as it should be.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.260
One of the advantages of a
single-source app like this is

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.220
that you don't need to figure
out how to incorporate lots of

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.960
different sections from lots of
different news sources with

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.680
potentially different styles of
writing, different styles

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.210
of layout, different
styles of imagery.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.490
It all comes from your site,
so you can be much more

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.520
aggressive in your assumptions
as to the way you'll be

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.460
getting the information and the
way that that information

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.440
should be displayed.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.730
So you can see right off the bat
they've separated the app

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.220
into three sections using a
standard view page that works

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.650
really well.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.730
So you can swipe between those
three main topics.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.000
And again, this front page is
really nice and engaging.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.170
You've got big, rich graphics.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.360
Particularly the top story has
that full bleed image in the

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.860
background.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.780
In fact, it may even be worth
considering doing that more.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.360
If you have that ability, if you
have the ability to know

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.820
what graphics you're going to
get, what format that they're

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.020
in because it's your site, it
can create a really engaging

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.470
experience if you make that
front page just graphics,

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.950
graphics, graphics, full
bleed with headline

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.270
text over the top.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.450
Now, you do need to be careful
to weigh that up against

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.330
readability.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.604
It's no use having a
great-looking front page if no

00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:28.540
one can read the articles
if that's the point.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.860
But it's something to consider,
perhaps trying to

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.980
make what we've got here for the
lead article more common

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.230
throughout the ListView.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.060
They've also implemented the
draw pattern the right way,

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.230
which is always nice to see.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.380
And this is an alternative here
that uses an alternative

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.580
for hiding options that you
might otherwise expect to see

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.220
in the overflow menu.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.140
I think that works really well,
particularly for the

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.430
additional navigation options,
going between

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.510
sections and so on.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.210
It really lets them have that
really clean front page with

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.600
just the three swipers
rather than having

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.220
endless different sections.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.290
But I'm not sure it's the right
place for things like

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.460
Account and About.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.880
And I can see that you've put
them here so that all the

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.400
navigation options
are in one place.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.580
But personally, I think they
would be better off back in

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.590
the overflow menu, away from the
rest of the navigation, so

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.930
that this stays as clean
as possible.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.880
I think that's a really good
theme, overall, whenever

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.140
you're building that navigation
structure for your

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.760
app is you want to try and give
people as few options as

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.850
possible whenever possible.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.420
So if there are things like
Account and About which need

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.650
to be in the app, and if people
want them, they'll find

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.770
them, but this is a good example
where they may be

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.110
better off away from this
other, more standard

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.120
navigation.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.040
There's a lot of really nice
touches in the app.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.060
I particularly like the way that
they've handled comments

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.420
and updates for stories
really intuitively.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.150
You've got things like if
there are updates to the

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.440
stories, then the actual
ListView will have those

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.320
updates underneath.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.330
And you're able to swipe
through to get them.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.780
Really tidy.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.540
Same with comments.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.030
They've got a separate page.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.260
Using the standard action bar
for adding comments and a

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.420
standard ListView for reading
them looks really nice.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.790
Now, there's maybe one or two
exceptions to things which are

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.450
done the right way.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.580
And I think, most notably, is
once you have drilled into a

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.200
topic and you're reading an
article, it's not possible to

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.600
swap between the articles
within a topic.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.680
The way that we saw earlier
in News Republic

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.860
worked really well.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.760
So that would be really nice
to see something like that.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.850
And the reason for that is--

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.550
now, I don't want to
have to navigate

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.440
back out to the topic.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.230
It breaks that flow.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.970
And it's back to what I
was saying earlier.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.310
When you're building a news app,
you really want to keep

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.090
people reading as long
as possible.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.140
And every time they have to
click, it's one more step.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.200
It's that little bit longer.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.610
So you want to reduce the number
of clicks between any

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.380
given action for a user
to get what they want.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.480
And so that ability to swipe
through articles the way that

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.950
you would flip the pages of a
newspaper is a really good

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.350
metaphor, and it's one which
people are used to from

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.420
reading, whether it be books,
magazines, or newspaper.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.420
This idea of getting to a
section and then just being

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.550
able to swipe through
article after

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.080
article is really familiar.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.880
So I think it would be really
great to see something like

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.020
that implemented here
using a view pager.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.960
And this segues nicely into the
first of my more generic

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.930
recommendations for building
engaging news apps.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.880
Now, number one is you really
want to be using analytics.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.530
Now, I've highlighted here the
Google Analytics for Android

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.040
applications' website.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.470
But really, it can be this.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.359
It can be something homegrown.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.250
It can be something
else entirely.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.160
But what you want to be doing is
tracking really closely the

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.120
actions that your users
are taking.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.610
This can be completely
anonymized.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.630
It's not important that you
understand who it is and what

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.520
they've done.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.680
Really, you just want to get a
glimpse into how things are

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.230
working, which topics are
popular, which articles are

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.140
popular, which articles are
being fully read, which topics

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.620
are people reading all
the articles in.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.110
That's going to give you a lot
of really rich information

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.190
that you can use to customize
that feed and make that use

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.480
more and more relevant.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.990
So the best way to do this is
just the first time the app

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.370
starts up to assign it a UUID,
just a random, universally

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.880
unique identifier so that you're
able to keep track of

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.240
what people are doing in a way
that allows you to customize

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.330
their news feed accordingly.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.010
So you can do that in
a couple of ways.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.130
So once you've got that
information and you understand

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.310
what someone's reading habits
are-- and it's important, as

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.940
well, to make sure that people
understand that you're doing

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.330
this so that they know that you
are keeping track of what

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.330
they're reading if you plan
to do it in a way that is

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.300
personalized to them.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.640
So first off, you can customize
the notifications

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.180
and, potentially, their
widget contents.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.410
So these are the things which
you're pulling out to

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.340
specifically highlight to them
either on their homescreen

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.810
widget or within these broadcast
alert notifications.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.790
Now, this is really important
because it lets you tailor

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.960
that content to something that
they're likely to want to see.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.140
And this is really important
for notifications.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.000
If you're going to be popping
something up, interrupting

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.410
their flow, you want to make
sure it's something that

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.730
they're going to be
interested in.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.900
So understanding what topics
they have selected, what

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.920
articles they tend to read, is
a really powerful tool for

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.640
being able to do that.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.510
Now, you can take this a step
further and aggregate all the

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.490
results server-side.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.190
And this may, in fact, be an
even better option, in some

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.870
cases, than trying to make it
to customized, to find out

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.390
what is everyone reading, what
are the articles that everyone

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.187
is clicking, everyone is
reading through, and

00:19:22.187 --> 00:19:24.900
potentially, what are
they all sharing.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.180
And that is probably something
which everyone else is going

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.950
to be interested in.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.680
So you can take those aggregated
server-side results

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.250
and use it to use
cloud-to-device messaging to

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.540
ping everyone that this is an
article that they may want to

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.430
read and pop up a notification
accordingly.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.900
Now, you can then expand this
beyond a single article to

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.555
help decide which articles
to prefetch.

00:19:44.555 --> 00:19:46.750
Now, we've talked about
prefetching before.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.980
Particularly for something like
news, it's a really great

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.730
way to help reduce latency,
improve offline support, and

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.380
reduce the battery cost of
getting those regular updates.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.420
It's really a way of you being
able to figure out what is the

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.190
user going to need in the next
two to five minutes.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.380
Well, get it all now.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.880
So then, as soon as they
click on something,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.640
it's already there.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.330
They don't have to
wait at all.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.680
There's also a significant
battery cost associated with

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.160
turning on the cell radio in
order to download things.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.010
So you want to try and bundle
all of that together.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.915
And prefetching is a great way
of being able to take all of

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.660
the articles which you think
they may read, pre-downloading

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.230
them so that you don't
have to do it each

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.980
time they click one.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.170
Now, if you know what articles
or topics that a user is

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.140
likely to actually read,
including the frequency at

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.740
which they're likely to read it,
you stand a great chance

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.400
of downloading the right data
at the right time and really

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.510
have a dramatic impact on
battery life while also

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.930
reducing that latency
to nearly zero.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.140
So that lets you aggressively
prefetch, making sure that you

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.360
always have fresh articles to
read and reducing that latency

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.480
when you click a headline.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.020
So it's a really
great approach.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.280
And you can see here a code
snippet which lets you vary

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.850
the amount of data that you're
downloading based on the cell

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.660
radio connection that you have,
which really boils down

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.930
to the faster the radio, the
more data you should download

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.350
when your prefetching.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.230
So now that you're using
analytics and prefetching, you

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.110
run the risk of draining the
battery due to too frequent

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.850
radio state transitions.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.390
So to minimize this, you need
to bundle all your transfers

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.460
as much as possible.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.170
Now, analytics is a long game.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.530
Your algorithms don't need to
be working out, every click,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.990
how does this change the next
thing that we download.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.810
It really wants to be
working on large

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.300
corpuses of user data.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.550
So there's no particular urgency
to getting those

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.090
current usages, those clicks,
back to the server, which

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.170
means that you want to batch
them up and upload them at the

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.080
same time as you're going
to do other, more

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.030
time-sensitive transfers.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.950
So using a general pattern like
this one, you can ensure

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.530
that you're preempting
every next prefetch.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.200
So if your user clicks on a
headline which you haven't

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.240
already downloaded, you're
going to need to ping the

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.510
server and grab that content.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.950
That's a great time to initiate
the next prefetch, as

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.770
well, so the next bunch of
articles that the user may be

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.330
reading, as well as then
uploading all of your

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.070
analytics data.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.530
So the trick here is to always
try and reduce the number of

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.450
times you turn on the radio to
initiate a transfer while

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.940
still avoiding wasting data.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.220
So you don't want to download
data that you're

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.185
never going to use.

00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:12.260
But if you do have the radio on,
it's a great opportunity

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.480
to try and download as
much as you can.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.600
So we've been talking about
doing everything anonymously,

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.290
which is great.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.920
It has some real advantages.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.130
But there are always advantages
to actually knowing

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.850
who your user is.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.410
So with the new Google+ sign-in
for Android, available

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.900
as part of Google Play services,
you can carry

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.940
preferences between devices
without your users needing to

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.550
create yet another username
and password.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.370
And because it's social, you
can do clever things like

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.350
customize the news feeds which
are being displayed to each

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.120
user based on what their friends
are reading or what

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.380
their friends are finding
interesting.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.370
So it's a great way of being
able to do that dynamic social

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.660
sharing as frictionless
as possible.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.560
So our next step is to take a
closer look at today's apps

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.100
and see how close they are
to being pure Android.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.130
To do that, we're going to
pass them through each of

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.540
these standard Pure Android
checklists.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.330
The apps today were actually
pretty good.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.860
So I think they stand an
excellent chance of getting

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.140
into this category.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.450
And we'll certainly be working
with the developers to try and

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.370
help them better understand some
of the subtleties which

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.320
we're not able to fully describe
within our 30 minute

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:17.950
allocation.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.240
So we'll be getting in touch
with these guys.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.170
And hopefully we'll see some
updates in the near future.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.740
Until then, you can find our
existing Pure Android

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.000
collection at
bit.ly/PureAndroid.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.790
And you can nominate your app
for consideration by adding it

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.710
to our Trello page.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.230
Just search for App Clinic
Trello and it will take you

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.300
right there.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.270
Now, we're going to be back
later in the week to have a

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.190
look at podcast creation apps.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.500
But the Android design and
action team are going to be

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.700
taking a break tomorrow.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.870
So there will be no Android
design and action this week,

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:47.460
unfortunately.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.730
But they will be
back next week.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.080
So until Friday,
I'm Reto Meier.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.510
And this has been
the App Clinic.
