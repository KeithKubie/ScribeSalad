00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.550
So how do we compute this?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.980
Well, first,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.580
we want to be able to create a discrete
inverse response function from the data.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.900
And we refer to this as,
let's say, say G of Z,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.685
and what we're basically interested
in for each pixel site, and

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.675
I just showed you three in
the last image In image j.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.575
I just showed you five, and
I basically showed the plot was,

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:23.565
were about 15 of them.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.395
For each pixel site, and
we can choose a few good number of them,

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:31.415
all of the images,
we will compute the values, and

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:36.645
again we do this I'm in log here,
of both the exposures, And,

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:40.220
a time, to compute a function g(z).

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.870
I mean, doing in this log
allows us to do addition.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.420
Otherwise, remember we would be
doing this as a multiplication.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.510
Of course, what we have now is
an overdetermined linear system for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.450
N pixels over P different
exposure images.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.050
So again, we have P different
exposure images and we have N pixels.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.500
We basically started off with I,
side pixel I and image J.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.300
Now of course we have a number of
pixels that we want to measure,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.580
and the number of exposures.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.010
Remember, last time we basically showed
5, we had 15, and I had 3 points.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.820
So N was 3, and
P was 15 to create those plots.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.930
Now, of course, what we can do now is
create a system of linear equations,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.949
log of exposure, log of the time itself.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.320
And then, basically, subtracting by this
and this basically let's us do, you know,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.490
these squared difference.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.920
Of course, what we basically now do
is come up with a fitting term and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
a smoothness term.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.610
And this is the,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.000
kind of way we basically solve these
types of linear optimization problems.
