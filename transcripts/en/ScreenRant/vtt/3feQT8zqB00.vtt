00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.210
The internet has given the world so many amazing
things.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.430
It’s mostly videos of cats in boxes or dogs
wearing boots for the first time.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.340
But anyone who’s been online in the last
decade has probably come across something

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.000
else, too: memes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.580
While memes can draw inspiration from just
about anywhere, some of the most popular are

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.120
based on our favorite films!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.540
Here are 10 Amazing Movies That Started Famous
Internet Memes.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.070
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,
There’s a skill to being condescending.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.210
The speaker takes on the task of filling every
word with venom.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.159
And the audacity it takes to look someone
in the eye while doing it?

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.989
Well, that takes the verbal assault to a whole
new level.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.879
Since parts of the internet operate as a safe
space for grumps to be grumpy, we can see

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.469
why there’s a need for this kind of social
exchange to be meme-ified.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.260
Thanks to some Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
Factory fans, Condescending Wonka was born.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.019
Using a frame from the Everlasting Gobstopper
sequence, users worldwide have been bonding

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.449
through sarcasm.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.650
Even though in the context of the movie the
pose is fairly innocuous.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.500
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.020
Given that The Lord of the Rings has been
building it’s following since the 1950’s,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.850
it’s fair to say that at least a couple
people were excited after the three original

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.850
movies were announced.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.810
When you have that much material to work with,
something’s bound to stick.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.210
One scene shows the characters having a roundtable
about bringing the titular ring to Mordor.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.050
Boromir (Sean Bean) describes the terrors
involved in the journey.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.550
After feeling like the group is underestimating
the situation’s difficulty, he drops some

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.810
knowledge . It’s so perfect that people
use it when explaining how things might not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.100
be what they seem.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.410
The Matrix,
The Matrix introduced the world to a pile

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.870
of things we’d never seen: bullet time,
armless sunglasses, and a good Keanu Reeves

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.610
movie to name a few.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.030
But it also gave us Morpheus.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.090
The all-knowing, fearless leader of the unplugged
Nebuchadnezzar crew.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.340
Much is made of the wizened ringleader’s
philosophical nature, and the other characters

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.400
are constantly looking to him for guidance.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.000
The filmmakers did such a good job of this,
that his reputation extends beyond the confines

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of his movie.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.590
Memes with his face have sprung up all over,
and are often used to give relatively small

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.590
advice.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.249
And depending on who you are, it will either
blow your mind or make you roll your eyes.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.299
The Avengers,
Speaking of eye-rolling, you might have noticed

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.999
one of our favorite Avengers is guilty of
this offence.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.599
In a blink and you’ll miss it moment, Iron
Man (Robert Downey Jr).

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.500
turns up the sass after Captain America (Chris
Evans) gives himself a pat on the back for

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.610
recognizing a Wizard of Oz reference.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
Robert Downey Jr. delivers an eye roll that
puts all teenage girls to shame.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.279
The frame is dripping with attitude, and since
everyone has their own pet peeves, it’s

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.989
become a symbol of indifference to some, while
others see it as a visual embodiment of the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.650
phrase “here we go again”.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.420
The Big Lebowski,
Have you ever felt like the only person on

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.799
earth who’s paying attention?

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.569
The only one following the rules?

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.569
Surprise!

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.889
You’re not actually alone!

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.959
Walter (John Goodman) from 1998’s The Big
Lebowski knows what you’re going through,

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.469
because he’s been there himself.

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:12.610
The gun-toting veteran is a stickler for regulations,
and isn’t afraid to call bullshit on violators.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.849
After another guy at the movie’s bowling
alley goes off-book, Walter pulls his gun

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.409
and loudly wonders if he’s the only one
who “gives a shit about the rules”.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.969
Of the people who treat the internet like
their own personal soapbox, Walter’s seems

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.370
to be the meme of choice.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.049
Star Wars,
There’s no denying that the Star Wars movies

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.670
have had a huge impact on popular culture.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.319
They’re some of the most-watched films ever
made, and the franchise has left it’s footprints

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.439
all over the place.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.260
Trying to track down every single occurrence
would be a fool’s errand, so we’re not

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.480
even going to try.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.370
And even in a conversation about memes, there
were a few Star Wars offerings to choose from.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.200
But one of the most entertaining has to be
the Star Wars Kid.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.889
It’s amazing what we humans will do to pass
the time.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.290
Plus, who among us hasn’t imagined themselves
in the middle of a light saber duel?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.340
Anchorman,
Anchorman is a veritable treasure trove of

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.400
epic quotes.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.290
Written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the
movie is hilarious from start to finish.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.459
Farrell nails so many lines with his deadpan
delivery that if you’re not paying attention,

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.559
you’re bound to miss something great.

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.792
After a bloody brawl with some rivals, the
Channel Four News Team regroup over a beer

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:17.040
and talk about the fight.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.459
Putting it mildly, Ron downplays the severity
of the days events with his even tone.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.510
Someone realized that this scene delivers
the perfect out for anyone finding themselves

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.490
in a suddenly serious, awkward conversation.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.890
300,
Zack Snyder’s take on 300 chronicles the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.080
sweaty, topless battle at Thermopylae (“thurm-op-ah-lee”)
between the Spartans and Persians.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.670
The movie did good things for a lot of industries;
gym memberships, leather briefs, and body

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.720
airbrushing all got really popular - for better
or for worse.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.150
But one corner of the internet saw a different
opportunity, and turned the bloody flick into

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.880
one of the most enduring memes to date.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.850
In one of the movie’s most serious moments,
Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is giving one hell

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.380
of a pump-up speech to the troops about dining
in hell.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.660
And while his character yells a lot, this
scene is the one used most often in the memes.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.630
The Great Gatsby,
There are tons of good occasions to throw

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.450
a quick cheers in the air before you get down
to drinking.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.310
Birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations
are all reason enough to take that quick pause

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.200
before you get absolutely obliterated.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.420
But after the release of 2013’s The Great
Gatsby, one particular salute spread like

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.490
wildfire.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.630
When Gatsby’s character is finally introduced,
he raises his glass in a simple way, but the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.920
insane pyrotechnics going off behind him makes
it truly epic.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.190
People send the gif around as a glitzy way
to say “touché” to one other.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.040
Sarcastic or not, it’s usually a genuine
pleasure to receive one.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.190
Jumanji,
Have you ever played a game and wished that

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.280
it was real?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.810
Anyone who’s ever seen Jumanji knows it’s
important to be careful what you wish for.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.680
After being absorbed into the fabric of the
game decades earlier, Robin Williams’ character

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.620
is trapped for decades until two new players
unearth it and decide to roll the dice.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.370
Since time didn’t stop for Williams, he
emerges from his purgatory a fully-grown man,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.420
with the fully-grown beard to match.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.460
As you can probably imagine, it’s hard to
keep track of the time when you’re stuck

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.470
in a board game.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.030
So the first thing he wants to know is what
year it is.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.450
What do you think of our list?

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.240
Did we skip over your favorite movie-based
meme?
