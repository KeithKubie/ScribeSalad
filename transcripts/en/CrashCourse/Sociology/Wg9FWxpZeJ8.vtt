00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Where my ladies at?

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.080
Seriously, we’ve spent a lot of time learning about
the origins of sociology, and all of the founders we’ve
talked about so far have been men.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.300
That’s because, when sociology was
becoming an academic discipline, women didn’t
have the same access to education.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.420
In fact, it was considered improper in the
19th century for women to write articles and
give talks to the public.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.620
And this continued for decades, with some
of the top universities not allowing female
students until the 1970s.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.580
Which sucks.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.000
But it also raises an important question:
Why do women and men get treated differently?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.119
This is a question that sociologists can answer!

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.520
Or, well, we can at least try to answer it.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.900
Gender-conflict theory applies the principles
of conflict theory to the relations among genders.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.000
Specifically, it looks at how social structures
perpetuate gendered inequalities.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.160
Now, the functionalist approach has historically
held that gender inequalities are a natural result of each
gender taking on the tasks they’re best suited for.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.680
But many modern sociologists don’t share
this view.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.020
Economic and political power structures that
reinforce traditional gender roles often cause
more dysfunction than function.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.500
Restricting access to education by gender
is a great example of this dysfunction:

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.880
Denying women access to quality education makes our
society worse by squashing the half the world’s potential!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.820
Sociology’s understanding of society wouldn’t be complete without the women and feminists who started the conversation about gender as an academic field of study.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.200
First stop: sociology’s forgotten founder,
Harriet Martineau.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:25.320
[Theme Music]

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.260
Harriet Martineau was the first female sociologist,
born in 1802 in England.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.380
Unlike Marx or Durkheim or Weber, who are hailed as the forefathers of sociology and get entire chapters devoted to their theories, Martineau typically gets, at most, a couple of sentences in a textbook.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.140
Martineau started out kind of like the Crash
Course of her time – bringing research to
the masses in easily digestible bites.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.600
She wrote a best-selling series called Illustrations
on the Political Economy, which used fables

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.340
and a literary style of writing to bring the
economic principles of Adam Smith to the
general public.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060
She was a favorite of many of the leading
intellectuals of the time.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.600
Even Queen Victoria, who loved Martineau’s
writing so much that she invited Martineau
to her coronation.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.040
But this was just the start.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.480
Martineau decamped for the United States and
spent two years travelling the country, observing
social practices.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.420
She went from North to South, from small towns to Washington DC, sitting in on sessions of Congress, a Supreme Court session, and a meeting with President Madison.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.580
She then captured her observations in two
books, Society in America and How to Observe
Morals and Manners.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.400
The first was a set of three volumes that
identified principles that Americans professed to
hold dear, like democracy, justice, and freedom.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.660
Then she documented the social patterns that she
observed in America, and contrasted the values that
Americans thought they held,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.740
with the values that were actually enshrined in
their economic and political systems.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.120
Martineau’s observations included some of the
first academic observations of American gender roles,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.320
and she dedicated much of the third volume
to the study of marriage, female occupations,
and the health of women.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.040
Despite the title of her second book – How
to Observe Morals and Manners – it was not
a guide to etiquette.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.900
It was a treatise on research methodology,
describing how to do cross-cultural studies
of morals and moral behavior.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.220
Martineau talked about interviewing, sampling,
bias in observation, the problem of generalizing
from individuals to a whole society –

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520
many of the hallmarks of modern research.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.240
She wrote about class, religion, suicide,
nationalism, domestic life, gender, crime, health –

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.480
and this was all before Marx, before
Durkheim, before Weber.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.280
And her English translations of Comte’s
work on positivist sociology were so good
that Comte himself told her:

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.780
“I feel sure that your name will be linked with mine.”

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.260
But of course, Comte was wrong.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.700
Soon after her death, Martineau’s work was
forgotten.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.540
It wasn’t until the 1970s, when feminist scholars
began to revisit her work, that the full extent of her
influence on sociology began to be realized.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.300
That’s right, feminist scholars.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.420
Now, I know for many people feminism is a
loaded term.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.460
And I want to make sure we’re clear about
the historical and sociological context for
feminism as I’m using it here.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.120
Here, we’re defining feminism as the support
for social equality among genders.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.360
This is in opposition to patriarchy, a form of social
organization in which institutional structures,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.140
like access to political power, property rights,
and occupations, are dominated by men.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.740
So feminism isn’t just associated with activism;
it’s also a scholarly term.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.400
Feminist theory is one school of thought in
the study of gender.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.440
And over time, feminism has gone through many
different forms, often categorized as waves.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.820
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to look at
what’s known as feminism’s first wave.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.740
In the 19th and early 20th century, the first wave
of feminism focused on women’s suffrage – or,
the right to vote – and other legal inequalities.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.820
That’s because, in the 19th century, all
property and money that a woman had legally
belonged to her husband.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.900
Imagine that.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.660
Not being able to earn a salary that was your
own, not being able to own land, not being
able to write a will.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.580
And on top of that, you can’t vote, which
makes it a little hard to change these things.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.640
It was these issues that prompted the start
of the Women’s Rights Movement, which began

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.680
with a meeting of 300 like-minded women – and
a few men – in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.420
Early feminists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the meeting to put forth a manifesto on women’s rights, which became known as the Declaration of Sentiments.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.680
This convention was the spark that set off the
women’s suffrage movement in the United States.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.140
It took many years of activism – court cases,
speeches, protests, and hunger strikes – until
women finally won the right to vote in 1920.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.300
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.280
The first wave of feminism didn’t only affect
legal issues.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.450
It was also where many of the ideas about
societal roles of gender first got their start.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.210
Take Charlotte Perkins Gilman, for example.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.370
You might recognize her as the author of the
short story “The Yellow Wallpaper.”

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.940
But she was also a sociologist and social
activist.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.740
Early in the 20th century, she published papers
and books on society’s assumptions about gender,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.920
focusing on marriage, childbearing, and the
assumed roles of women as housekeepers and
men as breadwinners.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.000
She wrote: “There is no female mind.
The brain is not an organ of sex.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.700
Might as well speak of a female liver.”

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.200
Notice how she worded that – the brain is
not an organ of sex.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.140
Sex refers to biological distinctions between
females, males, and intersex individuals.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.340
But gender refers to the personality traits
and social roles that society attaches to
different sexes.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.540
Think about it this way: Do men and women act
the same way across all cultures and time periods?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.520
If gender arose only from biological differences between men and women, we would expect to see all cultures defining femininity and masculinity in the same ways.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.620
But we don’t.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:59.320
From the work of anthropologist Margaret Mead in the 1930s, to the research done today by economists Uri Gneezy and John List, scientists have found that gender roles change among societies, and over time.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.280
And this idea – the idea that gender has
societal origins – has formed the backbone
of the second wave of feminism.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.120
Books like The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir
and The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.920
argued against the idea that women were a
lesser sex, who should be resigned to taking
care of children and the home.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.230
The second wave of feminism focused on female
participation in the labor force, equal pay,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.760
reproductive rights, sexual violence, educational
equality, and divorce.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.180
This was the era of Title IX, the legalization
of contraception and abortion, no fault divorce
laws, and the Equal Pay Act.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.780
But it was also an era of divisiveness within
the feminist movement, with many feeling that

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.120
women in positions of power focused on issues
most relevant to white, upper middle class women.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.220
These divisions led to what’s known as the
third wave of feminism, starting in the 1990s,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.480
which has focused on broadening the definition
of feminism to encompass issues of race, class,
sexuality, and other forms of disadvantage.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.520
The ideas evoked by the third wave are nicely
represented by author and feminist bell hooks:

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.370
In her book “Ain’t I a Woman,” hooks
writes:

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.960
“The process begins with the individual
woman’s acceptance that American women,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.710
without exception, are socialized to be racist,
classist and sexist, in varying degrees ....”

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.250
That’s a heavy statement.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.040
Most people don’t think of themselves as
racist or sexist.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.770
But one of the underlying ideas behind third
wave feminism is the acknowledgement of the

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.960
structures of power that create inequality
across gender, race, class, and other dimensions
of disadvantage.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.780
There’s a term that’s used a lot in modern
day feminism, which maybe you’ve heard used
recently: intersectionality.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.600
So what is intersectionality?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.420
You add a little race-conflict theory in with
gender-conflict theory, and a smidge of Marx’s

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.580
theories about class conflict – and you
get intersectionality, the analysis of how

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.090
race, class, and gender interact to create
systems of disadvantage that are interdependent.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.600
The term intersectionality was coined by race
and gender theorist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.640
She wrote that the experience of being a black
woman couldn’t be understood just by understanding

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.250
the experience of a black person, or the experience
of a woman independently.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.420
Instead, you have to look at how these identities
intersect.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:53.040
How you – yes, you, in particular, you – see
society and see yourself is gonna be wrapped
up in the identities you have.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.980
I, as a cisgender white woman, will have a
different experience in the world as a result
of my own interlocking identities.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.780
And when it comes to our understanding of
gender in this societal mix, we have to thank

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.080
Harriet Martineau, whose work was one starting
point from which the waves of feminism unfolded.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.960
Today we learned about Harriet Martineau
and gender-conflict theory.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.460
We also explored the three waves of feminism,
as well as intersectionality.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.420
Next time, we’ll look at another important
figure in sociology Max Weber.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.280
