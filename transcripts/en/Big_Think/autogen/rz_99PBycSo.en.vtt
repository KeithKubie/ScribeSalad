it's great to trace things back to Alan

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
it's great to trace things back to Alan
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.280
it's great to trace things back to Alan
Turing you know he's in Bletchley Park

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
Turing you know he's in Bletchley Park
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.559
Turing you know he's in Bletchley Park
England he had come up with the concept

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
England he had come up with the concept
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.780
England he had come up with the concept
of the universal computing machine but

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
of the universal computing machine but
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.310
of the universal computing machine but
then he has to help put it in practice

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
then he has to help put it in practice
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.280
then he has to help put it in practice
to break the German wartime code so he

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
to break the German wartime code so he
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.129
to break the German wartime code so he
comes up with a device called ah the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
comes up with a device called ah the
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650
comes up with a device called ah the
bomb and then Colossus and these are

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
bomb and then Colossus and these are
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.429
bomb and then Colossus and these are
machines that can break the code and he

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
machines that can break the code and he
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.500
machines that can break the code and he
starts thinking about the difference

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
starts thinking about the difference
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.620
starts thinking about the difference
between human imagination and machine

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
between human imagination and machine
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870
between human imagination and machine
intelligence and he goes back to what he

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
intelligence and he goes back to what he
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479
intelligence and he goes back to what he
calls lady Lovelace's objection goes

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
calls lady Lovelace's objection goes
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790
calls lady Lovelace's objection goes
back to Ada Lovelace a hundred years

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
back to Ada Lovelace a hundred years
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889
back to Ada Lovelace a hundred years
earlier who had said machines will be

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
earlier who had said machines will be
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.560
earlier who had said machines will be
able to do everything except think and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
able to do everything except think and
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600
able to do everything except think and
so Turing comes up with what he calls

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
so Turing comes up with what he calls
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.180
so Turing comes up with what he calls
the imitation game now we call it the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
the imitation game now we call it the
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639
the imitation game now we call it the
Turing test in which it tries to figure

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
Turing test in which it tries to figure
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.130
Turing test in which it tries to figure
out how would you tell the difference

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
out how would you tell the difference
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.229
out how would you tell the difference
between a human and a machine how would

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
between a human and a machine how would
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.910
between a human and a machine how would
you know the machines not intelligence

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
you know the machines not intelligence
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740

a different room we send them in
questions and if after a while you can't

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
questions and if after a while you can't
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.010
questions and if after a while you can't
tell which ones a machine and which ones

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
tell which ones a machine and which ones
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860
tell which ones a machine and which ones
a human then it makes no sense to say

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
a human then it makes no sense to say
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350

since he came up with that concept we've
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910

would pass the Turing test or the
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390
would pass the Turing test or the
imitation game every now and then you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
imitation game every now and then you
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310
imitation game every now and then you
read about a machine that can sort of do

surprisingly we found it very difficult

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
surprisingly we found it very difficult
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270
