00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.360
You enjoyed a few parts of one

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.380
and some parts of the other.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.280
But when 2 popcorn movies are so aggressively OK,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.620
there's only enough to say about them to make one Honest Trailer.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.880
"Hahahahaha!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.600
Oh, you're being serious?"

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.840
Don't get mad we doubled these up. You know you went to see Black Panther instead anyway.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.040
Prepare for 2 perfectly fine, moderately entertaining films

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.420
that exist for the least exciting reasons:

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.780
Time Warner's legal department acquired an established IP from Paramount

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.040
and Comcast accountants noticed one of their movies overperformed in China

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.160
instead of, you know,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.120
someone had a new story to tell or something to say about the world or-

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
Yeah, I know, I sound like my grandpa.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.560
I'll just be in the shed.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.640
Suit up with 2 leads working their butts off to make these franchises a thing

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.220
as they both battle severe daddy issues

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.940
and Japanese McGuffins

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.040
in 2 films that start with fun opening sequences,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200
descend into by-the-numbers action,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.440
and end with a tease for a sequel that'll probably never come.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.680
"Tell them next time, we're gonna come for them."

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.440
"I'll take 2."

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.240
I'm good with one, thanks.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.260
Now that Oscar winner Guillermo del Toro, Ron Perlman, and Charlie Hunnam are gone,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.080
we're left with Pacific Finn,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620
a reluctant mentor to the next generation.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.940
Very reluctant.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.240
"Shut up, shut up!"

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.900
"I can't do that if you're yapping your gums."

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.520
"Your top lip and your bottom lip, they need to meet and become friends!"

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.100
"What record?"

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.840
"Shut up."

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.180
When he's sent secret information from a dead family member,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
he'll need to team up with an assortment of heroic Chinese people

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.660
"Sending help!

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.900
Transport inbound!"

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.120
to save the world in super impractical robot battles

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.560
that are so insanely destructive,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.660
there won't be much of a world left to live in either way.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.260
"How many buildings can this thing take?"

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.340
Now that Angelina Jolie, Jon Voight, and Lawrence Gordon are gone,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.060
we're left with Lara Croftfit,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.200
an orphan who gets in over her head.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.640
Way over her head.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:16.180
[Screaming]

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.000
When she's sent secret information from a dead family member,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800
she'll team up with an assortment of heroic Chinese people,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.820
then save the world in a super impractical tomb

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
that's so generic,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.080
you'll wish they left her as Lara Croft: Grubbed-Up Delivery Biker.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.500
You know, anyone can raid a tomb.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.120
Getting chipotle from Midtown to the Bronx in 20 minutes or less?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.560
Now that is exciting.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.020
But no 2 blockbusters are exactly alike.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.120
Gone is the female objectification from the first Tomb Raider

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.160
while Pacific Rim picks up the slack,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.560
"Eyes front, Pentecost."

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.400
and one has a villain too drab to be intersting

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.100
while the other has a villain too silly to be believed,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.540
"I'm ending the world."

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.860
where Uprising would've been better if it was more grounded in reality

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.260
while Tomb Raider would've been better with a little more fun.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.160
Or 3 big dinosaurs or...

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.060
something.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.160
So the next time all the new releases are checked out of Redbox

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.180
or you accidentally leave FX on on a Sunday afternoon,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.800
you can't go wrong settling on the movie based on the video game that was trying to look like the movie

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.500
or the movie trying as hard as it possibly can to look like a video game.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.480
Either way,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
you're gonna have an O...

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.500
K...

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.660
time.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.440
Eh, these days, OK would do just fine.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.920
That sounds like a parody name, but nope, his name is actually Burn Gorman.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.080
We're not the only ones who crossed Tomb Raider with another movie.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.780
The poster mixed it with Jurassic Park.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.800
"Alan!"
