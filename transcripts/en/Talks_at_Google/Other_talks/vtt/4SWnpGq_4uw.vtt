00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Norman Winarsky
is a venture adviser, lecturer,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.580
author, and angel investor.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.930
He is past president
of SRI ventures

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.220
at SRI International, a
world-leading research

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.490
institute founded by
Stanford University in 1946.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.130
He was a co-founder
and board member

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.060
of Siri, which was spun out
from SRI in January, 2008

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.070
and acquired by
Apple in April, 2010.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.640
Norman works with entrepreneurs,
startups, research institutes,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.890
and major companies to
create breakthrough ventures

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.210
or products.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.610
He is an author, a leader, a
lecturer, an Emmy Award winner,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.250
and is here to speak to us
today about his new book,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.520
"If You Really Want to
Change the World: A Guide

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.410
to Creating, Building,
and Sustaining

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.440
Breakthrough Ventures."

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.620
Welcome to Google, Norman.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.745
NORMAN WINARSKY: Thank you.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.102
Thank you so much.

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:51.078
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.380
So this is a pleasure.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.270
And first of all, it's a
pleasure to be here with you.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.770
And those who are connecting,
I believe, are many, as well.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.450
And I want you to feel
free to ask questions.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.740
This is my guess is
an audience that's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
particularly important, for
me at least, to want to reach,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.840
and where I stand matters.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.010
So is it better
over here, probably?

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.510
OK.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.810
As long as I'm
not blocking that.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.600
I particulaly want to reach
you because this book, which

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.240
is what this meeting,
this event is all about,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.470
is not about creating
just any venture

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.100
and building and sustaining.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
It's about
breakthrough ventures.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.410
And so first question to you is
how many of you would actually

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.700
like to start a venture or
be part of a startup venture?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.780
Could you raise your hands?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.070
And what I define by
breakthrough venture

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.410
is one that will have an
impact on the world, one

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.680
that people's passion was so
important that they really

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.340
want to have a positive
benefit on millions of people.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.290
That kind of venture,
how many people

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.860
would like to and have an
idea for that kind of venture

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.040
that they'd like to achieve?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.400
So that's what this is about.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.380
So that's what is distinguished.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.050
If you look up on Amazon
something like entrepreneurship

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.570
or innovation or
something like that,

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.830
you'll get about
50,000 to 70,000 books.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.430
That's not a good reason to
write a book in that space,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.270
then, unless you really
have something you really

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.550
want to make a difference on.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.970
So why did I write it?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.660
First of all, I think
the story of Siri

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.250
not just a story about
how we created a company,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.650
but it's about a process we
used to create that company,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.980
and that was a process
that I wanted to share.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.870
So the second is
that's the guide.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.190
The process we've
done-- and by the way,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.300
my coauthor's Henry Kressel.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.120
He was a managing
director at Warburg Pincus

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.950
and helped create
many companies.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.390
So the book is about our
experiences, about somewhere

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.030
between 10 and 20
companies that we've

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.730
helped create that had that
kind of breakthrough impact.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.000
So remarkably, the kind of
impact, the kind of companies

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.370
that we've created,
they've not had

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.450
a new formula or a new flavor
for how we created them.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.100
So what I'm really
telling you is information

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.530
that most great entrepreneurs
and most great venture

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.930
capitalists would
consider already

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.470
having been part
of their approach.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.660
This is not the next great
flavor or the next great diet

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.400
on how to create ventures.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.700
This is about how
our experiences been

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.601
over several decades
and dozens of companies

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:05.600
and what it took to create
those great ventures.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.630
I also feel, especially
having come from SRI,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.560
that we want to create
ventures that really make

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.500
a difference, which are
often in areas now that are

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.140
deep technology or deeply
difficult to commercialize--

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.060
things that relate to medical
devices, clean water, energy,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.590
helping the world in
many different ways.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.930
And researchers and
engineers and technologists

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.410
often don't feel that that's an
opportunity for venture capital

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.580
and investment.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.540
And I'm here to say
that's not true,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.800
that you can create
great ventures

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.260
from those
technologies, as well.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.570
The other point is,
and you'll read it

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.480
if you read it in the book
in the first few pages,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.460
this is not about
the narrow segment

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.740
of ventures that are usually
software ventures that you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.540
can get out into the market
with $50,000 or less of money,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.070
get some family money
and start pivoting often,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.090
fail fast, fail often,
and get to something.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.310
This is against that model.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.340
You can succeed with that model.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.960
It's not like I'm
trying to say you can't.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.610
But it's not the
kind of model where

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.670
if you really want to go
out and really, that's

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.330
why the word "really" is
emphasized in the book,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
intend to change the world.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.760
That's not the model I would
recommend you start with,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.990
and so we'll be talking
about that model.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.010
The other thing is,
while I'm talking,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.510
I've set aside like 30
minutes or so for presentation

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.450
and another 30 for discussion.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.920
But I am a teacher, too, so I
just finished my first class

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.560
at Stanford.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.830
I'm teaching the GSB second-year
graduate students there.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.080
So I like questions.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.050
So if any of you feel that
you need to understand,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.720
that would really make
it an engaging time.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.360
And the harder the
question, the better.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.850
First of all, my experience,
though-- why am I here?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.115
One is by SRI, I created the SRI
venture and commercialization

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:25.615
process.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.650
And out of that, we've
created about 70 companies.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.130
And out of those
70 companies, four

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.980
have IPO'd, many
had been acquired,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.710
the total market value
is about $25 billion.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.792
I brought back to SRI
about $350 million.

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:50.870
One of the important things
about that, by the way, is it

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.040
wasn't just ventures.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.170
It's ventures and
royalty and equity,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.170
and that has brought
in an ongoing stream

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.740
of revenue every year, somewhere
between $10 and $40 million

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.080
on average per year.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.930
SRI is founded by Stanford.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.400
It also, RCA Labs, where I
came from, was acquired by SRI.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.290
GE actually donated a billion
dollar donation of RCA Labs

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.040
to SRI when GE
bought RCA and didn't

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.460
know what to do with
consumer electronics.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.900
That's what happened,
and Jack Welch was there.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.790
I was on the merger
team that was

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.230
like having arrived on Ellis
Island and being turned back,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.720
but it was the best thing
that happened to us.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.530
2,400 staff members at
SRI, consolidated revenue's

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.530
about $500 million.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.840
They're all over the place,
and SRI's now independent.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.820
It became independent around
1970 during the student riots--

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.950
not riots, protests.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.570
And so Stanford said let's
make them independent,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.820
and that was a great effect.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.120
This is the bragging chart
that I want to get past

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.070
this as quickly as possible.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.920
But SRI has a long history,
and not just an old history,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.600
of succeeding in
commercialization.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.040
Actually, the first mouse--
let me try this little thing

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.710
that I bought-- the first
mouse from Doug Engelbart

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.260
was invented and
patented at SRI.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.610
After that, it went
to Xerox PARC, where

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.060
they did a lot of
the application

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.039
development, and after that, to
Apple, obviously, and others.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.740
This is the napkin on which
the internet was designed.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.200
That's the complete
internet at the time.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.740
SRI is in red, receiving
bits from UCLA.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.990
The first login
was "log" and then

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.950
it dropped before
"in" could come out.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.540
We do everything which is really
exciting-- malaria, drugs,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.770
new types of neurological and
cancer drugs, Academy Awards,

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.270
Emmys.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.150
I was on the one related
to HDTV-- on the team,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.210
I should say.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.670
Those little numbers
on your check we did.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.810
Siri was most recently in
2010 one of our startups

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.700
that got acquired.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.040
So it's consistent.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.000
We're building blocks.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.880
This is just a list
of the companies

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.750
that we've helped
create, and you

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.020
have that kind of
average impact that you

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.920
expect from venture capital.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.120
Actually, better
performance than you

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.770
might expect from a normal
venture capital firm--

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.050
somewhere about between 1 in
10 and 1 in 20 of our startups

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.020
are home runs.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.270
Namely, they create 10
to 100 times their value.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.820
To us, many times the startups
are singles and doubles,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.970
meaning they returned their
value back or a little more.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.280
And we've actually never
had a true bankruptcy

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.120
where everybody lost everything,
so it's been quite a ride.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.020
And what's really interesting
is unlike other venture models,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.880
we create only three or
four ventures a year.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.890
Like 1,500 projects,
$500 million going

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.110
in-- three or four ventures.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.070
But the reason for
that is because

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.630
of why I wrote this book.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.940
We only focused on
creating ventures

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.460
that could be home runs,
billion-dollar companies,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.410
breakthrough companies
that could really

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.370
make a difference in the world.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.020
And similarly, Henry at
Warburg Pincus did the same.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.020
Henry's a great researcher
and he and I together

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.080
were at RCA Labs before
we came out here,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.530
before he came to the venture
community and I came out here.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.250
As you can see
materials, biomed,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.335
all of those technologies.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.390
If you had to say the
moral to the story

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:03.240
here about creating breakthrough
companies, it's really here.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.690
If you have achieved
and if you want

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.940
to accomplish great things,
great aim, you fix your gaze

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.090
and it sometimes
seems impossible,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.500
and you stay consistent.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.130
This is why I have difficulty
with the fail fast, fail

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.810
often, pivot often model, and
we'll draw a picture later

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.880
if we have questions.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.420
But over time when you're
creating a venture, what

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.970
do you iterate on?

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.280
What do you iterate on?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.090
In the venture capital world--
sorry, what do you iterate on

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.750
and what you don't iterate on
is your core value proposition.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.520
You rarely iterate on your team.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.980
You rarely iterate and
change on whether you're

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.870
a consumer or an enterprise
play after you've been funded.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.280
Before you're funded,
anything goes.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.680
Before you take
external money, you

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.210
can iterate, decide on
your own venture concept

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.170
and really make it work, and
I'll show you how that works.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.490
In terms of the technology
that we helped create companies

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:12.190
from, it really comes
from the Bayh-Dole Act.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.070
Does anybody know Bayh-Dole?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.810
Raise your hands if you know it.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.530
So in the US back in 1980,
Birch Bayh and Bob Dole

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:27.680
passed a law that said if you
do projects for the government

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.930
and you're a
nonprofit institution,

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.289
such as a university
or a lab, then

00:12:33.289 --> 00:12:35.330
you can own all the
commercial rights of anything

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.680
you do, any breakthroughs
you achieve.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.530
That is an incredible
war chest of technology

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.650
that comes to Stanford,
Berkeley, SRI, all of these.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.780
That is the basis of it.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.680
And the crime of it is we
do breakthrough technology--

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.560
our number one customer was
DARPA-- we do breakthrough

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.770
technology and then it
may just sit on the shelf

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.590
and the real iteration
doesn't occur,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.070
doesn't drive up
the value curve,

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.290
and instead we just go to
the next great invention.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:10.330
So the Bayh-Dole Act is there.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.800
We can own the
commercial rights.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.620
That gives you the incentive
to do commercial success.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.570
And by the way, at
SRI, we gave a third

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.880
of what we got
back to employees.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.340
That's one reason SRI
wasn't hollowed out

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.330
by the nearby companies
that could easily

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.400
recruit all their staff,
because they could have

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.450
a portfolio of
stock or of royalty

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.550
and continue to stay at SRI.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.830
On creating value
propositions, does everybody

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.690
know what a value
proposition is?

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.490
Raise your hands.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.210
Believe me, you have to know
if you're starting a venture.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.960
There are four elements,
and in the book

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.946
it's repeated multiple times.

00:13:56.946 --> 00:13:58.570
If you want to start
a great a venture,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.810
there are four things you need.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.110
One is a great market
problem-- really

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.630
a pain point, unless
it's consumer.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.410
In consumer, it's a
different kind of pain point.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.060
In an enterprise, a pain
point for market problem

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.250
is customers or companies
have extreme pain,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.590
have some problem they want to
solve, and you can solve it.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.690
So market pain-- a disruptive
and differentiated solution,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.256
disruptive only because
these days if you only

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:30.970
have an incremental solution,
you're not going to win.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.700
Somebody else is going to
apply an incremental solution.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.410
And a great team and a
great value proposition.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.780
We're going to get into that.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.650
This is about
value propositions,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.440
and so this is actually
the SRI process.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.590
It's a mnemonic called NABC.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.810
It's actually not the
full-value proposition.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.980
The book lists that.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.400
I'll give it to you
in a minute on a page.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.700
But a full-value proposition's--
the beginning of a value

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.100
proposition, and these
arrows indicate iteration,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.460
starts with customer
and market needs.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.360
It's remarkable in
a technology space,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.850
people don't think
normally that way.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.030
When people have a
great technology,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.840
I've got a great new processing
or a great new bandwidth

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.670
or whatever-- that
kind of problem,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.479
they don't think naturally of
what market are they reaching,

00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:26.020
what customer are
they reaching, what

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.610
pain point are they solving.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.030
That is a crucial element.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.750
So basically everyone
that we worked with

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.580
had to start with and iterate
on a customer and market need,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.620
then look for the differentiated
and disruptive solutions--

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.470
well, business and technical.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.570
Then try to quantify
the benefits,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.790
and I'll tell you what we
did with Siri in that case,

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.960
and then always articulate the
competition and alternative

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.950
approaches.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.770
And then iterate again
and again and again.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.180
That's when you're creating
a company, when you really

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.000
have the concept, when you're
iterating on the concept.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.050
And so in some sense,
this is crucial to do

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.700
and actually
crucial to continue.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.510
But once the funding starts,
you have far less flexibility

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.250
because then you have
a lifetime established

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.810
by the amount of money
that you've been given

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.290
and a runway to get there
and a goal to get there,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.460
and that's why this is
so important to have

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.410
ahead of time.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.350
I'm not going to go
through the SRI process

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.300
for creating ventures, but
it's one more generally

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.940
that's open to any research
institution or lab that

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.700
wants to spin out companies--
starting with a concept,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.140
internally funding it,
using external venture

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.220
capital support.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.510
We have great friends in
the venture capital world.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.580
And then building a
venture or license.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.130
When I told you earlier we
only do three or four ventures

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.620
a year, we probably
do 20 or 30 or 40

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.470
licenses that don't meet the
strategy of breakthrough.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.030
So let's go to
the story of Siri.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.170
How many people
here think that Siri

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.220
started with we have great
natural language understanding,

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.579
we have great speech technology,
we started the original Nuance,

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.359
we knew what we were
doing, we had AI,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.339
so we need to figure out
what venture we could have?

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.110
How many think so?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.240
Good, very good.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.790
It wasn't.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.880
We knew that there were
certain opportunities that

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.614
were created that
were remarkable

00:17:40.614 --> 00:17:43.930
that we knew that
the mobile phone had,

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:50.520
and those opportunities had
more power than a supercomputer

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.910
10 years earlier.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.360
They were always on,
always connected,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.440
they had more storage and
bandwidth capabilities.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.120
And at the time, only
ringtones and SMS messages

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.020
were the dominant apps.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.710
We didn't know what
we wanted to do,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.850
but we knew that we
were on the leading

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.720
edge of most every
computing revolution at SRI.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.690
So what are we going to do?

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.690
Well, part of it
started by accident.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.290
CALO was started
by the government.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.830
DARPA-- DARPA, our
number one customer.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.220
CALO stands for Cognitive
Assistant that Learns

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.860
and Organizes.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.060
That meant an agent.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.790
They were happy.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.660
They liked agent technology,
agent meaning delegate

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.914
technology to some software.

00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:41.080
We didn't know what the
business was, the model was,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.660
or anything.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.190
But they started a program.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.290
We led it.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.380
SRI was the project.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.680
We had 23 subs from the
who's who of the AI world--

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.420
Stanford, Harvard, Carnegie
Mellon, MIT, Berkeley,

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.040
you name it.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.240
They're all there.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.090
SRI was the prime and we worked
on CALO, a five-year program,

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.510
the largest program in the
history of the US government

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.705
in artificial intelligence.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:15.310
The second inspiration was, and
this came from actually DARPA,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.264
was "MASH."

00:19:16.264 --> 00:19:17.430
How many people know "MASH"?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.290
Raise your hands, please.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.310
So do you remember in
"MASH," this guy here,

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.670
over here, Radar O'Reilly?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.910
So Radar always know
what the colonel

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.600
wanted before the colonel
knew what the colonel wanted.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.620
That was the thing about Radar.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.100
And so DARPA wanted to
create a Radar for you.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.000
What they really
wanted to do was

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:50.850
create an assistant
that would allow you

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.960
and give you insight
into your life

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.780
and support you in
your life, like Radar

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.890
did, to give you an assistant
with real-time knowledge.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.040
It was called
learning in the wild.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.120
Everybody know you could
do AI in large volumes

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.150
of massive data, but
learning in the wild

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.940
meant you had to
do it in real time

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.730
as the person was walking
along, doing their activities,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.620
and all.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.240
And that was what
that program was,

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.615
and that was a
great inspiration.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.360
So what I told you
earlier, there's

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.630
four things that it takes
to do a great venture.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.930
That's it.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.760
As you leave this
room, you can all

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.300
decide these are the
four things you need.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.810
Obviously, it's
hard to do each one,

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.590
and the book is
about how to do that.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:43.300
It's about the market need and
the opportunities, the team.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.520
Breakthrough for Siri started
and happened, actually,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.100
not because of CALO,
not because of DARPA,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.080
but because we finally
found a market pain point.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.820
We were seeking what's the
problem that we could really

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:02.000
solve with a "Radar
O'Reilly" kind of capability.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.960
What's the market
opportunity we could create?

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.430
And finally we
realized at the time--

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:15.320
this was 2007, June of 2007--
that mobile phones were

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.620
difficult to use to access
web services like OpenTable,

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.060
Yelp, hotels.com.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.120
They were all there building
their APIs for the customers

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.860
and they were losing 20% of
their customers for every click

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.280
that people had to do.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.270
People were not
used to clicking.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.390
They didn't know how
to do that, or at least

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.790
they didn't want to.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:43.610
And so what happened was that
we created the market problem,

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.110
finally.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.470
We understood that the problem,
the pain point of the market,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.466
was not clicking, to have
a zero-click solution,

00:21:53.466 --> 00:21:54.590
and that's what we created.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.510
That's why we created Siri.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.490
We wanted Siri to give
answers, not links.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.140
We didn't want people to have
to go and then link and click

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.110
on the next.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.240
We didn't want Siri
to be a search engine.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.530
We wanted it to be a do
engine, and that was the basis

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.160
for the value proposition.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:17.360
The business function,
the revenue model,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.490
was lead generation.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.690
If we could lead
you to OpenTable

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.080
or to any other,
hotels.com or whatever,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.770
they would pay us for that lead.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.680
So it was click per action, and
that was the business model.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.440
And together with that, we
created the basis for Siri.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.930
Now, I'm not going
to go through this.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.030
But in the book,
these are the 11 steps

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.080
that you really need to do to
create a venture-fundable value

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.660
proposition.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.050
They're beyond NABC,
obviously, but NABC is actually

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.950
the core elements of that.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.610
If you could do that,
if you can do your NABC,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.610
you can get started in
what the opportunity is.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.330
It's in the book.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:05.580
This page is almost
identically in the book.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:11.600
So then Siri all of
a sudden in 2010,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.200
April-- actually, we launched
the first product in February.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.860
How much time do we
have, by the way?

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.430
1:30.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.170
I'm going to be finished soon
so we can all go through it.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.630
In February, 2010, we
launched the company

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.170
and get this phone call.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.760
The CEO, Dag Kittlaus, of
Siri-- and I was on the board

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.020
as well as being a
co-founder-- the CEO gets

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.090
a phone call on his cellphone.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.299
"Hi, this is Steve."

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:40.340
And he says, "Steve who?"

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.423
And he says, "Steve Jobs."

00:23:41.423 --> 00:23:42.970
And he says, "Sure,"
and he hangs up.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.890
So then he comes back again.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.600
He calls again and he says hi,
no, really, this is Steve Jobs.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.255
And so Steve called
and talked to the CEO.

00:23:56.255 --> 00:23:58.390
He invited the
three founders that

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.200
were part of the
team-- I was not,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.370
I was still at SRI running
the ventures activity--

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.040
to his house.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.870
And from that point on, there
was a certain honeymoon period

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.580
between the founders
and him over a period

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.050
of two to four weeks
where the board originally

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.180
said do not discuss
any funding activities.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.550
But ultimately, we were invested
in by venture capitalists

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.310
and by a team that really want
to make a difference by having

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:35.210
their work go to tens or
hundreds of millions of people.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.710
And the venture
capitalists were offered

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:42.220
an opportunity that would
give them a very fine reward.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.160
We can't tell you what
that was because that's

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.810
part of the contract
agreement, that we would never

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.700
specify how much that amount
was, and that's what happened.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.200
I sent Steve a note
afterwards saying

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.980
you got a great company--
I was on the board--

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.030
and I hope that we can work
together in the future.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.730
In his classic way, he
sent me a note back,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.150
very short-- simply, we
won't disappoint you.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.400
Now, you all know that
truthfully Siri on occasion

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.725
was and seemed disappointing.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.770
Rarely a person came up to me
and said, I love Siri, period.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.630
It was always I like Siri,
but it's not recognizing me,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.465
or I ask it questions,
and so on and so on.

00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:30.960
And of course, you have
Google Now, as well.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.045
But it has made
great progress and it

00:25:33.045 --> 00:25:34.940
is being used by
hundreds of millions

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.972
of people around the
world and continues

00:25:36.972 --> 00:25:37.930
to be in every product.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.230
So that's all about
the story of Siri.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.580
That was chapter one.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.360
The rest of the
chapters are trying

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.130
to show you how to
build opportunities

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.310
from the great opportunities
that exist today.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.200
There are no greater
opportunities, in my opinion,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.330
than now.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.310
There's globalization,
demographics,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:06.200
the adversary between, in
particular, cybersecurity,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.410
the growing markets,
particularly in China,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.380
revolutionary technologies.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.050
They're all happening now.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.010
You guys are
probably all involved

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.780
in various pieces of this.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.160
This is why I'm
excited to talk to you.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.820
There's breakthroughs
in virtually every area

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.150
and advanced by technology.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.030
These, in particular--
microsatellites

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.030
that you folks have the
Loon project, but maybe

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.060
others in the CubeSats.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.900
They're going to be
circling the world

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.140
and basically creating
whole new infrastructure

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.920
for wireless carriers.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.880
Autonomous vehicles--
look at what

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.100
you've done, something
wonderful in terms

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.040
of creating the original
breakthroughs in that space.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.610
Health care devices I'm
particularly involved

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:56.270
in right now.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:01.200
And when I left SRI, I
began advising as a venture

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.590
adviser a few startups.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.100
And in health care
devices, given the fact

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.180
that you can sequence
genomes, and not only

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.010
your own but the
genomes of the bacteria

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.670
or viruses or the tumors, we're
in for a huge breakthrough

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.820
in the ability for people
to improve their health

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.660
and wellness.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.900
I was really excited
by this because we

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.850
helped make this device.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.520
A woman in the Boston
Marathon lost her leg.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.360
She was a dancer.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.940
And 18 months later,
Hugh Herr from MIT,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.960
who also has lost his legs--
he is an MIT professor--

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.395
showed what could be done in the
whole new world of prosthetics.

00:27:49.395 --> 00:27:51.820
This is just an example,
the tiny example

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.430
of what could be done with
robotics and personalized

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.530
robotics.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:05.020
And 18 months later,
this TED-- I'm

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:10.682
going to do a cut
of that TED talk.

00:28:10.682 --> 00:28:11.614
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:11.614 --> 00:28:12.394
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:12.394 --> 00:28:14.060
NORMAN WINARSKY: Look
at how beautifully

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.660
that leg and the
actuators, which

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:24.170
are driven by her own
muscles, have enabled her

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.280
to use her legs again to dance.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.910
This was her first time
that she was dancing.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.350
This kind of robotic
system helping people,

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:39.810
assisting people, is
now within two years.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.070
You've just seen the DARPA
Robotics Challenge recently,

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.660
where robots are walking
and preforming activities.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:56.050
We are also building at
SRI exoskeletons without--

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.050
[CHEERING]

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.529
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.570
NORMAN WINARSKY: We're
also building exoskeletons

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:13.070
without the exoskeleton,
so using human bones

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.110
as the skeleton.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.630
And we're doing exo-muscles
for people to wear outfits.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.300
This is the world you're in.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.140
Another part of the book
is about the investors,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.400
how the great investors
act and what they look for.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.740
Of course, I hear so many
times venture capitalists,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.575
vulture capitals, whatever,
and then what kind of deal

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:37.940
are they offering.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.760
This book is about the kind
of deal they really offer.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.900
It's not about the
money, and it's not even

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.550
about the equity terms.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.150
It's about what kind
of value they offer you

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.580
in their networks of friends,
their wisdom and their guidance

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.590
in creating and running
the venture, their ability

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.730
to help you recruit, and so on.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.890
This is what you use, and
this is what's described.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.580
I'm going to tell you
one thing about talking

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.450
to great investors.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.500
If you have a great
venture concept,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.130
there's only three things that--
and these are some of them--

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.420
this is Mike Moritz, Vinod
Khosla, Kevin Efrusy at Accel,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.950
Steve Jurvetson,
Gary Morgenthaler.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.860
These are these are all greats.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.650
There are three
things they're always

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.150
looking for in
your first venture,

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.386
your first presentation to them.

00:30:29.386 --> 00:30:30.760
So don't forget
the three things.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.520
That's in the book, but
I'm not telling you.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.020
No, I will.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.410
I will.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.760
The three things
are one, you have

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.340
to show them you have a
deeply compelling value

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.535
proposition-- deeply
compelling-- I'm

00:30:48.535 --> 00:30:50.410
talking about the greats
now-- something that

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.310
really is a change the
world value proposition.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.160
Secondly, you have to show them
that you're committed to it.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.630
This is another issue that
I have with the fail fast,

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:00.860
fail often.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.880
You have to show you
have passion for the idea

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.580
and you've wanted it, you've
lived it, you want it to happen

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.670
and you're going to do
anything 24 hours a day,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.770
seven days a week.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.050
You're going to be there
to make that happen.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.255
That's what they
want to see from you.

00:31:16.255 --> 00:31:18.630
And the third thing they're
going to want to see from you

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:20.930
is that you can execute.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.020
You're not there
in pie in the sky.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.150
You're there and
you're telling them

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.760
I'm going to be able to
go to the first step.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.730
The analogy that
Vinod Khosla uses

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.430
when you're climbing
Mount Everest-- I'm

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.700
going to get to a base camp.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.190
I'm going to get there.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.690
I'm going to have
this much money.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.148
I'm going to have this team,
and I'm going to keep it clean

00:31:41.148 --> 00:31:42.750
and I'm going to
keep it aggressive.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.350
Those kind of things
are in the three things

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.690
that you need to achieve.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.310
There's also five meetings
that are listed in the book.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.640
That's the first meeting.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.030
You achieve that.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.980
In my principle, Woody Allen
says 80% of life is showing up.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.990
If you achieve that--
the Norman Winarsky

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.050
principle is 20% of life
is knowing when to leave.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:07.410
So you got to go and you've
achieved what you did.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.570
Teams and execution--
it's obvious, again.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.660
We talk about how to
build teams and when

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.810
to build teams and the
ego related to teams.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.530
Teams-- you could be a
founder, you could be a CEO.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.010
You don't need to be both.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.850
You want to bring a team
in and keep your money

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.860
as lean as possible and so on.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:36.320
This is how to execute
a breakthrough venture,

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.930
and it's all in the book--
choosing the CEO, the founders,

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.440
choosing the right investors,
and maintaining the value

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.170
proposition.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.380
The mistakes that I've
seen and Henry's seen over

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.090
these dozens of companies--
some are not avoidable,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.030
like the world
changes, the government

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.160
changes the standard, whatever.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.710
But some of them are avoidable,
and these are the five

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.020
we described in the book.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.810
So fail to know your customer--
I started a company that I

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.520
thought was the best possible
company you could imagine.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.470
In terms of communications,
it was going

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.820
to do mobile ad hoc networking.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.670
Firefighters and
people like that

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.450
were going to be able to use
it with the internet running up

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.050
the stairs with them
instead of leaving them

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.605
without communications,
as what happened in 9/11.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.340
That company failed
because the CEO really

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.840
wasn't deeply knowledgeable.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.160
It was a great idea, but the
CEO nor the VP of marketing

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.210
were deeply knowledgeable
about that community

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.740
of the firefighters and
the emergency responders,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.370
and so the book describes
how that failed.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.610
Keep the wrong CEO-- this is a
challenge in business schools

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.120
all over the world.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.570
People still think is it
the horse or the rider?

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:58.630
What happens if you
have a great CEO?

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.914
Which is more important, a
great CEO or a great company?

00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:03.830
I'm going to leave it
to you to read the book,

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.920
but I'll tell you
we come out on CEO,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.699
and many of the business
schools in LA come out on it's

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:12.389
the great company.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.520
Mismanaged finances--
that means there's

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.409
obvious ways you can do that.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:23.780
You hire too much, you have
too much engineering services,

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.540
too many human labor
components, and so on.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.760
Becoming overconfident
is a remarkable failure.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.699
It's when you become
blind to your competitors.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.219
You're doing so well
that you're just not

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.300
even open to
considering competitors.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.880
You might think of Nokia
in that space, for example.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.750
And fail to anticipate future
industry developments--

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.480
a lot of that is in
the book, as well.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.800
So I want to keep going
on because we're near done

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.980
and I want you to ask questions.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.120
Finally, this book is
about how to maintain

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.210
an ambidextrous organization.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.700
That's a word that's
actually not in the book,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.580
but it's the word
that Stanford uses.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.570
It's an organization that's both
good at building and continuing

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:13.300
their existing products and
services, as well as innovating

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.719
and create breakthrough
products and services.

00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:17.260
That's the left
hand, the right hand.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.810
That's the ambidextrous.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.960
Turns out that the
average lifespan

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.960
of a company at the turn of
the century, around there,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.355
was 67 years-- a
company in the Standard

00:35:29.355 --> 00:35:33.205
&amp; Poor 500, the top 500
companies in the United States.

00:35:33.205 --> 00:35:35.330
What do you think the
average lifespan of a company

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.260
is around now?

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.070
Guess, please.

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:43.370
AUDIENCE: 14 years.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.260
NORMAN WINARSKY: 14 years.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.840
So if you're in the top 500
companies in the United States,

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.480
you're in danger.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.590
You're going to be broken up
or bought, one way or another.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.330
Look at Kodak, Polaroid,
or Oracle, Sun.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.470
You can just keep
going on and on.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.700
So the book ends
with an approach

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.300
to ensuring the future, how
we went about it, what we've

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.160
done to do that, and what
it takes to create centers

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.800
of innovation.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.630
You have Google X here,
which I think is actually

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.210
a great model for continuing.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.160
I don't know the inner
details about how you do it

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.490
because there has to be a lot
about financial independence,

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.750
it has to be
top-level CEO support,

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:33.180
it has to be new metrics
and new measurements that

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.700
are not related to the
revenue that so dwarfs it

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.960
in the beginning.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.540
And so there has to be a whole
lot to creating and building

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.460
a company and maintaining
it in the 21st century.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.744
So thank you so much.

00:36:49.744 --> 00:36:52.696
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.220
Any questions?

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.630
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have
a quick question.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.020
Let's say I have a
breakthrough idea.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.960
At which point,
like at what stage,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.350
does it make sense to engage
venture capitalists like SRI?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.850
Like what's the MVP [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.130
NORMAN WINARSKY: So if you
have a breakthrough idea, what

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.850
they're going to look
for-- and by the way,

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.930
that's where your
iteration occurs.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.210
Do I have the right market?

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.300
I have my market.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.350
Well, no, it's too
broad a market.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:25.770
Do I have the right solution?

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.920
No, the technology solution
only works for a narrower space,

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.190
or whatever.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.510
And then finally,
do I have a team?

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.390
A venture capitalist
will not normally

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.590
consider strongly
something which

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.780
is called heavy
lifting, where they

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.940
have to go help recruit the
CEO, where they have to help

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.900
go recruit the key people.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.200
So there needs to
be a core team.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.400
They don't have to be
working for the company,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.860
but they have to
have come together

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.050
and said we're going
to be founder, CEO.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.570
This is where the technology
is going to come from.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.900
Here is our value
proposition, and here

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.100
is the beginnings of the
value proposition, at least.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.170
Here's the competition.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.080
Here's all these elements.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.810
Here's the risks.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.880
And then you go
in front of them.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.790
Now, these days, you can
also go in front of angels,

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:20.000
as wealthy individuals,
instead of venture capitalists.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.920
You could start
with wealthy angels.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.330
The truth is I would still go
to great venture capitalists

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.050
because they'll watch
you, they'll track you,

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.290
they'll see how you're doing.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.670
Sometimes they'll fund you.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:34.080
Somebody like a Vinod Khosla
likes to come in very early.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.820
He can either do seed
or A. Mike Moritz

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.640
believes in people like you.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:44.105
He believes in people that
have breakthrough ideas who

00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:49.647
are energized and passionate
and it's their idea

00:38:49.647 --> 00:38:50.980
and they want to make it happen.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.280
So get the four elements
of your company in mind--

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.210
your team, core team-- you only
need three or four people who

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.130
are going to come together--
your market problem and value

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:07.710
proposition, your
differentiated technology,

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.610
and you better understand
your competition,

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.790
and the goal is to
get to an A round.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.468
Yeah?

00:39:12.468 --> 00:39:16.840
AUDIENCE: So you
don't need to have

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.960
an established running business?

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960
NORMAN WINARSKY: Oh, no.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.914
AUDIENCE: Like people
can just still,

00:39:21.914 --> 00:39:23.330
let's say, have
their [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.163
NORMAN WINARSKY: No.

00:39:24.163 --> 00:39:27.310
That's a huge mistake
people make, by the way,

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.560
against their own selves.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:36.610
When we started Siri, there
wasn't a running product.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.900
The purpose of a venture
capitalist or any other funder

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.980
is to build the commercial
product and to help it scale.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.400
If you tried building the
product on your own beforehand,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.440
first of all, you won't succeed
very well because it'll usually

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.060
have too little money.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.910
And secondly, you won't
have done it fast enough

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.160
or had sufficient resources.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.200
So definitely they
will love the fact

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.840
that you're going
to build the product

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.590
or service with their money.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.880
You need, and that was item
number 11 in that deck,

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.710
but you'll never get venture
funding-- I should never say

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.470
never, that's a terrible thing.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.642
You'll never get--
no, I did it again.

00:40:15.642 --> 00:40:16.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:23.460
You're unlikely to get venture
funding with a PowerPoint

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.710
alone.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.000
That world's over,
as far as I know,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.550
unless you're a superstar.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:32.470
You need a PowerPoint,
a team, and you

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:36.730
need a demo or a proof
of concept of some form,

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.214
but not the whole product.

00:40:38.214 --> 00:40:38.880
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.897
Thanks for coming.

00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:42.230
So just as a context I'm not
very well read in the area.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.350
I'm just a little bit
curious and stuff.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.979
But from the little
I read when you

00:40:45.979 --> 00:40:48.020
talk about the dimensions
is the time [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.580
the team, the business
plan, and the idea.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.330
So one of the articles
I read kind of

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.704
emphasizes a more underlooked,
I think, concept of timing.

00:40:55.704 --> 00:40:57.870
So I want to see if you can
comment about the things

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.710
that you have seen
succeed or fail

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.080
because my perspective
is we want to believe

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.027
that a lot depends on
us, how good we are,

00:41:04.027 --> 00:41:04.860
how much experience.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.880
But maybe the reality is a
lot like what's the timing

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.140
and do we get some element
of [INAUDIBLE] there?

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.230
NORMAN WINARSKY: Thank
you for that question.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:19.120
First of all, it's just as bad
to be too early or to late.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.470
And just like the stock market,
you can't time too well.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:26.250
So what you have to do
is feel-- it depends

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.560
on what your problem is.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.270
Is the market problem
painful enough?

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.050
That's one thing
I always look for.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.270
Is the market problem
so painful-- in the case

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.250
of medical, it's obvious.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.666
Something like a disease,
like cancer or something,

00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:43.060
you can literally
quantify it very easily.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.340
Is the market problem so painful
that it's not going to go away?

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.460
So that helps you
with the timing.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.380
The second is your solution.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.390
Is your technology solution
mature or are you really

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.820
asking to do more research?

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.690
I do not support more
technology research.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.310
In each of these programs
that we've built,

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.980
there have been
hundreds of millions,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.480
if not billions of dollars, by
the government funding-- that's

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.830
why I said it was so important--
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:15.800
towards building the technology.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.050
Do not ask a venture
capitalist to come and help

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.850
you build more technology.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.530
That's not going to happen.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.700
Go get your next government
contract or commercial contract

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.990
or whatever.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.830
And so that part
of timing is make

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.890
sure your technology, if
it's technology, is mature.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.430
Or if it's a
business model, make

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.030
sure the business model is
implementable, and make sure

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.180
there's a base camp.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.490
So the final thing about
timing is this idea

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.330
of Mount Everest and base camp.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.580
Did anybody read
the note on this?

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.340
I'll explain it briefly.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.040
I'll explain it.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.020
It is true that
you shouldn't try

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.040
to climb Mount
Everest all at once

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.520
and somehow scale what you're
trying to achieve all at once.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.980
Nobody would believe you.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.430
It's like boiling the ocean.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.880
It's really Geoffrey
Moore "Crossing the Chasm"

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.700
kind of thing.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.970
You need to start with something
that you think is achievable.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.170
And every time you do a
round, and this book describes

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.300
the rounds-- the A round,
the B round, the C Round,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.670
and so forth-- every
time you do a round,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.300
it's not for the money.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.090
You're doing a round to
get the next achievement.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:24.460
What you wanted to
achieve with-- you're

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.140
going to first get the product.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.770
That'll probably be
round A, and build

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:35.250
revenue might be round B. Build
profitability might be round C.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.870
Scale is round D, and so forth.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:39.800
Now, of course
those are different,

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.930
but that's how timing helps you.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.210
But yes, a venture capitalist--
each one of those rounds

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:48.300
should never be
more than 18 months.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.320
No venture capitalist
in general,

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.000
unless it's medical
devices or health care,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.770
would expect to have their
money last more than around 18

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.020
to 24 months.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.370
That's a good question.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.000
Other question?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.670
AUDIENCE: What suggestions do
you have for future-proofing

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.540
your vision, especially
if you're not

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.620
planning to go and fail
safe and fail fast?

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.840
NORMAN WINARSKY: Wait, say--

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.290
AUDIENCE: Future-proof your
vision, and I'll explain--

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:14.000
NORMAN WINARSKY: My vision?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.583
AUDIENCE: Yeah, or if you have
a venture and you have an idea,

00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:19.250
you see a market need and you
have a vision and technology

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.916
how to solve it.

00:44:19.916 --> 00:44:22.457
NORMAN WINARSKY: When you say
you, are you meaning you or me?

00:44:22.457 --> 00:44:26.700
AUDIENCE: I'm just
referring to like a person.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.170
And there can be, I
think, opportunity

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.745
to fail on both sides, right?

00:44:30.745 --> 00:44:31.661
NORMAN WINARSKY: Yeah.

00:44:31.661 --> 00:44:34.830
AUDIENCE: One, you may create
a solution which by the time

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.822
you actually implement
it may be not the best

00:44:36.822 --> 00:44:38.780
way to solve this problem,
even though it does.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.150
Or you may create a solution
where the market isn't ready,

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.930
and there have been
examples, I think-- well,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.500
we can take even
one of the examples

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.710
we did at Google in
Google X, Google Glass,

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.190
where we went and learned a
lot, but we realized maybe

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.500
it wasn't the right solution.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.110
NORMAN WINARSKY: Right, right.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.651
AUDIENCE: So without
going and trying

00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:58.910
to learn as much as possible
and fail, how do you actually

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.900
protect yourself from working
too long on the solution which

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.020
may not be the right one?

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.520
NORMAN WINARSKY:
So a couple things.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.170
One is a venture
capitalist-- again,

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.930
the good ones-- would
not have allowed

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:15.380
a long period of time for the
first proof points to be there.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.500
So you would have had to
form early proof points.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.554
And maybe the early
proof points would

00:45:21.554 --> 00:45:23.220
have been where you
are right now, which

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.570
is, I think, quite a wonderful
application at Google

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.840
Glass with doctors using
it, people like that.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.650
That might have been an early
proof point, as people started

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:35.830
using it and experiencing it.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.530
Other ways that you can--
you're getting into timing,

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.200
in other words.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.320
You're saying how do we know
when there's an opportunity

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.350
and how long should
we work on it, right?

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:51.610
Everything has to be
broken up into milestones

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.020
within 18-month chunks.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.940
And as you're moving
along, if you're not

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.720
achieving those
milestones, you're

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.210
going to start
finding difficulty

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.917
to continue the funding.

00:46:01.917 --> 00:46:03.750
AUDIENCE: So one of the
things you emphasize

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.360
was finding the right team.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.610
NORMAN WINARSKY: Yes.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.630
AUDIENCE: Bringing the
right team to the venture.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:07.930
NORMAN WINARSKY: Yeah.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.900
AUDIENCE: I know a lot of us
probably have a great idea,

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.230
but lack the help to get
that idea off the ground.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.870
NORMAN WINARSKY: Right.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.380
AUDIENCE: So what do you
do in that kind of case?

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.171
What do you suggest
for somebody like that?

00:46:17.171 --> 00:46:20.250
NORMAN WINARSKY: So Let me
tell you how we did that,

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:24.050
and we had that problem
every single time.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.780
When you're in a research lab
like SRI with 2,400 people,

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.656
most of the people
are researchers.

00:46:29.656 --> 00:46:30.780
That's sort of a tautology.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.170
And so how do you get the team?

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.750
What we did is
the first thing we

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.840
did was build the
value proposition, just

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.190
like we talked about.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.110
You can do that with
your internal team

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.190
as well as you can.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:50.880
You're really not a domain
expert usually in the market.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.800
You're not an executive
yet, but you do that.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.040
Once you have that, you use
your own network or venture

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.340
capitalists will help you.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340
They're not funding you.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.030
They'll just give you insight.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.500
You start looking for
the CEO of your dreams

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.200
or the VP of product or the
VP of marketing or the like.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.950
Don't bring them on.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:13.860
You don't need to.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.070
Just get the gang together.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:17.710
We're going to save
the orphanage now,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.300
"The Blues Brothers."

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.850
So get the gang together
and then iterate

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.660
again on the value proposition
till you get something solid.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.300
Then you have the team, you
have the value proposition.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.010
You still have the problem
with intellectual property

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.180
if it's a technology company.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.950
If it's a business company,
it's a little different.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.150
And so if it's
intellectual property,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.330
you'll probably want to
know who has the patents

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.600
or who can do what,
or can you get it

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.610
from Stanford or whatever.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.880
And so that's really
how you do it.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.864
You can build.

00:47:51.864 --> 00:47:53.780
If you've got somebody
that's both the founder

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.460
and a CEO like Larry and Sergey
kind of people, god bless,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.400
go ahead.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.320
But if you don't, that doesn't
mean you can't start this.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.000
You absolutely can because
those kind of people

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.930
are looking for these
kind of opportunities.
