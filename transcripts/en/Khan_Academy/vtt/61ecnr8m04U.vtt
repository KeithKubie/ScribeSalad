00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.265
In the last video we
looked at a function

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:04.064
and tried to draw
its derivative.

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:06.230
Now in this video, we're
going to look at a function

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.776
and try to draw
its antiderivative.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.640
Which sounds like
a very fancy word,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.200
but it's just saying the
antiderivative of a function

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.080
is a function whose
derivative is that function.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.740
So for example,
if we have f of x,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:33.570
and let's say that the
antiderivative of f of x

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.874
is capital F of x.

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:37.790
And this tends to be the
notation, when you're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.730
talking about an antiderivative.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.750
This just means
that the derivative

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.780
of capital F of x, which is
equal to, you could say capital

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.550
f prime of x, is
equal to f of x.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.307
So we're going to try to do
here is, we have our f of x.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.140
And we're going to try
to think about what's

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.999
a possible function that this
could be the derivative of?

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.040
And you're going to study
this in much more depth

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.900
when you start looking
at integral calculus.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.550
But there's actually
many possible functions

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.160
that this could be
the derivative of.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.590
And our goal in
this video is just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.980
to draw a reasonable
possibility.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.820
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.790
So let's, over here
on the top, draw

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.374
y is equal to capital F of x.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.790
So what we're going
to try to draw

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.130
is a function where
its derivative

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.210
could look like this.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.080
So what we're
essentially doing is,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.120
when we go from what we're
draw up here to this,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.320
we're taking the derivative.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.872
So let's think about what
this function could look like.

00:01:37.872 --> 00:01:39.330
So when we look at
this derivative,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.170
it says over this interval
over this first interval right

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.680
over here, let me
do this in purple,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.880
it says over this
interval from x

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.340
is equal to 0 all the way
to whatever value of x,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.940
this right over here, it
says that the slope is

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.680
a constant positive 1.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.710
So let me draw a line with a
slope of a constant positive 1.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.610
And I could shift
that line up and down.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.600
Once again, there's many
possible antiderivatives.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.289
I will just pick
a reasonable one.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.975
So I could have a line that
looks something like this.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.610
I want to draw a slope of
positive 1 as best as I can.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.980
So let's say it looks
something like this.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640
And I could make the function
defined here or undefined here.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.120
The derivative is
undefined at this point.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.160
I could make the function
defined or undefined

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.180
as I see fit.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.819
This will probably be a
point of discontinuity

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.860
on the original function.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.320
It doesn't have to
be, but I'm just

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.070
trying to draw a
possible function.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.810
So let's actually
just say it actually

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.600
is defined at that
point right over there.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.460
But since this is going
to be discontinuous,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.110
the derivative is going to
be undefined at that point.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.330
So that's that first interval.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.970
Now let's look at
the second interval.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.410
The second interval, from where
that first interval ended,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.760
all the way to right over here.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.384
The derivative is a
constant negative 2.

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:04.800
So that means over
here, I'm going

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.170
to have a line of
constant negative slope,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.350
or constant negative 2 slope.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.580
So it's going to be twice
as steep as this one right

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.550
over here.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.200
So I actually
could just draw it.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.930
I could make it a
continuous function,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.292
I could just make a negative
2 slope, just like this.

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:23.500
And it looks like this
interval is about half as long

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.210
as this interval.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.918
So it maybe gets to
the exact same point.

00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:29.230
So it could look
something-- let me

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.585
draw it a little bit
neater-- like this.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.560
The slope right over
here is equal to 1,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.720
we see that right over
there in the derivative.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.440
And then the slope right over
here is equal to negative 2.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.010
We see that in the derivative.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.440
Now things get interesting.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.310
Once again, I could have shifted
this blue line up and down.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.890
I did not have to construct a
continuous function like this.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.140
But I'm doing it just for fun.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.440
There's many possible
antiderivatives

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.160
of this function.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.120
Now what's going on
over the next interval?

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.700
And I'll do it do it in orange.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.380
The slope starts off
at a very high value.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.590
It starts off at positive 2.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.190
Then it keeps decreasing, and
it gets to 0, right over here.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.590
The slope gets to
0 right over there.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.450
And then it starts becoming
more and more and more

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.740
and more negative.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.140
So I'll just try to make this
a continuous function, just

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.639
for fun.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.380
Once again, it does
not have to be.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.360
So over here the slope
is very positive.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.280
It's a positive 2.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.140
So our slope is going to be
like, this is negative 2,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.290
so it's going to
be a positive 2.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.510
And then it gets more and more
and more negative up to this,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.260
or, it becomes less and less
and less positive I should say.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.290
Even here the slope is positive.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.930
And it gets to 0
right over there.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.460
So maybe it gets to 0
maybe right over here.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.970
And so what we have, we could
have some type of a parabola.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.570
So the downward facing parabola.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.930
So notice, the slope is
a very positive value.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.790
It's a positive 2
right over here,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.890
then it becomes less and less
and less and less positive,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.920
all the way to 0
right over there.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.845
And then the slope
starts turning negative.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.500
And so our function
could look something

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.830
like that over the interval.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.410
Let me draw it a
little bit neater.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.160
This is symmetric.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.860
How ever positive
our slope was here,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.180
it's equally negative here.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.020
So our curve should probably
be symmetric as well.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.390
So let me draw it like
this over that interval.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.120
It could look like that.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.280
And then finally, over
this last interval,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.920
or I guess we could say, it
keeps going, our slope is 0.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.440
And once again I don't have
to draw a continuous function.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.210
But when the slope
is 0, that just

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.550
means that I have a
line with slope 0.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.620
I have a horizontal line.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.740
And I could draw that horizontal
line up here, in which case

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.740
I'd have to say
its discontinuous.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.560
Or I could draw that horizontal
line right over here,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.460
and try to make
my antiderivative

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.420
a continuous function.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.420
So once again, I could have
shifted any of these segments

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.920
up or down, and gotten
the exact same derivative.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.170
But then I would not have
gotten a continuous function

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.210
like this.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.410
But we have been
able to construct

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.370
a possible antiderivative
for f of x.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.250
And just as a reminder, that's
just saying this f of x is--

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.020
the antiderivative is
a function that f of x

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.230
could be the derivative of.
