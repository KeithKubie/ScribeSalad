00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.830
Sharks are going to starve to death!

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.600
And it’s all our fault!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.240
Sorry, pal.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.440
Hey everyone, I’m Chastity, the Associate
Producer for DNews.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.009
Say what you want about climate change, but
the fact still remains that levels of carbon

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.770
dioxide are rising fast in our atmosphere.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.570
And its causing major concerns for marine
life.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.079
As the oceans absorb more CO2 from the air,
the waters become more acidic.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.300
The latest report on greenhouse gases from
the World Meteorological Organization shows

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.950
carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rose
at an alarming rate last year, shattering

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.460
previous records.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.250
And for the first time, the annual report
on greenhouse gases included figures on ocean

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.250
acidification.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.600
The WMO says the rate of acidification is
now “unprecedented, at least over the past

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.220
300,000 years.”

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.360
If ocean acidification continues at its current
pace, a new study published in Global Change

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.070
Biology says that sharks could lose their
ability to sense the smell of food.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.710
For the study, researchers from Georgia Tech
tested the odor-tracking behaviors of the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.860
smooth dogfish, a shark native to the Atlantic
Ocean off the eastern United States.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.039
They placed the dogfish in swimming pools
treated with carbon dioxide.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.619
The CO2 concentrations tested matched the
projected climate forecasts for midcentury

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.580
and the year 2100.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.729
Researchers found that the adult sharks significantly
avoided squid odor after swimming in the CO2

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.729
treated pools.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.749
The sharks’ tracking and attacking behavior
were significantly reduced.

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.210
Sharks use other senses, like hearing, to
track prey, but none is more important than

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.530
chemical sensing.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.579
Lead author of the study, Danielle Dixson,
says "Sharks are like swimming noses, so chemical

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.090
cues are really important for them in terms
of finding food."

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.340
In the past, sharks have adapted to ocean
acidification conditions projected for later

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.340
time periods.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.030
But they’ve never had to adapt as quickly
as they do today.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.189
Dixson says “It’s the rate of change that’s
happening that’s concerning.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.939
Sharks have never had to deal with it this
fast.”

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.459
Previous research by Dixson and her team has
shown that fishes’ sensory systems are also

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.119
seriously affected by future CO2 concentrations
in the ocean.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.399
Reef fish were less able to detect predator
odor when tested in water treated with projected

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.319
future CO2 concentrations.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.740
The only problem with the research is that
it’s all laboratory based, so it doesn’t

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.630
fully represent the potential effects of future
ocean acidification.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.110
Regardless, the rising CO2 concentrations
in our oceans is still a major problem for

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.190
future marine life.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.060
