type of cancer treatment is very

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.190
type of cancer treatment is very
 

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.830
type of cancer treatment is very
interesting because it works in a

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:31.840
interesting because it works in a
 

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.800
interesting because it works in a
completely new fashion all previous

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:34.810
completely new fashion all previous
 

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.930
completely new fashion all previous
cancer treatments were essentially

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:36.940
cancer treatments were essentially
 

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.840
cancer treatments were essentially
directed against the tumor cell but this

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:39.850
directed against the tumor cell but this
 

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.030
directed against the tumor cell but this
particular treatment is directed against

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040
particular treatment is directed against
 

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.730
particular treatment is directed against
the immune system and one interesting

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:44.740
the immune system and one interesting
 

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.070
the immune system and one interesting
aspect is that it works on many

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.080
aspect is that it works on many
 

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.320
aspect is that it works on many
different types of tumors not only on

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:49.330
different types of tumors not only on
 

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.870
different types of tumors not only on
one particular tumor but on many

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880
one particular tumor but on many
 

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:58.500
one particular tumor but on many
different types here we have one custom

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:58.510
different types here we have one custom
 

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.180
different types here we have one custom

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:10.810
narrow down the point to check for the
 

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.850
narrow down the point to check for the
cancer treatment or how better is it is

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:14.860
cancer treatment or how better is it is
 

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.830
cancer treatment or how better is it is
than the previous ones

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840
than the previous ones
 

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.970

thank you

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:23.980
 
 

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.640
 
the effects of these checkpoint

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:26.650
the effects of these checkpoint
 

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.520
the effects of these checkpoint
inhibitors are quite remarkable because

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:29.530
inhibitors are quite remarkable because
 

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.310
inhibitors are quite remarkable because
they really define a new concept where

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320
they really define a new concept where
 

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.620
they really define a new concept where
you release the brakes previous types of

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:34.630
you release the brakes previous types of
 

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.050
you release the brakes previous types of
immune therapy they were really trying

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.060
immune therapy they were really trying
 

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.090
immune therapy they were really trying
to make use of the immune system by

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:39.100
to make use of the immune system by
 

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.850
to make use of the immune system by
stimulating it and enhancing its

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:41.860
stimulating it and enhancing its
 

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.070
stimulating it and enhancing its
capacity but here in that concept you

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080
capacity but here in that concept you
 

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.870
capacity but here in that concept you
didn't release the brakes and for that

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880
didn't release the brakes and for that
 

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.720
didn't release the brakes and for that
reason those therapies were not as

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:51.730
reason those therapies were not as
 

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.090
reason those therapies were not as
successful as these therapies and the

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:54.100
successful as these therapies and the
 

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.790
successful as these therapies and the
fundamental thing also is that these

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:56.800
fundamental thing also is that these
 

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.090
fundamental thing also is that these
therapies as we are discussing today

they are apparently and very nicely

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:03.070
they are apparently and very nicely

until they have not been that fantastic

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.250
 
 

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:50.210
 
yeah what what about the side effects

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220
 
 

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.160
 
the side effects are there it's correct

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.170
the side effects are there it's correct
 

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.180
the side effects are there it's correct
but if you compare with other approved

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.190
but if you compare with other approved
 

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.360
but if you compare with other approved
drugs or therapies for cancer there by

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.370
drugs or therapies for cancer there by
 

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.470
drugs or therapies for cancer there by
all means always side effects and if I

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480
all means always side effects and if I
 

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.750
all means always side effects and if I
compare their momentary on with the new

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760

inhibitors the side effects are for

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.220
inhibitors the side effects are for
 

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.700
inhibitors the side effects are for
almost all patient manageable although

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:14.710
almost all patient manageable although
 

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.300
almost all patient manageable although
they are in a scale up to five they are

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:17.310
they are in a scale up to five they are
 

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.550
they are in a scale up to five they are
not rare with grade three to four side

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:20.560
not rare with grade three to four side
 

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.620
not rare with grade three to four side
effects but mostly of them they are

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:22.630
effects but mostly of them they are
 

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.500
effects but mostly of them they are
reversible and it's clearly so if you

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:25.510
reversible and it's clearly so if you
 

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.510
reversible and it's clearly so if you
look at the benefit namely the effect on

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520
look at the benefit namely the effect on
 

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.400
look at the benefit namely the effect on
the cancer and then your balance then

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:29.410
the cancer and then your balance then
 

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.250
the cancer and then your balance then
versus the risk there is no question

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:32.260
versus the risk there is no question
 

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.310
versus the risk there is no question
that there is a clearly positive benefit

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320
that there is a clearly positive benefit
 

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.450
that there is a clearly positive benefit

so what's what's the next future or

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480
so what's what's the next future or

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.810
 
yes I think what's most promising now we

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:13.820
yes I think what's most promising now we
 

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.240
yes I think what's most promising now we
have we have now a completely new tool

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.250
have we have now a completely new tool
 

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.910
have we have now a completely new tool
to add to the toolbox so it has sort of

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:18.920
to add to the toolbox so it has sort of
 

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.970
to add to the toolbox so it has sort of
revitalized the whole area so to find

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:21.980
revitalized the whole area so to find
 

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.620

individualized therapy will be a very

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:29.810
individualized therapy will be a very
 

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.690
individualized therapy will be a very
important process there are very many
