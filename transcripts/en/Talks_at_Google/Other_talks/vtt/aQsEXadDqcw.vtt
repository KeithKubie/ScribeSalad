GARRETT OLIVER: I
almost said, welcome--

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:05.910
as if I was bringing
you guys to the brewery.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.730
But I should say, thank
you for welcoming me.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.250
So I'm Garrett Oliver.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.710
I'm the brewmaster
of Brooklyn Brewery.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.736
Thank you.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.570
I know that I'm speaking here
as an American male, which

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.880
is, in and of itself,
a rarefied species.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
But I think brewmaster
has to be-- well,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.880
it's probably the
third coolest title

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.050
that can have in American
male life if you like.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.600
I mean there's quarterback,
and then theres' astronaut.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.120
But right behind
astronaut is brewmaster.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.780
They always say that
you know that you

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.460
have some kind of success
if you enjoy saying what

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000
you do when you go to parties.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.170
So I get to go to parties,
and I'm like, "Brewmaster."

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.030
You know, it's Ike
version of the force.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.690
It's kind of good.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560
I do remember one time I
went to a party, though,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.770
and the guy said,
"Hey, what you do?"

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.399
I'm like, "Brewmaster."

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.690
And I'm like, "What do you do?"

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.860
He's like, "Fighter pilot."

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.937
And I was like, "Oh."

00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:14.831
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.000
You know, like, your
Kung Fu is very powerful.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.970
That was the only time I
ever got a brush back pitch.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.040
So I do love it, and we get to
do an awful lot of cool stuff.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.900
And I'm grateful that I've
been doing this for 27 years,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.750
and I still get to
do it every day.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.730
Yesterday I was
actually out on a boat.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.280
The Seaport Museum--
and you guys

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.315
should know this--
the Seaport Museum run

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:48.760
a 130-year-old schooner
called "The Pionner."

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.416
And "The Pioneer" is a
full-rig sailing vessel.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:53.790
And we took it
out on the harbor.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.500
And the day started hot, but
it got really, really nice.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.520
Beautiful sunset.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.290
We went out around the Statue
of Liberty and whatever else.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.420
And you kind of come to
remember that this is really

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.170
a water city.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.930
And we often forget that.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.480
And it kind of leads me to
think about all the things

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.210
that came and went
out of that port

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
and how that port connected New
York City to the whole world.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.520
And we live a very, very
different kind of life

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.060
than people did back in other
countries-- than most people

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.010
even live today.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.590
I mean, we'll look
up and we'll say,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.030
"What do you want
to have tonight?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.290
How about some Thai food."

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.530
Like, "Oh, I had
Chinese food yesterday."

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.840
Or something, as if
it was somehow related

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.980
and that what you
had yesterday has

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.050
anything to do with what
you're going to have today.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.520
If you are in a
good-sized Italian city,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.840
and you wake up in the morning,
and you're really tired.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.060
Say you're in Torino.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.490
And you wake up in the
morning, and you don't really

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.570
feel like Torinese food.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.240
Guess what you're probably
going to have today.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.220
Torinese food.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.830
Most people in the world
don't get to think about,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.640
well, I ate that three days
ago, and I'm bored with it.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.760
In the United States, especially
in a place like New York,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.490
we had everything.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.300
Everything.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.060
Every kind of beer from
everywhere was here.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.240
There were so many IPA
breweries in New York City

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.910
there was a New York Burtinizing
company that existed just

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.610
to selling brewing salt
to IPA and pale ale

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.390
brewers in New York.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.650
You could get
whatever you wanted.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.610
And I'm talking about the 1880s.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.610
Your people were from
Campagna, and you're

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.140
tired of Campagnian food?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.240
Walk five blocks that way,
and you'd be in China.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.060
Walk 12 blocks that way,
and you'd be in Sweden.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.180
There would be a
different language,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.540
and people would have
completely different food.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.500
We were never locked
into anything.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.510
In Brooklyn we had 48 breweries.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.740
And those 48
breweries were brewing

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.540
10% of all the beer
in the United States.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.950
We had the most
diverse food culture

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.899
on the face of the earth-- and
the most diverse beer culture

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.420
on the face of the earth.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.400
And we had everything
because we had everybody.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.310
And that was our strength.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.650
I think it continues
to be our strength.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.010
But we went through
a weird period.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.340
Now I look around this room,
and I can see that most of you

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.435
did not live through
the weird period.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.720
You know, which is cool.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.740
And it's the weird period
and our recovery from it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.540
that we're going to
talk about today.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.290
Because it's really what I
do on a day-to-day basis.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.650
I feel like I am
helping us recover

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.940
from the strangeness of the
middle of the 20th century.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.340
So we had-- and this kind
of pertains, in a way,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.590
to your business-- we had a huge
difference between what 1920

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.290
looked like-- which is
when prohibition came in--

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.160
and what 1933
looked like-- which

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.250
is when prohibition ended.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.890
Prohibition is a
fascinating subject.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.450
If you've never
really studied it,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.450
it's a lot more
interesting than it sounds.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.870
It was not really an
anti-alcohol movement,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.560
but more of an anti-German,
anti-Catholic movement, which

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.120
was kind of tied together with
the women's suffrage movement.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.060
It had relatively little
to do with alcohol itself.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.350
But I digress.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.620
The important thing is that 13
years later, from 1920 to 1933,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.480
you emerged into a
completely different world.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.410
Oh, sure, beer came back,
but the world was different.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.030
And, in a way, it's
almost as different

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.200
as it was between, say,
1993 and 10 years later

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.180
for most of us, when they
were smart phones starting

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.950
to pop up everywhere, et cetera,
et cetera, shortly after that.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.070
And you had search engines,
yourselves foremost among them.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.400
We couldn't imagine that world.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.380
And we don't remember the
old one almost anymore.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.860
But by 1933 you had a
true mass market possible.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.710
You had actual modern
media-- a radio network

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.470
that could reach out to
everybody all at once.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.790
And this was new.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.560
Beer used to be a local.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.390
It was a thing,
like all other food.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.290
It was local.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.210
It got trucked a little
ways, but there wasn't really

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.360
a network of highways.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.010
So you could only
get food so far.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.740
I think, even by
the 1970s, Pabst

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.370
was still the number one
beer in the United States.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.310
And it probably had
20%, 30% of the market.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.540
It wasn't possible to
grab everything at once.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.690
But finally they
figured out-- wait

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.240
a minute-- we have the ability.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.087
We now have roads,
and we have trucks.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:15.170
And we have a railroad
system, and we've got this,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.370
and we have that.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.060
And we have mass
communications which makes

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.560
possible that mass market.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.910
And what is going to
be most profitable

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:30.290
is to sell only one
thing in each category.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.020
Control the category,
and get all the money.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:42.760
And that is the end of the more
radical straightforward idea

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.730
of capitalism.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.540
Your job is to
get all the money.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.250
And the people in
the food industry

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.770
started to think
about it that way.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.700
And the really
horrible thing about it

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.940
is that we like to act like
we fought it all the way.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.050
But we didn't.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.760
We asked for it.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.310
Because it was
science, and science

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.000
was going to solve everything.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.714
And science is kind of like
the force in "Star Wars."

00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:19.020
It has this bright side,
and it has this dark side.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.090
And at certain times people
only look at one side,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.320
and they're not really
seeing the other

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.670
creeping up behind them.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:32.030
So the same forces that
wanted American sugar

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.590
to be blindingly white and
that wanted all of our bread

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.799
and our food to be
blindingly white,

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:45.100
and then to have these
ideas of purity running

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.570
very hard-- everything from
eugenics on down to food.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.330
We can make things pure.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.330
We can solve all problems.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:58.280
And the problem, when it
came to food, was life.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.790
Things that are
alive are a problem.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.900
Everything is
trying to eat sugar.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.780
It's trying to get protein.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.590
Which means that it's trying
get into your food and spoil it.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.940
A loaf of bread was a problem.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.540
They had two ends on it.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.890
You had to slice the thing.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.080
Then try to make a bunch
of sandwiches for the kids.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.690
Get the kids out the door.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.860
Most people were poor.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.500
But you could solve that
problem by making stuff

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.070
that would never ever spoil.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.670
In 1990-- and I'm
sure there are people,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.760
myself possibly
included, who can

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.670
do entire parts of
this movie verbatim--

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.985
but one of my favorite
movies, the original,

00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:48.320
"The Matrix" which obviously
posits a world where computers

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.000
have essentially pulled down
a scrim over the real world

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.050
and replaced the real world with
a computer-generated vision.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.720
But here's the thing.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.160
You know, I grew
up in The Matrix.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.820
I grew up in The Matrix.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.570
And The Matrix was the
American supermarket.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.040
When you walked in there
were all these things

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.080
in the supermarket that
were labeled as food,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.160
but they weren't food.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.070
Almost none of them
were actually food.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.959
Bread-- there were
two kinds of bread.

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:25.500
There was white
bread, and then there

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.208
was white bread with
food coloring, which

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:28.970
they called wheat bread.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:35.660
And this bread stayed fresh
in a bag for two weeks.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.830
That was the expiration date.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.990
Now who here has ever made
a loaf of bread at home?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.520
OK.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.110
How long does your average
loaf of bread stay fresh?

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.470
One day, two days.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.200
OK.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.520
A loaf of bread does not stay
fresh in a bag for two weeks.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.440
The thing in the
bag was not bread.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.860
It didn't look like bread.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.300
It didn't smell like bread.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.960
It didn't taste like bread.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.200
It was not made from
what bread is made from.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.080
And it was not made
how bread is made.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.700
It had no actual
bread attributes.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.040
And how can we actually-- and
every person, if you ask them,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.090
what is bread made of?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.100
They could tell you.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.400
There are four or five
ingredients, each of which

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.510
could be pronounced by
a five-year-old child.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.640
But this bread
had 40 ingredients

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.660
printed in a big blue
panel, and all of them

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.160
were the unpronounceable
names of chemicals.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.280
The question is, why
are you not scared?

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.970
You give this to your children.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.030
You have no idea what it is.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.860
Right?

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.860
It doesn't even taste good.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.570
It doesn't even taste good.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.410
Even worse than that, it was
never supposed to taste good.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.120
It wasn't its job to taste good.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.040
Its job was to keep your meat
from falling onto the floor

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.250
and to hold on to mayonnaise
and for you to pay for it.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.701
That's its job.

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.200
I always wonder why
did they call it

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.990
a crust when it wasn't crusty?

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.540
It had never even
been in an oven.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.720
It was sprayed on food coloring.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.890
Every single thing
about it was fake.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.940
This is The Matrix,
and this is the world

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:21.880
of American food in the 1970s--
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.972
I saw my first broccoli
plant-- like, stalk of broccoli

00:12:24.972 --> 00:12:26.930
that you could go out
anywhere in New York City

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.990
now and buy at 4:00
o'clock in the morning

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.730
to your heart's content-- I
saw my first broccoli plant

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.080
when I was in my 20s.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.750
Broccoli came chopped
up frozen in a box.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.380
It was a brick.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.550
And that was the only
way you could get it.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.269
Not that you wanted it.

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:47.810
Because your mom
was going to cook it

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.643
the way everybody else
was going to cook it.

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:52.460
Follow the instructions--
put in a little bit of water,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.580
cook approximately 30
minutes until gray.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.820
And that was the way
that we ate broccoli.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.770
I hated broccoli.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.350
I hated every vegetable
except for iceberg lettuce.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.790
That was the one
you could get fresh.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.770
There were only two
kinds of broccoli.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.330
There were two separate names.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.860
But that was it.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.620
And that was food.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.070
Even the Thanksgiving
turkey that we all got

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.070
familiar with-- let's face it.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.610
Nobody even likes the turkey.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.890
Nobody even likes the turkey.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.348
They're like, "I
don't like turkey.

00:13:25.348 --> 00:13:26.080
It's dry."

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.290
It's like, real
turkeys aren't dry.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.420
I mean, an actual turkey
is a delicious bird.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.600
But most Americans have
never even had one.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.930
So The Matrix is still here.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.070
OK.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.720
I want you to think about this.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.510
The stuff that you--
probably a good many

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.350
of you, maybe some
of you are still

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.080
thinking about doing
it this weekend.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.200
You're going to put
it on your hamburger.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.420
It melts so beautifully.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.360
So I want to think
about what is this?

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.030
And if your answer is cheese,
I want you to think again.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.200
First of all, the package
doesn't even say cheese on it.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.840
It mentions the word cheese--
"American pasteurized processed

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.280
cheese food product."

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.780
Sounds delicious, huh?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.520
It's got a whole
bunch of ingredients.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.900
What this is an edible plastic,
and that is not a joke.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.210
I know people who are working
on this for the military.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.380
So you can carry this
stuff around in your pocket

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.330
forever, take it out in
the desert, and eat it.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.400
Now if your definition
of food is something

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.420
which does have calories and
does not kill you immediately,

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.210
well, all kinds of
things are food.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.040
This is awesome.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.620
I can come down there and eat
your papers and whatever else,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.050
and I'll get some sustenance.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.590
And I'm going to die,
like, not right now.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.900
It's all food, right?

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.230
What is this?

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.720
Well, I mean, you probably
have a nostalgia, some of you,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.309
about it.

00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:02.350
You're thinking-- there
are a few of you actually

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.070
thinking about grilled cheese
sandwiches when you see it.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.690
You are really well conditioned.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.340
This isn't cheese.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.830
This was never cheese.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.760
I went to my first cheese
shop-- my first actual cheese

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.800
shop-- in 1993 in Paris.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.850
And I literally walked in, and
I said, "What's that smell?"

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.880
"It is the fromage, Monsignor."

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.520
I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.770
I've had all four cheeses, and
none of them smell like that.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.280
And these are covered in mold."

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.990
No, they've solved
the entire problem.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.980
Life has gone away.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.940
It's undead.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.980
It was never alive, and it's
never going to be alive.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.610
I could walk around with this
for a month in my pocket,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.430
take it out, and
eat it right now.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.280
And each one of you
knows that's true.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.510
You know it's true.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.560
You know nothing will
ever happen to this.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.910
And yet, somehow, to you
this still looks like food.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.420
That's The Matrix.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.450
Do you know why it's yellow?

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.500
The reason why it's yellow
is that, hundreds of years

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.000
ago, everybody knew that,
as cheeses got older,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.460
they gain more flavor.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.440
They also became yellow over
time, as many things do.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.770
They oxidized.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.240
There were melanoidin
reaction products,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.610
and your cheese became yellow.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.860
So yellowness became a symbol.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.010
And it was a symbol of age
and, therefore, quality.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.180
Now people started later to
add annatto food coloring

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.650
into cheeses to
give them that color

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.670
so that you would associate
their cheese with quality,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.150
even if that quality
wasn't there.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.050
Then you denature the product
further into something

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:53.460
which isn't even cheese anymore
and put the coloring in there.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:58.280
And then you look at this now,
today, identify this as cheese,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.990
identify yellow as the
color that cheese should be,

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.390
based on something
hundreds of years ago,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:09.380
which you no longer even
remember and never even knew.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.994
That's The Matrix.

00:17:10.994 --> 00:17:12.410
And that's the way
that it worked,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:13.930
and it worked on everything.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.349
Nobody here probably
is old enough

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.776
to remember Sealtest ice cream.

00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:18.109
I probably shouldn't mention it.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.950
You should beep that
out, the actual name.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.480
But that's the one that--
they were all the same.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.240
It was a box of air.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.869
This thing weighed
absolutely nothing--

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.550
a cardboard box of air.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:36.960
So I remember going
down South one time--

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.950
I think it was in Virginia.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.710
I was on a road trip.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.600
And we pulled up to a diner,
and a stack of pancakes

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.700
sounded great.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.770
There were literally cows
out there in the field.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.311
We're like, we're
from New York City.

00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:51.170
This is awesome.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.690
There are cows outside.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.050
And the lady says to us,
"Want to have the syrup?"

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:56.980
And I was like, OK.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.146
And I knew it wasn't really
going to be maple syrup.

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:03.070
This was 1985 or something.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.599
But then she put these
pats of goo on the table.

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:07.140
And it was like the
old school thing.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.790
It had a little
square of wax paper,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.930
and there was, like, splat.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.480
And we said, "Well, can
we have some butter?"

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.550
And they're like,
"Well, this is butter."

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.360
I'm like, "Uh, no,
actually this is margarine.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.200
We'd like to have some butter."

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.370
And her previously sweet
nature went away suddenly.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.520
And she said, rather
bitterly, "Well, this

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.040
is the only butter we have."

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.920
And it turned out
that, no matter where

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.560
you went the United States, the
closer you were to actual cows,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.420
the further you
would be from butter.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.620
And vice versa.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.030
And that's still true today.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.840
I love the idea of kind
of facsimile and reality

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.400
in butter.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.250
Because margarine actually
started off as fake

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.820
butter for poor people.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.900
And then during the
'80s it actually turned

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.500
from being fake butter
to real margarine.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.820
Because they said that it
was actually better for you

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.840
than butter.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.060
And they actually started to
promote the fact that it didn't

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.654
have the properties of butter.

00:19:08.654 --> 00:19:10.320
It supposedly didn't
have the same fats,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.300
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.940
Butter was terrible for
you, and margarine was good.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.250
Then they found out that
this wasn't actually true.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.080
And the whole thing reversed.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.020
And margarine, which
had been fake butter,

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.820
then became real margarine,
became fake butter again.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.980
All these things depend on
what it is you're trying to get

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.590
and what it is that
you're thinking about it.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.530
When I first lived in London--
well, before I lived in London,

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.560
I lived in Boston.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.280
And I went to Boston University.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.050
We drank beer
basically every day.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.220
The thing was we didn't like it.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.230
We didn't like it.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.270
There wasn't anything to like.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.340
It was yellow.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.710
It was fizzy.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.230
And I will tell you the truth.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.360
We drank the mass market
brands like Budweiser

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.550
when we had money.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.890
We never had any money.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.420
But if we had a
little bit of money,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:10.110
we got that stuff, because at
least it tasted like water.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.180
The other stuff, which I
will not mention by name,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.690
tasted much, much
worse than water.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.160
They were horrible.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.650
Absolutely horrible.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.540
The thing is that those
mass market brands won out

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.130
for a reason.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.880
The mass market bread
won for a reason.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.750
You know, you've heard
the term, "the best

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.106
thing since sliced bread."

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.730
But it never occurred
to you, probably,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.706
to think about, well, what's
so great about sliced bread?

00:20:35.706 --> 00:20:38.080
How could something be the
best thing since sliced bread?

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.010
Sliced bread was
considered awesome.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.330
It stayed fresh in
a bag for two weeks.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.470
Never throw out a slice.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.350
No food waste.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.700
That's great-- if it's food.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.567
So beer, we thought
we knew what it was.

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:53.150
It was yellow.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.440
It was fizzy.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.910
And it tasted OK, or it didn't.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.920
But we drank everything.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.260
We were college students.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.350
You know, 18 was the
drinking age back then.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.520
And we drank like fish.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.710
And Tuesdays, kamikaze
night at Mollie's.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.940
OK, whatever.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.410
Try to find the bartender who
is really going to hook you up.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.550
And that was about it.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.070
And then I got to London.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.740
And my first day, I'm
like, "Oh, there's

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.570
the British beer I've
heard so much about."

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.819
And it's brown.

00:21:24.819 --> 00:21:26.610
It's like, I wonder
why it looks like that.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.020
And then I taste it.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.200
It's not even cold.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.484
And then it's barely fizzy.

00:21:32.484 --> 00:21:34.150
And I'm drinking it,
and it's like, this

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.420
tastes like hay and flowers
and fruit and sea air.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.660
And I'm drinking it, I get
to the bottom, I'm like,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.810
"I'm not sure I liked that.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.920
I better have another
one to find out."

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.250
And I became completely
fascinated with this stuff.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.740
And I had traveled all over
Europe from then Czechoslovakia

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.860
to Belgium, et cetera.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.750
And everywhere you went,
people had different beer.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.280
And it started to occur to me,
as I went to the cheese shops,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.270
and I went to the beer places,
et cetera-- we've been lied to.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.800
That wasn't cheese.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.100
That wasn't bread.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.620
That wasn't a croissant.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.630
This is a croissant.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.680
That beer wasn't beer.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.390
And I was pissed.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.070
I was pissed.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.680
I got back, and I
went to the bar,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.130
and they had the same four beers
they'd had when I left in 1983.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.340
Came back in 1984,
pretty appropriately.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.490
And they were all like, "Bud,
Bud Light, Miller, Miller Lite,

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.480
Heineken."

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.660
I was like, "Oh, no.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.310
I can't-- I can't
do this anymore."

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.800
I had took the red pill.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.700
I had already left The Matrix.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.450
I was not going back
into The Matrix.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.340
So I determined for myself that
the only way to have any beer

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.620
was to make myself.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.840
And my best friend
Larry, one year

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.440
he gave me a home brewing
kit for Christmas.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.190
He was like, "Man, I'm
so tired of hearing

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.661
you talk about how much
you can't get a good beer.

00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:10.160
Here.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.180
Make it yourself."

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.310
So I did.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.110
And it was kind of magic.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.910
And it's still kind of magic.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.070
Take this really inert
looking material.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.990
I mean, let's face it.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.920
I love malt, but it
doesn't look like grapes.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.640
I mean, now, I love wine.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.474
I think wine is a
quite limited beverage.

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:31.140
I mean, that one
ingredient they've got.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.700
It's a nice ingredient,
that one ingredient.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.870
They can do a lot with it.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.450
They can't do nearly what I can
do with malt or whatever else.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.890
Like, every time I do a
competition versus a sommelier

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.880
wine versus beer with cheese.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.440
There are two
types of opponents.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.160
The ones who know
they're going to lose

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.220
and the ones who don't
know they're going to lose.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.014
I like the second type better.

00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:54.680
Because they're more
combative about it,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.440
and they just go down
spinning in flames.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.750
You can't beat me.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.690
You can't beat me.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.830
I can make something that tastes
like anything, like anything.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.900
I have a whole drawer full
of-- I can spice things.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.920
I can smoke them.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.430
I can caramelize them.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.090
I have a whole range of yeast
and things to work with.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.400
And you have this one grape.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.310
Nice grape, but
there's no way you're

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.960
going to win this competition.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.400
So I have a good time
smoking these guys.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.930
But people don't think
of beer that way.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.050
They think of beer
as a commodity.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.670
That's only now
starting to change.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.580
People look at it
because they're

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.070
thinking of The Matrix
version of beer as beer.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.650
What's funny about the
way the market works,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:48.120
though, perception wise,
is that the actual truth

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.290
of the American wine
market is a bag and box

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.160
or a jug with a finger loop.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.432
That is 90% of the
American market-- 90%.

00:24:57.432 --> 00:24:59.140
The stuff that you're
thinking about when

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.810
I say wine-- the
nice label and a cork

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.470
and whatever else--
less than 10%.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.994
Less than 10%.

00:25:06.994 --> 00:25:08.410
When we think about
scotch we tend

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.210
to think about a single malt.
That's not the scotch market.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.500
The scotch market is
blended scotch-- the stuff

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.550
that you, by and
large, don't drink,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.450
that's the actual market.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.860
The difference is that when
people think about beer

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.940
they think of the
90% at the bottom.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:32.820
And when they think of wine they
think of the 10% at the top.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.050
That's marketing.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.940
Boy, the French are so good.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:41.370
I mean, I have to
love that about them.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.360
Ronald Reagan was
not my favorite guy.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.460
I will tell you right now.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.800
I did-- speaking of
our political season--

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.770
I did wear a black
armband for two weeks

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.577
when he got elected in 1980.

00:25:54.577 --> 00:25:56.660
I was not into him then,
and I'm not into him now.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.630
But I'll tell you
one thing that he did

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.260
that turned out interestingly.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.690
He deregulated the airlines.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.840
And one thing that this resulted
in was cheaper airfares.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.510
And Americans started to travel.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.730
And they went overseas, and
they said, now wait a minute.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.880
Look at all this food.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.870
Look at these markets.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.910
This is unbelievable.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.520
Where's ours?

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.260
And this is really what
jump started craft brewing

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.130
in the United States.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.290
Was Americans going overseas,
finding out that beer

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.830
was not what they
thought it had been.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.810
Leaving The Matrix,
food and beer-wise,

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.600
coming back and starting,
not only the craft brewing

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.840
movement, but all of
the interest that we

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.750
see flowering in food,
in cheese, in chocolate,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.190
and all sorts of things.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.670
These are not actually
separate phenomena.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.710
We look at them as being
separate, because we

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.470
as ourselves think of ourselves
as brewers, or we're beer fans.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.080
We may or may not be chocolate
people or coffee people

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.060
or whatever else.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.680
It's all one thing.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.430
And what's fascinating
is that you

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.670
would have thought in 2008
when the economy collapsed

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.240
that what you would
have had was a decline

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.020
of this "fancy stuff."

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.300
Because, after all, millions
and millions of people

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.220
are losing their jobs.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.400
People are insecure
in their incomes.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.400
This stuff is more
expensive, and you

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.950
would expect it to decline.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.680
What happened, interestingly,
is exactly the opposite.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.000
People said, I'm not going
on vacation this year.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.540
I'm not getting that new car.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.320
I can't afford that new suit.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.752
But I'm sure as hell
not giving that up.

00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:44.170
I am going to keep that.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.950
I'm going to stay
in the actual world.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.400
And I'll leave you
with a thought here.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.350
Americans are odd people.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:03.350
We are suspicious of pleasure.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.640
Now when I said the word
pleasure, some of you

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.240
had a little jolt of
"that sounds dirty."

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.950
The word pleasure actually
sounds dirty to Americans.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.880
You know who it
doesn't sound dirty to?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.130
Italians.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.660
And that's why we go there.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.270
Because when an
Italian says pleasure,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.097
that automatically just sets
off nothing but happy thoughts

00:28:29.097 --> 00:28:29.680
in their head.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.190
And you know what word you
can't explain to an Italian?

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.110
Try explaining to an
Italian what a foodie is.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.002
I hate that word so much.

00:28:38.002 --> 00:28:40.210
I can't even tell you how
much I hate that word. "Oh,

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.060
he's a foodie."
""[INAUDIBLE] foodie."

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.700
It's like, what is a foodie?

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.180
Oh, a foodie is
a person for whom

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.297
food is one of the principal
pleasures in their entire life.

00:28:51.297 --> 00:28:52.880
And the Italian would
just look at you

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.230
and say, as opposed to who?

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.450
Like, what other
person would there be?

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.450
It's like, yo, sex--
really like it.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.440
As far as they're
concerned, food is-- yes,

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.610
it is sustenance--
but you're supposed

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.110
to be having a good time.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.200
Can you imagine listening
to music all the time

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.675
that you didn't like?

00:29:12.675 --> 00:29:14.800
You just, like, go home,
and you're just like, ugh.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.910
It's music.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.810
Now there are people like that.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.740
They can't hang out at my house.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.310
You cannot be anywhere
around me and not care,

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.954
at least little bit, about
what you're eating not

00:29:25.954 --> 00:29:26.620
you're drinking.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.820
Because liking some things
and not liking other things--

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.730
we call it taste.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.660
And you have to have some.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.700
What we're in right now
is simply a recovery.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.310
And some people remember The
Matrix, and some people don't.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.560
Those of us who lived
through it and who

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.090
grew up in it, many
of us are determined

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.830
to make sure that we never
go back that way again.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:58.520
And fortunately what we're
seeing is that we are winning.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.940
People are unwilling to go back
there and drink that stuff.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.120
Oh, yeah.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.720
Maybe if they want to be ironic.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.980
It's the trucker hat of beer
when you want to be funny.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.840
But when it comes
right down to it,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.040
people really just aren't
interested in bad things

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.890
anymore.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.771
And I think that the
big breweries thought

00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:24.270
that there was going to be--
this is a pendulum, it's a fad.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.470
It's going to swing back
the other direction.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.290
It's like, no.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.460
Actually there is no fad,
and there is no pendulum.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.460
This is a return to normality.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.470
This is the way things
were supposed to be.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.590
We had 4,000 breweries with
every kind of beer already.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.100
And if you look at the history
of American food what you see

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.450
is everything in the whole
world all the way out here.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:51.640
And then post-war you have
a very thin period where

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.530
everything is squeezed.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.310
And this is the choke point.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.490
This is The Matrix.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.400
This is big business trying
to get all the money.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.240
And now that you can't
find everybody anymore.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.490
You don't know where they are.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.180
You don't know how
to market to them.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.638
They are not going to be sitting
in front of the same three

00:31:09.638 --> 00:31:13.780
channels on Friday
night at 8:00 o'clock.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.350
Now you can't reach everybody.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.200
Everything fractures again.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.020
Taste also fractures again.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.620
And people go back to
having actual taste,

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.780
not taste controlled
from a central point.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.940
And that's what craft
beer actually is.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.400
That's what I do every day.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.660
And people ask on a
day-to-day basis, oh,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.070
what is a craft brewery?

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.550
It is a small brewery?

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.160
Is it a brewery run by
somebody who's under 26?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.880
Or is it a brewery that--
well, I'm going to say, no.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.890
I'll give you my version
of what a craft brewery is.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:55.380
A craft brewery is a
brewery really controlled

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.820
by one individual vision.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:03.010
There is a person-- a
person, not a committee, not

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.210
a department-- a
person whose taste

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.990
is expressed through what's
going on in front of you

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.870
in that glass.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.210
That's a craft brewery.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.300
I don't care how big it is.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.080
If that person is saying
this is the way forward,

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.370
and this is what we do, and
this is who we are, then, yeah,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.810
that can be a craft brewery.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.280
And it can be 20 times our
size, as far as I'm concerned,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.130
as long as they're
doing the right thing,

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.440
and they're bringing reality to
people in the form of a glass.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.190
And what I tell younger
brewers if they want advice,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.390
and what I tell them
is, brew the truth.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:46.180
Brew the truth.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.910
Whatever is your
personal truth, whatever

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.730
makes you get up in
the morning and say,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.090
I'm want to go do that job.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.070
That's your god.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.970
You go serve that god every day.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.390
And we're no longer serving
him, pack your bags, go home.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.340
We don't want to
see you anymore.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.000
We're not interested in fear.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.210
We're only interested in making
things that taste good for,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.860
hopefully, nice people.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.350
And I'll tell you what.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.400
It's a lot of fun.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.570
It's pretty good.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:15.380
I hope you guys will
sometime come and visit us.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.620
There are many ways to
visit Brooklyn Brewery.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.870
Some of them will impart
information to your mind.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.690
Other ways of visiting us
will remove information

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.040
from your mind.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.970
If you come on Friday night,
you will leave knowing less

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.010
than you did when you came.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.740
We will teach you
absolutely nothing.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.860
However there are ways of
coming during the week where

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.960
you can come see us.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.501
Go check it out,
BrooklynBrewery.com.

00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:43.650
You can just come
see us, and you

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.220
can come in for small tours.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.400
There are the big tours on the
weekend, lots of fun things

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.190
to drink.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.500
And I hope that you'll
come check us out.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.250
Of course, in a certain way,
I see you guys every day--

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.215
probably more times a day
than I want to imagine.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.260
But I hope you will come see us.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.170
I thought it would be
churlish to come and bring

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.760
not one drop of beer with me.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.210
So I did bring one
drop of beer with me.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:19.510
So we're going to have a little
bit of beer here afterwards.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.600
It is a beer--- and I
did go to film school,

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.940
so you'll have to forgive.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.500
The name of the beer
is "The Discreet Charm

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.591
of the Framboisie."

00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:28.091
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:32.780
He's the one who
actually got the joke.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.670
Everybody else who wants to
know what this is a reference to

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.199
is going to have to Google it.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:42.230
And I think that you probably
think that's pretty OK.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.420
Thanks very much.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.851
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.752
SPEAKER: And we have time for
a few questions if any of you

00:34:54.752 --> 00:34:55.710
have questions for him.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.585
GARRETT OLIVER: Sure.

00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:00.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Garrett.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.620
Thanks for coming in.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.490
I really liked your talk.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.240
I love your beers.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.392
GARRETT OLIVER: Oh, thanks.

00:35:03.392 --> 00:35:05.975
AUDIENCE: So a lot of the foods
you were talking about-- like,

00:35:05.975 --> 00:35:09.150
The Matrix foods, like
processed cheese-- a lot of that

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.730
comes from the military.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.320
Because they're one of the
biggest investors in R and D

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.680
into food.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.960
So you mentioned Reagan
deregulating the airlines,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.100
and Americans going abroad, and
that was a huge cultural shift

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.670
to get people to
kind of wake up.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.310
So do you think we're
still on the down slope

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.290
from that discovery?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.050
Or do you see any
cultural shifts

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.810
more recently that might take
people away from The Matrix?

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.450
Because the military is still
really invested into R and D

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.180
into food preservation
and things

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.740
like that-- like the energy
bar, and they're really

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.640
into discovering shelf
stable pizzas now.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.400
And when people in America
really value convenience still

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.030
a lot over taste, do you see
any other indicators in culture

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.250
that might swing us out of
that convenience-heavy mindset

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.364
and more into actual food?

00:35:58.364 --> 00:36:00.780
GARRETT OLIVER: Yeah, I think
that's a very good question.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.120
I think that-- and it
is sometimes ironic

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.370
that I was one of the founders
of the Slow Food movement

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.750
here in the United States, Slow
Food USA, about 16 years ago.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:16.550
It's a worldwide
eco-gastronomical organization.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.330
So it looks to
preserve worldwide food

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.510
culture and the
biological diversity

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.310
necessary to make real food.

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.400
And we always
joked that the time

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.750
that we were most likely
to end up eating fast food

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.970
was when we were
traveling for Slow Food.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.320
Like, you'd be running through
an airport, whatever else.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.470
My last book took
4 and a half years,

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.030
and I'm not going to
sit there and tell you

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.730
there were not times that I
wished to God that in Brooklyn

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.880
we had drive-ins.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.470
Because I'm like,
I have 12 minutes.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.110
I have three minutes
to get the food,

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.040
and I have six minutes
to eat the food,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.590
I have two minutes to clean up
what's left over from the food.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.550
I have no time.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.590
Somebody give me some
food, give me some food,

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:54.440
give me some food.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.106
I would have eaten
anything at the time.

00:36:57.106 --> 00:36:58.480
Fortunately I
discovered peanuts.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.540
And at the end of that whole
process, I had lost 20 pounds.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.040
Everybody looked at me and said,
you look great, and I said,

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.200
I'm dying.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.920
But I still love peanuts.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.650
But I think that,
yeah, you're always

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.330
going to have a need for
things that are convenient.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.100
However actual cheese
and peanuts and things

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.490
like that are not
actually inconvenient.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.580
If you have them, they are
among the most convenient things

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.800
you can have.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.790
I can literally put some
peanuts in a bag, or trail mix,

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:33.660
or whatever else.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.826
It can be made of 100% real
stuff, and it even tastes good.

00:37:37.826 --> 00:37:39.700
And it's a great protein
and everything else.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.950
It's going to keep you
going for many hours.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.130
It is a matter of what
you're willing to pay.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.890
And I think that a lot of it
really comes down to the fact

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.780
that in our culture
the people who

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.020
are most likely to know how
to take $10 worth of material

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.530
and turn them into a really
great meal for four people-- I

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:00.100
can do that.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.290
I can do that and leave
several dollars over.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.760
And there'll be sauces
and all kinds of stuff.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.330
The people who know how to
do that are rich people.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.050
It used to be everybody.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.490
Everybody knew how to cook.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.556
And it might have been sexist,
but they taught home ec

00:38:16.556 --> 00:38:17.890
to girls.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.630
But at least somebody in the
household knew how to cook.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.410
And this is
critically important.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.420
And I think what it's
going to require, really,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.050
from us is things like
the Edible Schoolyard

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.350
where we are bringing
home to children

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.860
every day what it
means to grow food,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.190
what it means to
consume food, and what

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.330
it means to cook food and
share food with people.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:46.160
If you can cook, the
world's your oyster.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.330
It's when you can't-- the people
who most need that knowledge

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.080
are the people least
likely to have it.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.080
I mean, all the great foods of
the world are based on poverty.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.750
You know, boil the
bones until you

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:00.200
get every bit of-- stocks
and everything else

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.840
are all based on poverty.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.320
So I think that's
one thing I really

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.970
admire about Michelle Obama.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.010
That's one of the main
things that she put out

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.600
there was getting kids
to pay attention to that.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.220
And hopefully we can turn our
education system that way.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.960
Looking at beer culturally
what's fascinating

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.170
is that we are now
exporting beer culture.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.040
It used to be we
only took it in.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.020
Now, no matter where
you go in the world,

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.030
everybody brews
American-style stuff.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.200
And they're not talking
about the mass market beers.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.810
They're talking
particularly about IPA,

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.870
but even things like
sour beers which

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.524
originally came to us in certain
forms from Belgium, et cetera.

00:39:42.524 --> 00:39:45.065
And now we're giving them back
in completely different forms.

00:39:48.077 --> 00:39:48.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.660
Thanks for coming.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.040
And cheers for the
Bunuel reference.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.817
My question is, you talked
a lot about deregulation.

00:39:55.817 --> 00:39:56.650
GARRETT OLIVER: Yep.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.950
AUDIENCE: Or at least
you mentioned it.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.010
And the narrative that
I'm used to is really,

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.860
Fritz Maytag gives
way to Ken Grossman,

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.860
gives way to this explosion.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.170
So I'm curious.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.050
Do you think that
the deregulation

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.690
piece and Americans
traveling was more important?

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.510
Or that it was kind of a
perfect storm, where you have,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.740
again, Fritz Maytag,
Ken Grossman, and then

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.590
this appetite growing
in the American public

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.720
for that type of stuff.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.760
GARRETT OLIVER: Well, I think
that one, if you like, is push,

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.140
and the other is pull.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.970
So the push is, I make the beer,
and I try to sell you the beer.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.820
The pull is you want
to buy the beer.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:39.070
And they wanting to buy the
beer was really created-- partly

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:43.440
by people tasting what we had--
but it was almost like we were

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.760
a fish and there was no ocean.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.330
There was nothing to swim in.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.320
We had to actually
start distributing

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.820
our own beer in New York City.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.640
Sierra Nevada came
to us and said,

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.500
we can't sell our beer either.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.590
Nobody wants it.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.584
Would you put our
beer on your trucks?

00:40:59.584 --> 00:41:01.250
It's like, well,
you're our competitors.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.850
Like, yeah, I know, but none
of us can get to market.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.070
And then Chimay came,
and Paulaner came,

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.049
and everybody came.

00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:09.340
By the time we were done and
we sold that business off,

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.894
we had 200-plus brands.

00:41:10.894 --> 00:41:12.310
Because nobody
wanted these bears.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.330
There were, like, eight
guys who wanted them.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:19.320
What deregulation did
is that flying to places

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.896
became something
for "the Jet Set."

00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:23.770
And we all have heard
the term, but we forget

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.070
that it was a real thing.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:30.020
People who could get on
a plane were rich people.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:34.380
By a point in the mid-'80s I
was flying to Boston because I

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.550
didn't have money for the bus.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.890
It got weird there for a while.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.940
You won't remember
Freddie Laker's airline,

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.980
but I'm glad still to be here.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:48.100
Because Lord knows that was a
budget airline, I'll tell you.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.867
But it got off the ground,
and it went back down again,

00:41:50.867 --> 00:41:51.450
and it landed.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.960
So I guess everything was OK.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.070
But, yeah, things got-- I mean,
your average American college

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:04.290
student now if you hear they've
been to Europe once or twice,

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.390
it doesn't sound as
weird as it would have.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.350
If you had said
that in, like, 1980,

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.395
people would have imagined
you were insanely wealthy.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.440
It's true that Americans
are famous for not having

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.680
passports.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.200
We are not a traveling people.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.240
We have a very big country,
so there is some excuse.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.860
But the fact that we
started to actually travel--

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.410
all that that happened
in California--

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.230
the new food movement, people
like Alice Waters-- it's

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.850
all down to them traveling.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:41.950
And that comes down to Ken
Grossman and Fritz Maytag, too.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.330
They went to England, and
they came back on fire

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.878
to get some for themselves.

00:42:47.878 --> 00:42:49.370
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.351
So it seems like
the United States--

00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:52.600
thanks for coming, by the way.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.280
GARRETT OLIVER: No, not at all.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.196
It's great to be here.

00:42:54.196 --> 00:42:56.800
AUDIENCE: It seems like
this is-- currently

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.130
this is a sort of
Renaissance for beer,

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.710
and maybe even the
organic movement,

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.890
whatever you want to call it.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.410
And we're exporting
that, as you said.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.930
In fact, you can find Brooklyn
Brewery all the way in China.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.900
I've been able to find it there.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.170
Although you can't find
it in California, and I

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:18.030
want to know why.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.390
That's actually my question.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.810
GARRETT OLIVER: The reason
is-- and you may not

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.506
like this reason.

00:43:24.506 --> 00:43:27.600
I don't want to get myself
in too much trouble.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.135
We have really
followed a strategy

00:43:31.135 --> 00:43:32.920
of going to where
we found really

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.960
cool things and like-minded
nice people, and we go there.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.670
Now that does not
mean that we're not

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.260
cool things and nice--
like-minded nice people,

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.570
but if you're in New York,
you can get on a plane.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.930
And in six hours you
can be in California,

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:53.080
or you can be in Paris.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.640
And if you had to choose one,
I decided to get on the plane

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.620
to Paris.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.865
Now California is beautiful.

00:43:58.865 --> 00:44:00.240
I have so many
friends out there.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.090
They grew up.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.150
They make a lot of great beer.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:06.420
We will get ourselves
out there eventually.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.000
But, really, it came down
to-- we're like, well,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.890
we feel like going that way.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:14.607
It's an overnight flight.

00:44:14.607 --> 00:44:16.690
You sleep on the plane,
you get up in the morning,

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.660
there's cool stuff
when you get there.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.830
It's not America.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:20.600
And we liked it.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.430
So we started
traveling immediately

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.990
after establishing the brewery.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.940
In 1989 we were in Tokyo.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.740
We were selling beer in Tokyo.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.680
It was always-- I mean, you
see other American beers

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.590
internationally now.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.130
But actually the
number two market

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.550
for Brooklyn Brewery outside of
the New York City area itself

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.744
is Sweden.

00:44:39.744 --> 00:44:40.660
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.630
GARRETT OLIVER: So we
have a second sister

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:48.160
brewery, Nya Carneiebryggeriet,
in Stockholm.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.360
And then we're just
finishing the redevelopment,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.180
opening in a couple
of weeks of E.C. Dahls

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.460
in Trondheim, Norway.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.230
And there will certainly
be other things coming.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.520
But our international
associations

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.320
have always been
really, really strong.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.550
The owners of the
brewery are half Italian.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.890
They speak fluent Italian.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:11.362
We've brewed beer in Italy
with partners to do projects.

00:45:11.362 --> 00:45:13.320
We were actually the
first brewery in the world

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.930
to do collaborations.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.790
So when we started
doing them, that

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.241
was the start of the
collaboration culture.

00:45:19.241 --> 00:45:21.240
And for a long time we
were the only ones really

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.760
going out there doing them--
us and whoever we chose

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.670
to do a collaboration with.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:30.172
And when I went back to Germany
and did the first collaboration

00:45:30.172 --> 00:45:32.130
in Germany, people were
kind of like, wow, this

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:32.796
is really weird.

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.930
Americans are going to
come here and brew a beer,

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:37.013
and then the Germans are
going to come over there.

00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:38.800
But now this has
become-- 10 years later,

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.740
15 years later-- it's,
like, totally normal.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.260
When I talk to friends
that are from Europe

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.060
it's almost like they
appreciate the American beers

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.080
more than the beers in
their home countries.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.010
GARRETT OLIVER:
Well, that's true.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.770
And actually I think
that's a shame.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.680
I think that's a shame.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.390
I think that we get
we get a little bit

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.030
too big for our
britches sometimes

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.640
because everybody's
swelled with pride

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.030
that, like, the American
thing is what everybody wants.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.790
Frankly, when I go overseas,
the first thing people

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.290
say to me is like, "You
want to taste our IPA?"

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:09.850
Now I'm going to be polite.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.120
And I'm going to taste it.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.040
But the answer is, no.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.660
No, I don't want
to taste your IPA.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.950
We have 10,000 IPAs-- actually
a lot more than that--

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:20.640
in the United States.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.080
At least the modern version
of this, we invented it.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.800
It's like taking a
Japanese person out

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.930
for sushi in New York.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.340
It's like, come on, dude.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:29.840
Really?

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.560
I mean, can't you find him
some barbecue or something?

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.090
And so I'm most interested--
like, I go to Brazil,

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:42.060
I want to see you what are
you doing that I can't do?

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.160
You've got some stuff.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.420
You know some things.

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.460
Your grandmother
knew some things.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.390
Do you know how many kinds
of sugar these guys have?

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.950
And I went down
there, and I actually

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.810
carried out one of those ideas.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.310
They said, let's
do a beer together.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:57.810
I'm like, fine.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:58.380
I've got an idea.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.310
He's like, what is it?

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.542
Like, I love
[INAUDIBLE], I said,

00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:03.500
and I can't get sugarcane,
not fresh sugarcane.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.550
You've got to use
it within 24 hours.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.620
We went down, cut down
700 kilos of sugarcane,

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.150
and crushed it straight into
the kettle to make a beer

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.510
called Saison de Caipira
that has actual sugarcane

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.930
character and 20% of
the sugars in the beer

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.430
were straight off
the plant that day.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.242
And the reason for me
that it was so cool

00:47:23.242 --> 00:47:24.700
is not just the
flavor of the beer,

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.000
I can't do that here--
like, not possible.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.110
That has a flavor of place.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:30.850
I love that.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.540
I hope people will continue
to explore that wherever

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.830
they are and have a little pride
in what's going on locally.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.060
AUDIENCE: I'll just
say, anecdotally,

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.450
I just got back from Texas.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:45.530
It was a family reunion where I
was able to find Brooklyn Beer.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.110
I bought some.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.030
They loved it.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.946
GARRETT OLIVER: Ah, well,
I'm glad to hear it.

00:47:49.946 --> 00:47:52.350
Because Texas pride is fierce.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.200
AUDIENCE: They all
want to drink Shiner.

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:59.020
GARRETT OLIVER: Yeah, well, as
I said, Texas pride is fierce.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.320
It overcomes almost anything.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.580
Anybody else?

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.110
See, they're thinking, we would
like to drink the beer now.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:08.740
All right.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.857
Have at it.

00:48:09.857 --> 00:48:12.190
The beer is called The Discreet
Charm of the Framboisie.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.130
It is a sour beer.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.620
It is not tremendously sour.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.070
If you've had sour beers, and
you think that they are awful,

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.460
I still urge you to try it.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.030
Think more, sparkling rose.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:27.770
I'm not a person-- there are
great complexities there.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.010
The beer spent several
months on fresh raspberries,

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.390
15 pounds per barrel.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:38.520
They were previously
used bourbon barrels,

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.490
and then re-fermented
in the bottle.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.234
So the beer was
bottled completely flat

00:48:42.234 --> 00:48:44.900
and gains all of its carbonation
from the secondary fermentation

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.450
in the bottle with champagne
yeast and Brettanomyces,

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:52.150
which is a wild yeast strain
which is just starting

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.821
to show itself a little
bit of earthy complexity

00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:55.570
in the background.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.250
But if you want to turn
all that off and just say,

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.190
hey, this is happy juice,
that's totally fine by me.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.730
Because that's
kind of what it is.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.410
So I hope you like it.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:05.540
It's about 7%.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.130
Won't completely
put a spin on you,

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.630
but hopefully brings a little
bit of brightness to your day.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:11.580
[APPLAUSE]
