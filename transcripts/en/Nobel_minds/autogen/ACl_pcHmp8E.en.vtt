00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%

it's<00:29:19.650><c> only</c><00:29:19.920><c> the</c><00:29:20.460><c> moving</c><00:29:20.850><c> part</c><00:29:21.090><c> is</c><00:29:21.240><c> only</c><00:29:21.390><c> part</c>

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's only the moving part is only part

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.220 align:start position:0%

it<00:29:23.820><c> for</c><00:29:24.180><c> instance</c><00:29:24.360><c> you</c><00:29:24.570><c> have</c><00:29:24.630><c> to</c><00:29:24.810><c> put</c><00:29:24.990><c> it</c><00:29:25.110><c> on</c>

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:25.230 align:start position:0%
it for instance you have to put it on
 

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.550 align:start position:0%
it for instance you have to put it on
the<00:29:25.350><c> servers</c><00:29:25.830><c> or</c><00:29:25.980><c> integrate</c><00:29:26.430><c> in</c><00:29:26.610><c> a</c><00:29:26.700><c> device</c><00:29:27.060><c> etc</c>

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
the servers or integrate in a device etc
 

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.850 align:start position:0%

so<00:29:28.880><c> that</c><00:29:29.880><c> is</c><00:29:30.060><c> that</c><00:29:30.600><c> all</c><00:29:30.840><c> depends</c><00:29:31.230><c> on</c><00:29:31.380><c> the</c><00:29:31.620><c> type</c>

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
