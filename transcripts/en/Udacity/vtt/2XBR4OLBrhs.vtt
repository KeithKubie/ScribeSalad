00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.560
Now that you've learned a bit about what a

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.510
genome is made of, and how big the human

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.950
genome is, I want us to start thinking about

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.380
the human genome in context of other living organisms. I

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.810
want you to tell me, which species do you think has the biggest genome. Is it

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.840
Bufo bufo, the toad frog? Homo Sapiens, or modern humans, us?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.510
Amoeba dubia, a single-celled organism, or is it gallus gallus, the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.300
chicken? Remember that all living things have genetic material

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.600
that make up their own genomes, but not every animal's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.250
genome is the exact same size. The human genome

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.450
has 3 billion base pairs and one copy. But how

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.550
do you think it compares to these other three

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.420
organisms up here? Now don't worry if you don't get

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.610
this right. Just take a guess, I just want

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.730
you to think about which other species, you think might

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.470
have more or less DNA in their genome compared to humans. So, go ahead

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.150
and pick what you think best answers

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.330
this question, which species has the biggest genome?
