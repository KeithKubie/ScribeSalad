a much more of a sort of meditative
 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.640
a much more of a sort of meditative
record and but at the same time it is a

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650
record and but at the same time it is a
 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.590
record and but at the same time it is a
record of Optimus and ultimately of

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600
record of Optimus and ultimately of
 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.150
record of Optimus and ultimately of
optimism and sort of coming out of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160
optimism and sort of coming out of
 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.140
optimism and sort of coming out of
adversity and that's much to celebrate
