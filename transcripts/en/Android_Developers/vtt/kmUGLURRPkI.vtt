JOANNA SMITH: With
Android Lollipop,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.550
material design changed the
way that apps look and feel

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.071
to create more magic moments.

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:08.029
But devices running
earlier versions of Android

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.752
don't have all of
the same options.

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.710
I'm Joanna Smith, and
one of the coolest things

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.543
that material design
gave us were tool bars.

00:00:13.543 --> 00:00:15.580
Which are now even more
magical, because they're

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.820
backwards compatible as well.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670
A toolbar is a
view that is richer

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.170
and more flexible than the
traditional action bar.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.570
In fact, toolbars are part
of your view hierarchy,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.290
so they can be animated or
even react to scroll events.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.410
Because it's a view,
you can use the toolbar

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.060
as a standalone element
anywhere in your app,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.230
providing the user with
options and controls

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.440
that don't need to span
the entire layout width

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.270
at the very top of the screen.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.899
You can even have
multiple toolbars

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.190
if the structure depends on
the content of your layout,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.630
or if you're providing the user
with many differing controls.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.310
To populate your toolbar
with actions and options,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.340
you can inflate a
menu onto the toolbar

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.390
to display those
actions to the user.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.280
You can also create
your own controls,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.150
like having a navigation
button to go up

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.010
to the parent activity.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340
While toolbars can be used
in any part of your layout,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.200
you can also choose to use the
toolbar instead of the action

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.140
bar whenever you simply
want more control

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.610
over the appearance and
functionality of that action

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.660
bar.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.110
So to use the toolbar in place
of the standard action bar,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.779
you first need to
disable the action bar.

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.320
The easiest way to
do this is to have

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.570
your theme extend from
theme AppCombat.NoActionBar,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.370
or its light variant.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.060
Then create your
toolbar the way you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.200
would create any other
layout in your app,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.160
and call set action
bar to designate it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.800
as the action bar in the
activity or fragment.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.340
By calling this
method, the system

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.930
will add the standard
action bar options for you,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140
so you don't need
to inflate a menu.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.620
Now you may be convinced of
how awesome toolbars are,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.740
but how can you use them
in versions of your app

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.850
targeting older SDKs?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.860
Well, toolbars were
added to the support

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.070
library for AppCompat V21.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.680
So now it's as easy as calling
set support action bar instead

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.960
of set action bar to replace
action bars on older devices.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.510
So check the documentation
for all of the support options

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.050
available, so that you can
bring more magic moments

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.280
to your users.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.050
