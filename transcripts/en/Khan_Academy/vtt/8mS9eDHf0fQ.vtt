00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.253
- [Instructor] What we
have here is the graph

00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:06.302
of R is equal to sin of two
theta in polar coordinates

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:08.546
and if polar coordinates
look unfamiliar to you

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:10.038
or if you need to brush up on them

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:12.132
I encourage you to do a
search for polar coordinates

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:14.906
in Khan Academy or look at
our pre-calculus section

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:16.624
but I'll give you a little
bit of a primer here.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:18.830
Let's just familiarize ourself

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.913
why this graph looks the way it does.

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:24.980
So, what we're doing for any point here,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.964
we could obviously specify these points

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:28.636
in terms of X and Y coordinates

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:32.083
but we could also specify
them in terms of an angle

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:33.489
and a radius so for example,

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.495
this would have some X coordinate

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:36.602
and some Y coordinate

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.531
or we could draw a line

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:42.130
from the origin to that
point right over here

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.153
and specify it with some angle theta

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:47.312
and some R which is the distance

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:49.812
from the origin to that point.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:52.737
And just to familiarize ourselves

00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:53.601
with this curve

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.086
let's just see why it's intuitive.

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:59.424
So, when theta is zero,
R is going to be zero,

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:00.958
sin of two times zero is just zero,

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.636
so our R we're just gonna be at the origin

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:04.591
and then as theta get larger,

00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:06.439
our R gets larger

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.974
and so, we start tracing out

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:11.682
this pedal of this flower
or clover-looking thing,

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.163
so it starts looking like that

00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:15.111
and we could keep going all the way.

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.874
What happens when theta
is equal to pi over four?

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:22.921
When theta is equal to pi
over four right over there,

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.001
well, sin of two times pi over four

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.217
is sin of pi over two,

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:27.734
R is equal to one.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.049
So, we reach a kind of a maximum R there

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.205
and then and as theta increases,

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:34.441
our R once again starts to get smaller

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.023
and smaller and smaller.

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:39.173
Now, we're going to do
this in a calculus context,

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:40.846
so the first question might be

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:43.935
well, how do we express
the rate of change of R

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.375
with respect to theta?

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.433
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.516
What is R prime of theta?

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.867
Well, there's really nothing new here.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:55.135
You just have one variable
as a function of another.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.135
You just use the chain rule.

00:01:57.135 --> 00:01:58.444
Take the derivative with respect to theta

00:01:58.444 --> 00:01:59.638
right over here.

00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:01.050
So, the derivative of sin of two theta

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.140
with respect to two theta
is going to be cosine

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.754
of two theta

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:08.057
and then you multiply that,

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:09.472
times the derivative of two theta

00:02:09.472 --> 00:02:11.237
with respect to theta which is two,

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:12.769
so we could just say times two here

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.872
or we could write a two out front.

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:16.675
Alright, that was interesting

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:19.388
but let's see if we can express this curve

00:02:19.388 --> 00:02:21.411
in terms of Xs and Ys

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:24.190
and then think about those derivatives.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.178
So, one primer, a review from pre-calculus

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.407
is that when you wanna go
between the polar world

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:32.811
and the, I guess you can
say rectangular world,

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.435
you have to remember the transformation

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:37.185
that Y is equal to R sin of theta

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:42.843
and that X is equal to R cosine of theta.

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:46.595
Now, just as a really quick primer,

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:48.525
why does that make sense?

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:52.559
Well, let's just take one of
these angle R combinations

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.392
right over here,

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:57.457
so let's say this is
theta and that is our R.

00:02:57.457 --> 00:02:59.874
Well, the height of that side

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:02.497
is going to by our Y

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:04.237
and then the length of this side

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:06.206
is going to be our X.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:07.568
Well, we know from trigonometry

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:09.203
from our unit circle definition,

00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:11.540
the SOHCAHTOA definition
of our trig functions,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.849
sin of theta is opposite over hypotenuse,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.128
sin of theta is equal
to Y over our hypotenuse

00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.628
which is R and cosine of theta

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.790
is equal to the adjacent or X over R

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.588
and you just have multiply both sides

00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:30.182
of these equations by R

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:32.860
to get to what we have right over there

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.903
and once again, if this is going too fast,

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:35.736
this is a review

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:38.387
of just polar coordinates
from pre-calculus.

00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:42.127
But now we can use these to express

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:43.520
purely in terms of theta.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.519
How do we do that?

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.940
Well, we know that R is
equal to sin of two theta,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.777
so you just have to replace these Rs

00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:50.346
with sin of two theta.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:53.763
So, Y would be equal to sin of two theta,

00:03:55.644 --> 00:03:58.644
sin of two theta times sin of theta,

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:01.847
times sin of theta

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:08.321
and X is going to be
equal to sin of two theta,

00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.654
sin of two theta

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.342
times cosine of theta,

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:16.827
times cosine of theta, just like that

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:18.887
but now we can use these expressions

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:23.033
to find the rate of change
of Y with respect to theta,

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.930
find a general expression for it.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.985
Pause the video and
see if you can do that.

00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:28.425
Right, let's work through it together.

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:29.258
Well, this is once again,

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:31.602
we're just gonna use our
derivative techniques,

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:34.253
so I could write Y prime of theta,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:36.100
the derivative of Y with respect to theta,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.186
just gonna use the product
rule right over here,

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:40.339
derivative of this first expression

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:42.589
is two cosine of two theta,

00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:44.917
cosine of two theta,

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:45.818
we've already seen that.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.759
That's just coming out of the chain rule

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.964
and then times the second expression,

00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:50.964
sin of theta

00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:56.740
and then plus, plus the first expression,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.181
sin of two theta,

00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.514
sin of two theta

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.503
times the derivative of
the second expression,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:07.892
derivative of the sin of
theta is cosine of theta.

00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:10.270
Fair enough and we could
do the same thing for X.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.687
X prime of theta,

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.621
derivative of the first expression,

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.588
it is going to be two
times cosine of two theta,

00:05:18.588 --> 00:05:21.487
two times cosine of two theta,

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.318
times the second expression,

00:05:23.318 --> 00:05:24.568
cosine of theta

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.515
and then you're gonna
have the first expression,

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:28.932
sin of two theta,

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.421
times the derivative of
the second expression

00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:34.068
which is negative sin of theta,

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:35.818
negative sin of theta

00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:38.285
and we could use this,

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.157
we could actually
evaluate these at points.

00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:42.108
For example, we could say
well, what's happening

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.108
when theta is equal to pi over four?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.174
So, when theta's pi over four,

00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:50.497
I'll do that in black right over here.

00:05:50.497 --> 00:05:52.992
We are going to be at this point

00:05:52.992 --> 00:05:55.140
right over there.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.992
Well, let's evaluate it.

00:05:56.992 --> 00:05:59.325
So, if I were to say Y prime

00:06:01.045 --> 00:06:04.295
of pi over four is equal to, let's see,

00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:09.081
this is going to be equal to two cosine

00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.165
of pi over two, two times pi over four,

00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:14.248
times sin of pi over four

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:20.176
plus sin of two times pi over four

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:23.952
is sine of pi over two

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.849
times cosine of pi over four.

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.766
Cosine of pi over four.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.871
What is this going to be equal to?

00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:36.604
Well, cosine of pi over two is zero,

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.425
so if that's zero all of
this stuff's gonna be zero

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:40.774
and here's sin of pi over two,

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:43.805
this is one, cosine of pi over four

00:06:43.805 --> 00:06:45.451
is square root of two over two,

00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:47.972
square root of two over two,

00:06:47.972 --> 00:06:51.988
so this is going to be equal
to square root of two over two

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:53.638
and actually just for the
sake of saving some space

00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:54.751
I'll just write it right over here.

00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:58.580
It's going to be equal to
square root of two over two.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.166
Well, we could do the
same exercise with X.

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:04.249
We could say X prime of pi over four.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.243
Let's see.

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:09.212
We're still gonna have
two times cosine of two

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:10.684
times pi over four,

00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:13.214
so that's going to be two
times cosine of pi over two.

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:15.261
This first part right over
here is gonna look the same,

00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:17.420
so that first term's gonna be zero.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.054
Then we're gonna have minus,

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:21.229
so this is all gonna be zero,

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.624
so then we're gonna have minus sin

00:07:24.624 --> 00:07:27.652
of pi over two times pi over four

00:07:27.652 --> 00:07:30.819
is sin of pi over, sin of pi over two,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.024
and then times sin of pi over four,

00:07:35.024 --> 00:07:36.691
sin of pi over four.

00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:41.767
Now, this is just going to be one

00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:43.287
and so, this is gonna be equal to

00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:45.187
and this is square root
of two over two as well,

00:07:45.187 --> 00:07:47.832
so this is negative square
root of two over two.

00:07:47.832 --> 00:07:49.765
Now let's see why that that makes sense.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:50.916
So, let's think about what happens

00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.323
as theta increases here.

00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:54.207
If you increase theta a little bit

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.188
from pi over four,

00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:57.258
if you increase it just a little bit,

00:07:57.258 --> 00:08:00.854
your Y coordinate continues to increase,

00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:03.164
so it makes sense you have
a positive slope here.

00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:04.979
But what happens to your X coordinate

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:06.823
as theta increases a little bit,

00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:08.213
as theta goes from there to there?

00:08:08.213 --> 00:08:10.141
Well, then your X coordinate
starts to decrease

00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:11.423
when theta increases,

00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:12.698
so that's why it makes sense

00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:14.756
that you have a negative rate of change

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:16.082
right over here.

00:08:16.082 --> 00:08:17.724
Now, the next question that you might say

00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.306
is say is well, I wanna
find the rate of change

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:20.627
of Y with respect to X

00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:22.188
because I want to figure out the slope

00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:24.332
of the tangent line right over there.

00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:26.320
And it looks like it has
a slope of negative one

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.862
but how would we actually calculate it?

00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:31.293
Well, one way to think about it is

00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:33.333
the derivative of Y,

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.166
the derivative Y with respect to X

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.439
is going to be equal
to the derivative of Y

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:43.772
with respect to theta
over the derivative of X

00:08:43.772 --> 00:08:46.357
with respect to theta.

00:08:46.357 --> 00:08:48.522
And so, at that value,

00:08:48.522 --> 00:08:51.605
so at theta is equal to pi over four,

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.463
this is going to be equal
to positive square root

00:08:56.463 --> 00:08:57.713
of two over two

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:01.021
over negative square root of two over two,

00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:02.963
negative square root of two over two

00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:06.394
and this all simplifies to
being equal to negative one,

00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:07.227
which makes sense.

00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:10.281
This does look indeed like a tangent line

00:09:10.281 --> 00:09:12.757
that has a slope of negative one.

00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:14.349
So, hopefully this puts it altogether,

00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:16.173
you're feeling a little
bit more comfortable,

00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:17.373
you got a review a little bit

00:09:17.373 --> 00:09:18.775
of the polar coordinates

00:09:18.775 --> 00:09:20.556
but we've augmented that knowledge

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:23.723
by starting to take some derivatives.
