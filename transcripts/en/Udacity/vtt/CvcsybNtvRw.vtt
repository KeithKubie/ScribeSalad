00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.220
Now it's time to launch a settings
activity from the menu item.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.555
We need to launch it from two places,
the Main Activity and

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:08.860
the Detail Activity.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.280
Afterwards, compile and
run the app to make sure that it works.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.180
This is what it should
look like from the.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.898
Main Activity,
if you tap on Settings menu,

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:19.840
it should be bring you to
the Settings Activity.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.920
It is expected for it to be blank,
because we haven't populated it yet.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.100
Now let's try the Detail Activity.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.842
If you tap on a Forecast,
you can go into the Detail Activity and

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.460
then you can go into
the Settings Activity.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.460
Complete the task and then verify
that your app behavior is like this.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.791
In the directions that
I just provided and

00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:42.922
in the following videos of this course,
you'll notice that the settings

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:45.800
activity had an action bar
at the top of the screen.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.207
When building your app with the latest
version of the Support library,

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:52.519
the action bar doesn't show up by
default in the Settings Activity.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.463
As a result, it's expected and

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:58.140
correct that your device looks
like this with no action bar.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.785
Don't worry, we'll add the action
bar back when we change the theme of

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.800
the Settings Activity in lesson five.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.840
