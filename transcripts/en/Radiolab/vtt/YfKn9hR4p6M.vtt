00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey, I'm Jad I boom rod, this is radio lab today.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.260
Eight experiments and translation

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.140
<v 1>last from number three. They called it shell shock.</v>

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.930
[inaudible] discovered the shale, the truck. Now you try

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.690
<v 0>this one, Robert Krulwich and our producers are when wheeler talked to, right?</v>

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.040
Or Adam Gopnik about George Carlin. And why is George Carlin mentioned?

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.520
Oh because Carlin is the wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language.

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.330
You're talking about the comedian. Comedian, yeah. And this next thing,

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.460
this next thing is about the English language.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.440
It's about little expressions we use.

11
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.980
We all say in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time.

12
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.390
Moses is one of his great subjects,

13
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:42.300
really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting cause he

14
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:44.550
was, he didn't even have a high school education, you know,

15
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:49.160
so it was not something that he got from schooling and one of God,

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.330
Nick's favorite Carlin roofs. And I really liked this one too.

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.710
It's about how Carlin hated euphemisms. I don't like words that hide the truth.

18
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:58.800
I don't like words that conceal reality. I don't like euphemisms.

19
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.000
And American English is loaded with euphemisms cause Americans have a lot of

20
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.630
trouble dealing with reality. And Carlin was wonderful about things like that.

21
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.410
What about books as he called her? We have no more old people in this country.

22
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.280
No more old people.

23
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:16.281
We shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens.

24
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490
Isn't that a tip? And he was unsympathetic.

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.570
The reason we use the euphemism I've just been through,

26
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.460
my father in law died like four months ago and we went through the same horrible

27
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.960
business that we all go through in an intensive care ward where the doctors and

28
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.600
nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught.

29
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.800
We just want your father to be comfortable. He's gravely ill, he's gravely ill,

30
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:38.940
means he's dying, right?

31
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.390
And we want him to be comfortable means can we give him enough drugs so the hill

32
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.700
pass out before he dies and so on.

33
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.810
And so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing,

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.460
but no one is fooled.

35
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.620
What we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you

36
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.490
cannot disguise.

37
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.470
But Carlin's real point was that it it like Dole's our reactions to it that

38
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:04.770
actually has like a can have a negative effect and it gets worse with every

39
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.750
generation. And he has this whole bit,

40
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.920
it's about shellshock becoming PTSD. No, he goes, no, he goes,

41
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.410
it's in four different things. In the first world war,

42
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.300
that condition was called shell shock. They used to call it shell shot. Simple,

43
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.450
honest, direct language, two syllables, shell shock.

44
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.190
And then it became battle fatigue, battle fatigue.

45
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.020
Four syllables now takes a little longer to say it doesn't seem to hurt as much.

46
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.220
And then after it became battlefield t, then it became operational exhaustion.

47
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.310
Hey, we're up to eight syllables now.

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.180
Then it became post traumatic shock disorder, still eight syllables,

49
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.960
but we've added a hyphen and then it became PTSD,

50
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.540
post traumatic stress disorder.

51
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.350
The pain is completely buried under jargon.

52
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.690
This was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blanded out

53
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.990
the word. So have you stopped saying no? Yeah, we just tortured the guy.

54
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.670
If you say some force of interrogation or enhanced interrogation,

55
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.810
that makes a big difference.

56
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.590
And part of what Carl and his saying is that like now that as PTSD we are not

57
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.430
having the appropriate reaction to it. I mean it's Shell Shock Betcha.

58
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.620
If we'd still been calling us shell shock,

59
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.070
some of those Vietnam veterans might've gotten the attention they needed at the

60
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
time.

61
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.073
<v 2>Okay,</v>

62
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.080
<v 0>but now you're putting your finger on the,</v>

63
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.680
this is where the rubber meets the road.

64
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.910
Does the use of euphemism,

65
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.100
does that really rob us of some understanding and Adam Gopnik surprisingly says

66
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.200
maybe not the truth, it's just the opposite.

67
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.510
We actually have more of an apparatus to help people with PTSD than they did in

68
00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.010
1915 to help guys with shell shock.

69
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.150
The reason the word gets more abstract is be exactly because you have a much

70
00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:55.910
more complicated and abstract system of support.

71
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:59.990
It's not because the reason it's called PTSD is because it's a more complex in

72
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.250
n. Yes. Because think about what that evolution says. The initial thing was, oh,

73
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:07.010
these guys are being driven crazy because the shells are exploding all around.

74
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.770
On the western front. Gopnik says, the thinking was, you know, it was temporary.

75
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.410
The shell goes off, it explodes in a moment.

76
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.200
They have a moment of shock and they need a moment of rest and then they can go

77
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:21.890
back in, but by World War II we are thinking that's not quite right.

78
00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:26.000
It's not just shells exploding, right? It's the whole experience of battle.

79
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.740
It's all the shooting and the death and the fear, so it becomes battle fatigue.

80
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.150
You're trying to generalize it. You're trying to make it richer as the content.

81
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.880
It also becomes a fatigue versus shock. There's less violence in this, right,

82
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.840
because,

83
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.540
because you're looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock

84
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:45.620
necessarily, but over time it becomes impossible for them to go on.

85
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.290
There's a wonderful film from World War II called let there be light.

86
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.350
These are the casual days at the skirt troubled in mind named who I damaged

87
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:59.220
emotionally about guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue and the

88
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:03.030
reason they were calling it that was because you didn't necessarily see it right

89
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.430
away. Then around Vietnam he says,

90
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:07.410
we realized you don't just see this on the battlefield.

91
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:11.480
You see it with guys who aren't necessarily directly involved in battle. Right?

92
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.490
And so the question became, what's the source of it? It's you say, well,

93
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:15.480
it's nervous exhaustion.

94
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:19.470
You say the human nervous system can only take it for so long and then

95
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.580
everybody's nervous system shuts down. Hence the term operational exhaustion.

96
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.470
Oh, that's example. Again, when you're trying to enrich it,

97
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:27.990
you're saying the guys aren't cowards and not in a state of shock.

98
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.520
They are behaving the way all human beings do and then you get more concerned

99
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:34.890
about them and you say, the real problem isn't there,

100
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.660
just their experience on the battlefield.

101
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.580
The problem is is that they are in a constant state of disorder because it

102
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:44.460
lingers on long after you think it's over.

103
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.250
You can't just get these guys into a hospital for six months and think they're

104
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:49.230
going to be better. They are permanently you.

105
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:53.060
They have post traumatic shock and then once you have a, uh,

106
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.250
whole apparatus to deal with it, then you becomes PTSD.

107
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.370
My point is just that it's perfectly possible that the language of euphemism

108
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:06.020
grows and becomes more abstract as actually as people actually are becoming more

109
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:10.300
empathetic to the people who suffer from it. Saren do you buy, I mean, he's,

110
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.830
he's easily turned Carlin on his head and he's made these blander and three

111
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.660
words, enrichments I have, I mean,

112
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.490
my only move would be to hit play on Carlin. Poor people used to live in slums.

113
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.480
Now the economically disadvantaged occupied substandard housing in the inner

114
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.314
cities

115
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.670
<v 3>there, Bro. Yeah, Bro. They don't have it yet.</v>

116
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.700
<v 0>Negative cash flow position</v>

117
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.510
<v 3>and blow.</v>
