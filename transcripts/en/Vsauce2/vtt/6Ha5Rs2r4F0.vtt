00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:01.999
Vsauce! Kevin here.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Hang on a second.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.120
Ah, man. Ah, now I have to pee.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.680
Wait.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.500
Why do we pee and poop in clean water?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.780
I did disinfect the bowl and refill it because the
toilet could contain harmful bacteria -

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.900
but the water is fine.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.640
So how did artificial rivers
flowing in and out of a tiny artificial pond

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.960
become the most common way to remove waste?
And how does an English poet’s attempt to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.990
sweeten air and an Austrian holocaust survivor's
dirt toilet factor into what a British Medical

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.570
Journal poll revealed to be the most important
health problem of the last 150 years?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Poop.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.660
Humans can either poop in the ground and cover
it with dirt or poop in water and walk away.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.450
We’ve pooped in water by building toilets
over canals like the Romans in 4th century

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.030
BC, building toilets on bridges like the London
Bridge privies in 1382, or using a hanging

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.990
toilet, which is basically a chair at the
end of a dock with a hole in it. Water is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.990
the quickest, easiest way to get poop out
of sight and more importantly to our ancestors,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.030
out of smell.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.659
For much of history, bad smells weren’t
just unpleasant - they were thought to carry

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.420
illness. Before the discovery of germs in
1880, the miasma theory was dominant -- it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.020
held that sickness like Cholera, which is
acquired by drinking water contaminated with

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.640
feces, was actually caused by breathing smelly,
poison air. The word malaria, a disease commonly

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.330
transmitted by mosquitos, comes from the Italian
“mala aria” meaning “bad air.”

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.030
The bad air from dead bodies was thought to
spread the plague. The Black Death killed

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.689
almost a third of Europe in the 14th century.
1348’s Ordinances For Sanitation In A Time

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:14.930
Mortality in Pistoia set strict rules on sealing
dead bodies in coffins and establishing the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.069
specific depth of their burial. During England's
Great Plague in 1665, the Mayor of London

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.379
attempted to prevent plague-ridden stench
from infecting the living by mandating that

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.209
bodies must be buried six feet deep (1,82 meters) .

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.150
Over two hundred years later, in the wake
of pioneering germ research from Louis Pasteur

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.710
and Robert Koch, French biologist Alexandre
Yersin finally found the plague's cause -

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.260
bacterium carried by fleas living on rodents.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.340
Smells don’t carry sickness, but they can signal

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.900
a biological warning to help us avoid something
dangerous.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.800
Pathogens in human feces cause illnesses ranging
from typhoid fever to hookworm, and we believe

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:02.680
the dislike of odors from bodily fluids is
an evolutionary response to avoid disease.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.300
Odor molecules bind to specialized receptors
in the back of the nose located on millions

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:13.449
of olfactory neurons - which go straight to
the brain where they’re deciphered. Fresh

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:19.370
food is typically safe and typically smells
good. Rotten food is often dangerous and often

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.079
smells bad.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.160
And preventing stench and sickness was the
motivation for the john.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.380
The Sir John.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.280
Sir John Harington, an English poet and prominent
member of Queen Elizabeth I’s royal court,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.339
wrote about his flush toilet invention in
1596. But his desire to sweeten the air would

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.159
go unfulfilled for centuries.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.199
One reason his technology was ignored was
that the rich simply had no need for a complicated

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:55.349
toilet - they had servants. The Groom of the
Stool, a job which later gave way to the Lady

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.189
of the Bedchamber, not only disposed of waste
by emptying the chamberpot, but also literally

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.799
wiped their royal butts.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.529
But you don’t have to be royalty to not
want to deal with waste. Individuals generally

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:14.609
leave their waste in the nearest water source,
or a hole in the ground until it becomes someone

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.129
else’s problem…

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.269
which it usually does.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.560
The Tragedy of the Commons is an economic
theory that describes how everyone acting

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.310
in their own self-interest can destroy a resource
used by an entire community. Victorian economist

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.840
William Forster Lloyd coined the term in 1833
to illustrate the problem with cows grazing

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.120
on shared land. If each individual grazed
their cows without limits, they'd eventually

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.140
bring more and more cows until the land became
so overgrazed that no one could use it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.880
Now imagine a city tripling in population
from one to three million people in just half

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.930
a century, with everyone dumping industrial
and human waste into one river. Combine that

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.280
with an unusually hot summer and you get stink.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.020
In London, 1858, it was the Great Stink.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.220
Outbreaks of cholera were blamed on the smell
from the banks of the River Thames. Chancellor

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.540
of the Exchequer Benjamin Disraeli described
the river as, “a Stygian pool, reeking with

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.910
ineffable and intolerable horrors,” and
English physicist Michael Faraday said, "Near

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.340
the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds
so dense that they were visible at the surface."

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.720
Social scientist George Godwin documented
piles of untreated waste on the banks as being

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.660
up to six feet deep.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.920
The average male height
at the time was about 5 foot 4 (1,65 meters).

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.420
The government accepted a proposal from civil
engineer Joseph Bazalgette to build an elaborate

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.580
sewer system that carried waste to six different
outlets, each emptying into the ocean.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.740
It took twenty years to complete, but one hundred
years later, the Thames was declared dead.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.420
After wartime bombing destroyed parts of Bazalgette’s
sewer, the Manchester Guardian described the

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.800
Thames as a "badly managed open sewer," and
in 1957 the Natural History Museum declared

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.580
it biologically dead. Despite resistance to
cleanup, including a member of the House Of

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.560
Lords stating in 1959 that breaking up sewage
gave rivers, “something to do,”

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.620
waste treatment improved

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.640
Advances involved screening
and cleaning the waste before releasing the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.130
filtered water back into waterways -- and
today the Thames once again supports wildlife.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.190
It took nearly three hundred years, improvements
in civil engineering and a public disaster

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.150
for Sir John Harington’s flushable toilet
to be widely adopted. And now the water in

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.720
toilet is the same water that comes from the
tap. Which, in many areas is perfectly drinkable.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.780
The end.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.140
But wait. Billions of people lack access to
flush toilets. And whether the ground is too

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.850
frozen, the land is too dry, or a community
is too poverty-stricken, complex water sewage

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.350
systems don’t exist in much of the world.
1.8 billion suffer every year from ingesting

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.480
water contaminated with waste.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.500
Flying toilets are used in the slums of Kenya
and Haiti. They’re plastic bags used as

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.540
toilets and then flung as far as the user
can throw them. Hitting people, piling on

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.510
roofs and bursting open when they hit the
ground - clogging drainage systems and contaminating

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.340
water. In India, where more people have cell
phones than access to a toilet, newly-installed

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.530
toilets are often ignored because of taboos
regarding cleaning them out. The government

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.280
and World Bank developed a “No toilet, no
bride” campaign to influence families to

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.790
have a proper toilet before getting married.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.940
The future of poop requires a paradigm shift,
described by American physicist Thomas Kuhn

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.060
as a fundamental change in the basic concepts
of a scientific discipline. While spiderwebs

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.700
of water pipes pushing waste for centralized
processing was rated the greatest medical

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:16.139
advance in 150 years - Friedensreich Hundertwasser
advocated for a different approach. His solution

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.260
was pooping kinda like cats.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.370
Litter boxes play on a cat's natural instinct
to defecate in soft, sandy soil by making

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.950
a cat toilet out of moisture and odor-absorbing
material. But instead of throwing the waste

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:35.419
away like owners do with cats, Austrian painter
and architect Hundertwasser’s wanted human

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.559
poop to return to its natural purpose.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:43.529
The humus toilet is a composting toilet that
works by having a layer of humus, at the bottom

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:48.970
of a bucket and then scooping some fresh humus
on top of the poop after each use. With no

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.579
bad smell, Sir John Harington would approve.
A double bottom allows for air flow and a

00:08:54.579 --> 00:09:00.019
drip-trough and eventually the contents during
turn into fertilizer called humanure.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:06.370
The word human actually derives from the latin
word humus meaning earth and ground and humanus

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.579
meaning man. And the humus toilet, according
to Hundertwasser, represented a direct cycle

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:18.589
of life between people and planet. His concern
was that flush toilets divorce humanity from

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:25.139
a basic circle of life - with waste turning
into fertilizer for plant life. The death

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:31.629
of food becomes the birth of vegetation. Saying,
“What comes out of us is not waste, but

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:37.779
the building block of the world…” And
while poop might not exactly be Lego, it was

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.759
worth some money.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:44.509
Human excrement entering sewer systems was
actually opposed in mid-19th century France

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:49.720
by night soil collectors. Named because they
did their dirty work at night, they didn’t

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.649
want to lose their job gathering and selling
poop to be made into fertilizer and pee to

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:57.910
be made into the saltpeter used for gunpowder.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:03.779
Companies around the world are starting to
see the dollar signs in doody. Utilizing waste

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.819
from urban sewage treatment facilities is
gaining steam as technology advances for turning

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:15.459
biosolids into fuel and energy. And toilet
reinventions are underway, including a solar

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:21.519
toilet from the California Institute of Technology
that generates hydrogen and electricity, and

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:27.209
the Cranfield nano membrane toilet which separates
and cleans water from waste. The leftover

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:33.420
is covered in wax to seal pathogens and help
it dry out to be later used for energy.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:39.600
Waxy poop balls might not be the direct cycle
Hundertwasser desired, but toilet reinventions

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.389
represent the unique marriage between humanity
and the planet -- the engineering of Sir John

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:50.089
Harington with the ecological philosophy of
Hundertwasser.

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:55.031
A direct theme of Hundertwasser’s work
was his rejection of straight lines. Preferring

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.149
spirals and squiggles, he believed straight
lines were a human construct that separated

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:05.809
us from nature -- and a straight line was
the design flaw in Harington’s toilet.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.360
A straight pipe allowed gas to rise up directly
into the water closet from below. Alexander

00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:18.949
Cumming invented the S-trap in 1775, which
allowed standing water to block the foul air.

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:23.369
A squiggly line perfected Harington’s toilet.

00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:28.779
But Hundertwasser cared about people and improving
the most basic parts of their lives, saying,

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:34.819
“I want to make people happy. Not depressed.
I don’t want to burden them with more problems

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:41.329
-- they already have enough." He knew problems,
having survived the Holocaust when at least

00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:46.470
69 of his family didn't -- and thought that
returning to a state of beauty in our interactions

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.180
with nature would ensure our survival.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:56.569
Hundertwasser believed in the Earth’s cycle
so strongly he used himself as fertilizer.

00:11:56.569 --> 00:12:01.809
When he died of congestive heart failure in
2000, he was buried without a coffin, under

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:09.729
a tulip tree only two feet deep. No one visits
his grave - they visit his tree.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.980
Friedensreich Hundertwasser’s circle is complete.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:20.920
And through this perspective of death and
rebirth, we re-invent our waste and our bodies

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:29.600
- sewage becomes energy, and we become a forest
of the living dead.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.040
And as always

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.600
thanks for watching.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.220
Special thanks to Neil Bromhall for the stoning nature footage.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.000
And a extra special thanks to everyone at The Hundertwasser Foundation.
