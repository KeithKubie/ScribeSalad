00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:08.370
ALLEN LO: All right.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.180
Well, thank you.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.430
Welcome, all of you who are
here in the room and those

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.550
of you who are joining
us on live stream.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.810
This is part of
AAPI Heritage Month.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.570
AGN is happy to host today's
panel called AAPI in the Public

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
Eye, White House Commissioners
on Civic Engagement.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.630
So welcome to all of you here.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.390
We'll have some time at
the end for questions.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.400
So think of your questions
now, giving you a fair warning.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.360
I'll basically ask some
questions of the panel

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.760
as we go along here.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.940
But we'll make sure to have
questions here at the end.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.870
I'm Allen Lo.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.030
I'm in the legal
department here at Google.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.580
Let me introduce the
panelists for you.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.020
Sitting immediately to my
left is Lorna May Ho Randlett.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.580
She currently serves on
the commission for WHIAAPI,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.920
which is the White House
Initiative on Asian American

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.320
Pacific and Pacific Islanders.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.190
She previously was a
communications specialist

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.980
and reach and relevance
external relations manager

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.280
at McKinsey, where she
represented McKinsey's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.590
global semiconductor practice.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.770
But more recently, she founded
a nonprofit organization

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.980
called the Leaders
Forum that helps,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.710
in particular,
Asian leaders make

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550
the transition from government
into private practice and vice

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.050
versa.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.950
So maybe Lorna can talk
about that some more

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.360
during the panel.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.000
Sitting next to
her is Bill Imada.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.520
Bill serves also on the
commission, the WHIAAPI

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.720
commission.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.350
He's the founder, chairman,
and chief connectivity officer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.850
for IW Group.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.370
You have to tell us
what that means as well.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.580
IW Group is a minority-owned
and operated advertising,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.940
marketing, and communications
agency focusing on the growing

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.250
multicultural markets.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.180
Sitting next to Bill
is Kathy Ko Chin.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.474
She's a former
commissioner of WHIAAPI.

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:07.890
So we've got the two current
commissioners sitting closest

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.050
to me, and we've put
the former commissioners

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.060
a little further away.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.820
She currently serves as a
president and CEO of the Asian

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.440
and Pacific Islander
American Health

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.440
Forum, which is a position
she's held since 2010.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.040
And before that, she has
been in a number of positions

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.890
in the health care space.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.620
She was the program director
for the Community Clinics

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.260
Initiative, which is a
joint project of Tides

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.480
and the California Endowment.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.200
And then sitting next to
Kathy is Dr. Tung Van Nguyen.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.200
He was a former chairperson
of the commission,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.760
of the WHIAAPI commission.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.990
He's a professor of medicine
at UC San Francisco, where

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.750
he provides medical care to
a diverse patient population

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.940
and teaches clinicians.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.130
And so you've got,
basically, folks here

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.250
who've been on the commission,
who are on the commission.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.990
And so we should just
actually jump into that.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.750
So let's talk about
WHIAAPI, especially

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.570
for those who may not
be familiar with it.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.350
What is WHIAAPI?

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.299
And what does it do?

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:06.840
I don't know.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.670
Who wants to take that one?

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.110
KATHY KO CHIN: Former chair.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.070
Former chair.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.579
TUNG NGUYEN: Yeah,
there's a lot--

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.120
can you hear?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.500
ALLEN LO: Yeah.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500
TUNG NGUYEN: There's a
lot to say about WHIAAPI.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.290
But most importantly, it is a--

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.880
obviously, is in
the White House.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.940
And it is responsible
for, basically,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.520
engaging the Asian-American
Pacific Islander community

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.610
and also making sure that issues
related to the AAPI communities

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.210
are represented and addressed
by the federal government.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.870
Historically, it was created
under President Clinton,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.320
and has been renewed under
every president since.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.880
We were appointed
by President Obama.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.930
That's the short history.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.471
Maybe there are a
couple other things

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:49.644
you might want to mention.

00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:52.026
LORNA RANDLETT: No,
I think that's good.

00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:52.526
Yeah, sorry.

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:53.026
Go ahead.

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:57.520
KATHY KO CHIN: Well, I think
the really wonderful thing

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.525
about serving on the
commission is that they--

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:03.220
there are 20
commissioners, or it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.710
can be authorized for
up to 20 commissioners.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.050
And we came from all
over the country.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.030
And each person
represented a variety

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.860
of either their geography, their
ethnicity, the area of the work

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.000
that they did, but
collectively really were

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.790
the eyes and the ears
of the White House

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.480
into the community to make sure
that we could understand what

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.090
communities were facing
and then bring that back

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.260
to the White House.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.610
ALLEN LO: Great.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.630
And so Kathy and
Tung, you guys decided

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.610
after Trump was elected to
step down from the commission.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.920
Can you talk about
your decision,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.970
why you made that decision, how
you arrived at that decision?

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.680
And then for, I guess, Bill
and Lorna, you decided to stay.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.270
So maybe, Bill and
Lorna, you can talk

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.347
about why you decided to stay.

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.930
KATHY KO CHIN: Should I go first
and then I'll give it to you?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.630
So in my job, the Asian and
Pacific Islander American

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.940
Health Forum, we are
the nation's advocates

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.530
for Asian-Americans,
native Hawaiians,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.390
and Pacific Islanders on health.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.400
And so our job is to actually
hold government accountable.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.250
Our job is to push on
the federal government

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.100
to make sure that
health services are

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.840
as accessible as possible.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.400
And I really felt
that it was going

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.250
to be more advantageous
for our work

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.000
to be able to have a
little bit more separation

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.700
between the administration and
the work that we had to do.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.190
TUNG NGUYEN: I joined
the commission mainly

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.300
because I wanted to
help our community.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.557
And I felt that, at that
point, I wasn't able to.

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.140
I think that there
are reasons to stay

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.306
and there are reasons to go.

00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:52.440
But I think, on the
balance, it felt

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.810
like I wasn't going to be
able to do enough to do that.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.420
And also, a large number
of our commissioners

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.190
also wanted to leave.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.920
And I wanted to make sure that
I could support them as well.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.660
But having said that, I really--

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.910
one of the cool things about
serving in the commission

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.490
is the diverse points of
view and diverse approaches

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.930
to solving problems.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.240
So it was totally
understandable that some of us

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.870
thought that we would solve
the problems by leaving

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.150
and some of us would solve
the problems by staying.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.400
And I think, in a way, that's
what's really important,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.630
is that even when we
disagree on the approach,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.500
we actually need
different approaches.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.610
LORNA RANDLETT: So I am so
grateful that Tung gave me

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.580
that very kind lead-in into
why some of us decided to stay.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.400
I personally decided
to stay because I

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.560
felt like I was appointed for--

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.067
by a president for a term.

00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:46.400
And I thought it was important
to honor that term, which

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.370
is until the end of September.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.790
In addition to that, I
also felt that our chair--

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.390
not our chair, but our chair
within the administration, who

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.170
is the Surgeon General, decided
that he was going to stay on.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.900
And I felt that, given
the fact that we had staff

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.000
as well at the White House,
that it was important

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.520
that there was some leadership
within the commissioners

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.050
to stay, to be able to try
to impact the process even

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.420
within the new administration
on behalf of AAPIs

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.700
as best as we possibly could.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.020
BILL IMADA: So for me, when
President Trump was elected,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.180
it was really difficult
to have that conversation.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.420
And I have to speak as a
private citizen and not

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.200
as a commissioner.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.770
So I wanted to just put
that out there right away.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.140
I was working on a fraud case.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.760
There was a young
Asian-American woman

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.690
in Los Angeles who was scammed.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.340
And the federal
government was pursuing

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.630
a case against the scammer.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.900
And because that case was
pending, if all of us resigned,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.600
then this woman would not have
had counsel going forward.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.010
So we had just
started the effort

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.870
to look into the scammer.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.370
We were making some headway.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.670
This person was really
traumatized by being scammed.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.870
She lost her identity.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.650
She lost her ability
to do business.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.070
She was getting all
sorts of charges

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.160
all around the world
to her credit card.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.940
And I said, I think
I have to stay.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.470
We're focusing on bullying.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.140
Bullying is a terrible
problem in our community.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.430
And WHIAAPI has done
so much to make sure

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.950
that Asian-Americans and Pacific
Islanders are not bullied,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.710
and people of different
religious beliefs,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.550
like Muslims, that I did not
think that we should leave

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.919
without making sure
that we at least try

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.390
to have a proper hand-off
on that bullying discussion.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.140
And then we also had
staff, as Lorna said.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.169
We had a number of people
that were career staff.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.420
And if the entire
commission resigned,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.930
then there would be no
reason to have a staff.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.610
And so I felt some
obligation to stay in hope

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.560
that, when the new
administration came

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.140
on board, that we would
be able to at least save

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.600
some of the great work that
we had completed in WHIAAPI,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.610
including the anti-bullying
work, including

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.600
our work around DACA,
the Affordable Care Act,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.550
as well as all the
things that we were doing

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.760
to help keep government
accessible for Asian-Americans

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.510
and Pacific Islanders.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.085
ALLEN LO: So with
the resignations,

00:09:16.085 --> 00:09:18.680
there are how many commissioners
now that are still there?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.215
Is it four?

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:20.040
There's four commissioners--

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.540
LORNA RANDLETT: Four of us.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.890
ALLEN LO: --out of the 20?

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.890
LORNA RANDLETT: Correct.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.365
ALLEN LO: So there were 16 that
resigned, and four stayed on.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.740
Looking backwards,
what would you

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.020
say were some of the
proudest achievements

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.350
that you've accomplished over
the last couple of years?

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.951
LORNA RANDLETT: I would
have to concur with Bill.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.450
And I guess I should
say that I have

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.120
to speak on behalf of-- as
a private citizen as well,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.325
even though I suppose we
can talk about that work.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.340
I think that the anti-bullying
work was really important

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.450
for us, because I think that
one of the things that we share

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.330
across cultures is looking
to the next generation

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.370
and making the path
easier or better for them.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.220
And so focusing on
trying to make sure

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.770
that young people felt
like they were going

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.900
to be able to pursue
the American Dream

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.990
and not have these
barriers and anything

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.670
we could do in that
regard is probably

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.440
among the proudest
accomplishments.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.120
I specifically worked on
cultivating the business

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.800
community, because I think that
when you talk about where--

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.660
frankly, a lot of Asians
have had a lot of success

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.300
that is actually recognized
by the entire country, right?

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.840
I mean, you obviously have
a South-Asian CEO, right?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.370
Took up Microsoft,
Pepsi, whatever,

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.770
you name it, Mastercard, right?

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.020
So I thought that it
was important to bring

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.841
that conversation and
those accomplishments

00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:46.340
into the forefront so we could
be dealing with our community

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.169
from a position of strength.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:50.210
BILL IMADA: I don't want
to take the thunder away

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.585
from these two, so I'm going
to focus on one that I think

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.689
is amazing, is
part of our job is

00:10:54.689 --> 00:10:56.480
to make sure that the
federal government is

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.420
accessible to Asian-Americans
and Pacific Islanders.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.350
And WHIAAPI and staff pulled
together federal agencies

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.310
from all around the country, I
mean, from Alaska to Florida,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.560
from the island areas all the
way up to Maine, to California,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.020
and brought them together--

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.910
Department of Labor,
Department of Commerce,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.402
Department of
Education, CIA, SBA,

00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:22.610
I mean, all these really
important federal agencies--

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.270
and got them to sit down
together to find solutions

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.610
for Asian-Americans
and Pacific Islanders

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.840
to make sure that government
is accessible and works

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.004
for the people that they're
supposed to work for.

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:38.420
And so I thought that was one
of the proudest achievements

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.790
for WHIAAPI, is pulling
together all these agencies

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.970
and getting them to work
together to solve problems

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.629
in our community.

00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:48.670
KATHY KO CHIN: One of the
areas that I had worked

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.770
on as a commissioner was DACA.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.390
And so I appreciate, Bill,
that you raised that.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.180
The Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.530
is for the dreamers, right?

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.210
So the young people who
came as children, that

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.200
were undocumented.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.890
And President Obama had
provided the DACA program.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:06.835
There are a lot.

00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:09.610
There's something
estimated like two million

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.300
DACA-eligible people in
our Asian-Pacific Islander

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.800
community.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.290
The enrollment has
been a lot lower

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.290
than in other
communities, but I really

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.120
felt that WHIAAPI
and the commissioners

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.370
played an important role in
doing outreach and really

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.980
trying to understand
what were the barriers

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.050
and challenges in our
community, but also

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.960
how to make sure that
our communities knew

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.090
that this opportunity
was available.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.530
TUNG NGUYEN: I
have a lot to say,

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.946
so I want to try
to make it quick.

00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:40.400
So for number one, Affordable
Care Act and enrollment

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.090
of Asian-Americans, both in
terms of getting the act passed

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.290
and in terms of engaging.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.211
And Kathy is too modest to
talk about her work in getting

00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:49.210
Asian-American to sign--

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.110
Asian-American and
Pacific Islander

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.800
to sign up to get health care.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.250
So up to two million
Asian-Americans benefited.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.130
So we felt that was a huge
win for our community.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.110
Disaggregated data--
so we were a big--

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.812
everyone knows that
Asian-Americans and Pacific

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:08.020
Islanders, on the outside,
looks like it's one group.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.500
But on the inside,
everyone knows that there's

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.640
a lot of different groups.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.444
And each of those groups wants
to see data about themselves.

00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:15.860
And federal
government is probably

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.800
the only agency that's actually
going to be able to do that.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.100
So we fought very hard to get
disaggregated data collected,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.730
and of any time
when it is possible.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.900
And we can talk about
how that's gone.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.210
We had some successes.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.630
We still have a long way to go.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.460
Regional connections--
so not only

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.340
did we convene all
these great agencies

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.000
in Washington DC at
the national level,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.670
we also knew that
Asian-Americans a lot of times

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.900
can't go to Washington DC.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.550
But they needed to interact
with the federal government

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.510
where they lived.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.760
And so we were able to create
these so-called regional

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.790
networks where we linked
Asian-Americans communities

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.730
to 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 different
federal government

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.160
agencies in their area
so that they can actually

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.000
address any local issues.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.317
I think those are probably
the biggest thing.

00:14:01.317 --> 00:14:02.900
I had one other
thing, which I forgot.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.370
But I'll come back to it.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.330
ALLEN LO: Great.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.210
So let's pivot a little bit to--

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.310
away from WHIAAPI
specifically, and talk more

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.290
generally about Asian relations
here in the United States

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.820
today.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.450
When we look at over the last
100 years in the United States,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.090
the ways Asians have been
perceived and treated

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.345
has evolved over time.

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:26.345
And it depends on the
time and the circumstance.

00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:28.920
So if you look
100-plus years ago,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.170
there was the Yellow Peril and
legislation to keep Asians out.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.810
You had World War II and
you had internment camps

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.430
and the treatment of
Japanese during World War II.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.390
More currently, you've got the
image of the model minority

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.110
for Asians.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.690
Tung, you mentioned
disaggregation of data.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.660
It was, I think, 1980 where
the census started counting

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.280
Asian-Americans as a class.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.760
And as you mentioned,
I mean, there

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.900
are many different
subclasses within this class.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.140
But oftentimes, we're
lumped together.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.850
And maybe-- the term sometimes
is used is we're racialized.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.190
And given today, where we're
at today with the Trump

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.010
administration, with
various events that

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.410
have happened recently--

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.670
you have the United
Airlines incident.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.520
You've got different--
the Airbnb--

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.690
there's been some press
about owners not wanting

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.610
to rant to Asians.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.540
Where are we today?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.730
How are Asians perceived today?

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.842
How are they being
racialized today?

00:15:34.842 --> 00:15:36.800
LORNA RANDLETT: Well,
I'll tackle that question

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.961
by just saying I think it
depends on where you sit,

00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:40.460
right?

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.320
Where you are socioeconomically,
what part of the country that

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.950
you live in on how you
would answer that question .

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:54.740
What I will tell you is
someone recently told me--

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.900
with a Latino Victory Fund--

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.480
a saying that he had heard that
one of his mentors told him,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.185
which said, if you are not--

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.700
if you are not part
of the restaurant,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.440
you are on the menu.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.310
And that was his way
of saying regardless

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.850
of where we sit in the
country, unequivocally

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.660
the country looks at us
in one category in terms

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.540
of the federal
government and how they

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.260
fund programs and the like.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:31.160
And it behooves us to really
try to, at some point,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.280
collaborate and work
on that power together.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.130
Because frankly, in
a lot of situations,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.360
including when you talk about
the government in our country--

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.774
at least as it relates to
the political process--

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.440
there are two things
that really matter.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.120
It's money, and it's votes.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.040
And unless we're bringing
our money together,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.498
we're bringing our
votes together--

00:16:50.498 --> 00:16:52.610
and this is just
my perspective--

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.110
we are not going to get closer
to actually achieving the power

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.390
that I think Asian-Americans
deserve rightfully so

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.090
as an economic engine
in this country.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.278
So that's my perspective.

00:17:05.278 --> 00:17:07.069
BILL IMADA: I just want
to say that there's

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.020
a scholar over at
Columbia University.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.000
Her name is Vishakha Desai.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.940
She used to lead the Asian
Society here in the States,

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.900
in New York.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.130
And she once said that being
labeled a model minority

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.770
makes us invisible.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.200
And what's going to be very
important for all of you

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.569
in the audience, for
each of us is that we

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.550
need to stand up for ourselves.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.660
And we need to be better
about speaking up,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.040
even for someone like Allen.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.470
If something
happens to Allen, we

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.330
want to make sure that
everyone at Google

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.130
knows how important
someone like him is.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.360
And I have to tell
you, because we

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.520
are viewed as this
model minority that

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.090
gets along with everyone and
doesn't want to rock the boat.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:57.240
We've seen 96 Asian-American
executives lose their jobs

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.490
in less than five years at
major Fortune 500 companies.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.320
If it was a Latino
executive and this

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.200
happened at one of the
television stations, one of--

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.630
an Asian-American who
became president of NBC

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.240
lost his job in six months.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.610
It's the first time an
Asian-American has ever

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.910
ascended to that role,
and he loses his job.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.100
A Latina, who is a lower-level,
lower-ranking person

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.190
at the same station,
loses their job.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:33.040
1,000 people wrote
letters for her.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.610
Three people wrote letters
for Asian-Americans.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.730
Now, going back to Airbnb, one
place where Asian-Americans

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.160
excel-- and I don't want to
perpetuate too many myths

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.610
and stereotypes, is that we
are early adopters of online,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.630
so it just is safer for us
to criticize Airbnb when

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.710
that woman was denied housing
in Big Bear, of all places,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.870
in Southern California.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.920
But I do think that we have to
go beyond speaking out online.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.770
We have to step up and
say, this is unacceptable.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.060
And we as Asian Americans need
to be treated respectfully.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.060
We are not perpetual foreigners.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.590
We have a voice.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.660
And I'm going to
stand by this person.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.160
I'm going to stand by Allen.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.650
I'm going to stand by other
executives in the company.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.967
I'm going to stand
by community leaders.

00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:21.550
Because we're a part
of this community

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.770
and we're all Americans and
we all value the same thing.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.550
So in order for us to
get beyond some of this,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.100
we've got to get
people to be activized

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.030
not only in communities, but in
corporations and in businesses.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.030
KATHY KO CHIN: So you
asked the question, Allen,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.120
about being
racialized as a group.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.404
And I heard that you heard
from Buck Gee last week

00:19:42.404 --> 00:19:43.320
or a couple weeks ago.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.960
So Buck and I have a
connection that both of us

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.260
have been a former board chair
of the Angel Island Immigration

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.850
Station Foundation.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.260
And so that was where the
Chinese Exclusion Act was

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.270
enforced in the United States.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.290
And the Chinese Exclusion Act--
so this was adopted in 1882--

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.610
was the first racialized,
racially-focused exclusionary

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.950
law by Congress.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.950
So really, if we think
back over the last 100,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:16.080
150 years, our identity
as Asian-Americans

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.750
has always been
racialized, and in fact has

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:26.040
been connected to
detention, deportation, more

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.470
militarized enforcement
of all kinds.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.060
So it's not something new to
think about being racialized.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.319
In fact, that's been, really,
our history from excluding us

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.860
from coming into
the country and then

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.850
how we're treated once we're in
the country or even citizens.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.980
The other thing that I
think is really important

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.560
about this tension,
I think, at least I

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.180
feel when I speak
around the country,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.430
around this concept
of aggregation

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.990
versus disaggregation.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.760
So the importance
of disaggregation

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.260
is because that's
the only way we're

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.620
going to be able to identify
the challenges and disparities

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.070
that our communities experience,
while at the same time exactly

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.750
what Lorna said about
aggregating our power.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.290
Whether it's buying
power or political power,

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.800
it is really critical.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.630
So we have to somehow
transcend our individual ethnic

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.520
identities or any challenges
that we have with each other

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.700
by specific
ethnicities, recognizing

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.030
that some folks from different
countries-- their countries

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.650
may have been at war with each
other for hundreds of years,

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.214
right?

00:21:27.214 --> 00:21:29.130
So just because you come
to the United States,

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.680
doesn't mean all of a sudden
you can hold hands with somebody

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.750
who you've had
border issues with,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.150
or border conflict
for hundreds of years.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.860
But the issue around economic
power and political power

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.930
requires us to transcend that.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.900
At the same time, when we
think of disaggregated data--

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.650
and I'll thank you, Tung,
for your compliment.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.250
When it came time to do
enrollment for the Affordable

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.240
Care Act, we knew that, in
our community, because we're

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.842
one third limited
English proficient,

00:21:59.842 --> 00:22:01.300
we were trying to
figure out, well,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.360
how are we going to
best enroll people?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.240
So at the Health Forum, we
were able to take the data--

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.120
which if you just collapsed
everybody together,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.150
Asian-Americans actually had
the highest rates of insurance,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.080
meaning if you just looked
at the lumped-together data,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.940
it meant we didn't really
have an uninsurance problem.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.980
But when we were able
to literally look

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.260
at it in this
disaggregated fashion,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.430
Koreans actually had the highest
rates of uninsurance at 23%--

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.620
highest of anyone in
the whole country--

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.070
then 18% Bangladeshi,
17% Pakistani.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.830
And so then we were able to
really focus our enrollment

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.550
efforts.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.920
And then AAPIs had the
biggest enrollment rates.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.960
And now, after four rounds,
we have the greatest coverage

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.390
of any racial minority
in the country.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.120
But it's only because we
could really focus in on that

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.140
and understand that it was--

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.880
there are differences
by ethnicity.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.410
TUNG NGUYEN: So I'm going to
take a slightly different tact.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.805
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about philosophy,

00:23:00.805 --> 00:23:03.280
little bit about history, and
a little bit about politics.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.380
So the idea that we get
to define our own identity

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.910
is a very American idea, right?

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.940
You get to decide
who you want to be.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.800
And whether or not
you identify yourself

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.006
as even an Asian-Americans
is up to you, right?

00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:19.130
I mean, there are a lot of
Asians walking out there

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.326
who are saying, I'm not Asian.

00:23:21.326 --> 00:23:23.700
And then if you choose to
identify yourself as Vietnamese

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.230
or Chinese or whatever.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.450
But what's happening in
this country is pretty--

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.060
if you're not paying
attention, your identity's

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.860
also defined by
other people, right?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.510
I mean, how they
treat you, right?

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.530
So if you go back to the bamboo
ceiling idea, for example,

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.030
a lot of young
people don't realize

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.946
that their identity is
defined by other people

00:23:40.946 --> 00:23:42.600
until they rise up in the ranks.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.100
And all of a sudden
something happens to them,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.433
and they're like, what happened?

00:23:45.433 --> 00:23:48.480
I thought I had total
control over my destiny,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.890
and now I'm not, right?

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.090
Is it your name?

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.320
Is it the way you talk?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.870
Is it the way they
expect you to act?

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.975
Right?

00:23:56.975 --> 00:23:59.310
The thing about the history
that's happening right now

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.350
is you can't run away
from that anymore.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.590
The way this country
is right now,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.630
you have to be not
paying attention

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.250
to think that your identity
doesn't matter to other people.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.940
People are being killed
because they're Asian.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.320
There are brown Asian engineers.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.870
I mean, people like
a lot of you just

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.210
got killed in Kansas
or in other places.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.180
There was actually
a rash of killings.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.070
There was a South-Asian doctor
who was killed, I think,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.690
in Michigan.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.300
These things are real.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.260
It doesn't matter
what you think.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.950
It's what other
people think as well.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.720
So I mean, I just wanted
to at least reflect that.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.291
But historically, that is
actually not new, right?

00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:37.290
So that's the other
important thing to remember,

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.090
is this is not something
that happened with the Trump

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:39.715
administration.

00:24:39.715 --> 00:24:41.380
If anything, the
Trump administrations

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.830
allow it to be
much more explicit.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.696
It's always been there.

00:24:45.696 --> 00:24:47.820
How many of you here actually
are either immigrants

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.700
or parents were immigrants?

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.450
Yeah, none of you
would be here if it

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.950
weren't for the Immigration
Naturalization Act of 1965, OK?

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.687
Back then, before that, the
number of Chinese or Asians

00:24:58.687 --> 00:25:00.270
or whatever can come
into this country

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.520
were numbered in the hundreds.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.852
They were a quota, OK, of how
many Chinese, for example,

00:25:04.852 --> 00:25:06.060
could come into this country.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.000
Hundreds.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.500
All right?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.310
After the act, thousands and
thousands of people came.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.900
And it's great, right?

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.950
But we forget that.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.170
We forget the fact that
we are Asian-Americans

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.790
or we are Chinese or Vietnamese.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.460
And we are not here
if other people didn't

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.710
fight for us for us to be here.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.780
And now that we're
here, we need to fight

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.120
for ourselves, but also
for other people as well.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.495
So that's my
perspective on that.

00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:30.995
BILL IMADA: Totally
agree with that.

00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:33.270
LORNA RANDLETT: Tung, can
I add one quick thing?

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.020
And I'm so grateful that I saw
part of the Chinese Exclusion

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.510
Act movie that's
coming up on PBS.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.840
So please look out for that
one when it happens at an event

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.350
that Bill had in Washington DC.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.570
But I will tell you that,
even currently, when

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.490
you look at some
"immigration reforms," quote,

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.800
unquote that the
administration currently

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.320
is looking to put
forth, there are

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.740
pieces in it like the exclusion
of family members coming over.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.100
To be clear, that hails back
to the Chinese Exclusion Act

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.230
when they tried to
limit women coming.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.170
Because they understand,
right, the powers

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.210
that be who want
to hold Asians back

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.110
understand that if they limit
your family from coming,

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.110
then some people
won't have childcare

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.480
or they won't have
other ways in which

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.500
to support their families, which
then limits the effectiveness.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.272
It may limit the choice on how
many children, for example,

00:26:31.272 --> 00:26:32.730
someone who comes
here might decide

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.994
to have because they don't
have their parents coming

00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:36.660
to help them with
their families, right?

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.310
So don't misunderstand that
even though you live now,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.600
in this age, that there are
not still forces at work

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.590
that are trying to limit us as
Asian-Americans, as a people,

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.212
from thriving here and
growing our numbers.

00:26:52.212 --> 00:26:54.420
And the reason they don't
want us to grow our numbers

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.950
is, again, as I said,
when there's more numbers,

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.814
there is more power.

00:26:59.814 --> 00:27:01.980
BILL IMADA: I did want to
say that we should also be

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.271
better about telling our story.

00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:05.640
Of course, we've got
a lot of disparities

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.620
in our community,
health care disparities,

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.910
economic disparities.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.940
But we should also be a little
bit more proud about what

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.220
we have accomplished.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.390
And not wanting to completely
perpetuate this model minority

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.820
myth, I do think that
we need to be louder

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.710
about our accomplishments.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.650
I mean, our population
in the US is bigger

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.880
than 46 out of 50 states.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.530
We are helping to create
and fuel brand new jobs.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.500
If we were collectively
put on an island together,

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.980
we would be the 18th
economic power in the world.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.230
And Turkey currently
holds that seat.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:46.310
73 million Turks is only
20 million Asian-Americans.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.620
So I do think we should
be better about telling

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.770
our story, the positive things.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.510
But we also can't
forget where we're from,

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.180
and realize that lots of
other people are struggling.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.860
So I want to see a little
better storytelling,

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.750
each of you telling
your own unique stories,

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.930
but also telling the
Asian-American story, that we

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.650
are contributing
to this country.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.810
We are taxpayers.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.440
We're building businesses.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.050
We are an economic force.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.520
And we're also
tipping the balance

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.280
in elections in key states
like Nevada and Virginia.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.680
So I do think we
should be better

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.170
about telling our stories.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.490
ALLEN LO: So let me
follow up on that.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.230
So we should be better.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.080
But what you're really
saying, without saying it,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.670
is that we're not
that good at it.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:29.930
We're not working together.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.210
We're not using the
power of our voice.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.960
Why aren't more AAPIs getting
involved in civic action?

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.117
What's our problem?

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:41.562
BILL IMADA: That's an entire
conversation all to itself.

00:28:41.562 --> 00:28:46.410
TUNG NGUYEN: Well, I
think there is some--

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.190
I don't want to
stereotype us, but there

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.070
are some cultural
ideas that we shouldn't

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.150
stand up and say things.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.660
There's some classic saying
like the nail that sticks up

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.450
gets nailed down.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.030
Also, a lot of us
come from countries

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.780
where, if you stood
up and said something,

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.679
you'd get killed or put in jail.

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:06.220
I mean, my parents don't want
to talk anything about politics

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.020
ever, or because their
friends got put in jail.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.160
So I think there are good
reasons that we don't stand up.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.400
I think, though, this country
works on whether or not

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.259
you stand up or not.

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:19.800
So if you don't
stand up, then you're

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.810
not going to get
anything you need.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.960
Or maybe not for yourself, but
maybe also for your community,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.420
which is actually the more
important part, I think.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.810
So I don't think we
are very good at that.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.130
There are a lot of divisions.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.320
Within, say, the Vietnamese
community, for example,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.903
there are lots of
political divisions.

00:29:35.903 --> 00:29:39.060
So even to stand up, to speak up
in that community is difficult.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.430
And then there are divisions
within AAPIs, right?

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.560
So Chinese versus
Vietnamese, for example,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:50.260
would be one idea, or Pakistani
and India, for example.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.830
So there's a lot of
fault lines that we

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.010
need to understand how to
navigate before we can even

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.240
talk about it.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.580
But what I think is important
is, rather than look

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.520
at our culture and
where we came from,

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.930
is what common
values do we have.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.810
And if you look at
the common values

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.510
that I think a
lot of AAPIs have,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.490
you will find the source
where you can find the goals

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.460
that you need to reach.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.990
So for example, I would
say immigrants rights.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.604
I'm kind of surprised if
you're Asian and don't

00:30:21.604 --> 00:30:22.770
believe in immigrant rights.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.103
Because like I said, if it
weren't for immigrant rights,

00:30:25.103 --> 00:30:27.360
none of you would be here.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.130
KATHY KO CHIN: Yeah,
and just to follow up

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.120
on that, 2/3 of the AAPI
community are immigrant,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.410
and then one third are
limited English proficient.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.370
So immigration is a
huge common issue.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.200
The other thing, just to
cite some statistics--

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.690
so the AAPI community has the
highest rates of citizenship

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.500
naturalization of all
immigrant populations,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.120
but we have among the lowest--

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.410
of those citizens, we have
among the lowest that vote.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.010
So that gap.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.510
I think, is where-- as we're
talking about civic engagement,

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.110
I think, is where
there is a lot of room

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.710
for people to get involved.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.980
And so even if it's
not rocking the boat

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.020
or there's some cultural
barriers, at least

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:18.060
going to the ballot to vote is a
really, really important thing.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.170
There was just released
this 2016 post-election

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.300
national Asian-American survey.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.930
I think Tiffany has the link.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.430
And so we can share
that with people

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.471
if people are interested.

00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:31.710
And then I'm happy to have
people take a look at this one.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.350
What is really interesting
is the interests

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.945
of communities around
education and health

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:38.550
care and immigration.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.410
But the challenge
still is how to get

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.980
people to register to vote, and
then actually get out the vote.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.970
There are also some
structural issues on that.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.270
So in my organization, we do a
lot of civic engagement work.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.089
We're a nonprofit organization.

00:31:51.089 --> 00:31:53.130
So everything we do in
the civic engagement space

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.940
is nonpartisan.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.240
We do nonpartisan
voter registration

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.740
as well as get out the vote.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.470
And what we've been
able to do is--

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.420
because of the language issues--

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.340
develop what we call
the power boost,

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.020
a cross-state,
in-language phone banking

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.080
system, where we
select, let's say,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:18.690
five key races in any given
election, or key locations,

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.170
and then we'll try to
match the languages that

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.560
are available for phone
banking to that population.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.430
And what we found in three
cycles is we've had cases of--

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.350
there's this one woman,
Vietnamese woman.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.400
She'd been a citizen
for 20 years.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.890
She voted every year.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.350
But it was the first
time anyone ever

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.440
called her to ask her
if she was registered

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.520
to vote and to remind
her to get out the vote.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.100
There's an issue of, we need
to get our communities out

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.040
to vote.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.310
But we also see that
there's a failure

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.760
in the current political
system to really engage

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.257
our communities in the vote.

00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:57.840
So I think there's
a lot of work to be

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.700
done in the whole
civic engagement arena.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.380
BILL IMADA: But we over-index--

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.320
Asian-Americans
over-index online.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.590
We are early adopters.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.550
I mean, if you look at Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, video,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.920
Snapchat, even though WeChat
is significantly better--

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:20.070
bigger-- we over-index by double
to triple digits, 400%, 300%,

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.840
600% in terms of early adoption
of the social media platforms.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.930
And that's our bully pulpit.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.970
And the reason why
Asian-Americans and Pacific

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.390
Islanders do so well
online is because it

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:37.870
is our way to self express,
and not do it publicly.

00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:42.400
Our names are on
there, our handles

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.400
are on there, et cetera.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.820
But I do think that we need
to take that activism that we

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.540
find online--

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.480
I mean, we started the craze
of taking pictures of food.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.540
But I think that we can now
take it to the next level,

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.150
or we can show the
activism in different ways

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.345
online to get people
to be involved,

00:34:00.345 --> 00:34:02.744
to get people to
register to vote.

00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:04.660
And that's where I think
millennials and Gen Z

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.510
need to lead the way,
because as Tung said, do not

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.989
allow us to dictate
the future for you

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:14.020
or anybody else like
us, including Latinos,

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.730
African-Americans, and whites.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.630
You must lead the way
and take over for us.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.760
If you don't, then you're going
to allow people like Lorna,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.440
me Kathy, and Tung to dictate
the future for millennials

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.900
and Gen Z. And I don't
want to see that.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.120
So you have the power
of the internet.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.139
That is so powerful in
terms of mobilization

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.190
and civic engagement.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:39.250
You can change the
complexion of this country

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.719
and probably the complexion of
other places around the world.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.690
LORNA RANDLETT: I would just
add to what Bill is saying

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.420
and put a challenge
out to all of you.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.810
I was talking to a VC
recently, who's Asian, who's

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.730
going to raise $100 million.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.760
And it's really to find
new places for Gen Zs

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.060
to plug in to help be the
next generations of solutions.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.440
So we've done what we
can to try and seed

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.930
the ground with some
runway for you all.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.150
But what we're really
asking is that you

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.750
find the language apps
that help get the vote out,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.440
because so many people
are on devices now, right?

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.580
Or you find the solution
where you are making us

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.230
better in solving that problem.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.170
And so that challenge is one
that we would very gently

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.210
like to hand over to you.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.340
And we welcome you
to find those places

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.920
where you feel that
you can plug in and get

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.330
everyone else to plug in.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.820
The last thing I would say
is just 18 Million Rising.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.830
I don't know if you
guys have heard of that.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:47.020
But they were able to force some
pretty important corporations

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.930
to make some big changes on
behalf of Asian-Americans

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.960
in their stances because
they used technology

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.350
in a very, very smart way.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.860
So I just encourage you
all and challenge you all

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.860
to please pick up the baton
from where we left off.

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.666
TUNG NGUYEN: I want to
speak for my generation.

00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:07.240
So even though
we're going to rely

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.094
on you to do this new thing,
some of us can still do things.

00:36:13.094 --> 00:36:14.260
And we should work together.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.350
I think the diversity of
experiences and skills--

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.180
I just want to give
an example, which

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.400
is after I resigned
from the commission,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.520
we decided to build a
brand new organization

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.987
for Vietnamese-American
and progressive causes.

00:36:26.987 --> 00:36:29.320
So we call it PIVOT, The
Progressive Vietnamese American

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.550
Organization.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.770
It's now only three months
since we decided to do it.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.310
And using social media,
using traditional media,

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.990
using email--

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.080
that's really old tech,
but using G Suite,

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.730
using all kinds
of things, we now

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.720
have over 100
members in 12 states.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.530
And we are already
now recognized

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.080
as the progressive voice
for Vietnamese-Americans

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.070
nationally.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.050
So in three months,
with a guy who

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.870
doesn't know what he's doing
on the technological space,

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.020
we are able to do that.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.272
So imagine what you could do.

00:36:59.272 --> 00:37:00.730
ALLEN LO: So a
number of you talked

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.020
about getting out the vote.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.640
And one thing we
are starting to see

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.480
is more Asian-American
Pacific Islanders

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.200
getting into public
service and elected office.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.630
But still, there's
not that many.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.480
So what do you guys see
as the main barriers

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.270
for how we get more AAPIs in
public service and elected

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.770
office?

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.070
LORNA RANDLETT: I suppose
that one of the things

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.710
that at least I'm
working on with my work,

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.860
my nonprofit, the Leaders
Forum, is to focus and challenge

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.130
this idea that Asians are
not leaders, because I think

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.240
that that's completely untrue.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.950
So I think that when you
change the mindset of saying

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.590
that every Asian can be a leader
in whatever it is that they

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.710
choose, it will come to
pass that they will look

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.350
for leadership opportunities.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.629
I think it also matters
the ecosystem that we

00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:53.920
build to support those leaders.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.350
So some of the work that I
think that I and everybody

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.020
on this panel are doing is
to try to make sure that when

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.894
someone decides that
they are going to lead,

00:38:00.894 --> 00:38:03.310
that they know that they have
people that have their back.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.643
And that's incredibly important.

00:38:04.643 --> 00:38:06.925
So that's what I would say.

00:38:06.925 --> 00:38:08.300
BILL IMADA: I have
a funny story,

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.675
but I won't tell
the whole story.

00:38:09.675 --> 00:38:12.250
But a very, very, very
prominent executive at one

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.140
of your competitors who
I got a meeting with,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.394
a 30-minute meeting with,
and it took a long time

00:38:18.394 --> 00:38:20.560
to get the meeting-- as
soon as I got to his office,

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.090
the first thing out
of his mouth is,

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.636
why are Asian people so cheap?

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.790
And I said, what?

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.120
I mean, this is an executive
of a major company.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.990
And I went, wow, where
did that come from?

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.110
And he said, why
do Asian-Americans

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.240
hold so tightly to their money?

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.000
And I think that's kind
of true in some respects,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.360
is that we have a lot of
very wealthy Asian-Americans

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.984
that can give generously
to political causes.

00:38:46.984 --> 00:38:49.150
And I'll see them at an
event, and they'll say Bill,

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.690
I gave money to the
political cause.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:51.940
I said, how much did you give?

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.190
$50.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.270
And I said, $50.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.990
Wow.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.360
And I said, considering
the Jewish community gives

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.120
about $50,000 per person.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.740
And he goes, that's
a lot of money.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.380
So I do think that one of the
things that we're not good at

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.920
is--

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.870
because we're not as
political in our country.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.110
And I don't want to paint
that broad, broad picture.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.530
But I find that a lot of my
peers in the business community

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.814
are not used to giving
more than $100 at a time.

00:39:17.814 --> 00:39:19.480
And if we're going
to elect more people,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.160
then we've got to open our
pocketbook a little bit more.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.369
So I think that's
one big reason.

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:26.410
When I see the Jewish-American
community-- again,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.720
don't want to perpetuate
too many stereotypes.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.670
I went to an event,
and they said,

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.402
we need to raise $500,000.

00:39:32.402 --> 00:39:34.360
And I went, wow, that's
going to be hard to do.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.520
And everybody started
pulling out their checkbooks.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.589
And I said, you guys
are writing checks now?

00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:41.380
And they said, Bill,
if we don't do it now,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.985
we're not going
to raise $500,000.

00:39:42.985 --> 00:39:46.840
And I went-- it's unbelievable.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.280
Raised $500,000 in
less than 15 minutes.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.890
In our community, a hundred
people will be in the room

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.550
and I'll raise $5,000.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.240
So I do think that
we need to be better

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.444
about opening our pocketbooks
and supporting campaigns.

00:40:01.444 --> 00:40:02.110
ALLEN LO: Right.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:02.500
Kathy?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.900
KATHY KO CHIN: There are a
lot of bright spots happening

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.858
all across the country.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.160
In Congress, we've
moved from 13 members

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.900
to 18 members who are
AAPI, Including now three,

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.540
count of three Asian-American
women in the Senate,

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.482
which is huge, huge,
huge, huge thing.

00:40:22.482 --> 00:40:24.190
The other thing that's
a real bright spot

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.880
is local and
state-based electeds.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.250
So one person I'm really excited
to meet is Sam Park in Georgia.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:38.080
So he's a young,
gay, Christian Korean

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.340
who has just been elected to
the Georgia State Assembly.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.805
And our organization's--

00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:44.140
BILL IMADA: He's fantastic.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.190
KATHY KO CHIN: --trying
to reach out to him--

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.400
BILL IMADA: He's fantastic.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.941
KATHY KO CHIN: --and
get to know him.

00:40:46.941 --> 00:40:48.550
Just that profile
alone-- it just

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.100
sounds really interesting
to get to know him.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.580
There's also a city
council woman in Boston,

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.750
a new state legislator
in Illinois.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.920
So a lot of local and
state-based legislators

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.020
and electeds.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.780
There is an Asian Pacific
American Institute

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.700
for congressional studies.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.970
And they help people
who are thinking

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.520
about running for
office learn the ropes

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.110
and learn what it takes.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.200
And they have seen
a threefold increase

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.700
in interest just
in this last year.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.770
So that's really,
really exciting too.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.790
So I think that this idea
of really cultivating people

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:30.550
to think about being
leaders is really important.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.170
And even if you just
don't decide to run,

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.990
but just to learn
more-- thank you--

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.460
more about the
political process.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.257
And as Bill says,
to really support

00:41:38.257 --> 00:41:40.840
people who are deciding to take
that leadership role is really

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.760
important.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.330
TUNG NGUYEN: I want to
second the positivity.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.300
Again, every-- there's a saying.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.060
You shouldn't waste
a good crisis.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.420
This is a crisis in our country.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.000
If you don't do something,
you'll waste it.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.490
In other words, there
are so many people now

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.540
who are jazzed up about
the political system.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.089
It's like never before.

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:07.380
All these people who said,
I don't care about politics.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.090
It doesn't make any difference.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:10.186
All of a sudden they
realize, oh, no, it does--

00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:11.560
when it really
changes, it really

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.070
makes a huge difference, right?

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.640
So I know so many people
who are planning to run

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.670
or who are going to run for
office at every single level.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.320
So the story I'm
fond of telling is

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.620
there's this woman named
Kathy Tran in Virginia who

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.920
had three kids, all under the
age of 10, deliver a baby,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.690
I think, a week
after the election.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.000
And guess what she decided
to do with her life now?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.910
She's running for state
legislature in Virginia.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.700
She says, I have this baby
and I have these four kids.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.290
And I'm thinking
about their future.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.720
And if I sit on the
sideline, their future

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.240
could be a lot worse than mine.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.150
And she campaigns with two
kids, a baby on her arm

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.199
and a toddler in tow.

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:49.240
I'm very fond of saying--

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.940
I said, a lot of
politicians kiss babies.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.720
She brings her own baby.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.460
All right?

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.200
So if someone like that can
do that, then if you want to,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.560
you could do it too.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.460
And if someone else out there
wants to, they can do it too.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.490
I'll make a pitch for
the other organization

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.650
I've been trying to
start, or have started,

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.600
is we need money, right?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.030
So you can't run for office
these days without money.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:16.210
And we need a way to channel
the money to the candidates

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.420
that we support.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.380
So we created a super PAC
called the AAPI Victory

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.140
Fund, progressive Asians.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.370
I mean, it's very partisan.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.090
It's very clear.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.500
We're not one
party or the other.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.440
But we support
progressive ideas.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.281
I had some materials back there
in case you're interested.

00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:35.530
LORNA RANDLETT: I think that
the other thing that just

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.120
want to remind people--

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.380
we don't have an AAPI
Supreme Court Justice.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.160
BILL IMADA: Yet.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.840
LORNA RANDLETT: Yet, right?

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.230
So there's still
work to do, right?

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:50.020
And so just understand
that those types of things

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.480
are going to be really
important for your future

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.510
and for your children's
future and whatnot.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.500
So there's definitely
other stuff to be done.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.640
And we all have
different organizations

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.247
where we feel that we can have
places for you all to plug in.

00:44:04.247 --> 00:44:05.330
KATHY KO CHIN: Absolutely.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.080
LORNA RANDLETT: So I
don't know if there's

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.900
any questions for
us, for example, or--

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.790
ALLEN LO: So let's do this.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.081
Let's see if there's questions.

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:12.640
We've got a Dory
set up for those

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.810
who are on live stream or GVC.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.971
So add your questions there.

00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:21.470
Let's start with the room and
see if there's questions here.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:24.400
And I do want to follow up with
you guys on what you currently

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.930
are working on and
share some of that.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.585
So do folks have
questions in the room?

00:44:29.585 --> 00:44:31.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for being her.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.120
It was a very interesting talk.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.670
And you guys mentioned
the generation before

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.860
and the millennials, right?

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.960
So what is the-- is
there a difference

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.930
in views from our
parents' generation

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.970
and the older generation
versus the millennials now?

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.630
And if there are
differences in views,

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:53.974
what is it that we can do to
help gap that conversation?

00:44:53.974 --> 00:44:58.670
LORNA RANDLETT: So my group
has some millennials in it.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.760
There's one woman who's a
27-year-old CEO twice already

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.440
in "Fortune's" 30 Under 30.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.550
So she's clearly not
an underachiever.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.550
She didn't have running
water for the first five

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.850
years of her life.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.339
But I think that the
important difference

00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:18.130
in terms of your question
is the following.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.990
I think that people
like her are more bold.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.131
And I think that they're
more willing to engage.

00:45:23.131 --> 00:45:24.130
I think that they have--

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.250
a lot of them have more
resources or more ambition

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.095
to be able to play in
places and in politics,

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:33.730
like Bill is speaking about.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.920
I think that in terms
of bridging the gap,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.170
it's just about communication.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.711
I think it's like
what Bill's saying.

00:45:38.711 --> 00:45:40.010
It's about telling stories.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.120
It's about telling
people that there are--

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.030
even if you do a little
bit, the question is,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.081
if not you, who else?

00:45:48.081 --> 00:45:48.580
Right?

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.790
So if your parents don't vote,
then that's one less vote.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.000
And there are places
where races were decided

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.100
because hundreds--
a few hundred people

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.600
didn't cast their
ballots, right?

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.610
So getting your parents to vote,
other people in community, also

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.390
millennials to engage
and not be apathetic.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.764
I mean, I heard some millennials
sat out of the election

00:46:08.764 --> 00:46:10.680
because they were just
like, well, why bother?

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.990
Whatever it is, it's not really
the answer we're looking for.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.407
So that's what I would say.

00:46:15.407 --> 00:46:16.990
BILL IMADA: I think
what we're finding

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:18.640
is that the millennial
generation is

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.810
saying that they don't
know what they don't know.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:26.350
I don't know if you guys
have ever heard of Boba Guys.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:30.490
But Andrew Chau, who is
a leader in the city,

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.230
actually wanted to
tag along with us

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.880
when we went to Washington.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.490
And he brought a group of
millennial entrepreneurs

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.470
from all around the
country with him.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.100
And we went to a
lot of meetings.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.200
And he said, wow,
I need to know how

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.110
our political process works.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.110
And I have to be honest.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.580
I don't know how it works.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.090
And you guys are teaching
us what we need to know,

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.190
because everything is connected.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.060
And so I do think that
everybody's so caught up

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.620
right now in running
their businesses

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.350
or moving up the
corporate ladder

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.930
or doing a good job
at their companies

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.225
or maybe working on
one specific project

00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:09.070
that they can actually
do something that'll

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.460
change their communities.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.980
They're not focused necessarily
on the bigger picture.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.521
So I think what
we've been able to do

00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:16.720
is bring those people
together and say everything

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.520
is related and connected.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.364
Whatever you do can
impact multiple areas.

00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:23.530
So I think that one of the
things that we're finding

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.760
is people don't know
what they don't know.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.360
And pointing these things
out and showing them

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:33.120
how one simple act can change
everything about government,

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.570
a community, about a corporation
was very important and very

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.417
eye-opening for me personally.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.720
TUNG NGUYEN: My
understanding is that--

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.240
I think a lot of millennials
don't identify themselves

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.590
in one group or another.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.780
And I think that's
sometimes a problem for them

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.040
to figure out what they do.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.540
For example, tech-- a lot
of people who are tech maybe

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.610
have not have been interested
in politics before.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.590
But now, with the
current environment,

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.410
there is a movement
for tech to be involved

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.290
in political action,
and particularly

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.150
for Asian-American
tech to be involved.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.880
So you could engage
in that space,

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.180
or you can engage in the women's
rights space, where again,

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.420
a lot of issues are going
on that are addressing that.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.430
The thing that we
encourage AAPIs to do,

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.850
though, is whichever
space you engage in, also

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.670
make sure you engage
as an AAPI person

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.360
as well, for two reasons.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.520
One is, those viewpoints need
to be heard in those spaces,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.120
because they may be different.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.480
And the other is to be
able to bring all that back

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.510
to your community and see
how you can also leverage

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.610
the strength that you
have in those movements

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:45.731
to help your own community and
your parents and your family.

00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:46.980
ALLEN LO: Any other questions?

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.670
Anything on the Dory?

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:52.170
Nope?

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:53.878
KATHY KO CHIN: I'll
answer your question.

00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:55.139
ALLEN LO: All right.

00:48:55.139 --> 00:48:55.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.054
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:48:57.054 --> 00:48:58.410
My name's Brendan Chan.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:00.600
And I'm really glad
to, first of all,

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.795
be a proud member of the
Asian Googlers Network.

00:49:02.795 --> 00:49:04.680
I'm actually also
pretty involved

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.090
in the Hispanic
Googlers Network,

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.640
and the two networks have
worked together quite a bit

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.510
on issues related to
both of our communities

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.330
like immigration,
like you talked about.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.080
One thing I think that
we have both found,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.180
however, is that
there's a perception,

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.510
right, that some of these
issues are only issues applied

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.430
to particular communities.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.080
Immigration in
particular sometimes

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.485
is seen as just, right, a
particular issue that affects

00:49:28.485 --> 00:49:30.340
the Hispanic Latino community.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.770
And so I'd be
interested in, when

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.260
you talk about showing up,
when you talk about finding

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.740
the right issues, how do you
also band together so that we

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:42.400
realize that any progress
for any racial justice issue

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.400
is actually progress for
all of our communities,

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.369
and any advice that you
might have for us who

00:49:46.369 --> 00:49:47.910
are doing some of
that work or trying

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.150
to continue being involved?

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.680
KATHY KO CHIN: Thank you.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.830
That's a great question.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:54.150
So first of all, my kids
are Asian and Hispanic.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.790
So I really appreciate that.

00:49:56.790 --> 00:50:01.470
The other thing is,
between now and 2040,

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.950
being multiracial will be
the single largest segment

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.620
within the AAPI community.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.070
So it is this idea
that, for AAPIs, we

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.110
already have to be really
inclusive because it's

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.570
50 different countries and
all these different languages,

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.120
but even more so because
of how multiracial

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.580
our community is
becoming and is already,

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.777
but also will
continue to become.

00:50:22.777 --> 00:50:25.110
At the Health Forum, the Asian
Pacific Islander American

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.630
Health Forum where I
work, we are really

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.910
privileged to sit
at the same table

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.820
with 11 other
organizations who are all

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.780
considered racial equity anchors
by the Kellogg Foundation.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.050
That's the NAACP, the
National Urban League,

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.930
the National Council of La
Raza, the National Congress

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.300
of American Indians, and
other organizations as well.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.840
So for us, it is
working in coalition,

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.580
working in partnership,
being really

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.360
strong allies with each other
is really, really critical.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.270
And what we have done
is we've actually

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:00.540
discussed different issues,
whether it be voting rights

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.360
or immigration, and
try to figure out

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.960
what is the commonality and
how can we speak out together.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.080
So for example, on the
10th anniversary of 9/11,

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.830
we came together
and wrote a prayer,

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:18.720
a non-denominational prayer, but
about peace and about working

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.916
together.

00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:21.540
And fortunately, the
Kellogg Foundation

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.090
was able to take a full page
ad in the New York Times

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:25.200
magazine--

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.640
New York Times
newspaper for that.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:33.306
We've also responded
to the massacres in--

00:51:33.306 --> 00:51:33.930
where was that?

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:37.830
In Wisconsin, with
the South-Asians,

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:39.880
as well as with Ferguson.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.650
So all of those intersectional
and cross-racial work

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.570
is really, really important.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.790
Because as you said,
things like immigration

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.470
don't just affect Latinos.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:53.940
It also affects our communities
in a really significant way.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.950
The school-to-prison
pipeline-- I think people

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:56.940
have heard about that.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.800
Well, in the Southeast
Asian community,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.020
it's a
school-to-prison-to-deportation

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:01.860
pipeline.

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.180
And we also see that in
the Hispanic community.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.960
For any given issue that
our nation is facing,

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.840
there is a specific
slice for AAPIs.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.780
But we also have to realize
that to find the right solutions

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.904
and to have the right
advocacy solutions,

00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:19.820
we have to do it in
coalition with each other.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.440
Absolutely.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.370
BILL IMADA: I totally agree with
the intersectionality comment,

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:24.870
Brendan.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.328
I mean, we have
something in common

00:52:26.328 --> 00:52:28.230
with every single
Googler group here.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:32.250
The LGBT community also
faces immigration challenges,

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.290
separation of families.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:37.680
If you immigrate
here, you have to go

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.200
through a different process
if you're gay or lesbian.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.010
African-Americans-- some of
the fastest growing communities

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.050
in our country are
black communities,

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.731
coming from not only the
Caribbean, but from Africa.

00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:50.980
So I do think that there's
a lot of intersectionality.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.209
And it's important for
all of us to find that.

00:52:53.209 --> 00:52:54.750
And that's what
we're doing, I think,

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.730
at the Asian-American community.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.660
The Japanese can be reaching
out to the Muslim community,

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.405
because we were interned.

00:53:02.405 --> 00:53:05.880
And there was racial profiling
around the Chinese Exclusion

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.840
Act, as there was for Japanese
being interned in World War II.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.400
So the Japanese
community reached out

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.590
to the Muslim
community, said, we

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:18.430
know what it's like to
be pigeonholed and pegged

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.436
as outsiders.

00:53:19.436 --> 00:53:20.560
So we're going to help you.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.540
So I do think that if we
find those intersections,

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.706
it's going to be a lot
easier to focus on the things

00:53:24.706 --> 00:53:26.812
that make us unique
and different later.

00:53:26.812 --> 00:53:28.270
ALLEN LO: Maybe as
a final question

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:32.200
here, just given time, each of
you can just talk about just,

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.955
what are you focused
on right now?

00:53:33.955 --> 00:53:37.055
What's your main priority,
in a minute or less?

00:53:37.055 --> 00:53:37.930
LORNA RANDLETT: Sure.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.192
OK, minute or less.

00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:40.270
All right.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.930
So I started a
nonprofit, actually,

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.296
as an inspiration for
what Bill talked about,

00:53:46.296 --> 00:53:48.670
which is how many executives
that we're losing, because I

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.470
think that it's a
shame when you get

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.030
those leaders to
the top and they've

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:53.710
worked their entire lives.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:55.840
Their ability to be able
to help other people up

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.880
is obviously not there anymore
if they're not there anymore.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.330
So we are leadersforum--
all one word--

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:02.710
dot org.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:07.600
And I focus on making sure
that we protect those leaders,

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.990
that we develop them, that
we give them an education

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.310
about what public service is.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:17.020
And I would just say in
closing, to add to your point,

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.110
just make sure that you're
forming bonds with leaders that

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.610
are of other races, because
you can get a lot done, right,

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.360
when you're in those
leadership positions.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.476
And it's those
relationships that

00:54:27.476 --> 00:54:28.600
actually make a difference.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:33.430
Having a Rooney Rule
like they have in the NFL

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.380
for all executives
and making sure

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.400
that they interview
someone of every ethnic--

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.250
every ethnic group
in the top C-suite

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.980
would be something that would be
really beneficial to all of us

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.664
in America.

00:54:46.664 --> 00:54:49.080
BILL IMADA: Google has been
very supportive of me on this.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.040
So I started the National
Millennial Community,

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.350
and now we're starting
the Gen Z Council.

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:58.300
And that group has gone from
six universities to over 30.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.190
And we're now expanding
overseas as well.

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:03.800
And that group is to
create conversation.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:08.440
So it includes Republicans that
voted for Trump to progressives

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.680
that voted for Bernie to
people that didn't vote at all.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.100
And it's all about sitting
down and having conversations

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.090
that make us unique.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:19.480
And so the proudest
moment in the group

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.630
was when a Muslim
woman from Denver

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:26.320
who said she voted for Bernie
got into a huge argument

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.940
with a woman from eastern
Oregon who voted for Trump.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.360
And they argued in the bus
for 20 minutes straight.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.330
And then afterwards, they said--

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:35.830
the woman from
the vote for Trump

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.350
said, I've never
met a Muslim before.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:40.354
And she said, well,
I'm that person.

00:55:40.354 --> 00:55:41.770
And then the woman
that was Muslim

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.270
said, I never met
a person that was

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.450
from a town of 50
people in the country.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.300
And the two of them sat
together and had a conversation.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:50.760
And they are now best friends.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.790
So my movement is to
have civil discourse

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:58.481
to try to find out how we can
find ways to work together.

00:55:58.481 --> 00:56:00.730
KATHY KO CHIN: At the Health
Forum, for the last eight

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:03.670
years, we've been working
on the Affordable Care Act.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.320
And there's a handout, too.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.530
This is a map of where
we've worked in 23 states

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:13.540
to help a million people enroll
in the Affordable Care Act

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.210
health insurance expansions.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.710
And we did it in 56 languages.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:21.880
So as you can imagine, then,
defending the Affordable Care

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.170
Act has been a big fight
for us since January 3,

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:28.060
when Congress went
back into session.

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.740
If it's something
that you care about,

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.990
this is an opportunity
for you to engage.

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.080
I'm not telling you what to
say to your member of Congress.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.780
But I can also send you a
link with a phone number

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.036
that will connect you to
your member of Congress,

00:56:40.036 --> 00:56:41.410
and you can let
them know how you

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:45.010
feel about health insurance.

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.230
Just yesterday, the
Congressional Budget Office

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.840
did release the
analysis that said

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.420
the current bill in Congress
will see 23 million people lose

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.350
their health insurance coverage.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:59.990
And of those, 2 million will
be Asian-Americans and Native

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.480
Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.430
So it is a really
critical issue,

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.796
even if it doesn't
affect us individually,

00:57:05.796 --> 00:57:07.420
especially if you
have health insurance

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.620
through your employer.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.390
But it really does
affect millions

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:12.496
of people across the country.

00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:13.990
Thanks.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.419
TUNG NGUYEN: So in my
day job, I do research

00:57:16.419 --> 00:57:17.460
on Asian-American health.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.430
So I'll continue to do that,
which is really generating

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.620
data and interventions
to improve

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.240
the health of our communities.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.390
But I've decided, not
too long ago, that--

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.130
I have to take the
gloves off, and I

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:31.420
want to be completely partisan.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.330
I do not feel,
actually, that I can

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.510
work in the space where
I'm nonpartisan when

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.480
the political situation is
such that it oppresses me,

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.100
my community, and all
the people I care about.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.212
And so I've already mentioned
the 501(c)(4) that we started

00:57:45.212 --> 00:57:47.295
with PIVOT, called Progressive
Vietnamese American

00:57:47.295 --> 00:57:47.836
Organization.

00:57:47.836 --> 00:57:50.740
So if you're Vietnamese
or fellow travelers,

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.000
talk to me about that.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.680
And we also are very engaged
in super political activity

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.780
through the super PAC
with AAPI Victory Fund.

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.710
So again, we're trying to
identify progressive candidates

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.260
and support them.

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.420
ALLEN LO: Thanks to AGN
for arranging this panel,

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.780
in particular to Tiffany
[? Su ?] and to Maggie

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:09.280
[? Huang. ?]

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.580
But a big thank you
to the panelists

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.380
for spending the time,
for sharing their views,

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.110
and for helping to
inspire us here at Google.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:17.310
So thank you very
much for coming.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.393
LORNA RANDLETT: Thank you.

00:58:18.393 --> 00:58:21.260
[APPLAUSE]
