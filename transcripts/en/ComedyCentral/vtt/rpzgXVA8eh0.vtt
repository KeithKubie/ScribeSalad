00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.963 size:88% position:44% line:91%

THAT SENTENCE HAD MORE FUNNY

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.411 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WORDS PER SENTENCE IN IT.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEEP-THROATING PIG FARMERS,

FIND A BETTER FUNNY SENTENCE

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.026 align:start position:0% line:85%
STAKES WERE HIGH.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT CRUZ'S LEVEL OF PREPARATION,
HIGHER. 

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.231 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CRUZ AND HIS FAMILY DID A

HAPPENS NATURALLY?

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; OH MY GOD, NO.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT TAKES YEARS OF
PRACTICE.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:46.139 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE DO IT?

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, LIKE A

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.215 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:59.018 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE SHOULD REALLY
PRACTICE SECOND BASE.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:01:59.852 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.593 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU, SAM BEE
AND JASON JONES, EVERYBODY.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:13.733 align:start position:0% line:91%

HAVE THEY BEEN THERE MAKING OUT

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.500 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WHOLE TIME AND I

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.036 line:85%
AND THEN ITS WITH TIME FOR THE

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
BIG SPEECH.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.439 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S SEE HOW THE LIBERTY
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WELCOMED

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.206 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE SENATOR.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHOOO, THE EXCITEMENT, THE
PASSION.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:28.447 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE RAND PAUL T-SHIRTS.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.816 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT-- THAT

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:38.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
BUT COME ON, GUYS,

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:42.094 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T SHOW UP AT THE
SENATOR'S BIG DAY WEARING

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.730 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THE OTHER TEAM'S JERSEY.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.499 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THERE, JUST DON'T BE THERE.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.801 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO
BE HERE.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS A WEEKLY CONVOCATION THAT 
STUDENTS HAVE.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.839 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEN CARRY ON.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:57.043 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF COURSE NO CAMPAIGN
LAUNCH WOULD BE COMPLETE

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:00.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITHOUT SOME WEIRDLY THIRD
PERSON AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.818 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IMAGINE ANOTHER TEENAGE
BOY, BEING RAISED IN HOUSTON,

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:10.389 size:84% position:42% line:91%
HEADING OFF TO SCHOOL, OVER
A THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.492 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOME AT A PLACE WHERE HE
KNEW NOBODY.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:17.396 line:85%
WHERE HE WAS ALONE AN SCARED.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.231 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DUDE.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU WENT TO PRINCETON.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.670 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE I MEAN, DON'T MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE YOU GOT FORCED ON TO

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:28.374 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE TRAIN TO HOGWARTS.

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:31.310 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE EASIEST SORTING HAT

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:35.248 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVER.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.449 size:84% position:42% line:85%
SLYTHERIN, SLYTHERIN IT IS.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:42.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT-- CRUZ, CRUZ LOOKED TO
THE FUTURE.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.359 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU
TO IMAGINE, IMAGINE A

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:50.463 size:78% position:39% line:91%
PRESIDENT WHO SAYS I WILL
HONOR THE CONSTITUTION.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.366 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IMAGINE ABOLISHING THE IRS.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:59.071 size:78% position:39% line:91%
INSTEAD OF A GOVERNMENT,
THAT SEIZES YOUR E-MAILS,

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:03.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOUR CELL PHONES,
IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:07.613 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THAT PROTECTS THE PRIVACY
RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.716 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE GET IT, YOU ARE A
FAN OF JOHN LENNON AND SMALL

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.784 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOVERNMENT.

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:14.320 size:81% position:41% line:91%
YOU'RE A SMALL GOVERNMENT
CONSERVATIVE FREEDOM GOOD,

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:17.056 align:start position:0% line:85%
BIG BROTHER BAD.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.293 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH MAKES THE NEXT PART OF
THE SPEECH KIND OF

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNEXPECTED.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.398 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO
BREAK A RULE HERE TODAY.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:30.236 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I WANT YOU TO TURN
TO THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND SODOMIZE THEM.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND TO TAKE OUT YOUR CELL
PHONES.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:40.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT. TAKE OUT
YOUR CELL PHONE.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.582 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT AS REBELIOUS AS I
THOUGHT BUT OKAY.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.652 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU
BUT THOSE KIDS CELL PHONES

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:47.687 align:start position:0% line:85%
WERE ALREADY OUT.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.555 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE
BORING.

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:51.991 size:81% position:41% line:91%
LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE MORE
INTERESTING ON SNAPCHAT.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:59.231 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE POINT IS THIS-- YOU
WERE SAYING IMAGINE, YOU KNOW,

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:03.569 line:91%
THEY DON'T GET YOUR RECORDS,
WHAT ARE THESE LIBERTY LOVERS

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:04.303 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.038 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TAKE OUT YOUR CELL
PHONES.

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:13.145 align:start position:0% line:91%
TEXT THE WORD CONSTITUTION
TO THE NUMBER 33733.

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:20.419 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONCE AGAIN, TEXT
CONSTITUTION TO 33733.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:24.457 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE THING IS, HE
NEVER EXPLAINED WHAT 33733

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.158 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS.

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE JUST WANTED THEM TO TEXT
IT.

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:31.630 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO LET ME CLARIFY THIS A
LITTLE BIT.

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:34.100 align:start position:0% line:91%
STUDENTS AT LIBERTY
UNIVERSITY WERE REQUIRED TO

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.936 align:start position:0% line:91%
ATTEND A PARTISAN POLITICAL
SPEECH WHERE A SMALL

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.338 size:84% position:42% line:91%
GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE WHO
HAD JUST PROMISED HE WOULD

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.308 size:84% position:42% line:91%
RESPECT PRIVACY RIGHTS TOLD
THEM IF THEY CARED ABOUT

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:46.312 align:start position:0% line:91%
FREEDOM, TEXT YOUR
INFORMATION TO A MYSTERIOUS

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.882 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADDRESS THAT COLLECTS YOUR
CELL PHONE NUMBER FOR

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.451 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNDISCLOSED PURPOSES.

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:55.488 align:start position:0% line:91%
IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
