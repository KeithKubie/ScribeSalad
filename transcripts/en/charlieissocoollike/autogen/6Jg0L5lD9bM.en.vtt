every now and then my mum comes out with
 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.869
every now and then my mum comes out with
these little one-liners which are really

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879
these little one-liners which are really
 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.160

made me chuckle and the other day I was

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170
made me chuckle and the other day I was
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.300
made me chuckle and the other day I was
speaking to her on the phone and she

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310
speaking to her on the phone and she
 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.190
speaking to her on the phone and she
said people don't know enough about the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
said people don't know enough about the
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.009
said people don't know enough about the
moon these days I don't know how much

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
moon these days I don't know how much
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.180
moon these days I don't know how much
you know about the moon and I honestly

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
you know about the moon and I honestly
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860
you know about the moon and I honestly
don't know how importance it's gonna be

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
don't know how importance it's gonna be
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209
don't know how importance it's gonna be
to your life if you don't know anything

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
to your life if you don't know anything
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.709
to your life if you don't know anything
about the moon at all but for a while

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
about the moon at all but for a while
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.330
about the moon at all but for a while
now I've want to do a miniseries on

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
now I've want to do a miniseries on
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.890
now I've want to do a miniseries on
YouTube in which I talk about sciency

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
YouTube in which I talk about sciency
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.510
YouTube in which I talk about sciency
stuff that interests me and I thought

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
stuff that interests me and I thought
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.980
stuff that interests me and I thought
you know what if I'm ever gonna start

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
you know what if I'm ever gonna start
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779
you know what if I'm ever gonna start
doing that then the moon is probably a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
doing that then the moon is probably a
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.710
doing that then the moon is probably a
good place to begin

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
good place to begin
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.920
good place to begin
so fun science fun science fun science

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
so fun science fun science fun science
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900
so fun science fun science fun science
it's a science of fun yeah now the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
it's a science of fun yeah now the
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279
it's a science of fun yeah now the
obvious question to start with is how

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
obvious question to start with is how
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200
obvious question to start with is how
did the moon get there and all those

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
did the moon get there and all those
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.639
did the moon get there and all those
scientists have a pretty good idea of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
scientists have a pretty good idea of
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740
scientists have a pretty good idea of
how the moon came to be it's just that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
how the moon came to be it's just that
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270
how the moon came to be it's just that
it's a pretty good idea and nobody is a

it but relative to the planet the moons

it but relative to the planet the moons
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100
it but relative to the planet the moons
are like little specks of dust floating

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
are like little specks of dust floating
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450
are like little specks of dust floating
around whereas our moon is about a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
around whereas our moon is about a
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549

quarter of the diameter of our planet

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
quarter of the diameter of our planet
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.380

which makes it very big and very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
which makes it very big and very
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119
which makes it very big and very
confusing for example of past theory was

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
confusing for example of past theory was
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.049
confusing for example of past theory was
that the moon must have come in from

that the moon must have come in from
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759
that the moon must have come in from
some random bit of space and got caught

in orbit by the Earth's gravity but
because the moon is so big it would have

because the moon is so big it would have
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100
because the moon is so big it would have

that scientists have currently is

what you're actually looking at is

what you're actually looking at is

what you're actually looking at is
called the lunar near side because it's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
called the lunar near side because it's
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.459
called the lunar near side because it's
lunar light at the moon and it's the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
lunar light at the moon and it's the
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.319
lunar light at the moon and it's the
near side because it's the side nearest

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
near side because it's the side nearest
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.730
near side because it's the side nearest
obviously the mad thing though is that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
obviously the mad thing though is that
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.230
obviously the mad thing though is that
we only ever see that one face of the

we only ever see that one face of the

we only ever see that one face of the
moon and from here it doesn't look like

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
moon and from here it doesn't look like
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589
moon and from here it doesn't look like
it's spinning but in fact the earth and

it's spinning but in fact the earth and
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.540
it's spinning but in fact the earth and
the moon are spinning around in a kind

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
the moon are spinning around in a kind
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160
the moon are spinning around in a kind

what's even more interesting is that the

what's even more interesting is that the
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.490
what's even more interesting is that the
moon's orbit is in no way perfect it's

moon's orbit is in no way perfect it's
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.710

every single year and not only that but

every single year and not only that but
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.770
every single year and not only that but
because the gravity of the Moon has an

Moon gets slowly further and further
away the spin of the earth is actually

away the spin of the earth is actually
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.630
away the spin of the earth is actually
starting to slow down and our days are

becoming longer fortunately though the
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.840
becoming longer fortunately though the
moon is only moving away from us about

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
moon is only moving away from us about
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.610
moon is only moving away from us about
four centimeters every year which

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
four centimeters every year which
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.020
four centimeters every year which
results in a slowdown of the earth of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
results in a slowdown of the earth of
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.380
results in a slowdown of the earth of
about 15 microseconds a year so you'll

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
about 15 microseconds a year so you'll
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.210
about 15 microseconds a year so you'll
be long dead before you see any kind of

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
be long dead before you see any kind of
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.770
be long dead before you see any kind of
noticeable change so don't worry about

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
noticeable change so don't worry about
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.930
noticeable change so don't worry about
that one more fun moon fact before I go
