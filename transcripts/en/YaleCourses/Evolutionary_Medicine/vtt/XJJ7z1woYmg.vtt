1
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.580
Our final look at quite a patient is brings in all of the other things that are

2
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:14.591
living in the patient and we can see the difference they make when we look at

3
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:16.700
their developmental origins.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.480
So now we'll look at the developmental origins of the Microbiota.

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.220
A patient is actually a complex community with an ancient co-evolutionary

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.030
history.
A patient consists of about 10 trillion human cells,

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.090
about 90 trillion bacteria plus uncounted viruses and fungi,

8
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.540
and contains at least 300 times as many unique microbial genes as human genes.

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.650
<v 0>C-Sections,
breastfeeding,</v>

11
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:53.000
and our biotic treatments and hygiene all effect the Microbiota and through

12
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.230
their interactions with the immune system also affect the risk of allergies,

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.080
asthma,
obesity,
and autoimmune disease.

14
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.510
The evidence of Coevolution is actually development.

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.630
The Gut is the largest immune organ and the development of Gut associated

16
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:16.631
lymphoid tissue galt gut associated lymphoid tissue is triggered by signals

17
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.360
produced by gut bacteria.
One of those is Salmonella.

18
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
The mammals genome has outsourced this essential function experiments on a

19
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:27.111
scenic infant,

20
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:31.970
rabbits that is infant rabbits that do not contain any bacteria have

21
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:36.170
demonstrated that you have to have bacteria in the gut.

22
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.730
To develop the Gut associated lymphoid tissue and they need to be there in the

23
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.820
first week of life in the infant rabbits,

24
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.540
bacteroides fragilis is one of the agents involved.

25
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400
Then as the organism and its microbiota continue to develop,

26
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.930
there is crosstalk between the Microbiota and the immune system and that helps

27
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.090
to maintain immunological balance.

28
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.920
So this is the role of the immune system in managing the Microbiota,

29
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.610
not just in defending against pathogens but managing the Microbiota.

30
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720
Mutations in nod receptors which recognize pathogen associated molecules are a

31
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.780
significant risk for Crohn's disease,
which is an inflammatory bowel disease.

32
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.060
So if you interrupt this communication between the Microbiota and the immune

33
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:29.360
system,
it can induce a disease state and the patient.

34
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.960
If we look at what the gut looks like in a fetus and in a postnatal infant,

35
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.020
the first thing that you can see by comparing these diagrams is that the gut

36
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.910
lumen fills up with bacteria,

37
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:53.911
but it also fills up with molecules which are being secreted by cells that are

38
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:59.080
in by specialized cells that are in the gut.

39
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.140
So the maps are microbe associated molecular patterns.

40
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.550
These are communicating them with the gut wall payer's patches or lymphoid

41
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.790
nodules that surround the ilium.
Here is a payer's patch.

42
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.880
Here's a payer's patch.

43
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.040
The panic cells are secreting antimicrobial compounds into the gut lumen.

44
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.990
Here's a pan of cell.

45
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.390
Here are antimicrobial peptides and Immunoglobulin.

46
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.500
A IGA is the major immunoglobulin in gut mucous,

47
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.210
so there is a lot of immune globulin a in the gut mucous,

48
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.820
so a communication system is set up between the host and the complex community

49
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.930
of Microbiota.

50
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
The Gut epithelium is protected by an inner mucous layer that is nearly

51
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:57.700
steroids.

52
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.700
This is astonishing because there is such a huge density of bacteria in the gut,

53
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.220
but the layer that's right next to the gut epithelium is nearly sterile.

54
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.280
The Gut Microbiota live in the outer mucus layer and in the gut lumen,

55
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.630
so this is the small intestine here.
This is the large intestine here.

56
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.960
These blue dots that you see,
blue and green are bacteria.

57
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.600
The of cells are producing antimicrobial peptides.

58
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.170
The goblet cells are producing the mucus and that combination of mucus and

59
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.560
antibacterial peptides is protecting the gut epithelium,

60
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
but it's also creating and gut lumen in which the bacteria can flourish.

61
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.610
So the signals from the bacteria can also get through into the gut epithelium.

62
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.050
That microbiota develops across at least two generations.

63
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.870
So before pregnancy begins,

64
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.900
the maternal environment is affecting her microbiota and her own genes are

65
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.310
affecting her microbiota.

66
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.220
She is exposed to different bacteria and she develops her own gut community then

67
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.880
in Utero,
during her pregnancy,

68
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.610
whether or not she's stressed or smoking or what kind of food she is eating,

69
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.810
uh,

70
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.810
what sorts of other factors might be affecting her placenta can all affect her

71
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:43.120
own microbiota.
And then during delivery,

72
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.360
the delivery method determines which particular ecosystem of bacteria gets

73
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.550
transferred to the infant.

74
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.390
So vaginal delivery versus this area is very important.

75
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.210
Whether or not antibiotics are being used para natally.

76
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.270
So if the mother has given antibiotics before she delivers,

77
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.540
that will perturb her community.
The motive feeding,

78
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.430
breast milk versus formula and the initial colonization of the gastrointestinal

79
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:10.761
tract.

80
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.761
So it can be shown that children that are born by Syrian have a gut community

81
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.140
that is more similar to their mother's skin,

82
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.700
whereas those that are born vaginally have a gut community more similar to their

83
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.050
mother's Gut.
Then in early infancy,
the infant diet,

84
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.040
which includes introduction of potential allergens and infections will also

85
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.390
caused shifts in the Microbiota found in the baby and if the infant is exposed

86
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.690
to smoke in the environment,
that will also influence this.

87
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.250
So these all combined to determine the state of the immune system.

88
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.280
It's ability in the infant to resist disease and also the ability of the

89
00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.030
infant's immune system to manage its own microbiota.

90
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.380
<v 0>Here are some of the data,</v>

92
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.740
so we know that c-sections increase the risk of asthma and eight Hopi is a

93
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:13.450
hypersensitive allergic reaction that's mediated by Immunoglobulin e.

94
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.490
It usually has a genetic basis that interacts with exposure to the allergen.

95
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.710
Eight is include Excema,
hay fever,
allergic country,
conjunctivitis,

96
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.000
and allergic asthma.

97
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.220
Vaginal delivery leads to an initial colonization by aerobic eco lie and

98
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:35.080
streptococcus followed by anaerobic back to royalties,

99
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.590
clostridium and bifidobacteria.
Within the first two weeks,

100
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.280
bifido bacteria play a role in the maturation of the secretion of Immunoglobulin

101
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.620
a and saliva,
which may protect against allergy.

102
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.270
<v 0>So Zarian delivery leads to a much more frequent colonization by Klebsiella</v>

104
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.390
enterobacter and clostridium children born by c section had a 20% increased risk

105
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:04.080
of asthma and a slight increase in risk of a Topian allergy.

106
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.080
So delivery method makes a difference.

107
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.620
What about obesity?

108
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.270
C-Sections appear to double the risk of obesity in three year old children.

109
00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:20.271
So here are data on percentage of children on the y axis and the bars are

110
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.790
representing either vaginal or Securian birth.

111
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.010
These are the percentages that were overweight and these are the percentages

112
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.780
that were obese.

113
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.020
And you can see that says Zarian foreign children have just about twice the risk

114
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.560
of being obese as do vaginally born children.

115
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.650
<v 0>Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of atopic disorders.</v>

117
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:51.651
So children with and without a tow fees have different and gut microbiomes.

118
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.730
Breastfed infants are colonized with fewer equally c difficile and bacteroides.

119
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:01.731
These and then formula fed infants and breastfeeding has two n has to continue

120
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:06.390
for at least three months to produce these effects and to provide protection

121
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.690
against eight Hopis.
So this particular study,
uh,

122
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.950
followed about 1200 children for about four years and I'll just focus your

123
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:16.950
attention on this part of the table here.

124
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.230
You can see if we contrast the method of feeding with formula on the top line of

125
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:27.231
breastfeeding on the bottom line that the frequency of asthma,

126
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:32.871
excema rhinitis and food allergy is lower for breastfeeding for all of these

127
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.100
different [inaudible].

128
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.950
Now breastfeeding may be reducing the risk of obesity and here is a hypothesis

129
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.450
on how that might work.

130
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.540
It is thought that breast milk is supporting bifidobacteria and increasing full

131
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:56.141
late infant formula is supporting firmicutes bacteria and increasing butyrate.

132
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.220
The breast milk thereby promotes DNA methylation and the infant formula is

133
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:05.940
promoting histone acetylation.

134
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.230
They are affecting gene transcription in different ways with longterm effects on

135
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:14.910
metabolism target genes.
And that might lead to permanent metabolic changes.

136
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.500
So the mechanism,
if this is true,
is epigenetic.

137
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.210
And it might be mediated by continuing differences and gut flora that could be

138
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.650
treated with probiotics.

139
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.390
So one of the hopes for obese people actually is that they could be treated

140
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.560
simply by eating particular kinds of bacteria in their food.

141
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.880
Dealing with the epigenetic mechanisms is not so easy to manipulate.

142
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.330
We also know that antibiotic therapy increases the risk of a Utopian and

143
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:49.704
obesity,

144
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.010
so any course of antibiotics before the age of two years doubled the risk of hay

145
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:57.780
fever and Excema in a UK study.

146
00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.180
You see that doubling of risk right here between these two sets of lines and

147
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.610
early use of antibiotics increased the risk of obesity slightly but

148
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:09.870
significantly in humans.

149
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.871
So here are the antibiotics are being given in this gray bar period and the risk

150
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:19.440
of obesity is going up in the group that was exposed to antibiotics and is a bit

151
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:24.240
lower in the ones that were not exposed later exposures did not increase the

152
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.170
risk of obesity.

153
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.600
So a piece and obesity both appear to be conditions that are being mediated by

154
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:31.500
the Microbiota.

155
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:39.210
You can see the impact of hygiene and on the overall complexity and size of the

156
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:45.240
microbial community.
By contrast in people who are living in Karelia,

157
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.940
which is now in Russia and living in Finland,

158
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.910
they have similar genetic backgrounds,

159
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:54.400
but they're living in very different economic and cultural situations.

160
00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.450
The people who are living in Finland have much greater incidence of type one

161
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:06.100
diabetes than the people who are living in Karelia.

162
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.670
And if we look at the rates of Crohn's disease,

163
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.650
which is an inflammatory bowel disease,

164
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
the people who are living in Finland have about four times as high a rate of

165
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:22.690
Crohn's disease as do those in Finland.
And look at the other correlates.

166
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.140
People in Karelia have 73%

167
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.160
incidents of helicobacter.
Those in Finland,

168
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:38.161
only 5% people in Karelia have about $1,600 a year income.

169
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:43.441
Those in Finland about $2,500 a year and 73% of the people in Karelia have cats,

170
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.810
only 36% in Finland.

171
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.020
So there are similar differences between the two areas and hepatitis a,

172
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.110
toxoplasma enteroviruses and gut nematodes.

173
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:02.010
So the take home from this slide is that a dramatic contrast of neighboring

174
00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:07.930
geographic regions that differ quite a bit in their hygiene indicates that they

175
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.630
also differ a lot in auto immune disease,

176
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.110
both type one diabetes and Crohn's disease.

177
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.060
So what are the mechanisms that might mediate this sort of response,

178
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.430
which we're going to go into in greater detail?
The first is just competition.

179
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:28.720
So the infectious agents could be eliciting strong immune responses that compete

180
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.310
with the weaker responses that are elicited by allergens and autoantigens.

181
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.460
Second,
it could be regulation.

182
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:40.900
So one antigen suppressive effect also suppresses immune responses to other

183
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:43.030
antigens.
That's bystanders suppression.

184
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.350
So infectious agents could stimulate regulatory cells to damp,

185
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.390
autoimmune and allergic responses.

186
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.810
The third is innate immunity.

187
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:56.620
Infectious agents could activate the innate immune system by generating

188
00:13:56.621 --> 00:14:01.621
tolerogenic dendritic cells that activate tolerogenic t regulatory cells.

189
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.790
So this would be a more active manipulation of signaling pathways.

190
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.293
To summarize,

191
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.110
the development and expression of our immune system have coevolved with our

192
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:18.880
microbiome
interventions that perturb our microbiome,

193
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:22.810
changed the risk of atopic disease,
autoimmune diseases,
and obesity.

194
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.280
These interventions include c-sections rather than vaginal delivery formula.

195
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.900
Rather than breast milk and antibiotic treatments early in life,

196
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.850
as well as hygiene in general.

197
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.200
The result is mismatched diseases of civilization caused by the inability of

198
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:46.450
biology to evolve as rapidly as culture.
