00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.160
For a while, the Disney 2D animation studio was shut down

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.300
This is because the last few movies that were made were not huge financial successes

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.220
Half of them weren't even critical successes

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.680
So after a long time away, Disney decided to finally return to its roots

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.140
Go back to the fairytales, go back to the happily ever afters, go back to the magical stuff

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.320
This is where the Princess and the Frog comes in

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.760
Let me tell you, I was excited to see an animated 2D Disney film on the big screen again

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.540
and not just a satire one, I mean a real one

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.520
And personally, in my opinion, it didn't disappoint

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.640
Okay, story: You got a young woman named Tiana

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.140
She has a dream of opening her own restaurant

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.260
After her father passes away- I guess some Disney traditions never do truly die,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.020
She works her butt off to save as much money as she can

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.360
While that's going on, a prince from a faraway land named Prince Naveen comes into town

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.480
His parents cut off his finances because he's too much of a party animal

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.640
But then he comes across the Shadowman

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.720
He tricks Naveen into having him agree to have his soul be put into a frog

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.980
While his assistant would take on the appearence of the prince, and also work for the Shadowman

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.160
At a costume party, Naveen confuses Tiana for a princess and asks her to kiss him

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.060
She agrees, hoping that his riches will help keep her restaurant open

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.720
But, seeing how she wasn't a true princess, she gets turned into a frog too

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.120
And the rest of the movie is them trying to figure out how to lift the curse and how to stop the evil Shadowman

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.380
Let's look at our characters

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.960
Tiana is probably the best female lead since Belle

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.940
She's a fast thinker, she's positive, and she's a workaholic

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.380
God, never thought you'd see that in a Disney princess, would ya?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.540
The prince is also a lot of fun

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.360
He's full of himself but he's also got a lot of innocence to him

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.560
Tiana's best friend is fucking hilarious

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.020
I haven't seen a Disney character this funny in a long time

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.800
"Prince Naveen"
"Prince Naveen, of Meldonia, is coming to New Orleans!"

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.820
[Screams] "Ohh, isn't it the bee's knes? Ooh, tell her what you did, big daddy, tell her!"

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.680
Every second she is onscreen she just cracks me up

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.800
The villain is also a lot of fun. The fact that he's into voodoo allows for a lot of great visuals and a lot of great possibilities, and they take advantage of them all

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.420
And the rest of the side characters are also very memorable

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.780
You got Alligator who wants to be a musician

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.980
A redneck firefly who thinks he's in love with a star in the sky

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.200
And a witch doctor who always has the answer to every question

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.220
So, okay, this film sounds about as good as the classic, traditional, great Disney movies. What could possibly go wrong with it?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.160
Well, there's only one problem with the movie, and sadly, it's kind of a big one: The story

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.580
It's not that it's bad, it's just... a little too complicated

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.400
I mean, okay, I told you the basics, but I didn't even tell you about the fact that, what, the Shadowman has a deal with the Underworld so that he can take control of the town

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.880
But in order to take control of the town, he has to have the guy who looks like the prince marry the daughter of the mayor of the town

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.460
But in order to do that they constantly need the blood of the frog prince to constantly give to that guy or else his disguise will fade away

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.180
But it turns out the prince has to be kissed by the daughter of the mayor because the mayor always appoints himself the king of the parade

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.320
Which technically makes her a princess, but that has to be done before midnight on this certain day

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.860
But on top of that you also need the two main characters to fall in love with each other

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.700
While they're discovering how to fix their own faults, as well as each other's

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.280
Oh and did I mention there's also a totally unnecessary death and a totally goofy silly funeral scene

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.580
that'll either make you laugh or cry or both- oh my god, it's too much

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.820
I always said this should be called "Loophole: the Movie" because that's what it always seems like

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.240
Every second they're trying to look for a new loophole to get around something

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.520
Now, is it a major problem? I guess not, because you're constantly guessing what's gonna happen

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.740
But one of the charms of movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and so forth

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.460
is that the stories were always very flowing

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.740
They knew exactly how much to give to the characters and exactly how much to give to the details

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.060
This movie has way too many details going on

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.980
But like I said, it's not that bad, it's just not as good as the other Disney flicks had it put together

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.080
Yes the songs are Randy Newman songs, and to be fair, two of them are pretty good

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.980
Friends on the Other Side is a great villain song

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.560
And Almost There actually has a very memorable, nice beat to it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.600
The others- I don't remember 'em

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.440
And again, I guess that is a problem with the movie

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.420
But again, to the movie's credit, it does take place in New Orleans and at least the musical style does match, even if it's not all memorable.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.160
I guess before I wrap up I should talk about some of the controversy that surrounded this movie

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.500
Of course Tiana was the first black princess, and there was a lot of talk about the fact that originally she was supposed to be a chambermaid

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.840
They changed it and made her a waitress, but that caused a lot of uproar too

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.500
"Oh, it's changing history, oh, it's changing the way things were back then."

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.520
Well, you know what? There's a fucking talking frog. I think we'll live

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.460
Yeah, it's changing things, but you know what? We're always gonna have reminders of how things really were

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.640
This is a fairytale. Let the kids have their fairytale

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.960
On top of that, there's also controversy about why the film didn't do as well as Disney was hoping

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.140
Now, it didn't bomb, let me clarify that

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.660
But it wasn't the gigantic hit they were hoping for

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.420
Was it racism? Was the world just not ready for a black princess yet?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.060
I guess it could be, but I have my own theory

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.180
I think it is a predudice, but it's not against black people, it's against hand-drawn films

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.800
It's been a while since one has been marketed to both adults and kids, and, let's be honest, this is still a family picture

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.960
And the majority of family pictures coming out nowadays are either live action or 3D

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.320
Personally, I think a lot of adults still see hand-drawn films as kid's stuff

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.420
Now, it could get people in the seats if it was really doing something new like The Little Mermaid

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.760
Or just did it spectacularly like Beauty and the Beast

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.600
And to be fair, even though I like this film, it really didn't

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.000
It updated the fairytale very nicely and very cleverly, but the problems with the story do hold it back from being anything spectacular

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.340
And like I said before, only a few of the Randy Newman songs are memorable, there's no Be Our Guest in there

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.840
So that's my theory. To be honest, it still made money, I'd be more concerned if nobody saw it

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:07.380
But you know what? People did! Was it a ton of them? No, but at the same time a lot of the past Disney 2D animated films didn't have a ton of people looking at them

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.100
and nobody screamed racism at that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.320
But, I don't know all the people in the world, so that's anybody's guess. It's just a theory

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.360
On the whole, though, I really enjoyed this one. I felt just like I was seeing The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast again

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.160
It was great to see it on the big screen, it was great to see these characters, and I had a lot of fun watching it

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.900
The animation's great, the colors are great, the characters are great, I enjoyed watching it and I know I'll be seeing it a few more times in the future
