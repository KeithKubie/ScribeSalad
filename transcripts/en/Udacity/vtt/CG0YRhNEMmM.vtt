00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.130
So, for this approval process that we're doing it looks

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.370
like when we submit the first time, we lock the record.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.650
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.390
&gt;&gt; So nobody else can play with it.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.700
&gt;&gt; No one else can modify it

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.390
until it's either been fully approved or rejected.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.900
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Okay. And we can do,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.450
looks like we can hit other actions there?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.990
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. so, let's think about this. What are we going to want to do here?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, so in this case, when a new

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.230
set time is created and you know, we've added

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.000
a band or a stage, we probably want to change the field once it's

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.060
been set to in review, set the status of it from New to In Review.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's do that.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.700
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.330
&gt;&gt; Field update. Change status to in review? Is that okay?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.840
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.590
&gt;&gt; And the field update is status. How

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.440
very cool. So specifying a field value, in

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.660
review.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.110
&gt;&gt; And then Save.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.600
&gt;&gt; Okay. That makes sense.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.350
&gt;&gt; So, now that we have it changing

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.400
that status field, it'll notify everyone, hey, this

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.940
is why the record's locked. It's in review.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.170
The next piece would be waiting for whoever was

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.730
approving it to actually say whether they approve

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.260
it or not, so there's going to be a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
related list on the record where they can

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.620
do it from there, like straight from the record.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.790
&gt;&gt; Oh, so the manager can do it.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.820
&gt;&gt; The manager could approve,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.520
yes or no, or if we had that email template set up, they could also approve via.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.290
&gt;&gt; From the email?

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.590
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.420
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay, and approval steps, so this is just somebody saying,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.930
this is the part of the process where somebody says, looks good.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is talking to whoever needs to approve it, and see how

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.570
it says step one? You could add a bunch of approvers if you really wanted to.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. But we don't, so now we can final approval actions.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.520
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.520
so looks like by default, it locks the record.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.460
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.370
&gt;&gt; And we want to, I guess, change the status again to Confirmed?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sounds good.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:56.640
&gt;&gt; All right we did that. Okay and then we have Rejection Actions and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.180
Recall Actions which sounds similar to me. But I guess there's a distinction.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.650
&gt;&gt; So, I would say, I mean. We'd probably

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.330
want to keep using that status field to delineate where

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.220
in the process it is.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.288
&gt;&gt; with Final Rejection, I would say

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:12.090
that would probably be cancelled because we're like,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.460
no we don't want this anymore. But Recall, maybe we'd send it back to New.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.900
&gt;&gt; That makes sense, okay. Alright. We've got our

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.890
actions all figured out, based on what the approval says.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.330
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.930
&gt;&gt; So what should we do next?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.150
&gt;&gt; Test it out.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.930
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
