00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.812
- [Voiceover] All right,
this is the fourth and final

00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:07.088
in a series of videos about how to tackle

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:09.853
the DBQ or document-based question

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:13.515
on the AP U.S. History exam.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.917
We started out by reading
all of the documents

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.257
that are provided in the exam,

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:20.886
from which we are to write an essay

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.058
that analyzes the major changes

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:24.870
and continuities in the social

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.245
and economic experiences
of African Americans

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.098
migrating from the rural South,

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:34.053
to urban areas in the North
in the period 1910 to 1930.

00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:37.732
As we analyzed these primary documents,

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:40.831
we kind of identified three major themes

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.187
that we wanna talk about.

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:43.850
And that was cultural differences

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.943
between the South and the North,

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.103
differences in the type of labor

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:48.681
between the South and the North,

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.546
and differences in patterns of segregation

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:52.780
in the South and the North.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.497
And from these themes we
came up with a thesis,

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.238
which was more or less

00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:58.933
that the more things change,

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.918
the more things stay the same.

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:03.798
So even though African Americans moved

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:07.258
to a whole new city, a
whole new environment,

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:09.197
a whole new system of labor,

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:11.995
they couldn't escape persistent racism,

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.793
which had similar effects
on their lives in the North

00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:16.674
as it did in the South.

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:20.040
Now we're at the writing the essay part.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.458
And while obviously I can't sit here

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.674
and write a whole essay on the screen,

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:26.217
I do wanna outline things for you,

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:27.561
and give you a general sense

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:29.599
of what you could talk about where.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.150
For the DBQ we're gonna do

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.923
a standard five-paragraph essay,

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:38.202
which means introduction. . .

00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:41.563
with a thesis statement,

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:47.433
paragraph 1,

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:51.904
paragraph 2, paragraph 3.

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:53.893
These will all be the body paragraphs

00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:55.450
where we'll give our evidence

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.596
in support of our thesis.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:58.869
And then a conclusion,

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:01.973
which wraps up what we've said before,

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:05.549
and really drives home our point.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.395
In this essay, to get full credit,

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.937
you should expect to use

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:12.110
either all, or all but one

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.151
of the primary documents
that are provided.

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:16.730
And that means you need
to reference them all,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.156
although you don't necessarily
have to go into detail

00:02:19.156 --> 00:02:20.608
about every single one of them.

00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:24.498
And what I want to
caution you against doing

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:27.236
is just talking about
each piece of evidence

00:02:27.236 --> 00:02:29.013
one after another

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:33.112
without putting them into a
larger framework of ideas.

00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:37.176
So don't just say oh well
first their was a folk saying

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:39.996
about the effect of the boll
weevil and sharecropping

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.731
on black Southerner's lives

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:45.395
and then some of them asked
for help moving North.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:46.974
They wrote to the Chicago defender,

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:49.853
because you don't want
to just let this evidence

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:51.351
lead you along.

00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:53.278
What you want to do instead is say

00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:56.261
that you have read these
pieces of evidence,

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:58.015
you have analyzed them,

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:00.425
and now you're going synthesize them

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.125
into an argument of your own.

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.400
This is where the themes come in handy,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.362
because we've taken the time to see

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:09.846
what's going on in all of these documents

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.958
and kind of bubble up to the surface

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.443
what are the real important issues

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:16.139
that people are talking about.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.192
And as we thought about
changes and continuities,

00:03:19.192 --> 00:03:20.552
in those things,

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:23.898
the thesis that we came
up with was more or less

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.995
that even though the form

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.024
of each of these things changed,

00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:35.624
the form of the culture,
the form of the labor,

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:37.837
the form of the segregation,

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:42.282
the underlying problem of
racism kind of remained.

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:51.268
So this thesis actually gives
us a really neat structure

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:52.474
for the rest of the essay

00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:54.786
because we've said the forms changed,

00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:57.305
but the underlying
problem stayed the same.

00:03:57.305 --> 00:03:59.511
So for each of these body
paragraphs we'll talk

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:03.159
first, about the change in form,

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.886
but then we'll talk about
the underlying problems

00:04:04.886 --> 00:04:06.314
that stay the same.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.849
All right, are you ready to
take a stab at writing this?

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.566
Let's kind of ease into
things with our introduction.

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:18.585
I think a good thing for us to do

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:21.024
might be to set the scene a little bit.

00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:23.160
And we talked about some
of the historical events

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.925
that were going on at this time period.

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.328
So you might say that sharecropping

00:04:27.328 --> 00:04:30.811
had really been an economic loss

00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:33.887
for African Americans.

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:36.384
And so they were feeling the pressure,

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:39.471
both from the system of sharecropping,

00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:43.339
where 50% of what they got
was sent back to landowners,

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.219
and also from the boll weevil,

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.099
which had killed off a
considerable amount of the crop.

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.434
So they just weren't doing ok.

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:53.839
You could also mention that in the 1890s,

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.107
the Supreme Court case
Plessy versus Ferguson

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.920
had made separate but equal accommodations

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.970
legal for blacks and for whites,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.230
which basically put
racism as part of the law.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.111
So if there had been any hope remaining

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:12.375
that the Civil War and reconstruction

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:16.009
were going to result in
a society in the South

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.596
that was not based on
racial discrimination,

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:21.476
it was kind of destroyed
with Plessy versus Ferguson,

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.149
at least for the time being.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:26.382
And then lastly you might
say that World War One,

00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:28.908
As the United States
mobilized for the war,

00:05:28.908 --> 00:05:32.458
led to many new factory jobs in the North,

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:35.265
which gave African Americans in the South

00:05:35.265 --> 00:05:37.115
an opportunity to leave.

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:40.215
At the end of your first
paragraph in the introduction,

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.677
this is the time to bring out your thesis.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:46.956
Our thesis is even
though African Americans

00:05:46.956 --> 00:05:49.976
who moved from the South to the North

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:54.976
in the period 1910 to 1930
experienced tremendous changes,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.556
in the culture surrounding them,

00:05:58.556 --> 00:06:00.424
the work that they did,

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.283
and their living patterns,

00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:05.104
they still suffered from
many of the same problems

00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:07.506
that they had suffered from in the South

00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:10.282
due to the pervasive influence of racism.

00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:11.942
In a way what you're saying here is

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:15.599
that racism was a national
problem in the United States.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.921
It didn't change from north to south.

00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:22.026
So even though the form that racism took

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:24.503
might be different in
South Carolina and Chicago,

00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:26.942
there was no real qualitative difference

00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:30.340
in it's impact on the
lives of African Americans.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.436
This is where we break out our themes.

00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:34.860
Our first theme was about
cultural differences.

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:41.534
Remember our structure.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.568
First we're gonna talk about
the things that were different,

00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:44.833
and then we're gonna talk about the things

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.075
that stayed the same.

00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:47.747
One thing that was different would be

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:49.836
that if sharecroppers moved to the city,

00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:53.377
they were moving from a rural
to an urban environment.

00:06:57.453 --> 00:06:59.485
Where many African Americans in the South

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.377
had worked as sharecroppers

00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:04.720
and lived in a farming situation,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.043
now they were headed to
the heart of the city

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:08.587
where they might be surrounded

00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:09.887
by other African Americans.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.498
Bring up the map from document 7 here.

00:07:13.498 --> 00:07:17.163
And they were also worried
about what it would be like

00:07:17.163 --> 00:07:18.778
to take a job in the city,

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.506
somewhere that was completely
far away from home.

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:22.642
And this would be a part

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:26.441
where you might consider talking
about the newspaper letter

00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:28.355
in document 2,

00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:30.900
where a man writes to the Chicago defender

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.685
asking for help because he's
afraid he might get hoodwinked.

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:38.056
So what are some of the
things that stayed the same?

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:41.009
Well I think we can definitely
say that some of their fears

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:46.391
were justified about the move to the city,

00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:50.797
because many people
found that life there was

00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:53.668
just as hard as it was in the South

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.210
and we see this in this document

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.355
about the Cotton Belt Blues.

00:07:58.355 --> 00:08:01.328
We might even say on kind
of a larger cultural level,

00:08:01.328 --> 00:08:04.230
that white people in the North were

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.852
no more kind to them than
white people in the South.

00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:11.289
And here you might consider
bringing up document number six,

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:13.808
the one about the race riot in Chicago.

00:08:14.818 --> 00:08:17.081
That's a paragraph about
cultural differences.

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:18.637
How about labor differences?

00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:21.970
In our second paragraph
we're gonna talk about

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.012
how even though African Americans

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:28.076
moved to a completely
different type of labor,

00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:31.014
from sharecropping to factory work,

00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:34.520
they still faced pervasive
racism in the factory system

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.358
that led to whites rioting

00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:40.026
and also segregated facilities,

00:08:40.026 --> 00:08:42.218
even bathroom facilities
in these workplaces.

00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:46.019
The thing that changes
is the type of labor,

00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:54.741
and here you might wanna
bring up the first document

00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.801
where you're talking about sharecropping.

00:08:57.801 --> 00:08:59.918
So what kind of work they
were doing was different,

00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:03.332
but the same kind of problems they faced

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:05.538
in the workplace were quite similar.

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:08.615
They faced segregation in the workplace,

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:12.742
and they faced

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:16.904
stereotypes about the
kind of work they did

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:19.540
and whether or not they were good workers.

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.253
And here you might bring
up the third article,

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:28.711
where the efficiency expert talks about

00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.635
how it's important to separate
white and black workers

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.191
so that you don't have any kind

00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:37.407
of racial friction in your office.

00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:41.017
And you might also talk
about the sixth article,

00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:44.350
where they say that many people believe

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.928
that African American workers
were used as scabs in strikes.

00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:51.956
So that's a kind of a way
of separating the races

00:09:51.956 --> 00:09:54.849
that's saying that white workers in unions

00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:57.562
might be undermined by black laborers

00:09:57.562 --> 00:09:59.343
willing to work for less.

00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:02.930
Lastly we're talking about
the experience of segregation.

00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:09.118
We've already mentioned this transition

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:11.138
from a rural to an urban environment,

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:12.996
but you might also talk about

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.376
how living patterns changed.

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:19.418
In the South, African Americans and whites

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.482
usually lived in similar places,

00:10:22.482 --> 00:10:25.500
in the same town, in
the same parts of town,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.661
more or less,

00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:29.657
but the way that they used
space was slightly different.

00:10:29.657 --> 00:10:32.501
For example, African
Americans were often expected

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.359
to use the servant's entrance,

00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:37.586
sit either at the back of a movie theater,

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:39.781
or maybe not even go into the same places

00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:41.266
as a white person.

00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:43.890
But in Chicago,

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.452
there is an entire African
American neighborhood,

00:10:47.452 --> 00:10:48.407
And for this you definitely wanna

00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:49.871
bring up document 7,

00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:51.867
which shows where African Americans

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:53.677
were living in Chicago.

00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:55.175
And the thing that stays the same

00:10:55.175 --> 00:10:58.131
is really the system
of segregation itself.

00:10:58.131 --> 00:10:59.784
Northern segregation looks different,

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.782
but it's still segregation,

00:11:01.782 --> 00:11:03.720
so you might talk about,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.747
I mean this is still segregation
is one thing you can say.

00:11:08.747 --> 00:11:10.653
And you can also say
that there's kind of a

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:12.881
implicit promise of violence

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.841
if African Americans step out of line

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.699
in the system of segregation.

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:21.518
And here you might talk
about document number four,

00:11:21.518 --> 00:11:24.676
which is this kind of
snearing newspaper article

00:11:24.676 --> 00:11:26.975
from a white newspaper in Mississippi,

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:28.775
saying oh well in Mississippi

00:11:28.775 --> 00:11:30.420
we have lynching,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.285
in the North they have explosions.

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.426
Their point was

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:36.066
"Oh, well isn't lynching better?"

00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:37.735
But for the purposes of your essay

00:11:37.735 --> 00:11:38.675
what you can really say is

00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:39.988
"What's the difference?"

00:11:39.988 --> 00:11:41.973
They're both forms of death

00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:44.875
for getting out of line
in a system of racism.

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:47.101
So there's nothing that's really

00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:48.371
all that different there anyway.

00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:50.409
And now we're at the conclusion.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:52.212
Generally I would advise you

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.893
against bringing up any new information

00:11:54.893 --> 00:11:57.727
in a conclusion because
you want your reader

00:11:57.727 --> 00:11:58.749
to come away saying

00:11:58.749 --> 00:12:00.050
"Oh yea, that was right!"

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.591
not "Wait a minute, the author didn't talk

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:03.753
about that in the essay at all,

00:12:03.753 --> 00:12:06.029
why are they mentioning
it in the conclusion?"

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:08.465
So I would advise you
to just kind of restate

00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:09.766
what you've been talking about

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:11.519
throughout the essay saying

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:14.840
that even though there is
this vast transformation,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.184
in the culture, the living situations,

00:12:18.184 --> 00:12:20.656
the work of African
Americans who are moving

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:22.154
from the South to the North,

00:12:22.154 --> 00:12:26.027
the substantive problem
of racism stayed the same.

00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:28.357
All right, well that's it for the DBQ.

00:12:28.357 --> 00:12:30.815
Taking the time to do your due diligence

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:32.533
and understanding these documents,

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:35.390
and coming up with an
idea and a structure,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.690
and even an outline,

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.513
will really pay off in the long run,

00:12:38.513 --> 00:12:40.416
because it will help you to write an essay

00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:43.191
that is really strong and really clear.
