Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. See that is just not wise, right? That's just too much. It's too much to do. When people do that, when they just take on too many different, like I've, uh, I've thought about other stuff like doing other stuff. I've had offers to do other stuff and I start thinking about it. Maybe I could find time for that. And then I, then I give myself coaching. Like I'm like, what would you tell yourself? I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you? You're not doing anything else. I can go barely do all this stuff you're doing now. I think for me too, as I get older, especially like right now in my life, my leisure time is very important to me. Like it means something and I don't mean leisure, like sit around doing nothing but like hobbies, like stuff that I do. Like lately I've been shooting guns.

Speaker 1:          00:41          You have a jealous man, dude, you should come with us thinking about buying a gun. You should get a gun. Do you want to come with us tomorrow? Um, wait a minute. What's today? Wednesday I might go in tomorrow. We'll talk afterwards. Okay. But, um, I'm going soon. But you should come. It's fun. It's fun. You learn how to shoot your gun and tactical stuff. That looks fun. It is fun. You know, it's like video game, but some people get mad. A lot of mad comments lie. Just get mad. They don't want you shooting guns. Stop it. Stop it. Think of the children stop at blanks. Well, you're not shooting blanks, shooting real bullets, but it's um, there's also a game that you can get, we're going to get for this a studio that's a, it's a real pistol. Like it looks like a real pistol and has a six pound pole.

Speaker 1:          01:27          So it feels like a real pistol when you pull the trigger. And uh, it's like that techno hunt thing where you've got a laser beam that shoots out and uh, it even makes a noise like had gone like pow and you shooting zombies. Yeah. And it's heavy like a pistol. So you have to hold it like a PESTEL dope. Yeah. Dude, that's bad. That's next score and whatnot. Oh yeah. It tells you how many civilians you shoot, how many zombies you got. Cause sometimes people come running around the corner and it says it's a zombie and then there's a civilian behind them. You got to make sure not to start you guys rolling around and shit out there or you're just standing still and that we're not in a movie, bro. What's funny, you guys are having no obstacles. I don't think it's a good idea to have dummies like me roll around with a gun in my hand.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Somebody told me to buy a Glock 19 that was the gun, that box. Great gun. All right, cool. Yeah, you should. Before you do anything, you should learn how to shoot. I've I've shot before. I've gone a few times with you. Yeah, yeah. For rifles, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. I've shot in Burbank at the shooting place where they have a place near ya. Oh, that's right down the street. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun, man. It's fun. We should have a JRE, a shooting range somewhere. Hell yeah. Have a, just to that thing that we shot all the hard drives. Yes. That was fun, man. That was fun, wasn't it? That was rifle shooting is fun, but pistol shooting, um, when you're holding in your hand it's way more difficult. It seems to it more different. You think it's more difficult? More difficult to aim? Yeah, because he gave me a rifle and uh, you know, I shoot rifle so much or I have shot him so much.

Speaker 1:          02:55          It's easy. You just have trigger discipline. You just don't yank the trigger. Just pull, pull, pull, pull paying and let it go off like a surprise shot. And I was, I hit everything I aimed at and he was like, okay, you've shot that before. But like pistols, I've only shot pistols at a range with no instruction. I don't really, I didn't know what I'm doing at all. And once you learn like how to grip it, how to hold it, how to aim, like you don't really hold that hard with your right hand. Most of the pressures with your left. So, and the, the grip is very, it's not intuitive. You have to learn it. It's something that you have to be taught correctly. And there's so many people there that are like, they, they shoot in competitions and so when you watch them do it, you're like, Oh wow, Jesus Christ. Like there's levels to this. I just guys that can pull their gun out and shoot four shots inside of a second in a second, pull, draw, pull, shoot four shots inside of a second. That's crazy. Yeah, that's ridiculous. But they're just begging for someone to break in their house. You know, there's people like that out there. There's people like that where you, you know, you break into the house, you fucked with the wrong person. Well, tent city's growing, so I think I need to get one.

Speaker 1:          04:04          LA is going to be a giant homeless encampment. It's like if you looked at the spread, right? If it was a disease, a deadly disease that was killing everybody and you saw like patient zero and then it spread like two people, four people, six people, 10 people. Now LA has more than 60,000 homeless people and every single underpass that you go to, you see camps. Now. It's not like it used to be. It's a totally different animal now. It's like the walking dead man where it's, it seems like it's growing. Like Laurel cannon when you're going to Laurel cannon off the one-on-one. It used to be pretty normal last night or two nights ago when I went through it, it was like there was no sidewalk anymore. It was like if somebody wanted had to walk on that sidewalk. Yeah, good luck with that. You're going through your walk village, you know?

Speaker 1:          04:47          Yup. And needles and all kinds of fucked up and human shit. I mean human shits all over downtown LA. I seen a lot of people shit and that's nothing compared to San Francisco. That guy's Zubie who's on our podcast. He did a bunch of posts about his trip to San Francisco is like, it is so much worse. He was saying it was so much worse than he thought it was. It's so, it's so beyond comprehension. How many people were just openly shooting up drugs, shitting in the streets, homeless people everywhere. How do you fix that? And like if you would think that if there's something that LA needed to fix, how to all the things that Ellie complains about the homeless problem, it's like one of the most insurmountable problems. Like what do you do to curb that? How do you get these people homes? How do you clean these people up?

Speaker 1:          05:29          How do you get them off drugs? How do you get them off the streets? How do you make it not a public nuisance? How do you make it so people aren't scared to go down streets? Cause there's certain streets in downtown LA where you see the street, like you're at the beginning of the mouth, the street and you look in those three lights. I'm not walking down there like this is terrible. They need to open up the mental hospitals again whenever they closed them down. Wait in the seventies or the 80s that's what caused all this. They don't have those anymore. It definitely was a problem. But it seems like it's gotten way worse. Right? Like think about what it used to be 10 years ago. Now think about what it is now. I mean this 10 years ago, it was still decades after they closed down the mental institutions, they changed the standards.

Speaker 1:          06:07          So what it was was they had certain standards where you would be institutionalized and they changed those standards under the Reagan administration and just sent these people out into the streets and everybody thought it was like really cruel because here you just releasing these people with all these like severe mental health problems and just releasing them out into the street. But that was a long time ago. Something has happened recently I guess is the economy. I mean I don't know what it is, but another thing you think seeing around this area is mobile homes. Like those, the dry, those campers like Winnebagos fucking everywhere. People just get enough money to get one of them. Mobile homes, they just park it on the street and they live in those things, which is just like a mobile camp, you know? And you get these gypsies that hang out and they cook on the sidewalk and shit. Like we used to have them here. They would, they would like, they were hanging out in sunbathing on the lawn out here and the owner of the building's like, get the fuck outta here. Like, what are you guys doing? This isn't the park, like go to the park

Speaker 2:          07:08          in what's worse? Sovereign citizens, what does that, there's people that don't drive, they travel and they don't follow the rules and they like, if you watch it live PD, they have one every episode to every episode. They'll get pulled over and it's like they won't even roll down the window and they're like, I don't have to follow your rules, sir. I, they never have driver's license or insurance. They, it's like people that don't think taxes apply to them, but they don't think the law applies to that. But that's grown so big recently that it's so many people now that do this shit and it's the most grossest like, uh, if you watch on an IPD, you'll, you'll witness live P D by PDs cops nowadays it's, but it's, I think it's way better cause it's live, it's like four hours long and the host alive live in the moment, like in seven different cities. They have a whole control center. Like, all right, we've got a speeding going on here. We've got an, Oh there's a chase going on here. Let's go live over here. Yeah. It's my favorite. And they have it. They also have in Columbus, Ohio where they used to and they just got rid of it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:07          I didn't even know this was a thing. And so the sovereign citizens, like what are they saying? They get pulled over and they say, I don't have to listen.

Speaker 2:          08:13          Yeah. They pretty much say like, your rules don't apply. And they'll be like, uh, get, you know, give me your driver's side. I need you, I'm ready to quick take you to the jail for just a seatbelt, you know, violation. Give me your license. They won't like, I don't need to give you a license, sir, please. They have this shit to keep on repeating. And they all go to these websites and they're like reading on their phone, sir, I don't have to, you know, do this and that and this. And then they finally have to like break their window and just drag them out and arrest them. Just wear a seatbelt. Finally, people are smart and you know, they're talking about though. But other people, I've just watched another video, I'm like, Oh, I don't have to listen to this guy. I'm a YouTube bourbon. There's something unique, uniquely

Speaker 1:          08:48          satisfying about watching that. I get pulled over by the cops and he knows exactly what his rights are and the cops are fucking up and he calls the cops on different co codes and laws and the constitution and then he winds up driving off. I've seen that before. Yeah, pull over the da on accident. They're like, Oh geez. Oops. Yeah. Or that woman who was a New York, uh, she was like some kind of high up person that got pulled over and she starts yelling at the cops and shit. Like she lost her job the next day. I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. That was ridiculous. She was trying to throw her weight around. She didn't realize she was on camera being a corruption man. That's corruption. You're a citizen bitch. You know. Everybody needs to realize I, there was one where a judge got pulled over and they let him slide but he got in trouble afterwards as well cause it's on camera, you know, and then someone finds that video and it's like, Hey man, you are a citizen.

Speaker 1:          09:38          You're like us. Like if you're speeding or something like that and they pull you over, you can't get out and act like you own these cops. It's, I mean, you got to give your fucking [inaudible] driver's license though. You gotta you gotta show them your identification. If you're doing something that's an infraction or violation. That's the whole reason why we have cops. Do you want everybody to just driving 150 miles an hour, no ID and masks on? No. So you have to have rules. So these are the rules. If you do something that breaks the law, they gotta be able to pull you over and give you a fucking ticket and incentivize you to drive correctly and also find out if maybe you're running from the cops and also they pull you over, they get your ID, they go, Hey man, you got a murder warrant out for you.

Speaker 1:          10:19          So, uh, please step out of the car with your hands up. I mean, this is the whole reason when we have cops in the first place, then these people that think they don't have to pay taxes and then the laws don't apply to them. It's all on unconstitutional. Good luck with that case. Good luck with the ass Wesley Snipes. How that worked out. Yeah, it shit, they put Wesley in fucking jail for a long time. Lauren Hill too. From the goddamn Fujis. They put her in a cage for like a year. Right? How long did she go to jail for it? It was a taxes thing to men. They get these wacky, whether it's an attorney or a tax professional or some wacky advisor tells them they don't have to pay taxes and they read some internet thing. It says actually it's unconstitutional. It's only supposed to apply during war time.

Speaker 1:          11:03          I'm like, listen, pay your fucking taxes. Okay. You can protest all you want. You think it's unjust, that's good. They will put you in a fucking jail. And if you're a famous person's trying to pull that off, especially a famous rich person, look, it's not good, but it is what it is. They're going to make an example of you. Yeah. How long did she go to jail for? Three months. That's it. Showing what? The jail for three months. Hmm. So she was released from a federal prison, women's low security, all facility. All females facility. Just the fact that they put her in a fucking cage is crazy. Like she a danger to the public. Like what is going on here? She owes you money. How come that's the one money that you can't just pay back. You know, you can't just pay it back. How come I can't just pay it back?

Speaker 1:          11:48          Nope. Not good enough. That you still have to pay back and go. Yeah. And yet they take away your ability to earn a living for a long time. Like Wesley Snipes. How long was he in jail for? He was in jail for like a solid year. A whole year behind bars. Put a halt to his career and all because he owed some taxes cause he had some wacky dude that was telling him he didn't have to pay taxes. How long? He had a three year sentence. Three years. Imagine that man cause of money. They lock you in a goddamn cage. It's not like he stole money. It's not like he held up a bank. It's not like he was a violent person that was a danger to society. No, we owed some taxes. He made money and they had, they're taking his money. He made money, but he didn't give his share up to the government.

Speaker 1:          12:33          So the government decided to lock him in a cage to punish him and to make a a statement to everybody else. It's also like you pay taxes, you get taxed on your paycheck and then you'd get sales tax. They're getting tax. How many times, you know, getting taxed a lot. 10 times. Well then that's why places like Nevada people like because in Nevada you don't have to pay state taxes, so you make a, you can save a lot of money. Florida, same thing. Like I know a dude who moved to Florida because he was going to sell his business. So he's like, look, I'm going to move to Florida and establish residence in Florida for a few years and then sell my business so I'm a Florida resident and then I'll have to pay nearly as much money can say, if you want a big business, it can save you a ton of money.

Speaker 1:          13:13          It's just weird that it's different everywhere you go. You know, like some places just don't have state tax. You don't have to pay. Yeah. Montana has different taxes. Colorado is different. Taxes, they all have, everybody's going to like a different setup, different amount that you have to pay for this and that and over. There's a weird thing that like a lot of the big corporations have their headquarters in Delaware for some reason. It's like to somewhere tax law for that. Yeah. A nice little tax Haven. Well, isn't that why the juice moved to Florida? Didn't OJ moved to Florida because they couldn't take his pension that way, or he owes money based off the lawsuit for the civil suit. Yeah, but he has a pension right from the NFL. Yeah. So right. They can't fuck with that pension.

Speaker 3:          14:03          [inaudible].
