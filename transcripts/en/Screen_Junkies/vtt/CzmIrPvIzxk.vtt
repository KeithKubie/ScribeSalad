00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.900
Toy Story was visionary,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.000
Inside Out was a true original,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.560
and Wreck-it Ralph was still pretty good.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.100
But now, the "secret world under our own" premise

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.780
ends up like Taco Bell through a human centipede in:

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.820
Experience a film that only comes around when a studio exec has custody of the kids for a weekend,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.640
where the underlying IP is the top priority,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.020
while story, plot, character, humor, and tone come tied for dead last

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.660
in a film that may not be the worst one ever made,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
but it is the worst example of Hollywood farting out 80 minutes of cynical branded advertising

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.980
and pretending it's a movie.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.120
Too honest?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.540
Here's a poop joke!

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.580
"You might be making too much stink out of all of this."

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.860
You know emojis?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
Those little pictures morons use instead of words?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.680
Did you ever wonder if they were alive?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.660
No?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.860
How about what their day job is like?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.360
No?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.640
Their love life?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.300
Never?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.580
Well, too bad,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.820
because you're going inside the bland animated world of your phone, whether you like it or not,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.280
full of three-dimensional representations

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.360
of two-dimensional text icons

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760
with one-dimension to their personalities

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.660
and zero depth to any of this.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.960
"AAAAAAAAAAAH!"

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.460
"Gene."

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.200
"Are you finished?"

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.580
Meet Gene,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.340
the meh emoji,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.580
voiced by humanity's own meh, T.J. Miller.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520
He needs to believe in himself,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.520
get the girl,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.660
save the world,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.300
and probably some other generic protagonist goals you'll miss while you nap through the second act.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.980
Watch him and the Carpool Karaoke guy travel from app to app

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.160
to show off all the cross promotions Sony was able to sell.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.220
But 'cause Internet culture moves faster than it takes to animate a movie,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.960
all the apps are outdated,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.120
"Welcome to Just Dance!"

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.600
"Candy Crush."

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.520
all the slang is embarrassing,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
"#blessed."

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.680
"NBD, dude."

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.440
"Flay!"

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.140
"Ooh, shade."

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.260
and all the emojis have about 6 months of relevance left

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.100
until they're replaced by Apple's horrifying human/emoji hybrids.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.700
"We got a chicken.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.880
Bokbokbokbokbokbokbokbokbok!"

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.720
Eugh.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.460
OK, think of the laziest joke you can think of.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.640
"In the nosebleeds."

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.980
"Uh, I'm standing right here."

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.500
No, even lazier.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.780
"What kind of business?"

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.020
"Monkey business."

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.260
Now dumb it down to the point where it barely makes sense anymore.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.080
"Is that the time?"

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.100
"Hey, my eyes are up here, pal!"

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.020
Congratulations! Now you're writing The Emoji Movie!

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.400
Suffer through a parade of dumb kids' humor bordering on anti-comedy,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.960
where the meh joke is run into the ground so hard,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.120
you can't tell what happiness is anymore.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.700
"I'm just beaming with pride."

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.400
"I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug."

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.060
Stop.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.420
"Don't overreact."

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.980
"Uh-oh."

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.660
"I told you not to overreact."

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.800
Please stop.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.020
"Right now, I'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you."

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.760
I get it!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.740
"This is jazzy."

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.940
AAAAAH!

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.260
But nowhere does this comedy come closer to tragedy than Sir Patrick Stewart playing...

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.140
a turd.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.420
"Oh, sh-"

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.320
Prove that you can give a man talent, awards, and a knighthood,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160
but it's nothing compared to the power of a paycheck.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.760
"You're so soft, Poop."

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.260
"Not too soft, I hope."

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.140
So experience the perfect film for our times

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.640
that doesn't teach you the positive role of sadness like Inside Out

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.340
or turn a cash grab into something insightful like The Lego Movie,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.880
but instead teaches children that life is a meaningless, mediocre, joyless slog

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.840
that takes place mostly on your phone

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.420
and only exists to serve a global conglomerate's interest.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.100
Uh-oh, too honest again.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.180
Poop joke!

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.880
"Just doing my duty."

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.480
"Hahaha!"

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.160
"What? What did I say?"

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.460
A lot of good people probably had to work really hard on this movie for a really long time,

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.840
so I'm sorry.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.600
Not for anything I said about the film,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.540
just, you know, those lost years of your life.
