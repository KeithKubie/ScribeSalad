00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:22.630
[silence]

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.930
&gt;&gt; PAM JACKSON: Good afternoon.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.230
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.530
I'm Director for The
Center for the Book here

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.830
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.100
We're part of the National and
International Outreach Unit,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.820 position:56%
and we're very pleased to be with
you today for this afternoon's talk.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.610
It's a really exciting topic
with a really great group

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.290
of people and a great author.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.980
I should mention that today's
talk is brought to you in part

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.220
by The Daniel A.P. Murray African
American Cultural Association

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.920
for employees here at
the Library of Congress,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.580
and they all have a
special part in our program

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.080
that will be introduced
just shortly.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.340
I should mention that here, you
know, for our external audience

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.660
for the most part, but to remind
us internally too, at the Library

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.980
of Congress it's our focus, it's
our mission, it's our desire

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.110
to be recognized and
remind the public

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.650
that we are America's
first cultural institution.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.710
And it's our mission to provide
a rich and enduring source

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.250
of knowledge and we care about
doing that, because we care

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.450
about inspiring creativity

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740
and the intellectual
endeavors of people everywhere.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.430
And today's topic and
book talk is designed

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.880
to further the library's
mission in that way.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.180
I'd like to mention that The Center

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.430
for the Book includes both The
Young Readers Center and The Poetry

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.790
and Literature Center, and it's
our mission to promote books,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.250
and reading, and libraries,
and literature,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.960 position:56%
and poetry for the purpose of having
informed and engaged societies.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.100
We know that now, more than ever,
literacy is critical to upholding,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.400
defending, protecting,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.500
and preserving vibrant
and robust democracies.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.820 position:56%
And we have now for 2017, titled
ourselves as defenders of democracy.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240
We thank you for being
here for part of that,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.210
because our talks are
designed in part to promote

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.810
and extend a commitment to a
culture of reading and to make sure

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.750
that the Library of Congress's
mission is really focusing on-

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.540
one anchor of it is that we
create and sustain a culture

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.050 position:56%
that values literacy and literature,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.860
and we do that with
today's talk as well.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.610
Just as a quick aside, I'd
like to mention that The Center

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.960 position:56%
for the Book administers The
Library of Congress Literacy Awards,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.250
another way we further the
mission of the library,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.830
and we are currently soliciting
applications for prize money

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.990
from The Library of Congress for
literacy promotion organizations.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.570
You should visit us at
read.gov/literacy awards

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.060
to learn more about that program.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.550
Now onto today's focus.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.850
As we get started I want to do
two things- ask that you all reach

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.150
down and check your devices.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.180
Make sure they're on
silent or vibrate.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.150
And I do that because
our second point is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.930
that we are recording today,
both for the library's webcast,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.190
and we have the honor
of having C-SPAN

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.720
with us today for this book talk.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.040
So, as you participate and ask
questions in the conversation

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.000 position:56%
at that point in the program, please
know that you'll be being recorded

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.040
and a part of our webcast.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.010
We can mention that you can also
visit us at read.gov to see more

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.020
than 250 of our author talks and
webcasts that we have available

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.940 position:56%
from The Center for the Book for the
talks that we've had over the years.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.430
I'll also mention that
if you have not already,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.240
the book for today's talk
is available for sale

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.550
out in the vestibule,
and we encourage you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.620
to obtain your own copy,
if you have not done so,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.300
and to know that she'll be
available for a book signing

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.980
after today's talk as well.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.790
Finally, the chief criteria for
deciding the books to feature

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.370 position:56%
in our Books and Beyond Series here
at The Center for the Book has to do

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.880
with the connection to
The Library of Congress.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.410
And certainly today's book
is connected in a variety

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.340
of different ways- both
celebrating, honoring,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.980 position:56%
and acknowledging an
extraordinary figure in our history,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.310
both our personal lives as
Library of Congress employees

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.360 position:56%
and our cultural lives as Americans.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.760
But, also because the
research was done here.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.990
That's an important part of what
the library likes to promote

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.440 position:56%
and to encourage, which says we have
a vast, rich, set of collections

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.570
that matter to people, and we can
only share them if people engage

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.550
with them, find out what's in
them, write about them, publish,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.120
and come do talks about them.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.810
And that's one of the things
that we care about, and do,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.860
and celebrate at The
Center for the Book.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.290
So, to further our program
and to talk about it I'm going

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.990
to introduce The Library of
Congress historian, John Y. Cole.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.350
Now, John's a special
figure in our lives,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220 position:56%
because he's actually the founding
director for The Center for the Book

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.570
and was part of the initiative
that led to the legislation

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.400
that created us 40 years ago.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.500
We're actually celebrating our
40th anniversary this year.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.670
So, I'd like to acknowledge
and appreciate John,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.560
who also has a very special
relationship with today's author

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.420
and to the subject of the
book, Mr. Daniel Murray,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.330
who will introduce our author,
and to introduce a couple

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.390
of the key components of
the rest of today's program.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.480
Thank you so much for
your attention.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.280
Enjoy the talk.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.310
[applause]

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.080
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: Well, as Pam
has mentioned, I'm John Cole.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.040
I'm here not only to help celebrate
Daniel Murray and the book series

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.670
that The Center for the Book has
under way, called Books and Beyond,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.240
but also to acknowledge some very
special guests we have today.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.230
We have members from the Daniel
Murray family, the descendants

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.510 position:56%
of Harold Murray, who Harold was one
of Daniel Murray's seven children.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.810
Do I have that right?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.410
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: Yeah.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.190
And most of them have made the trip
from Mexico to be with us today,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.610 position:56%
and I would like them to stand and
be acknowledged in a special welcome

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.510
from The Library of Congress.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:33.750
[applause]

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.070
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: So, we have live
participatory history going

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.620 position:56%
on today, and part of my remarks
are going to be aimed at the family,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.660
as well as some of our other
special guests, but we also,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.870
through the Murray family, have
a special Daniel Murray project

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.880
that I'd like you to learn
about before those of you

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.700
who don't know the full story
of Danial Murray get immersed

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.950
in Elizabeth's wonderful
talk and book.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.620 position:56%
So, I'm hoping that Darren Jones ...

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.220
Darren, where are you?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.230
... is right here, will
tell you a little bit

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.800
about The Danial Murray Association

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.220
and especially the special
project, The Bench by the Road.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.510
Let's give Darren and The
Murray Association a hand.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.060
[applause]

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.360
&gt;&gt; DARREN JONES: Thank you.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.660
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.960
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.260
&gt;&gt; DARREN JONES: My
name is Darren Jones.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.560
I am the program director

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.140
for The Daniel A.P. Murray African
American Cultural Association.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.880
On behalf of the association and
our president, Larry Sarratt,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.240
and our board members ...

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.700
Raise your hand, board members.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.840
... I want to thank you
for being here today,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.110
and we have about 150 members of
The Daniel Murray Association.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.900
Let me see the hands of
the members in the room,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.810
so everybody can see you.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.640
Thank you for coming today.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.630 position:56%
Well, we have a special honor coming
up for Mr. Murray on April the 28th.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:06.080
The Toni Morrison Society is
placing 20 benches around the world

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.840
as historical markers for
African Americans and culture.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.180
The Daniel Murray Society
has been chosen as one

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.910
of those places that
will get a marker.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.330
Now, let me just tell you,
it was a long process.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:26.150
About two years ago Iris Taylor
went and talked with the people

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.500
at the Toni Morrison Society.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.740
We had to go to the Congress to get
the Congress to come to The Library

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.280
of Congress and The Architect of
the Capitol, because we were told

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.810
that they don't place benches in
someone's name on Capitol Hill.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.160
So, we had to go through the
Congress to get the library

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.240 position:56%
and The Architect of the Capitol to
agree that we can place a bench here

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.510
at The Library of Congress
in honor of Daniel Murray.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:00.120
[applause]

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.560
&gt;&gt; DARREN JONES: So, that
project is almost complete.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.540
We're still raising money.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.570
We have to pay $5,000 for the
bench, and we're also going

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.310
to have a celebration, so we're
raising money for that celebration.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.980
And I'm being told something else,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.760
but I don't remember
exactly what that is.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.810
We are going to be having
the presentation on the 28th,

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.430
which is a Friday, the
last Friday in April.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.390
And so, we hope you all
can join us at that time.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.870
It will be a marker to
celebrate the life and legacy

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.930
of Daniel Alexander Payne Murray.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.440
I want to thank Mr. Cole for
allowing me to get up here today,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.150
and I hope that you all
can join us at that time.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.950
Thank you.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:50.340
[applause]

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.250
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: We're
squeezing a few more members

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.910
of the family in, but
we're doing it.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:02.150
I first learned about Daniel Murray
back when I was a young librarian,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.190 position:56%
before even The Center for the Book
was created, which was 39 years ago.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:13.110
I was a collections librarian,
and I was assigned to work

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.760
on a collection called The
Colored Author Collection,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.250
that had many labels called Colored
Author across the front of them,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.900
but The Library of Congress
had decided to do some things

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.710
about this collection
that were all good.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.790
Part of it was to put them
into the general collections.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.180
Part of it was to sort out the
valuable pamphlets that were going

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.880
to be part of the Rare
Book Division.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.820 position:56%
And I had a partner, her name was
Dorothy Porter, who was the director

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.610
of The Howard Library, and she
helped me on this, and we sorted.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.800
Many of the duplicates in
some of the special books

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.480
from the Daniel Murray Collection,
that was left to the library

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.650
after Mr. Murray died,
were that way made part

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.330
of the library's permanent
collections.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.430
And I wrote an article
about it, and it was one

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.700
of the first articles I ever wrote.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.860
It was in 1978.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.160
And guess what?

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.740
37 years later, now, I have found
myself writing another article

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.950
about Daniel Murray and I have
learned so much about him and much

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.270
of what I have learned really
comes from this wonderful book

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.500
that we're going to hear more
about today from the author.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.300
But, I must say that I've never
forgotten what really struck me

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.920
about Mr. Murray was his passion
about the importance of literature

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.840
and the way that literature
and the literature

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.530
of African Americans could tell
their story in a permanent fashion.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.940
He devoted his life, as you
will hear, to this was one

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.160
of the several projects
he was involved in,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.990
that it was his passion.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:59.720 position:56%
The books and the love of literature
that he's left behind is now part

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.720
of his legacy at The
Library of Congress,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.840
not just through the collections
that I've worked on, and many,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.180
many others have worked on,
but also through the work

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.360
of The Murray Association, which
is carrying this tradition.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.540
Now, I first met our author,
Elizabeth Dowling Taylor,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.950
Beth Taylor, a couple of decades
ago when she was the Director

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.240
of Interpretation at Thomas
Jefferson's Monticello.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.800
Beth, who holds a PhD from
the University of California

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.930
at Berkeley, has spent more than
20 years in museum education

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:39.140
and research, including not only
Monticello, but also as Director

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.610
of Education at James
Madison's Montpelier.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.520
Her museum experience and her
great experience as a researcher,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.830
and her writing skills led
naturally to now a career

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.010
as an independent scholar
who's turning

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.580
out wonderful books
on important subjects.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.810
Her first book, "A Slave in
the White House: Paul Jennings

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.840
and the Madisons," which
was published in 2012,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.540
was a New York Times best seller
and a National Book Award nominee.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.780
It also brought her to
The Library of Congress

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.760
for the first talk about her book.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.030
And at the same time it
brought her to The Library

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.780
of Congress National Book
Festival to talk about the book.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.130
She is now back, and
we are just delighted.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.860
She is now also, among her other
lives, a lecturer and fellow

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.700
at The Virginia Foundation for
the Humanities, which I must say,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.280
to plug The Center for the Book,
is the home for The Virginia Center

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.320
for the Book, so our lives
come together in many ways.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.340
Today The Library of
Congress is very pleased

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.250
to help her launch this new
and very important history,

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:52.730
a book about Daniel Murray and his
remarkable family, but yes, also,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.890
as she herself describes it,

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.390
it's a book about America's
original black elite

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.220
in what has now become a
forgotten era in American History.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.080
Thank you, Beth, for reintroducing
this era now in another period

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.060 position:56%
of our history and to another
generation that has so much to learn

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.070
from the story that
you so skillfully tell.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.680
May I present Elizabeth
Dowling Taylor.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.480
Thank you.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:30.330
[applause]

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.660
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH D. TAYLOR:
Good afternoon.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.640
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.130
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH D. TAYLOR:
I'd like to thank Pam.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.880
I'd like to thank John.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.770
I'd like to thank The
Center for the Book.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.920
I'd like to thank The
Murray Association.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.440
I'm hoping you'll make
me an honorary member.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:51.170 position:56%
And in general, there are many staff
members at The Library of Congress

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:57.040
to whom I owe a debt for their
help with my research here.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.790
And indeed it was when I was
researching my first book

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.680
on Paul Jennings, James
Madison's enslaved man servant,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.360
that I stumbled across
Daniel Murray.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.360
Daniel Murray, one of his first
contributions to The Library

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.620 position:56%
of Congress, and he was an assistant
librarian of Congress at a time

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.130
when such professional appointments
for black men were rare,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:31.220
and he started by putting
together a list of 27, excuse me,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.770
270 titles by African
American authors.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.970
And one of them was the
memoir by Paul Jennings,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.800
which The White House
Historical Association considers

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.610
to be the first memoir

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.220
of life behind the
scenes in the White House.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.870
Precious few copies of it had
been made, and I would maintain

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.220
that if it was not for
the save by Daniel Murray,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.550
and this wasn't the only important
memoir or other notable works,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.670
that it would have been lost
to obscurity all together.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:11.890
My book is a biography
of Daniel Murray,

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:18.310
pioneer in the Black History
Movement, major race activist,

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.580
model civic citizen,
and prominent member

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.480
of Washington D.C.'s black elite.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:31.190
But it is also the story
of a larger narrative,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:37.970
and that is the remarkable
rise and disastrous decline

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.640
of African American
prospects over the span

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:48.310
of Murray's lifetime, 1851 to 1925.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.720
The rise of prospects
for African Americans

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.780
after emancipation brought,
as one ex-slave put it,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.170 position:56%
"a glorious harvest of good things."

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.260
In particular, the 14th
and 15th amendments

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.320
to The United States Constitution,
which granted Americans

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:13.320
of every color all rights,
including the right to vote.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.580
But later the federal government,
in the name of reconciliation

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:27.720
with the former Confederate states,
brought about a early abandonment

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:36.530
of Reconstruction and ushered
in a denial of the rights

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:42.570
of African Americans that were
embedded in that very Constitution.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:50.200
There was renewal in the south of
oppression of African Americans

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.410
that included stigmatization,
discrimination,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:01.630
segregation, intimidation, terror.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:09.300 position:56%
Now, I have long been a student of
slavery, given my work at Monticello

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.820
and Montpelier, and I know how
important it is, how central it is

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.110
to understanding American history.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.630
But I was a little bit slower in
understanding that that period

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:28.510 position:56%
between emancipation and the modern
civil rights era is just as central.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.950
Sometimes you mention the word
Reconstruction to Americans

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.560
and they're not sure if that
was a good thing or a bad thing.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.760
And I'm going to share with
you a personal anecdote

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:48.300
about my own ignorance prior to
my intensive study of this era.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:57.570 position:56%
I had a picture, a picture in my
head of African American legislators

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:03.120
in the halls of Congress
looking like buffoonish rubes

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.400
with hay seeds in their teeth.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:13.830
I, as part of my research
for this current book,

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:18.360
as difficult as it was,
watched The Birth of a Nation,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.230
the original 1950 movie
by D.W. Griffith.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.280
It was the second time
I was watching it.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.760
I recall that I had watched it in
high school in a humanities class.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.420
No discussion about the content.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.920
The whole point was to
discuss Griffith's innovative

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.320
film techniques.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.980
And when I watched it this time
there was a particular screen shot

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.060
and there it was, shabbily
dressed African Americans

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:50.130
in the legislative chamber, one of
them with bare feet up on a desk,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.400
looking enormous and close up,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.860
and in the background
was his colleague gnawing

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.070
on an enormous chicken leg.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.500
That was my picture.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.120
That was the picture in my head.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.570
And it shows you how strong
popular culture can be,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.910
especially visual images.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:17.870
And indeed this movie captivated
the American public and put

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:23.230
in their heads lots of false
images that were not countered

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:28.210
by our schooling, because of
the inaccuracy of our schooling

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.350
in presenting these
parts of our history.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.200
So, to be sure, there were
23 African American gentlemen

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.510
who served in the halls of
Congress and in the Senate,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.620
and they did so with distinction.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.380
So, yes, Reconstruction
was a good thing.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.680
It ended too early.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.240 position:56%
What followed was a bad thing, and
that of course was the Jim Crow era.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.730
Again, African Americans were
abandoned by the federal government

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:07.700
and allowed to be virtually
re-enslaved by white supremacists.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.720 position:56%
Now, we have to recognize all of
our history, own all of our history,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.850
including the chapters
that we're ashamed of.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:23.320
And only then can we do a better
job of considering the solutions

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:29.930 position:56%
to the legacies of these shameful
chapters, if we have a full picture.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:35.400
Now, in telling my story of
rise and reversal, I wanted,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.870
from the beginning, to personalize
it in the lived experience

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.120
of one man and his family.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.390
I chose Daniel Murray and his
family, because I admire him

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.500
and because as it turned out
he was even a better choice

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.120
than I realized initially.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.890
And that is because his
arc fit the overall arc

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:02.100
of the narrative almost perfectly.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.950
I also chose to focus on the
black elite for two reasons.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.090
One was to underscore
the heterogeneity

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.950
of the African American experience.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.410
In our own time, we hear common
reference to a phrase that's one

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.970
of my pet peeves, "the
black community,"

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:29.080
as if 42 million Americans formed
an indistinguishable block.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.890
African Americans are certainly
not a monolithic group today,

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:40.150
but nor were they even in the
time before the Civil War.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:46.530
The second reason that I focused on
the black elite is because they put

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:52.740
in highest relief, the absurdity
of the notion of white supremacy.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.310
They were not works in progress.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:01.200
They had achieved high
levels of education,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.180
accomplishment, gentility.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.350
They were prosperous.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.650
They were doctors.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.950
They were lawyers.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.250
They were businessmen.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.220
They were entrepreneurs.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:21.790 position:56%
They were district or federal
office clerks or held higher titles.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.710
So, they gave the lie to the
contention by white supremacists

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.140
that black Americans were incapable

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.460
of contributing to
mainstream society.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.220
Now, Daniel Murray was born

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.240
in Washington's sister
city of Baltimore.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.080
And he came here at about
age 18, after the Civil War.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.770
One of his half siblings who
lived here was a caterer,

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.900
and at the time he was
the proprietor of one

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.190
of the two restaurants in the
United States Capitol Building.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.410
Now, in The Capitol Building
there was a restaurant

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.200
on the Congressional side
and on the Senate side.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.990 position:56%
And on the main floor of The
Capitol was The Library of Congress.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.000
That's where it got its start,
and that is where it remained

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.370
until 1897, when it moved over
to the dedicated new structure

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.920
that we now know as
The Jefferson Building.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.750
So, Danial Murray worked
as a waiter for his brother

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.780
in the Senate restaurant.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.770
And there, even as a waiter, he
rubbed shoulders with the high

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:40.610
and mighty, including not only
law makers, but the librarian

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.930
of Congress, Ainsworth Spofford.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:49.650
Spofford came to think
highly of Murray,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.670
and he took him under his wing.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.560
He hired him into the library.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.090
Murray Started there
in 1871 when he was 19.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.620
And you know, as I was just in
the cab coming here today I,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.450
for the first time, figured
out, did the math to figure

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.920
out Murray was an employee at The
Library of Congress for 52 years,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:21.630
and it just turns out that he spent
26 in the Capitol Building and 26

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.620
in The Jefferson Building,
divided equally.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:30.920
Yes. Quite a career, but
we'll get to the sad part.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.770
So, he worked in The Library of
Congress, and Spofford trained him

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:41.170
in the librarian's trade,
but in other ways too,

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:46.660 position:56%
including teaching him how to make
research inquiries, and gather data,

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.320
and encouraged him
to pursue languages.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.900
They were very close.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.180 position:56%
Spofford was a true mentor to
Murray, and he advanced him readily.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.170
He got the title of Assistant
Librarian of Congress,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:06.530
and he was indeed Spofford's
personal assistant.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.870
Well, that was all well and
good, but Murray never relied,

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.820
thank goodness, on his Library
of Congress salary alone,

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.330
and many in the black elite
had a second stream of income.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:26.600
In Murray's case he was a real
estate and building entrepreneur.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.880
He was also very active in civic
life, and I mean for decade,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.350
after decade, after decade.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.530
He was the first African
American to be elected

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.310
to The influential Board of Trade.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.740
He also married well.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.120
You know, the black elite

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.850
in Washington was a very
exclusive group, make no mistake,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:53.500 position:56%
and you had to have a certain
package of qualities to be admitted.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.230
Most were light skinned.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.480
Most had money, but
neither one of those alone,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.320
or even the two combined,
would be enough.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.890
The more important question
was who are your people?

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.550
Are you already related

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.710
to established members
of the black elite?

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.540
Do you hail from a family line

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.710
with notable Civil War
heroes or abolitionists?

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.940
Well, Anna Evans did,
and in abundance.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.030
She was from the abolitionist
town of Oberlin,

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:31.820
Ohio and she had attended Oberlin
College before her family moved

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:37.020
to Washington D.C. And she was
from a long line of abolitionists.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:43.230 position:56%
Two of her relatives were two of the
young men who sacrificed their lives

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.410
as two of John Brown's
raiders at Harper's Ferry.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:52.000
Another one of her
relatives was Hiram Revels,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.710
and he was the first
black citizen to serve

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.390
in either house of Congress.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.870
So, this was a great match.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:11.730
Daniel Murray and Anna
Murray were married in 1789.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.480
Thank you.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.300
You're listening very well.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.290
Married in 1879.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:29.430
They had built for themselves an
opulent house, especially in terms

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:35.860
of interior design, in
Northwest Washington on S Street.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.840
Murray was the first African
American to live in that block.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.450 position:56%
He integrated that block, and there
were other black families to follow.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:51.270
Now, there was a time for the
black elite in Washington,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.710
and for African Americans at large,

00:28:53.710 --> 00:29:00.340
where everything was going
swimmingly- the period from 1865

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:06.580
to 1875, so the passage of the
13th, 14th, 15th amendments,

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.850
and also any number of
civil rights measures,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:19.490
culminating in the Civil Rights
Act of 1875, which granted access,

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:24.610
regardless of color, to
all public facilities.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.000
Now, I'm not saying
that color prejudice

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.170
in Washington ever
went away all together.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:36.530
Of course it did not, but there was
a definite trend in that direction,

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.300
to the point where incidents of
discrimination would be called

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.750
out as bucking that trend.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.480
Murray and his cohorts were
primed to think of themselves

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.770
as Americans first, people of
color second, no apology for color.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.070
They were ready.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:02.220
It was the logical next step to
assimilate into society at large.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.030
Nobody knew that that
Civil Rights Act

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:12.150
of 1975 would be the last
civil rights bill passed

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.360
by Congress for 80 years.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.800
As W.E.B. DuBois later
lamented, "The slave went free,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:28.690 position:56%
stood for a brief moment in the sun,
then turned back towards slavery."

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.800
Now, historians will
tell you that the end

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.870
of Reconstruction was
the election of 1876.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:42.090 position:56%
Rutherford B. Hayes was able to
assume the presidency the next year,

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.640
this was a contested election.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:50.780
But Democrats conceded a series of
electoral votes if Hayes promised,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:56.650
which he did, to remove the last
of the federal troops in the south

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.880
that were enforcing
Reconstruction commitments.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.550
Now, I would say that was
the beginning of the end.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:12.280
Sure enough, changes came swiftly
for African Americans in the south,

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.340
but for Murray and other
members of the black elite

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.890
in Washington it was
a slower process,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.480
and it was a staggered progress.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.230
It took them until the decade
of the 1890s to face the fact

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.960
that there was a backward
slide, that it was real,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.170
and that they were not to
be considered exceptions,

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:40.330
regardless of their accomplishments
and their refinements.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:48.370
When the rug was pulled out from
under all African Americans,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.760
those in the black elite
only had further to fall.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.290
More and more the only
thing that was important was

00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:01.130
that one fatal drop
of African blood.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.620
In Washington with
each passing year,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.110
there was more segregation
and more discrimination.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:16.170
In 1897 Murray faced a
case of personal reversal.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.340
I have talked about
how well his career

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.930
at The Library of Congress
was going.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.430
Well, this was until the change
in sentiment in Washington

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:35.270 position:56%
as more southern racists were coming
with their rabid brand of racism

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:39.350
to Washington, and
those black congressmen

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:47.430
and senators were being replaced by
southern, shall we say, colleagues.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.730
Probably not a good word.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.380
Murray lost the support
of Ainsworth Spofford

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.500
after he was no longer
the Librarian of Congress.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.150
He stayed on as Chief
Assistant Librarian.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.360
It had been he who had
conceived of the whole need

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.210
for a dedicated library building,
because the books were overflowing

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.500
to the max in the spaces
they had in the Capitol.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.380
There had to be a great
increase in staff,

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.140
and there had to be a new
organization of staff.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.740
And initially Murray was
chosen to be the chief

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.200
of the new division of periodicals.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:34.550
But, after Spofford could not
support him the new librarian

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:40.310
of Congress enacted a
reorganization that demoted Murray

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:45.650
from his high position and sent
his salary flying backwards,

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.650
not just to what he had been
making before he got a raise along

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:54.410 position:56%
with a new title, but to what he had
been making maybe a decade before.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:34:00.530
And I'll say now, his salary
never rose again for the remainder

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:05.470
of his quarter century service
to The Library of Congress.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.100
Now, what was the problem
with Murray being head

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.800
of the Periodicals Division?

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.660
White men, about three white men,

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.200
had to report to Murray,
white underlings.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.210
That would not do.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:28.890
Now, I'm happy to insert
here that today we are all,

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:35.240 position:56%
and Daniel Murray would be
thrilled to know, that the Librarian

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:42.220
of Congress is an African American
to whom all 3,000 and some Library

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.750
of Congress employees report to.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:55.760
He might question that it was a
woman, but he'd be happy to know

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.570
that it was an African American.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.230 position:56%
[laughter] Now, the [inaudible] came

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.590
with the administration
of Woodrow Wilson.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:10.140 position:56%
Woodrow Wilson was southern bred,
as were many members of his cabinet,

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.350
and it was their idea,
for the first time,

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:20.200
that federal offices should be
segregated according to color.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.340
African Americans worked
in screened off areas.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.880
They had to use "colored
only" toilets.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.060
Same thing with their lunch room.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.170
This extended, sad to say,
to The Library of Congress.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.550
One day Murray finds out
there's a separate cloak room

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:42.980 position:56%
for black men only, and in the lunch
room there's a sequestered area

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.340
for African American employees.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.940
In the public cafeteria,
well, not public after all,

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:54.450
because neither visitors nor
employees of color are welcome

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.800
to eat in the public cafeteria.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:10.580
Now, what the people in the
black elite found out is that,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.020
as I've indicated, they were to
be segregated and stigmatized

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.990
with the rest of the race,
but they were not going

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:21.370
to take these changes laying down.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:26.250
They weren't going to sit back
and wait on white largess.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:36.980
They got organized and in 1898 the
first truly national civil rights

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:43.070
organization in America was formed,
The National Afro-American Council.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:47.630
And Daniel Murray served on
the first executive committee

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:53.650
and was the chief of its
legal and legislative bureau.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:37:00.660
And he and they worked very hard
on a host of issues, anti-lynching,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.610
anti-Jim Crow, and
perhaps most notably,

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:09.270
they were the first civil
rights organization to challenge

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:15.360
in the court system the maneuvering
that the southern states had done

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:22.240 position:56%
to get around the right to vote that
every black American was guaranteed

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.230
in the United States Constitution.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:29.020
Now, I'm sure that many of you
are not familiar with the NAAC.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.530
You've heard about
The Niagara Movement.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.790
Of course we all know
about the NAACP,

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.970
but as historian Rayford
Logan has pointed out,

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.900
The National Afro-American Council
has not gotten the credit it

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:50.550
deserves as the primary precursor
of these other organizations.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.110
The membership was much greater
and it lasted much longer

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.610 position:56%
than The Niagara Movement certainly.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.950
And the NAACP, when they
put together their goals,

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:06.350
their approach, their strategies,
especially the idea of fight it

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:11.520
out in the courts- that
all came from the NAAC

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.650
that Murray was so involved with.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:18.130
But there was an even stronger
political stance that he took,

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:21.250
passionist, as John
called it earlier.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:26.410
That was the belief that
scholarship can be put

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:30.090
to the cause of Negro protest.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.760
So, Murray's goal, Murray said

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.830
that prejudice is the
handmaiden of ignorance.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.180
Now, he had started out
with this list of 270 works

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.580
by African American authors.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.700
Well, believe me, that
was only the beginning.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:50.820
The man become obsessive
about carrying out this work.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:55.390
He was allowed to work in it,
if he had a time here and there

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.390
at The library of Congress, but
most of it he did in his own time.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:04.430
And it just, it mushroomed,
and he moved on.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.590
He always continued
with the bibliography,

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.490 position:56%
but he moved onto biography as well.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:17.330
Then he moved on from African
Americans to Euro-Africans as well,

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:22.250
and he moved from literature and
the polite arts to all fields

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.230
of endeavor, and then
to, as he would put it,

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.580
the colored race throughout
the world.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.120 position:56%
And in the end, and he had
mountains and mountains of sketches,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.250
25,000 biographical sketches.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:40.300
In the end his goal was to produce
a six volume, 800 pages each,

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.820
what he called "Murray's Historical
and Biographical Encyclopedia

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.520
of the Colored Race
Throughout the World."

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.520
This was his grand vision.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.530
This was his opus.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.370
Well, sad to say that he never
did get to see it published.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:03.490
There was no publisher willing to
underwrite an endeavor like that.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.980
Carter Woodson, he tried too.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.780
W.E.B. DuBois, he tried too.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:14.750 position:56%
And it wasn't until the last century
of the 20th century, the last year,

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:17.290
excuse me, of the 20th century

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:24.020
that an Encyclopedia
Africana saw printer's ink.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.380
Now, I am happy to say, and despite
that little dig I had at Murray

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:34.930
about women earlier, because
you know it's true that men

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.550
at the time were loath to give
women the intellectual credit they

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.120
give themselves.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.680
But on the other hand, Anna
Murray was an activist too,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.980
a race activist.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.770
Her husband was very
supportive of what she did.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.270
They were like a power couple,
the way that Mary Church Terrell

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.050
and Robert Terrell
were, for example.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.390
Some of you may be
familiar with that couple.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:01.620
Well, Anna's thing was early
childhood intervention.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.240
You know, Murray said, "The true
test of the progress of a people is

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:12.610
to be found in their literature,"
while Anna maintained that it was

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:20.000
in the home that indicates any
substantial progress of a race.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.410
And her idea was that if you can't
have proper upbringing in the home,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.260
as believe me, the black elite were
careful to do with their children,

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.160
very carefully cultivated.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.820
If that can't always be
the case in the home,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.520
then the next best thing
is the kindergarten.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.020
And Anna Murray is the mother
of public kindergartens

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.870 position:56%
in Washington D.C. And this would be
both for white and for black pupils.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:56.820
She became, you know as
time went by her interest

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:02.450
in kindergartens became more
overtly part of the cause.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:08.640
And she identified early
childhood intervention as one

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.290
of the solutions to
the race problem.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:20.000 position:56%
And she went all over the country as
a race speaker, very well received.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.100
She was quite an orator.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.140
And she always, I must say,
presented a striking appearance,

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:33.450
because there was a strong genetic
tradition in the Evans' family

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.670
to have premature white hair.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:41.150
And so, here she was at a very
young age, still in her 20s,

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.270
and she had this beautiful
white hair.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.410
She was tall and slender.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.740
And very many descriptions of her
are available, because she made

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.910
such a striking appearance.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:05.970 position:56%
But as I say, for all of this action
there wasn't any real progress.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.630
That's one of the reasons
why I admire Murray and Anna

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:15.160
for their civic service on
race issues and other issues is

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.440
because it is frustrating.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.770
They waded in and they stayed in
the water, and they stayed there,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.080
and kept fighting decade
after decade.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.130
And the black elite, they
certainly were disillusioned.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:36.490 position:56%
Many found that their jobs were lost
or stalled, as Daniel Murray did,

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.430
that their incomes were
decimated or irregular.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.270
They were denied access
to public facilities.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:49.560
They faced humiliation and
disrespect on a daily basis.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.360
And most importantly of
all, they lost the prize.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:44:03.020
Washingtonians, as well as
southern blacks, lost the vote.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.320
Now, I'd like to turn
to the next generation.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.100
You know, the Murrays
had seven children.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.810
There were six sons
and one daughter.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:17.680
Two, a son and a daughter,
died as little children.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.840
And they were buried
in a park like setting

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.990
in an interracial cemetery
in Washington.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:30.050
Later it was deemed that that
cemetery was a health hazard,

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:35.520
and Murray had to exhume the
bodies of his little children,

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.090
could find no other interracial
cemetery that would accept them,

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.470
tried 30 different places.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.750
And they ended up having to go to
a new cemetery, which especially

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.430
at that point was described as
nothing more than a potter's field,

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.300
although it's the cemetery

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:57.260
where eventually all the Murray
family members were buried

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.550
and so were many other leading
members of the black elite,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.230
like Blanche Bruce or
John Mercer Langston.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.880
And I'm referring to
Woodlawn Cemetery.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.830
It was especially ghoulish
with the little girl, Helene.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:17.690
She had died of diphtheria, and
so her body had to be drenched

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:23.000
in a solution of chloride of lime
before it could be reinterred.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.940 position:56%
Now, there were five remaining sons.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.140
We all think of the American dream.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.890
One aspect of it is that one wants

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.760
to see one's children do
better than one's self.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.030
Well, this was not to be.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:45.180
If that's true, then the Murray
generation and the generations

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.810
with his sons had much to
be disillusioned about.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.700
His sons went to top colleges.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.060
All five have college degrees.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.510
One went to Harvard.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.170
Three of them went to Cornell.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:07.660
Of course at these schools
discrimination was showing its

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.020
ugly head.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:14.160
The generation before, an African
American could go to Cornell

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.070
or go to Harvard, and
there wasn't any discussion

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:20.930
about separate dormitories.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:26.690
But now the schools would tell
you, in deference to students

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.910
from the south, who found having
to room with blacks odious,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.390
all of a sudden there was.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:37.340
Moreover, if you got through
the experience, nevertheless ...

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.660
I want to mention, as a side, that
one of Murray's sons, his son,

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.550
Nathaniel, was one of
the six African Americans

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:49.930
at Cornell University that founded
the first black college fraternity,

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.790
Alpha Phi Alpha.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:56.160
And that of course was a way
to get around the isolation

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.350 position:56%
and to bond and support one another.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.330
But, when they finished with
their college education they found

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:07.110
that the job pickings
were slim to none,

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:11.080
that there were very few career
opportunities open to them.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:16.390
And that's why Murray's
sons, Nathaniel and Henry,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.190
spent their working lives

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.700
in the colored public
school system in Washington.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.700
Some of you may be
surprised to know,

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.020
some of you may well already
know this, that at the time

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.050
that we're referring to,
the colored school system,

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:35.010
the public colored school system
in Washington was par excellante,

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.790
all the way up to the capstone,

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.410
which of course would
be Howard University.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:44.120
A good reason for why that
was so was because there were

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:50.910
so many shall we say over-educated
black men and women who found

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:58.210 position:56%
such career opportunities so limited
in range that so many of them,

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:03.110
even with PhDs, ended up working
in the public school system.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:10.350
Now, Harold had great job success,
but he had to go to another country

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.670
to find it, namely Mexico.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:20.550
Some of you who know Washington
history may well be familiar

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:27.510
with Lillian Evans-Tibbs, known
professionally as Madam Evanti.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.880
She was a well-known opera singer.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.650
Well, what you might not know is
that she was Anna Murray's niece,

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:38.630
and she faced the same
kind of prospects.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:43.770
She had to go to Europe to
have more career opportunity.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:48.730
She had a life's goal of singing
with the Metropolitan Opera Company

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:54.580
in New York City, but because of
her color, that was never allowed.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.390
Only two of Daniel and Anna
Murray's sons had children.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.340
One had two children, and
Harold had 10 children.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:08.610
You shouldn't be too surprised
that all of the Murray descendants

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:14.650
that are with us today are
descendants of Harold Murray.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.950
I'm honored.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.160
We're all honored.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.600
Your ancestors would be thrilled to
know that you made the great effort

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.960
to make the trip here
today to honor his memory

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.020
and Anna's memory as well.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:35.450
Well, in closing, I have
a fair amount to say

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.870
about what this book can show us.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.210
It's a cautionary tale.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.390
There's no mistake about that.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:50.880
Most Americans cherish our
founding ideals, individual rights,

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:55.600
equal treatment under the
law, religious liberty.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:03.260
We like to think these ideals
were not always honored.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.010
We have shameful chapters
in our past.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:12.340
And to my mind the only way we can
redeem ourselves as a nation is

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:21.290 position:56%
to honor those ideals in the future,
even in times of hyped up fear.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:26.420
We like to believe that there's
a American master narrative

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.540
and that it's one of
increasing freedoms over time.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.150
This story gives the lie to that.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:39.590
The American master narrative
is not unidirectional,

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.970
and it can reverse
direction again at any time.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:49.570 position:56%
I think the most extreme time that
it's happened in our past is the one

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.350
that I've just described.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:57.170
And here was a case where
the Constitution spoke loud

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.180
and clear, but was discounted.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.900
Moreover, we like to think
of our nation as first

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.880
and foremost, a country of laws.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.480
But not only the southern
governments,

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.900
but the United States government
turned their backs on crime

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:25.270
as serious as arson and lynching.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:28.380
So, yes. I think it's
a cautionary tale.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:38.180
Today we struggle with the elements
of wanting our individual rights,

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.520
but worrying about
increased security.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:46.290
And we have to be very careful how
much of the latter we're willing

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:49.980
to give up to fortify the former.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.130
And in this current political
climate we need to worry

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.700
about the ideas that
are floating out there.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:01.310
Some Americans are more
real Americans than others.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:06.060
The very concept of
religious liberty,

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:09.420
one religion being
favored over another.

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.360
If religious liberty doesn't exist

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:16.010
for all sects, then
it doesn't exist.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:25.210 position:56%
This idea that profiling, whether
it be African Americans, or Muslims,

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:33.990
or Arab looking people- the
problem isn't that we just have

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:38.020
to stop describing it
as politically correct.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.580
It's not politically correct.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.780
It's just correct.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:48.650
So, I would wonder if we
shouldn't move from a state

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:53.420
of caution to a state of action.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.320
Rights won must be rights guarded.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.150
Our founders understood that.

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:06.370
For self-representative government
to succeed, it takes a free press,

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:13.140
and it takes a vigilant
and informed citizenry.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:18.630
Rights won must be rights
guarded, or else, as in this case,

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:21.580
they will need to be rights re-won.

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:28.990 position:56%
And it was a slow and torturous
climb back up for African Americans.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:36.270
I told you there's no
happy ending to this story,

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:42.650
but I would maybe close
by echoing the words

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:46.490
of Congressman John
Lewis, "Get in the way.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:51.450
Get in trouble, good trouble."

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.510
Thank you so much.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:54:10.830
[applause]

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:15.040
&gt;&gt;JOHN COLE: We are squeezed
for time, so Elizabeth,

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.090
she's going to answer 3 questions.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:23.670
So let's have, does somebody
have a question for her?

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:29.400
In the back.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.700
Yes sir?

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.000
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.980
&gt;&gt;ELIZABETH: Yes, I
was asked to expand

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.760
on Daniel Murray's business career.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.230
You know, he was well to do.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.320 position:56%
In fact, he was one of the most well

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.590
to do black Americans
in Washington for sure.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:54.390
And as I mentioned, he never relied
on his Library of Congress salary

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:58.670
and instead he was very savvy
in acquiring real estate.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.830
And you look at the original black
leader in Washington- we're talking

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.290
about what some of you would
be familiar names like Cooke

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:09.810
and Syfax and Brent and Wormley.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.180
These were people who
were here early.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:18.850 position:56%
They had a leg up and that
included the opportunity to buy land

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.700 position:56%
that later became prime real estate.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.860 position:56%
Murray came here right after the war
and he had those early pickings too.

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.450
He also invested in
stocks and bonds.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.020
He had numerous houses.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.870 position:56%
He was both a building entrepreneur.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:36.310
He hired 50 black men
at any one time.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:41.940
And his father in law and his
mother was his construction foremen

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.920
and he built way well over
100 structures in Washington-

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.230
sometime these were houses for
friends like Pinckney Pinchback.

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.750
Sometimes they were spec houses.

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:58.930
In one case, he built three
houses near Logan Circle.

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:02.370
One for himself and two to rent.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.860
In the end, once he built
his house on S Street,

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.380
he rented all three of those.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.490
He also had properties in Maryland.

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:15.510
So, he was a savvy investor
and given the stall that he had

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:19.720
in salary at the Library of
Congress, that served him well.

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.560
&gt;&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible)

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:07.320
&gt;&gt;ELIZABETH: Well, I'm going to
talk a little bit more about Murray

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:12.180
and his cohorts and their
efforts to make change-

00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:16.040
both politically and otherwise.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.310 position:56%
I do want to mention first, his
association with the Board of Trade.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:25.030
That was a very influential body
given the government in Washington.

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:27.470
And Murray, as I think I mentioned,

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:30.800
was the first African American
elected to the Board of Trade

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.560
and did you know that the
number of blacks increased,

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.860
but it never kept pace
with the overall increase

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.240
of numbers on the Board of Trade.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:45.540
And then there were fewer
and fewer African Americans-

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:51.900
not only proportionally, but Daniel
Murray was part of that Board

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.160
of Trade until he died in 1925.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:59.460
I think he may well again of
been the only African American

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.580
on the Board of Trade
at the end of his life.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:05.300
Well, there were two issues that he
was compassionate about and worked

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.910 position:56%
on the Board of Trade and got to see
ultimately after decades of effort,

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.540
success with both of them.

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:17.830
One was to establish in Washington,
manual trade high schools.

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:22.820 position:56%
Manual education I call it, I should
say because Murray was very sure

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.730
that this wasn't about
training for trades,

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:29.900
this was about acquiring
an employing both the head

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.080
and the hands to understand
drawings and to be able

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.720
to manufacture something
from you know, two dimensions

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.930
to three dimensions and so on.

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:43.320
And eventually, he and the
other members of the Board

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.980
of Trade were able to see two
such high schools established

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.960
in Washington and one for
white pupils and Armstrong

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.760
for black pupils and Anna's
brother, Bruce Evans was principal

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.070
of Armstrong for many years.

00:58:56.070 --> 00:59:00.080
And the other was, to
establish in Washington,

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.410
a free public library open to all.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:08.930
The Library of Congress books
don't circulate there of course

00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:11.390
and at this time they
didn't have extended hours.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:15.020
So, that was very important and
that eventually was realized

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:21.430 position:56%
with what was initially called the
Carnegie Library Mount Vernon Square

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:25.980
and of course lead directly to
the Marlin Luther King Jr Library.

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.030
So, those were two, those were
two elements that he worked

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.110
on that he could see
through to fruition.

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:35.230
There were so many
others that he did not.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:38.790
You know, the National
Afro-American Council- some

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:43.590
of the people involved
included T. Thomas Fortune,

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:46.670
He was really the instigator.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:52.510
Along with Bishop Alexander Walters
who was the President for so long.

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:56.660
And Murray interestingly
enough, he's not a lawyer.

00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.080
He was chosen to be the head of
the legal and legislative bureau.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.700
And part of the reason for that
is, over his time in the Library

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.670
of Congress and at one point he had
been assigned to the law library,

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:13.400
he had not only a self-taught
thorough grounding in law,

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.810
but he gained much experience
writing legislation and he,

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:24.150 position:56%
you know, whether it be with African
American supporters or whether it be

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:28.480 position:56%
with white congressmen and
senators and he knew how to network,

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.050
there were many cases where
legislation that was presented

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:37.540
by a congressman or a senator was
in fact written by Daniel Murray,

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.640
including the whole e
tax plan for Washington,

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:49.620 position:56%
DC- a change in the structure which
was another Board of Trade activity.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.920
But, again and again
Washingtonians had to fight

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.990
against Jim Crow cars
coming into the city.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.800
They had bird-dogged
that issue because over

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.380
and over again it would come up.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.650
You know his, another
active participant

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:10.460
in the NAAC was George White

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:15.840
and he introduced the first
anti-lynching legislation

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.510 position:56%
and then there was one after another
all the way into the 1920's and none

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.800
of them ever got through.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.030
Now, what Murray worked really
hard on was in Louisiana,

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:33.020
there was a grandfather's clause,
was part of their new constitution

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:37.940
which was a way to suppress,
almost entirely the black vote.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.480
In their constitution called
for a literacy requirement.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:49.340
But, they said that if anyone
was the descendent of the man

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:54.190
who could vote in 1865,
then they were exempt.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.110
They were grandfathered out.

01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:02.440
Well, that was, I mean obviously,
that's such an obvious way

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.940
of getting around the intent of
the 15th amendment and Murray

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:15.480
and the other officers in the
NAAC, took this on and as I say,

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.780
it was the first time

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.650
that a national civil rights
organizations said let's fight it

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:21.950
out in the course.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:24.950
They didn't get as far as the
Supreme Court on a technicality,

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.430
but they certainly
lead the groundwork

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.950
for that approach in the future.

01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:34.640
&gt;&gt; PAM JACKSON: So we actually
said 3 questions and we are going

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.160
to change our mind
and keep it to two.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.670
&gt;&gt;I'm sorry, I blabbered
on too long.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.640
&gt;&gt; PAM JACKSON: And, it is
with very deep appreciation

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.090
that we have you here and that
you've shared the knowledge

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:46.690
that you've shared.

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:48.080
First of all, you talk
with no notes.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.880
My gosh, the entire time.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.150
It was really awesome, but I think
that one of the things that I'd

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:56.590
like to emphasize here is how much
we care about reading and writing-

01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:59.700
not just because we do it,
but because we get to share it

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.750
in the way you shared today
and make it come alive

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.060
and make it real for us.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:08.770
I feel now personally mentored
by Daniel Murray from this talk-

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:11.460
even more so from the words
on the page although the words

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.530
on the page are absolutely
exquisite too.

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.140
So, first of all, if you
haven't bought this, go buy it.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.040
It's outside and there'll
be book signing.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.280
Elizabeth is generous enough to
stay with us for a little while

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.680
for book signing outside
shortly, so make sure you do that.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.670
Again, on behalf of the Center
for the Book and on behalf

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.580
of the Librarian of Congress,
Carla Hayden, I thank you for being

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.520
with us and joining us
today in partnership

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.670
with the Daniel A. P. Murray
Association who has a special gift

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.590
for the family which is this "Black
Americans in Congress" book -

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:44.890
they have a copy for each

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.510
of the family members
who are with us today.

01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:55.460
[applause]

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.930
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

01:03:56.930 --> 01:04:00.200
And we want to very much
honor and celebrate you.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.910
Your heritage, your
gift, your families gift.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:07.990
The gift that Daniel
Murray is to us is huge.

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.230 position:56%
We can all take away from this talk,

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.700
however much we knew before
we came into the room.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.630
We certainly had an
opportunity to take away

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:19.890
