1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,610
You are listening to radio lab radio. W.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,990
N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. E. R.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,090
All right. Okay, so let's just do the
open. All right. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab
and today we're going to be talking,

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,140
well, let, let's do it
this way. Which way I, uh,

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,860
I was at the 92nd street y in New York
City, a big gathering spot for up, uh,

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,150
cool people with new books and that
particular we is Richard Dawkins. Richard,

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,620
don't you like him?

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,440
Make it so easy for
him? I decided to begin.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,300
This is a real problem for a lot
of people by quoting him to him.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,240
Um, you right. I Dunno if it's
in this book or some other,

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,830
the total amount of suffering per year
in the natural world is beyond all decent

13
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:57,250
contemplation. During the minute it
takes me to compose this sentence.

14
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:01,480
Thousands of animals are being eaten
alive. Others are running for their lives,

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,170
whimpering with fear. Others are
slowly being devoured from within,

16
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:09,760
by rasping parasites. Thousands of
all kinds are dying of starvation,

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,310
thirst disease. It must be.

18
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:15,280
So if there's ever a time of plenty,

19
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,640
this very fact will automatically lead
to an increase in population until the

20
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:22,360
natural state of starvation
and misery is restored.

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,480
Darwin was worried by the same
thing. I mean Darwin recognize the,

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,110
the total horror of the
suffering in nature.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,330
It's one of the things that
actually made him lose his faith,

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,670
but he also realized that it's not
just a fact that it happens. It's,

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,060
it's intrinsic to natural
selection that it must happen.

26
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,530
And when you look at a beautiful animal
like a Cheetah that appears to be

27
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,840
beautifully designed for something like
a cheater is amazingly well designed

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,250
apparently for catching gazelles and
gazelles are amazingly well designed for

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,480
escaping from,

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,810
from Cheetahs that they are
the end products of a sort
of evolutionary arms race

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,460
in which thousands, millions
of animals have died. The,

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,810
the shaping, the,

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,900
the carving of the shape of a cheetah
or a gazelle has come about through

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,470
millions of unsuccessful gazelles
being caught and the successful ones,

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,800
um, making it through, only
to be caught later probably,

36
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,390
but after reproducing and passing on
the genes that helped them to escape.

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,750
So the sheer number of deaths
that lie behind the sculpting of,

38
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,060
of these beautiful creatures is
horrifying. And at the same time it goes,

39
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,500
it's got a kind of savage beauty

40
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,363
[inaudible]

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,250
um, why do you blame
them? This exactly what?

42
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,810
Because I was sitting there thinking,

43
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,170
I know the cheetahs chasing eat antelopes
but wasn't there a nice cheetah ones

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,020
that went over to the antelope and
said, here, have a sandwich together.

45
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,040
And maybe something about the Cheetah and
the had something to do with an act of

46
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,660
kindness. And imagine that you see,

47
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm thinking that maybe it's not
just meanness that can sculpt,

48
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,200
but maybe niceness can sculpt too.

49
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,103
The exact

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,280
niceness as a, as a [inaudible]

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,000
[inaudible] niceness as a scout ball.

52
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,190
Ooh, I wouldn't listen to that show.

53
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,530
Wait a second. We are that
show. We should do it then.

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,740
Let's do it today on radio lab.

55
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,823
Goodness,

56
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,030
selflessness, altruism. If the world
is so cruel, how do you account for it?

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,860
Yeah, how should we think about
it? And when you do see generosity,

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,820
how do you know what's really generous?

59
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,623
[inaudible]

60
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,680
right? So we're going
to start the show, uh,

61
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,120
with a story that sort of embodies the
last question you asked about a guy named

62
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,260
George Price,

63
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,930
who is a mathematician we never heard
of until our producer Lynn Levy told us

64
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:21,110
about him. She heard about it
from an author, Orin Harman,

65
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,850
who wrote a book called the price as
in George Price of altruistic down,

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,420
you know, this is a high
school photo. So okay,

67
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,220
so the people on the radio
can't see the picture.

68
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:35,270
So describe what he looks like. Well, I
tell you, he looks a bit like sort of a,

69
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,250
some kind of Scandinavian
prince in the 17th century.

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,690
Good looking guy. Totally. Um, definitely
something about this guy's eyes.

71
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,140
His eyes. Yeah. This was described to
me by a number of people who knew him.

72
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:51,170
He had a gaze that you sort of
walked away from at your own peril.

73
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,640
There was something that, you
know, he, he sort of new things.

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,360
You could start George's story anywhere.

75
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:59,880
But let's start in 1943 today,

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,630
George graduates from college and
he's this very kinetic kind of guy,

77
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,523
really athletic.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,910
You'd swim in the surf and he did a lot
of rock climbing and by all accounts he

79
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:13,560
was incredibly brilliant and right after
college he starts to kind of bounce

80
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,410
through history. He
was all over the place.

81
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:21,240
First place he ends up is the Manhattan
project on uranium in Richmond,

82
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:25,800
so he was working as a chemist on the
atom bomb when he was done with that.

83
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,930
After a couple of years he made a 90
degree turn and started working at bell

84
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,850
labs on transistor research.

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,470
Solved some very basic problems there
and then disappeared like a phantom.

86
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,220
Started working at a medical
center on oncology research,

87
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,990
meaning cancer and I remember going to
his lab playing hide and seek all these

88
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:50,010
bottles and tips to this time.
George had a wife and two kids.

89
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,790
You look under the microscope
at slides of blood and Kathleen,

90
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,800
but he never really saw them that much.

91
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,290
Work 56 straight without sleeping on beds.

92
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,060
Can I remember? He was
always stuff like that.

93
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,690
Gone a lot when the kids
are still pretty young.

94
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,690
You were like five and six
he left his family. Yeah,

95
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,133
just left

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,000
turn another 90 degree corner and
began working on computer aided design.

97
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,310
In fact, he invented computer aided
design. He was firing in all directions.

98
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,220
What do you think was driving him
to keep moving from thing to thing?

99
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,070
He just wanted to succeed at any cost.

100
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,410
It made no difference in what field.

101
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,670
And at one point in time
he was corresponding with
about five Nobel laureates

102
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,810
each in a different field.

103
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,070
He wanted to have one great
discovery that would make his name.

104
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,620
So that's, that's George. Wow.
Quite a guy. Very interesting guy.

105
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,950
So what happens next? So next what
happens is he gets on a boat and he,

106
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:55,680
he goes to London. When was
this by the way? It's November,

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,290
1967 and uh, in London,
that's where things, um,

108
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,280
for our purposes start to really
happen by what happens in London. Well,

109
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,570
he starts looking for this question.
He goes from library to library.

110
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:10,830
There are 13 libraries that he would hang
out at and the question that he finds

111
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:15,510
for himself, which is weird
considering his personal history, um,

112
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,250
is

113
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,083
why family?

114
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,430
Like why do people have family?
Like, why do families stick together?

115
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,510
There are a lot of

116
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,760
sort of dynamics within the family
where it would make more sense for an

117
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,350
individual to sort of break out.

118
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,440
No, go it alone. I'm like, he
had and yet family persists

119
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,110
and there should be a good reason for it.

120
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,330
He even wrote about the question
to his daughter, Dear Kathleen,

121
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,890
my big paper will be on the
evolutionary origin of the human family.

122
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,240
In most species,

123
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,650
the father just mates with the mother and
she does all the childbearing herself.

124
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,180
But in the human species,

125
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:54,800
the dominant pattern has involved care
by adult males toward their own children.

126
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,320
Why did our species evolve this way?

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah,

128
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,320
it just brings back what kind of a
father our father was towards us and

129
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:12,910
basically there was kind
of this benign neglect.

130
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,990
Mm. But this question, why family
was only the beginning, uh,

131
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,790
why family led him to a bigger question,

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,680
which is why does anybody
help anybody? Huh?

133
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,620
Well, what do you mean? If you
think about, um, Darwin's ideas,

134
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:32,370
survival of the fittest, think
about what that really means.

135
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:37,080
It means if you are a creature,
you have two big important jobs,

136
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,810
you got to survive and you gotta
be fit, right? Whatever that means.

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,420
Fitness really means how
many babies can you make,

138
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,020
how many babies are you making? And
so if you do some stupid, you know,

139
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,150
harebrained thing, that means you can't
stay alive and or you can't make babies.

140
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,960
That doesn't make any sense. Right?
And yet, wherever you look in,

141
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,310
you see creatures

142
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,340
doing this from bacteria to insects,

143
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,060
birds and and wasps. Fish.
I'll give you an example.

144
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,640
There's a species of Amoeba called
Disco Tealium, discoid, IOM Wa,

145
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,810
which usually the Amiibo
sort of lives on its own.

146
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:14,520
It's a single celled organism in the
forest. But when resources are low,

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
what it does is it sends out this chemical
signal and all the other Amoeba who

148
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,870
are also single celled,

149
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,860
they start sending out signals and they
start sort of crawling until they all

150
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,300
meet and they become one slug,
which is now a single organism.

151
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,510
And the slug begins to sort of move
along until it finds a place that's windy

152
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,450
and sunny, at which point it stops.

153
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,020
And the top 20% of the slug,

154
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,410
the top 20% Amoeba in the head of the
slug begin to create out of their own body

155
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,374
a star

156
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,590
which hardens

157
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
and they die while doing so.

158
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,260
But the stock allows the bottom 80% to
climb up the stock and to create an orb

159
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,010
at the top of this stock.

160
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,460
And from there all the Amoeba
that aren't, you know, dead,

161
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,320
they can catch a wind

162
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,230
to better pastures. It's like a dandelion.

163
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,790
So what's happened is that the top 20%
have really sacrificed themselves for the

164
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,380
back 80% and that's an Amoeba. So we
figured what the hell is happening here?

165
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,770
This was a great mystery
to Darwin and Darwin said,

166
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:36,200
this is in fact the greatest
mystery and the greatest riddle.

167
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,170
And if I can't answer it, then
my theory isn't worth anything.

168
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,980
And for a hundred years when people
talked about evolution, this thing,

169
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,590
altruism is the elephant in the room.

170
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,320
So we were curious about
this. Sorry, I'm, I'm,

171
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,110
how might you take this elephant,

172
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,010
this niceness thing that seems to be
everywhere and shove it back into the mean

173
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:02,570
old theory of evolution? We, it's gotta
be a way. So we called up Carl Zimmer,

174
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,840
who's a journalist we have on the show
quite often and writes a lot about

175
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,674
evolution.

176
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,130
And he told us in the 1960s just as
George Price was starting to ask these

177
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:12,900
questions, some scientists
came up with a [inaudible]

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,140
new way of thinking about
altruism, a thought experiments,

179
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,000
which you ran us through.
Okay. So, okay, so, so Robert,

180
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,170
do you have siblings? I have a sister.
Okay. You have a sister, Sarah. Okay.

181
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,120
Let's just imagine that, um, you guys
are like home from college. Say Okay.

182
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,750
And there's a flood at the crawl away,

183
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,850
which manner and the
water flooding around.

184
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:39,970
And you can see that your
sister is about to die.

185
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,990
If you save your sister's life and
die in the process, your jeans,

186
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,150
Robert Curology's jeans
are gone. Yup. Yup.

187
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,080
Right. This is the problem. Yes. But you,

188
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,500
your sister a have the
same parents? Yes. Okay.

189
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,480
So your sister has 50% of your
genes, so if I rescue her,

190
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,610
then half my genes survive.
Right? 50% move on. Oh No.

191
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,060
If you had a sister and a brother

192
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,700
and you saved them both lead each
have 50% so it's a watch and so it's

193
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,200
effectively, it's like it's like
saving Robert Kralik in his entirety.

194
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,500
Mathematically speaking,
mathematically speaking. Right.

195
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,210
Can you do this with cousins? Yeah,

196
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:25,540
actually if you step it back to cousins,

197
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,670
what percentages are, that's a quarter.

198
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,230
In the case of the grist cousins that is,

199
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,450
it's an eight so I have to have eight cut
first cousins to equal my full genome.

200
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,500
Right? Yeah.

201
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:36,763
Do you have that money?

202
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,660
I have 32 third cousins and that's why
I always round them up at a Rodeo every

203
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,040
year and done and you place
them all together. Your mom,

204
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,240
you guys stay here in case
something happens to me,
but here's what I don't get.

205
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:49,070
Like how does this actually operate?

206
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,560
Like Robert's not going to sit there
while the manners flooding and be like,

207
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:55,630
well, let's see cousin, it's an eight
then a second cousin at the 32nd no,

208
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:59,840
you understand the math has already
been done. The math is already,

209
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:04,610
the math has been done by evolution on
genes and those are the jeans you got.

210
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,470
Oh, so you're saying that the,

211
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,070
that evolution has turned the math
into an instinct. Yeah. You got it.

212
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,280
I don't think I get it. Like so
what is the instinct here? The,

213
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,550
I know I want to save my sister. Yeah.
Well, so here's how I understand it.

214
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Since this has half your genes and
since second cousin only has a 32nd

215
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,720
theoretically,

216
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,720
your instinct to save your cyst should
be 16 times stronger than your instincts.

217
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,040
No, that's actually roughly
proportionally. Correct. But keep in mind,

218
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,150
this was just an idea.

219
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,560
It's just a thought experiment until our
Guy George Price comes along and writes

220
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:45,920
an equation, which shows
mathematically how an instinct like

221
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,730
this could evolve. Very
powerful. Okay. So,

222
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,030
well do you want me to just read the
letters? Yeah. What is the equation?

223
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,340
What equals what. Okay.
Okay, so it's a, uh,

224
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,780
w times Delta z equals the
covariance of w I come a Z,

225
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:06,860
I plus e, we call it e, w. I, Delta, z. I,

226
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,200
no, of course. Yeah. There you go.

227
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,760
Well, complicated. I mean, it was
simple a second ago. It, yeah,

228
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:17,440
it sounds a little complicated. He's not
just dealing with like a simple setup.

229
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,320
It's like he's got a traits and how
they affect the different groups and how

230
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:25,400
things change over time. So it's a big,
there's a lot going on in there. Okay.

231
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,293
Yeah. All right.

232
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,550
Do you understand what you
just said? Not so here.

233
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,170
This is a really interesting
word, or we should read it.

234
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,000
When he did write the equation, he walked
off the street into the university,

235
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,660
University College of the
University of London in London.

236
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,090
Completely unknown. Why just moved from
America. No one knew who, who he was.

237
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,950
I went to talk to a professor Smith
and actually showed equation to the

238
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,240
professor and said, is this new?

239
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,290
I felt sure that someone
must've discovered it before
the professor looked at it

240
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,310
and after a very, very
short amount of minutes,

241
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,040
gave him an honorary professorship
keys and the keys to a,

242
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,093
to an office.

243
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,930
Great. One of the best genetics
departments in the world.

244
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,920
So George is sitting in his office,

245
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,810
which by the way is on the site of
Darwin's old house. Whoa. Yeah. And uh,

246
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,410
he's made this big
discovery and he's thinking,

247
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,843
thinking,

248
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,600
thinking philosophically
that what it all meant.

249
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,083
Thank you.

250
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,680
If I can write a formal mathematical
treatment of the evolution of a trait like

251
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:41,461
altruism,

252
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:46,461
what it means about the trade is that
that the trait is never really purely

253
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:48,930
altruistic.

254
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,280
Mm.

255
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,380
If making a sacrifice helps me in
the end or helps my jeans sorta like

256
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:58,240
selfishness in the skies.
Yeah. If that's true,

257
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,330
the world is a terrible place.

258
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,460
[inaudible]

259
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,750
does. It means that there's no true,

260
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,570
there could never be true
selflessness in the world.

261
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,110
My math means that there cannot
ever be true selflessness.

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,650
Yeah.

263
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,180
And I can't accept a world like that.

264
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,920
Why could he suddenly not accept the world
like that? I, yeah, I don't know. Um,

265
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,110
or other things it might be
because precisely because
he had been so selfish for

266
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,400
most of his life.

267
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,280
[inaudible]

268
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,280
and so he decided in his own life to
embark on a program of radical altruism

269
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:36,850
that would prove that there was true
selflessness in school and that's what led

270
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:37,990
him to the streets of London

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,520
in search of homeless people.

272
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,500
There are licks down and outs and he
began by sort of just walking up to them,

273
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,260
introducing himself a little. My
name is George, what's your name?

274
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,530
How can I help you? It's random
people on the street. Yeah,

275
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,480
everywhere I go I keep running into
down and out alcoholics to whom I give,

276
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:02,350
when I have anything and with whom
I sit and drink from their bottle.

277
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:06,550
If they offer me a drink by people's
sandwiches or give them a few pounds,

278
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,260
whether it's by giving them money,

279
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,900
cleaning a filthy kitchen and
then God, Lord, bigger job.

280
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,450
You started giving out keys to his
place, dividing these guys into his home.

281
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,660
People were coming and going.
He was giving them food clothes.

282
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,110
And after a few months of charity
like that, he was out of money.

283
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,560
There was one letter that he had written
to John Maynard Smith and other great

284
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,900
biologist of the era which said, John,

285
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm down to my last 15 p and I can't
wait to get rid of the f the last 15 huh?

286
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,680
He thought he was proving
his equation wrong.

287
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,920
So by getting poorer and poorer
and giving away all this stuff,

288
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:44,400
he was somehow negating the thing.

289
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:48,690
His math seemed to say was inevitable.
The selfish instincts. Yeah. You know,

290
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:52,650
he had self preservation instinct and
he was gonna fight the self preservation

291
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,340
instinct and,

292
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,400
and he was going to win to sort of beat
the mathematics that he himself had

293
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:00,060
written. So he was approaching it
almost like a, like a math proof. Yeah.

294
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,790
Just the red one that you'd be
[inaudible]. When he ran out of money,

295
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:09,440
George moved out of his apartment and
into this Bandon house in a part of London

296
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:12,410
called Tomer Square, which one
does the volume for my headphone,

297
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,870
which is where he met
Sylvia. It was rough.

298
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:19,760
They were just cause they were just
poles holding the walls up some,

299
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,050
some places at balls.

300
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,440
She was a young artist also squatting
at the time and the buildings are

301
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:26,830
crumbling. You know, people
who had made, makes shifts,

302
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,920
staircases and George
had like a room, well,

303
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,490
a few clothes on the floor. Not much,

304
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,530
but you could see he was always thinking
he would go around asking other people,

305
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:44,090
does anybody have shoes? They don't
want so and so needs a pair of shoes.

306
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,250
You know, that would be part of it,

307
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:50,180
but it might also be like
if somebody was sick,

308
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,960
getting them to a doctor because if
you didn't, if you were homeless,

309
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:57,620
it's very hard to have a doctor. But
like I said, all this is going on.

310
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:58,880
At the same time,

311
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,680
he was getting thinner and thinner.

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,250
The sin neck and then these clothes,
it just hung around him. Hmm.

313
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,680
He began writing letters to his
daughters, apologizing, weeping.

314
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,451
Dear Henri, sorry,

315
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:18,060
I deserted you like that and I'm sorry
it was such a poor father to you. Yeah,

316
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,340
I've been a terrible father.

317
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:22,610
Looking at your picture now makes me
wish I could do it all over again.

318
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,330
Maybe where I come into the
picture is to leave you.

319
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,700
And then he wanted to
begin again. She says,

320
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:33,470
George asked her to marry him over
and over for us. I thought it was, um,

321
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,090
kind of a joke and I was Saint
George, we can't get met, you know,

322
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,950
she said no each time and that
at a certain point he gave up.

323
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,800
It's hard to really, really remember,

324
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,360
but it was cold or is
it as a winter came on?

325
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,653
Um,

326
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,273
okay.

327
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,990
You wouldn't see George's often.
He became quieter. I think.

328
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,560
I just remember, um,

329
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,850
I'm quieter. One morning,

330
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,810
this guy that was sharing a squat
with George name is Shmuley Katia.

331
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,710
He was heading out the door.
He found beneath the door. Um,

332
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,850
as he was going out of the building,
he found beneath the door a letter.

333
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,040
And since they were living in a squat,

334
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,860
he was afraid that this was some kind of
eviction notice or something like that.

335
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,690
He didn't read English,
he couldn't read English.

336
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,990
So he ran up the stairs and knocked on
George's door because George was the only

337
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:37,640
one who could read English.
And when he knocked the door,

338
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:42,641
sort of kind of went in a bit and
he could see in the aperture that,

339
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,350
that there was blood all
over the linoleum floor.

340
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,990
Money had enough of an opening.

341
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:53,860
He could see that George was sitting
there with no blood left in his body.

342
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,810
He killed himself. Yeah.
He took a pair of, um,

343
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,770
of scissors and cut through his
carotid artery, which is a very,

344
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,720
very sort of terrible death.

345
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,223
[inaudible]

346
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,130
oh,

347
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,340
[inaudible]

348
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,310
thanks to producer Lynn Levy
for more on George Price,

349
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:26,790
be sure to read Oren Harmon's
book, the price of altruism.

350
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,620
And thanks also to Carl Zimmer. His
latest is microcosm. We'll be right back.
