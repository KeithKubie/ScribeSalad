00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.480
 Let us solve some of the issues of the foundations 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.420
 Which require a division 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.340
 If I ask you what is the result of 5 ^ 6 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.370
 5 5 ^ 2? 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.700
 Well, we can go for the basic definition 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.420
 For the foundations we say that 5 ^ 6 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.470
 Means 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.730
 X 5 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.030
 5 multiplied by itself six times 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.720
 And 5 ^ 2, is 5 multiplied by itself twice, ie 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.770
 Is equal to 5 × 5 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.380
 Well, we know how we can simplify a fraction or relative phrase 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.620
 Like this 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.470
 We can divide the numerator and set it to 5 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.900
 Then we delete, then divide on 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.110
 5 Others, delete these 5 and those 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.960
 What will we have left? 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.220
 5 × 5 × 5 × 5/1, or can say that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.540
 5 ^ 4 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.320
 Now, notice what will happen 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.060
 We started with 6 in rugs, 5 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.580
 Multiplied by itself six times in rugs, then 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.720
 We put up 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 We could have put the 2 in the place 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 So we have 5 ^ 6-2 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020
 That is, we could have put the Ace in 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.620
 The place with the bass in the rugs 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.610
 Let us remember how this can be attributed to beatings 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.790
 If I had 5 ^ - let me use a different color 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.570
 5 ^ 6 × 5 ^ 2, as seen in 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.330
 Another offer that this equals 5 ^ 6 + - 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.970
 I try to make the colors distinctive here - 6 + 2 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.670
 Now, we have a new property 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370
 In the next show, we will see that these two are not 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.940
 Are different 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.210
 They are really two sides of one coin, when we learn 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.520
 More on negative grounds 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.250
 But in this video, we saw that 5 ^ 6 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.040
 Divide on 5 ^ 2 - Let me type it 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 In a different color - and the output is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.830
 5 ^ 6-2 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.580
 Ie 5 ^ 4 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 Here is equal to 5 ^ 8 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.095
 When we hit two numbers with the same foundation, we collect 

00:02:40.095 --> 00:02:40.830
 The foundations 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.270
 When we divide and have the same foundation, we ask 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.870
 Assam is the first of its kind 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.250
 Let's solve a bunch of additional examples of this 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.470
 What is the result of 6 ^ 7. 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.710
 6 ^ 3? 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.060
 Well, again, the same property can be followed 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.190
 This equals 6 ^ 7 - 3, which is equal to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.430
 6 ^ 4 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.540
 We can beat it this way as we did in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.680
 The first issue we realized is that it is equal 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.840
 6 ^ 4 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.460
 Let's try something interesting now 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.350
 It will be completed in the next video 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.140
 Suppose we have 3 ^ 4. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.960
 3 ^ 10 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.240
 Well, if we follow the basic rules, this will be equal 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.100
 3 × 3 × 3 × 3, all this divided by 3 × 3 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.040
 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920
 × 3 × 3 We must have 10 of the number 3 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.310
 how much? 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.960
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.160
 Well, if we do the same as what we did in the last video, this will delete the 3 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.910
 With those 3 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.790
 Delete these 3 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.570
 Delete these 3 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.740
 Delete these 3 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.590
 And we have 1 / - one, two, three 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.730
 Four, five, six 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.090
 If 1/3 ^ 6, right? 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.970
 We have 1/3 ^ 6 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.029
 But the content of this property I talked about 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:24.820
 This equals 3 ^ 4 - 10 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.010
 Okay 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.590
 How much is the product of 4 - 10? 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.630
 We will get a negative number 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.690
 Which is 3 ^ -6 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.350
 If we use this property, we will get the output 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.670
 3 ^ 6 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.400
 And when we hit them we will get 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.680
 1/3 ^ 6 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.690
 The fun part of all this is that for those 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.100
 Same amount 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.930
 If you think you now realize what it means 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.520
 We have a number raised for negative 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.040
 3 ^ -6 = 1 / 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.630
 3 ^ 6 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.990
 I will solve many examples in 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.790
 Next video 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.520
 But if you raise any number for a negative force, for example 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.110
 a ^ -b, this is equivalent to 1 / a ^ b 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.230
 These two images are two sides of a single coin 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.770
 At the beginning of this video, we saw that if we had a ^ b 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.670
 / a ^ c, this equals a ^ b-c 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.010
 This is another property that we have used 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.510
 Now, to use what we have learned now and what we have learned in 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:32.160
 The latter offer, in solving more complex problems 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.630
 Let's say I have a ^ 3 b ^ 4) 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.180
 / a ^ 2 b) ^ 3 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.290
 Well, we can use the property we learned to simplify 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.010
 The amount inside 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.800
 This is equal to - a ^ 3 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.650
 / a ^ 2 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.110
 Is a ^ 3 - 2 equal? 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.190
 Its final simplification would be a 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.150
 You can imagine, this is a × a × a 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.690
 / a × a 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.260
 We have a left in the rugs 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.080
 We now come to our b words b ^ 4 b b 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.630
 This is equal to b ^ 3 true? 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.990
 Ie b ^ 1 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.810
 Because 4 - 1 = 3, and then all this amount within the parentheses is raised 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.140
 Force 3 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.060
 And we do not want to forget the 3 power here 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.220
 Power 3 These are the same ones 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.110
 Let me do it 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.485
 Force 3, then this a 

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.990
 Written in orange is the same as a here 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.280
 I think we understand the relationship between each value 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.850
 Now the property can be used when we multiply 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.730
 Number and raise it to force 3, this is equal 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.820
 a ^ 3 × b ^ 3 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.140
 All raised to power 3 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.700
 This equals a ^ 3 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.770
 a ^ 3 I will write it here 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.880
 X b ^ 3 × 3 × b ^ 9 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.830
 We want to simplify this 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.680
 As much as possible 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.240
 Let us solve another example 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.980
 I think it's a good and valuable training 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.150
 You will gain experience later 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:33.220
 Suppose we have 25xy ^ 6 / 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.190
 20y ^ 5 x ^ 2 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.315
 If again, we can rearrange the numerator and 

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:43.400
 Maqamat 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:50.890
 We can write as follows: 25/20 x 

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.940
 x / x ^ 2, right? 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.170
 We created the denominator 20x ^ 2 y ^ 5 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.850
 It does not matter which order we follow - x y ^ 6 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.140
 / y ^ 5 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.470
 Let's use the property we've just learned 

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.150
 To simplify the fractions 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.220
 25/20, if we divide each of the numerals and denominator on 5 

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.240
 We'll get 5/4 

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.990
 x x x ^ 2 - Well, there are two methods 

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.880
 To think about these 

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.890
 We can consider it x ^ -1 

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.080
 We have 1 power here 

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.240
 1 - 2 = -1 

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.169
 If this equals x ^ -1 

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.169
 Or equal to 1 / x 

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.620
 Both are equal 

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.690
 Let's take this picture 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.510
 1 / x so 

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.900
 It will be x / x x x 

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.050
 One of the x deletions 

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.560
 Our remaining 1 / x 

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.160
 Finally, y ^ 6 / y ^ 5 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.540
 Equals y ^ 6 - 5 which equals 

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.230
 y ^ 1 or y if y 

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.730
 If we want to write all this in a way 

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.410
 One relative term, as follows, is 5 × 1 × y 

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.690
 Which is equal to 5y and all this divided by 4 x x 

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.930
 These y / 1 if 4 x x x 1 each this amount divided by 4x 

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.240
 We have simplified it
