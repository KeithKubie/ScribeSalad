00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:14.230
The 
Slurpee was invented as a commercial product

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.880
more or less by accident by a Dairy Queen
franchisee Omar Knedlik in Kansas City in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.949
the late 1950s.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.530
Born in 1915 and having grown up relatively
poor, after WWII Knedlik used his pay from

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.849
his time serving in the war to open a small
ice cream shop.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.480
After rinsing and repeating with various business
ventures (some successful, some not), by the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.660
late 1950s, he’d scraped enough money together
to purchase a Dairy Queen franchise.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
The commonly told story, corroborated by none
other then Knedlik’s son, Phil, in an interview

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.770
after his father’s death in 1989, is that,
struggling with a malfunctioning soda fountain,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.020
Knedlik began storing bottled soda in his
freezer, which cooled, but did not entirely

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
freeze, the beverages into a delicious slush.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.660
However, according to none other than the
company website itself, Knedlik simply didn’t

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.780
have a soda fountain (not even a broken one)
in the early days of running his Dairy Queen

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
franchise, so made due with putting the bottled
soda in the freezer.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.190
Whoever is correct, Knedlik putting the bottled
beverages in the freezer turned out to be

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.050
an accidental stroke of genius.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.410
The sometimes slushy result quickly became
a customer favorite, in turn spurring him

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.250
to start advertising his drinks as “The
Coldest Drinks In Town.”

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.630
At this point, you might be wondering why
the soda didn’t always just freeze all the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.630
way through.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.990
Recall that back in the 1950s, most soda was
sold in glass bottles that had very smooth

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.430
interior surfaces, and the soda itself had
few extraneous particles.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.470
For any ice crystal to form at temperatures
found in a typical freezer, it has to have

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.470
something to grab onto (technically, a nucleation
site).

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.210
However, in the hermetically sealed glass
bottles of soda, unmoving in Knedlik’s freezer,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.250
this wouldn’t necessarily happen.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.720
When the soda was removed, however, two factors
potentially worked on it to begin to create

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
slush.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.880
First, if the soda was supercooled (below
the solution’s freezing point, but not frozen),

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.250
just by moving it, this created additional
interactions that could sometimes reveal previously

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.400
unrealized nucleation sites, causing localized
freezing.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.260
Second, even if the liquid wasn’t “supercooled,”
but was at close to the freezing point of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.560
the solution, when the carbonated bottle of
soda was opened, the dissolved CO2 under pressure

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420
suddenly returns to atmospheric pressure,
so outgasses.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.230
Beyond potential further jostling of the liquid,
this outgassing results in a slight drop in

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.730
the temperature of the remaining liquid via
the expanding gas absorbing heat from the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.010
surrounding solution, particularly causing
a temperature drop around the outgassed bubbles.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.670
The result of all this can potentially be
a previously liquid solution turning quite

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.090
slushy.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.420
Back to Knedlik- with customers clamoring
for it, Knedlik began tinkering with equipment

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.900
he had sitting around, including an old ice-cream
maker and a car air conditioner.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.990
His goal was to create a device that would
consistently produce slushy sodas on demand.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.990
Knedlik eventually came up with a working
prototype- essentially a spinning stainless

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.940
steel barrel with coils filled with Freon
wrapped around it that would keep the pressurized

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.190
liquid, originally root beer, cooled to 28°F
(-2°C).

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.760
He later hooked up with a manufacturer, John
E. Mitchell Company- a company that sold aftermarket

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.760
car air conditioners, to come up with a version
of the machine that could be mass produced,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.180
and together they patented a “machine for
dispensing semi-frozen drinks and control

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.180
therefor.”

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.780
Their patented version more or less worked
exactly as the prototype:

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.520
Water and flavor were combined and poured
into the machine . . . then gaseous carbon

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.890
dioxide was added.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.980
A refrigeration system cooled the mixture
[and] a pump designed to achieve the desired

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.410
consistency would . . . regulate[] temperature
and kept the mixture from either freezing

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.410
or melting.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.630
The result is a partially frozen foam-like
liquid that comes out of the tap.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.540
Free from the pressurized chamber, the CO2
then causes the slushy solution to puff up,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.380
at the same time dropping the temperature
slightly via the outgassing, as previously

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380
described.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.670
This results in the whole solution freezing
into a more solid slush, with the sugar in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.840
the liquid, besides helping it to taste good,
ensuring the solution doesn’t turn into

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.680
a solid block of ice.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.100
Knedlik initially thought to call the product
Scodasice, but the final name and logo settled

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.120
on was ultimately ICEE, thought up by design
artist Ruth Taylor.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.120
By 1965, Knedlik’s icees were being offered
in approximately 100 stores across the country.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.020
It was then that 7-Eleven came calling, wanting
to put the product in their stores.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.980
The license 7-Eleven ultimately purchased
came subject to conditions, however, including

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.880
that it had to call the product something
other than ICEE.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.750
After a brainstorming session in May of 1966,
7-Eleven’s then advertising director Bob

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.900
Standford noted how the drink made a slurping
sound when one drank it.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.850
He later stated, “The first time I heard
that sound through a straw, it just came out

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.850
‘slurp.’

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.601
We added the two e’s to make a noun.

00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:59.550
It was just a fun name and we decided to go
with it.”

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:14.250
And thus, the most famous version of this
particular drink, the Slurpee, was born.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:27.180
And 
the rest, as they say, is history.
