00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.770
Imagine you're trying to throw something heavy
as far as possible… the best way to do it,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.040
is hold on, and spin in a circle to add momentum,
right?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.820
Now imagine you're the Earth and the thing
you're throwing… is a rocket!

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.089
Hey there Florida wannabes, I'm Trace, this
is DNews!

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.089
Thanks for swimming over.

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.740
Florida; the land of endless beaches and verdant
marshes.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.080
Oh, and we can't forget the hurricanes, of
course.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.470
Knowing all that, why would we start a space
program there?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.210
In the late 1940s, rocketry was taking off.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.080
At the U.S. government missile range in New
Mexico, scientists were trying to figure out

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.090
how to control the flight of highly explosive
giant metal tubes.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.360
In 1947, a V-2 rocket, launched, took an unplanned
flight over El Paso, Texas, and crashed in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.710
Juarez, Mexico.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.650
The U.S. had to pay damages and deal with
the international fallout.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.880
They needed to move out of New Mexico -- they
considered going to Washington, California,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.370
Alaska, Baja, or the Banana River Naval Air
Station in Florida.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.590
Baja would have been fantastic but, because
of the Juarez incident, the president of Mexico

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.200
didn't want missiles flying over his citizens.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.659
Florida would be the place.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.119
In 1948, the Banana River station was renamed
the Joint Long Range Proving Ground, and today

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.740
it manages operations for Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.479
The coast of Florida was perfect for the United
States' space program, not just because the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.590
weather is pretty good, but also it wasn’t
a heavily populated area, and the site was

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.079
accessible by road, ship and rail.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.079
But there's another reason...

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.920
I reached out to former NASA astronaut, Michael
Lopez-Alegría, and asked him…

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
why Florida?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.000
"I don’t want to get into the orbital dynamics,
but the closer you are to the equator, the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.490
better it is to launch because you, when the
earth is turning, you get the speed of the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.139
velocity of the point that you’re on, with
respect to the rest of the universe as an

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.869
added acceleration.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.469
So, at the equator i think it’s something
like 1200 feet per second, and it gets lower

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.439
as you go further north, the north pole is
nothing.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.179
So Florida, which is at 28 degrees, it’s
good."

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.470
Just like the example from the beginning,
if you're going to throw something really

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.530
far, spin first!

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.380
Once you're off the ground and heading for
space, the Earth's rotation really helps.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
If you are on the equator, you're already
traveling 465 meters per second sideways,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.420
so you get a payload advantage.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.240
Rockets can use less fuel for the same lift.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
Which is ideal.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.820
"Also the ocean is there, so we like to launch
over water, so if we, somebody won't, if we

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.980
have a bad day it wouldn’t land on somebody’s
head."

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.700
When NASA launched Bumper 2 in 1950, the first
launch ever done from Cape Canaveral, the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.590
rocket reached an altitude of 248 miles, a
record at the time!

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.040
Florida was hot!

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.840
Since this part of Florida was basically just
a beach and a military base, the government

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.480
built a huge amount of infrastructure to support
space operations.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.270
And then in 1958 -- only a few months after
Sputnik kicked them in the space-butt -- a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.550
Jupiter C rocket carried Explorer 1 into orbit
-- the first satellite put into Earth's orbit

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.980
by the United States.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.220
It launched from Florida.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220
So did the first American, Alan Shepherd in
1961.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220
Today, we still launch from Florida, because
they've got the infrastructure, they've got

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.310
the expertise and they have the best spot
in the continental United States to launch.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.680
All 135 space shuttles were launched from
Florida, because they could get all the parts

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.100
there by ship or rail and assemble them in
NASA's unique VAB -- vehicle assembly building.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.310
The MSL Curiosity launched from Florida!

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.530
The rover is the size of a small SUV, and
weighs almost 2000 pounds!

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.810
For such a huge, heavy launch, the coast of
Florida gives that payload advantage, making

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.690
it easier to get something so big into space.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.370
And now, the next generation of rockets too!

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.600
See, Cape Canaveral, Florida is 28 degrees
above the equator -- so it's in a great spot

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.700
for launches.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.930
Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California,
is a bit higher up, at 34.4 degrees, and Russia's

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.960
Baikonur facility is a crazy 45.6 degrees!

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.090
Each of these things require different orbital
calculations, and muscle to get to orbit.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.210
The further north or south you go, the more
fuel you need to get the same result.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.600
The European Space Agency's launch site is
in French Guyana, only 5.2 degrees north of

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.250
the equator, and they get a 15 percent payload
advantage over Florida because of it!

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.239
When it comes to space, even though there
are giant snakes and sometimes crazy weather,

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.460
Florida is still the ideal place in the continental
United States for space, both now, and moving

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.150
forward into the commercial space era!

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.260
"I am totally convinced that more people that
are not space professionals will get to see

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.690
what flying to space is like.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.240
One day we’ll look back to today as we do
to the 1920s and 30s and think well that was

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.310
when commercial aviation really took off,
well now is when commercial space is about

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.310
to take off.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.660
No pun intended."

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.680
If you've never been able to see a launch
from Florida, I'd highly recommend it.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.060
Add an element of space to your next Florida
vacation!

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.930
I drove from Washington, D.C., to Florida
to watch the very last space shuttle launch,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.180
and it was moving, and amazing and so many
things.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.330
Best roadtrip ever.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.830
There's nothing like seeing a real launch...and
no better place to view a launch than Florida!

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.640
If you want to see a launch visit WeAreGoFL.com,
or download their We Are Go Vacationauts app.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.590
So now that you know why they launch from
Florida…

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.500
Florida does get more than 100 days of rain
a year, does that screw up rocket launches?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.500
What causes launches to get cancelled?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.080
Find out in this video!

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.770
Central Florida has more lightning strikes
than anywhere on Earth, except Rwanda.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.310
And giant metal needles do tend to attract
lightning strikes!

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.220
But NASA prepares for this, but what if it
happens in flight?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.610
That would actually be really bad.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.150
So, they constantly gather weather data and
if one thing is off, they either wait or they

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.680
scrub the launch for another better day.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.290
Would you ride a rocket to space like Lopez-Alegria?

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.020
Or would you rather stay Earthbound?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.130
