00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
 

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.710
In this problem, we're given an
urn with n balls in it, out

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.510
of which m balls
are red balls.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.370
To visualize it, we can draw a
box that represents the set of

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.990
all n balls.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.310
Somewhere in the middle or
somewhere else we have a cut,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.750
such that to the left we have
all the red balls (there are

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.670
m), and non-red balls.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.100
Let's for now call
it black balls.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.250
That is n minus m.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
Now, from this box, we are to
draw k balls, and we'd like to

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.900
know the probability that
i out of those k

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.455
balls are red balls.

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:42.690
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.670
For the rest of the problem,
we'll refer to this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.120
probability as p-r, where r
stands for the red balls.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.180
So from this picture, we know
that we're going to draw a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.330
subset of the balls, such that
i of them are red, and the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.920
remaining k minus i are black.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.830
And we'll like to know what is
the probability that this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.020
event would occur.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.360
To start, we define our sample
space, omega, as the set of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.150
all ways to draw k balls
out of n balls.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.540
We found a simple counting
argument -- we know that size

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.750
of our sample space has
n-choose-k, which is the total

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.710
number of ways to draw k
balls out of n balls.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.300
 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.450
Next, we'd like to know how
many of those samples

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630
correspond to the event that
we're interested in.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.700
In particular, we would like to
know c, which is equal to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.670
the number of ways to get
i red balls after

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.800
we draw the k balls.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.500
To do so, we'll break c into
a product of two numbers --

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.660
let's call it a times b --

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.680
where a is the total number of
ways to select i red balls out

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.520
of m red balls.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.530
So the number of ways to get
i out of m red balls.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.820
Going back to the picture, this
corresponds to the total

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.340
number of ways to
get these balls.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.000
And similarly, we define b as
the total number of ways to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.150
get the remaining k minus i
balls out of the set n minus m

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.340
black balls.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.890
This corresponds to the total
number of ways to select the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.820
subset right here in the
right side of the box.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.080
Now as you can see, once we have
a and b, we multiply them

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.600
together, and this yields
the total number of ways

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.470
to get i red balls.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.335
To compute what these numbers
are, we see that a is equal to

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:54.280
m-choose-i number of ways to
get i red balls, and b is n

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.570
minus m, the total number of
black balls, choose k minus i,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.160
the balls that are not red
within those k balls.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.670
Now putting everything back, we
have p-r, the probability

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.260
we set out to compute, is equal
to c, the size of the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.250
event, divided by the size of
the entire sample space.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.700
From the previous calculations,
we know that c

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.410
is equal to a times b, which
is then equal to m-choose-i

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.000
times (n minus m)-choose-(k
minus i).

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.460
And on the denominator, we have
the entire sample space

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.110
is a size n-choose-k.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.810
And that completes
our derivation.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.080
Now let's look at a numerical
example of this problem.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.630
Here, let's say we have
a deck of 52 cards.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.290
And we draw a box with n equals
52, out of which we

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.400
know that there are 4 aces.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.660
So we'll call these the left
side of the box, which is we

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.130
have m equals 4 aces.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.640
Now if we were to draw
seven cards--

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.550
call it k equal to 7--

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.620
and we'd like to know what is
the probability that out of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.340
the 7 cards, we have 3 aces.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.610
 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.420
Using the notation we did
earlier, if we were to draw a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.000
circle representing the seven
cards, we want to know what is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.550
the probability that we have 3
aces in the left side of the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.650
box and 4 non-aces for the
remainder of the deck.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.570
In particular, we'll
call i equal to 3.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.990
So by this point, we've cast the
problem of drawing cards

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.810
from the deck in the same way
as we did earlier of drawing

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.210
balls from an urn.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.970
And from the expression right
here, which we computed

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.630
earlier, we can readily compute
the probability of

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.280
having 3 aces.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.360
In particular, we just have to
substitute into the expression

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.370
right here the value of m equal
to 4, n equal to 52, k

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.980
equal to 7, finally,
i equal to 3.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:29.300
So we have 4-choose-3 times n
minus m, in this case would be

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.260
48, choose k minus i, will be 4,
and on the denominator, we

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.750
have 52 total number of cards,
choosing 7 cards.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.810
That gives us [the]

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.440
numerical answer [for]

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.890
the probability of getting 3
aces when we draw 7 cards.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.140
