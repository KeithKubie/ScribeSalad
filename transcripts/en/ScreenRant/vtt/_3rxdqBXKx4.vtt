00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.740
Audiences expect to be riveted, surprised,
or simply astonished when a blockbuster film

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.740
comes to theaters.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.380
But what about the stories, messages, and
deeper meanings that being told below the

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.480
surface?

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.090
Most films are exactly what they seem to be,
but every so often, a writer or director will

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.410
craft a hit film that is much, much more than
meets the eye.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.820
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Amazing Hidden
Messages in Your Favorite Movies.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.880
Iron Man

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.101
Jeff Bridges got the chance to show a darker
side when cast as the villain of Iron Man,

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.690
but the visual effects team made it clear
which of the actor’s roles was their favorite.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.330
When Pepper Potts is secretly looking for
evidence on his computer, the documents show

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.540
weapons shipped on a vessel named “Lebowski”
- a nod to Bridges’ role in The Big Lebowski

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.980
released a decade earlier.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.080
His character’s name is also contained in
a barcode for all to see, and exact quotes

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.530
from the movie are easy to read in the fine
print.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.740
Pepper and the viewers had just a fraction
of a second to read all of the hidden messages,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:03.850
since she’s interrupted by none other than
The Dude himself.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.850
Captain America

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.360
In Marvel’s version of World War II, it
was HYDRA and Red Skull who posed the real

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.620
threat to the Allies.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.400
The villain even shrugs off Adolf Hitler,
claiming to be doing real research while the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.320
German leader wastes his time seeking mystical
artifacts.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.650
When audiences remember that director Joe
Johnston worked in visual effects and art

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.580
direction for Raiders of the Lost Ark, the
real meaning of this line is clear.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.370
At the very least, it’s a nod to the plot
of Indiana Jones’ first adventure, and at

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.920
most, a playful hint that the archeologist
existed alongside the Marvel Universe decades

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920
ahead of time.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
The Matrix

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.400
The idea that humanity’s idea of reality
is decaying, or is already erased wasn’t

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.420
a totally original thought when The Matrix
hit theatres.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.560
Once Neo is removed from his artificial life,
Morpheus shows him the world as it really

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.050
is.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.640
That line is taken word for word from “Simulacra
and Simulation” by Jean Baudrillard, a book

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.690
that can be seen in Neo’s apartment.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.700
Considering Neo’s search for meaning, it’s
no coincidence that the book is open on a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.310
chapter “On Nihilism” - the belief that…all
beliefs are meaningless.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.480
Eventually, the philosophy changes, with Neo
accepting that he is “The One”, and even

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.620
being resurrected by the ‘Holy Trinity’.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.780
The religious themes don’t stop there, so
viewers can take their pick.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.780
Jurassic Park

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.230
Before the scientists of Jurassic Park had
learned the dangers of growing dinosaurs firsthand,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.440
they developed a unique method to control
breeding.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.360
Ian Malcolm warned that growing only female
dinosaurs wouldn’t work forever, but Alan

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690
Grant had already proven the theory to audiences.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.530
During the group’s bumpy arrival on the
island, Alan struggles with his seatbelt.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.530
Why?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.390
He’s trying to connect two female ends.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.140
Rather than swapping buckles or giving up,
he fashions his own solution, just as mother

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.060
nature would later in the movie.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.170
Grant, like Life, “found a way”.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.170
Robocop

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.260
With the star of this near-future action film
advertised as “part man, part machine,”

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.300
it’s hard to see how the story could truly
take inspiration from the Bible.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.150
But the events of the movie are a clear match:
Alex Murphy is a hero in a corrupt city, who

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.550
is killed, resurrected, and emerges as a robotic
savior.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.739
Director Paul Verhoeven confirmed that a Biblical
allegory was his goal, even including a scene

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.420
of Murphy walking on water in the film’s
third act.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.780
According to the Dutch filmmaker, an invincible
hero who handed out bullets instead of forgiveness

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.580
was his idea of “an American Jesus,” dishing
out brutal justice in a world torn apart by

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.790
violent crime.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.920
Serenity

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.820
Every Firefly fans know that Joss Whedon’s
canceled TV show was given a second life,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.629
and a conclusion on the big screen.

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.209
But when Serenity was greenlit by Universal.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.519
The crew realized that Fox, believing the
property to be dead, had destroyed the sets

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.000
– meaning they had to be rebuilt from scratch.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.190
The film’s budget had to cover the new ship,
but Whedon made light of the situation, stencilling

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.620
storage containers with the words “REUSABLE
CONTAINER: DO NOT DESTROY” in large letters.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.650
Let’s hope they took the message to heart.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.650
Harold and Kumar

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.250
The story of two stoners in search of burgers
made John Cho and Kal Penn overnight stars,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.420
but Cho previously turned heads in the movie
Better Luck Tomorrow, director Justin Lin’s

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.540
acclaimed story of over-achieving Asian American
teens.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.930
Lin has confirmed the movie is a prequel story
for Fast &amp; Furious hero Han (“Honn”),

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.530
but the same can’t be said for Cho’s character.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.430
Someone on the set of Harold &amp; Kumar was clearly
a fan, and found a clever way of working the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.930
title into the script.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.930
Terminator 2

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.639
When James Cameron’s sci-fi sequel hit theaters
in 1991, it did so with a theme song: “You

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.470
Could Be Mine” by Guns N’ Roses.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.099
But that wasn’t always the plan.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.700
James Cameron has never admitted he made the
film with the band in mind, but there are

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.169
some obvious clues.

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.020
Not only is John Connor’s best friend wearing
an L.A. Guns t-shirt – one of the two bands

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.229
which would lead to GNR – but when the Terminator
finally arrives to take on the villain, he

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.060
reveals his gun hidden in a box of, you guessed
it, roses (31:30).

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.759
Arnold Schwarzenegger personally convinced
the band to sign on, making sure the movie’s

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.580
sales pitch was a successful one.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.650
The Lost World

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.770
Jurassic Park was a difficult adventure to
beat, but director Steven Spielberg tackled

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.909
the challenge anyway, removing dinosaurs from
the island, and dropping them in San Diego.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.529
The added spectacle wasn’t a hit with every
fan, but the director had gotten the chance

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.219
to finally film the sequences and plot beats
that he couldn’t fit in the first movie.

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.219
The Lost World ended with the dinosaurs traveling
back home, and letting Spielberg finally take

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.800
on the role of a fan – literally.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.369
Look closely at the TV reflection, and the
director can be seen with a bowl of popcorn

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.339
in his lap, and a smile on his face.

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:31.339
Prometheus

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.960
The religious themes and imagery of Ridley
Scott’s sort-of-prequel to Alien begin in

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.979
the opening scene, with an alien Engineer
sacrificing himself to seed Earth with life

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.229
– an idea seen in Greek, Roman and Aztec
religions.

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.369
But it’s not the most obvious message.

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:49.949
When the film’s characters uncover an ancient
map to a distant moon, LV-223, the film’s

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.219
Christian heroine sees it as an invitation
to meet her creator in person.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.039
But instead of answers, the crew finds violent
creatures and an Engineer determined to destroy

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.379
all human life on Earth.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.569
It may be unexpected, but apply the Bible
to the story, and some answers are possible.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.879
The moon LV-223 is likely a reference to Leviticus
22:3, a warning from God that “…if any

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.520
of your descendants is unclean, and yet comes
near these sacred offerings…they shall perish

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520
before the Lord.”

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.599
To make the twist on Christianity even clearer,
Scott had planned to explain that an Engineer

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.300
sent to save mankind 2,000 years ago was crucified
instead, but decided that was a little too

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.659
on the nose.

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:26.830
