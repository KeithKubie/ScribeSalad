SO HERE'S THE SITUATION.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.805 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR
WITH OBAMA IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:07.407 align:start position:0% line:91%
VERY COMPLICATED BUT
BASICALLY THIS IS IT.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYBODY AGREES THAT IRAN
WANTS TO EVENTUALLY GET

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:11.544 align:start position:0% line:85%
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:12.879 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.983 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THIS DEAL IS JUST TRYING
TO SLOW THAT POSSIBILITY

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.217 size:75% position:38% line:91%
DOWN, IN CLASSIC CARTOON
TERMS THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.521 align:start position:0% line:91%
POUR MOLLASSES INTO THE
ACME CENTRIFUGES, RIGHT,

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.024 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT THIS
DEAL IS LET'S KEEP IT 100

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.427 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE INTELLIGENT
ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.194 align:start position:0% line:85%
OBAMA'S DEAL.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:29.228 size:81% position:41% line:85%
AND THEN THERE'S THIS GUY.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT
HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:35.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
IRANIAN DEAL, THE ONLY
WINNER ARE THE IRANIANS.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.939 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S RIGHT, DICK
IS BACK!

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.240 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH!

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.109 align:start position:0% line:85%
HEY, COME ON, GUYS.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.344 size:84% position:42% line:91%
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE WORLD WHEN

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:51.851 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU LOSE JON STEWART AND
RETAIN DICK CHENEY.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:55.254 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: SOMETHING NOT

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.456 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.290 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, JON
ACTUALLY WARNED ME ABOUT

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.624 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS.

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:02.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE LEFT ME A LITTLE PAMPHLET
ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE DICK

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHENEY, HE DID.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.732 size:78% position:39% line:91%
IT'S CALLED JON STEWART'S
GUIDE TO HANDLING DICK.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:13.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
PROBABLY NOT THE BEST TITLE.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:19.245 size:81% position:41% line:91%
NUMBER ONE, MAKE IMMATURE
DICK JOKE, COMPLETE, DONE.

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:22.815 line:91%
TAKE A FEW DEEP BREATHS. OKAY,
PENGUIN VOICE: OBAMA IS BAD!

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:26.285 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, CHECK THAT
OFF, OH THIS IS INTERESTING.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:31.891 size:75% position:38% line:91%
IT SAYS SHOW ANY CLIP OF
DICK CHENEY, TRUST ME IT

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.327 align:start position:0% line:85%
WILL BE BULL [BLEEP].

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.330 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
NO WAY THAT CAN'T BE.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.098 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT CAN'T BE THAT EASY.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.067 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.468 align:start position:0% line:85%
ROLL ONE.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:47.440 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU COMPARE OBAMA'S IRAN
DEAL TO NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.076 align:start position:0% line:91%
APPEASING HITLER IN MUNICH IN
1938.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.576 align:start position:0% line:85%
REALLY?

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT IS BULL
[BLEEP].

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.449 align:start position:0% line:85%
JON WAS RIGHT.

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.817 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.454 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO YOU ARE GOING TO OPEN
WITH LINKING OBAMA TO HITLER,

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.156 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S HOW YOU ARE OPENING
IT.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.959 align:start position:0% line:91%
BILLY JOEL DOESN'T OPEN WITH
"PIANO MAN"

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:10.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
DID I JUST LINK PIANO MAN TO
HITLER?

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.464 align:start position:0% line:85%
SORRY, BILLY JOEL.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.332 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, BUT MAYBE IT GOT
BETTER FROM THERE.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.268 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT ELSE DID CHENEY HAVE TO
SAY.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DID A LOT TO LIMIT
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IN THE

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.273 align:start position:0% line:91%
REGION 
&gt;&gt; BUT THE

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.807 align:start position:0% line:91%
CENTRIFUGES WENT FROM 0 TO
5,000.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY MAY WELL BUT THAT
HAPPENED ON OBAMA WATCH, NOT

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:25.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON OURS.

00:02:25.744 --> 00:02:30.550 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, BY 2009 THEY
WERE AT 5,000 --

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.485 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.889 size:84% position:42% line:91%
NO, NOT-- HOLD ON A SECOND,
A FEW THINGS HERE, NUMBER

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:40.193 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE, YOU JUST GOT CAUGHT IN
A LIE, OKAY.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:45.498 align:start position:0% line:91%
NUMBER TWO, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
ACT CAUGHT.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:50.036 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU ACTED LIKE WE'RE IN SOME
SORT OF ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHERE LYING IS TO BE EXPECTED,
RIGHT.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.840 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WHATEVER, BABY, YOU KNEW I
LIED WHEN YOU STARTED GOING

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:58.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH ME.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.545 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT?

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:03.149 size:84% position:42% line:85%
GO GET ME SOME COURVOISIER.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.586 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND NUMBER THREE, AND
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT,

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.589 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF CHRIS WALLACE HADN'T
CALLED YOU OUT ON IT, YOU

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.058 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY FOR
EVERYBODY TO JUST SWALLOW

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:15.595 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THAT POISON PILL, RIGHT?

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:21.500 line:91%
LIKE IT WAS-- A POISON PILL
THAT EVEN FOX NEWS CHOKED ON.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:25.204 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, WHATEVER, IT'S JUST A
LIE.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY IT'S HARD TO
HAVE AN INTELLIGENT

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONVERSATION WITH THIS
IMPERSONATOR OF A HUMAN

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:31.077 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEING.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.113 align:start position:0% line:91%
MR. CHENEY, IT IS ONE THING
TO NOT HAVE A PULSE ANY

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.115 align:start position:0% line:85%
MORE.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:40.186 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT TO NOT HAVE A CONSCIENCE
IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.724 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I MEAN GUYS, HE'S JUST LIKE
SOME CREATURE WHO JUST MAKES

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.025 align:start position:0% line:85%
[BLEEP] UP.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:48.561 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AND LOOK, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
LIKE I'M PICKING ON DICK

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.030 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CHENEY, I KNOW, ACTUALLY I
HAVE TO ADMIT, SOME OF THIS

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:51.597 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS MY FAULT.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.632 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, NO NO.

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0% line:85%
I CREATED DICK CHENEY.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:04:00.573 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, OR MORE PRECISELY,
I SUMMONED HIM.

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:01.440 align:start position:0% line:85%
I KNOW.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.243 align:start position:0% line:91%
I KNOW, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
CRAZY.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.912 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUYS, GUYS, OKAY.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.448 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS A STORY I NEVER TOLD
ANYBODY.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.550 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL
ANYBODY THIS IS JUST BETWEEN

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:12.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
US, AMERICA, OKAY.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.588 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ALL RIGHT SO, I WAS LIKE
NINE AREAS OLD AT THE TIME

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:19.825 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND I WAS ON A-- I WAS ON A
HIKE IN THE WOODS AND I KIND

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:21.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF GOT SEPARATED FROM A
SCOUT TROOP.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.597 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT'S WHEN I MET THE
TALKING DOG THAT I FOUND OUT

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.999 align:start position:0% line:91%
LATER WAS A SHAPE SHIFTING
WITCH.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT,
REALLY.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:32.104 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ANYWAY, THE DOG LEAD ME
TO AN ANCIENT CAVE.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:35.675 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND THEN HE HAD ME REPEAT A
SPELL IN A LANGUAGE I DIDN'T

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.909 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNDERSTAND, OKAY.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:40.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, THE DOG
WAS VERY PERSUASIVE.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.181 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.650 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SUMMON THE DARK LORD
FROM THE ETHER AND WILL YOU

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:49.155 align:start position:0% line:91%
GET LOTS OF TOYS FOR
CHRISTMAS.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:54.593 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT?

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.029 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN
THAT SITUATION, YOU KNOW THE

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:58.364 align:start position:0% line:85%
REST.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:02.134 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE FIERY HELL, THE DEMON
MATERIALIZES, THE TALKING

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:06.672 size:88% position:44% line:91%
DOG REWARDS ME WITH THE KICK
ASS CHRISTMAS AND EVENTUALLY

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:09.442 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE BECOMES VICE PRESIDENT,
INVASION OF IRAQ, BLAME

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.812 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBAMA, WA, WA, WA, SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT, MY BAD, ALL

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:13.779 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:15.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHOOO, GOT THAT OFF MY CHEST,
MAN.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:20.519 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S GREAT.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:23.155 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; JUST EMOTIONAL FROM THE
CATHARSIS, SO I APOLOGIZE

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.490 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR THAT OKAY.

00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:27.126 size:78% position:39% line:91%
ALL RIGHT SO, DICK CHENEY
EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE HIS

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.895 size:81% position:41% line:91%
PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE IRAN
DEAL WHEN PREDICTIONS ARE

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:32.631 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETHING HE IS JUST NOT
THAT GOOD AT.

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:36.502 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SIMPLY STATED, THERE IS
NO DOUBT THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:41.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW HAS WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION.

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.908 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO DOUBT.

00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:51.016 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF I COULD QUOTE NO
DOUBT, DON'T SPEECH.

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:54.687 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT EVEN JUST
POLITICS, DICK CHENEY HAS

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.722 size:78% position:39% line:91%
MADE HORRIBLE PREDICTIONS
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S LOOK AT A FEW YOU
PROBABLY AREN'T EVEN AWARE

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:00.292 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF.

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I PREDICT BRUCE JENNER
WILL NEVER, EVER BE A WOMAN.

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:08.267 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WRONG!

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
WRONG.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
IT'S WEIRD.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:15.040 size:88% position:44% line:91%
KIND OF WEIRD HE WOULD WEIGH
IN ON THAT DURING THE '70s.

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:18.611 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SO I THINK WE'RE ALL AGREED
HE GETS A LOT OF [BLEEP]

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:19.512 align:start position:0% line:85%
WRONG.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.013 size:88% position:44% line:85%
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO CLARIFY.

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:25.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE IS JUST ONE BRIEF
MOMENT WHEN DICK CHENEY GOT

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.519 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOMETHING RIGHT.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.788 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THE '90s, HE SUPPORT THE
DECISION NOT TO INVADE

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.122 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAGHDAD.

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:31.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ONCE YOU GOT TO IRAQ AND
TOOK IT OVER, TOOK DOWN

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.193 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S GOVERNMENT,
THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.762 size:81% position:41% line:91%

MY [BLEEP].

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.476 align:start position:0% line:91%

AND YOU DID IT ANYWAY.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:57.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR IT
YOU NEVER ADMITTED YOUR

MISTAKE AND THEN YOU JUST
DROP LITTLE LIE BOMBS AND

YOU TRY TO MAKE THE BROTHER
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:08.494 line:91%
YOU ARE LIVING IN AN EXTREME
COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THAT NOT

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.830 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN BILL BELICHICK WOULD
RECOGNIZE.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:14.733 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DID NOT CONJURE UP BILL
BELICHICK, YOU GUYS.

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:15.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:17.736 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW LET'S GET BACK TO
OBAMA'S IRAN DEAL.

HERE'S FORMER SECRETARY OF
STATE HILLARY CLINTON'S

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.076 align:start position:0% line:85%
ASSESSMENT.

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:27.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT A DEAL, IRAN'S
BREAKOUT TIME, HOW LONG THEY

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:32.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEED TO PRODUCE ENOUGH
MATERIAL FOR A NUCLEAR

00:07:32.284 --> 00:07:35.521 align:start position:0% line:91%
WEAPON WOULD SHRINK TO A
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:37.790 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH A DEAL THAT

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.492 align:start position:0% line:91%
BREAKOUT TIME STRETCHES TO A

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.261 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND THAT'S SOMEONE
TRYING TO MAKE THE CASE FOR

IT.

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:44.096 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.664 align:start position:0% line:91%
LISTEN, I DON'T LOVE THIS
DEAL EITHER.

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:47.967 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BUT OFTEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE
DEALS WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRUST WHEN THE STAKES ARE SO
HIGH.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.671 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SOMETIMES IT AVOIDS NUCLEAR
WAR LIKE THE SALT TREATIES

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:53.839 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH THE SOVIETS.

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:58.277 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SOMETIMES IT GETS YOU A KICK

BUT HERE'S WHAT UP SETS ME
ABOUT CHENEY.

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:07.453 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING HE
SAYS WHEN HE MAKES

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.554 size:84% position:42% line:85%
PREDICTIONS, THEY'RE WRONG.

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:11.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT TO MENTION HE KEEPS
PREDICTING OBAMA WILL LEAD

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:14.293 align:start position:0% line:91%
US INTO DISASTER WHEN ONE OF
OUR BIGGEST DISASTERS

00:08:14.326 --> 00:08:16.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAPPENED ON HIS
ADMINISTRATION'S WATCH.

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:24.503 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:40.052 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SO YES, I DO HAVE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE IRAN DEAL, WE ALL

00:08:40.085 --> 00:08:43.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO, BUT I TELL YOU ONE
THING, IF CHENEY'S AGAINST

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.390 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT, I'M FOR IT.

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:45.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
