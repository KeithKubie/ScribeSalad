drug addiction is a disease of the brain

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480
drug addiction is a disease of the brain
 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.770
drug addiction is a disease of the brain
it's a disease of the brain we don't put

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780
it's a disease of the brain we don't put
 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.859
it's a disease of the brain we don't put
people that have diseases in the jail or

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869
people that have diseases in the jail or
 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.470
people that have diseases in the jail or
in prison because they actually that's

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480
in prison because they actually that's
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.260
in prison because they actually that's
we decide right i mean this person is

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270
we decide right i mean this person is
 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.519
we decide right i mean this person is
actually has has a what type of disease

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
actually has has a what type of disease
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.130
actually has has a what type of disease
i actually i don't even dare myself to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140
i actually i don't even dare myself to
 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.350
i actually i don't even dare myself to
the concept of of putting someone on

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360
the concept of of putting someone on
 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.180
the concept of of putting someone on
jail because they have a diseases my

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190
jail because they have a diseases my
 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.710
jail because they have a diseases my
brain doesn't even allow me to think

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720
brain doesn't even allow me to think
 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.650
brain doesn't even allow me to think
that way and yet that we do that with

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660
that way and yet that we do that with
 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.350
that way and yet that we do that with
addicted people and and I've thought a

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
addicted people and and I've thought a
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.880
addicted people and and I've thought a
lot why why is our society criminalizing

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890
lot why why is our society criminalizing
 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.460
lot why why is our society criminalizing
the person that's addicted to drugs and

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470
the person that's addicted to drugs and
 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.780
the person that's addicted to drugs and
I think it's because it has been very

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
I think it's because it has been very
 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.630
I think it's because it has been very
hard for people to recognize that our

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640
hard for people to recognize that our
 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.860
hard for people to recognize that our
behaviors and our ability to control our

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870
behaviors and our ability to control our
 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.130
behaviors and our ability to control our
desires it's basically the product of

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140
desires it's basically the product of
 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.420
desires it's basically the product of
very complex systems in the brain that

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
very complex systems in the brain that
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.149
very complex systems in the brain that
enable us to perceive these desires to

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159
enable us to perceive these desires to
 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.899
enable us to perceive these desires to
control them to make the right choices

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
control them to make the right choices
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.490
control them to make the right choices
this is very difficult for people that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500
this is very difficult for people that
 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.480
this is very difficult for people that
have all of their faculties intact to

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
have all of their faculties intact to
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.940
have all of their faculties intact to
understand that not everybody can do it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
understand that not everybody can do it
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.740
understand that not everybody can do it
and and so I sort of easier to say well

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750
and and so I sort of easier to say well
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.620
and and so I sort of easier to say well
if I can do it that person is not doing

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
if I can do it that person is not doing
 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.300
if I can do it that person is not doing
it because they are choosing to just

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310
it because they are choosing to just
 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.760
it because they are choosing to just
have a good time and so we've taken that

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
have a good time and so we've taken that
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.190
have a good time and so we've taken that
approach and and I guess the other

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200
approach and and I guess the other
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.399
approach and and I guess the other
element that happens with drugs the the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409
element that happens with drugs the the
 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.620
element that happens with drugs the the
drive to take these drugs can be so

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630
drive to take these drugs can be so
 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.980
drive to take these drugs can be so
overpowering so so overpowering because

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990
overpowering so so overpowering because
 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.289
overpowering so so overpowering because
it's hardwired in the brain as the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299
it's hardwired in the brain as the
 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.480
it's hardwired in the brain as the
signaling is this is something that is

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
signaling is this is something that is
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.550
signaling is this is something that is
necessary for survival that's what drugs

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
necessary for survival that's what drugs
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.289
necessary for survival that's what drugs
have done in a person that's addicted

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299
have done in a person that's addicted
 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.230
have done in a person that's addicted
they've generated the message as the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240
they've generated the message as the
 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.020
they've generated the message as the
same intense as if you haven't eaten and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030
same intense as if you haven't eaten and
 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.940
same intense as if you haven't eaten and
and it's a signal you have to eat or

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
and it's a signal you have to eat or
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.770
and it's a signal you have to eat or
you'll dry or your diet you have to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780
you'll dry or your diet you have to
 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.649
you'll dry or your diet you have to
drink water or you'll die very very

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659
drink water or you'll die very very
 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.319
drink water or you'll die very very
powerful signals very difficult to

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329
powerful signals very difficult to
 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.359
powerful signals very difficult to
control when you you have anything for

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369
control when you you have anything for
 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.070
control when you you have anything for
one week and you have full in front of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
one week and you have full in front of
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.530
one week and you have full in front of
you just try to say no to that for this

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540
you just try to say no to that for this
 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.610
you just try to say no to that for this
it's the same drive so it they can when

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
it's the same drive so it they can when
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.800
it's the same drive so it they can when
they are in those situation this intense

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
they are in those situation this intense
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.229
they are in those situation this intense
drive they can do behaviors that are

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
drive they can do behaviors that are
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.990
drive they can do behaviors that are
criminal they can go and still you know

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
criminal they can go and still you know
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.760
criminal they can go and still you know
are to be able to get that wrong like

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770
are to be able to get that wrong like
 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.610
are to be able to get that wrong like
someone who has not eaten for one week

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
someone who has not eaten for one week
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.340
someone who has not eaten for one week
if they have nothing but to steal the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
if they have nothing but to steal the
 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.010
if they have nothing but to steal the
food they may steal the food so that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020
food they may steal the food so that
 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.620
food they may steal the food so that
that leads to the criminal behavior that

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
that leads to the criminal behavior that
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.050
that leads to the criminal behavior that
then leads the person and the system to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060
then leads the person and the system to
 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.210
then leads the person and the system to
react very negatively you should not

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220
react very negatively you should not
 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.000
react very negatively you should not
steal of course you should not steal but

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
steal of course you should not steal but

people should not be hungry people
 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.350
people should not be hungry people
should not be on that situation that

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360
should not be on that situation that
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.390
should not be on that situation that
they have to steal in order to it that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400
they have to steal in order to it that
 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.630
they have to steal in order to it that
should not happen like a person should

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640
should not happen like a person should
 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.990
should not happen like a person should
not be not given treatment that is in a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
not be not given treatment that is in a
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.750
not be not given treatment that is in a
situation where their bodies

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760
situation where their bodies
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.890
situation where their bodies
experiencing that draw as if it were a

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900
experiencing that draw as if it were a
 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.080
experiencing that draw as if it were a
survival knee they should be provided

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090
survival knee they should be provided
 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.920
survival knee they should be provided
with treatment so yes we should deal

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
with treatment so yes we should deal
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.630
with treatment so yes we should deal
with drug addiction as a disease like we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640
with drug addiction as a disease like we
 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.550
with drug addiction as a disease like we
deal with any of the other medical

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
deal with any of the other medical
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.370
deal with any of the other medical
diseases we should not be criminalizing

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
diseases we should not be criminalizing
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.830
diseases we should not be criminalizing
it when we criminalize the drug addict

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840
it when we criminalize the drug addict
 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.800
it when we criminalize the drug addict
and nobody wins certainly you're not

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810
and nobody wins certainly you're not
 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.660
and nobody wins certainly you're not
going to improve the behavior of the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670
going to improve the behavior of the
 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.060
going to improve the behavior of the
person that is thrown into jail when

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070
person that is thrown into jail when
 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.740
person that is thrown into jail when
they get out of the jail the first thing

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750
they get out of the jail the first thing
 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.229
they get out of the jail the first thing
they'll do is relapse unless you treat

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
they'll do is relapse unless you treat
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.910
they'll do is relapse unless you treat
them in jail if you treat them in jail

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
them in jail if you treat them in jail
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.130
them in jail if you treat them in jail
and you maintain the treatment when they

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140
and you maintain the treatment when they
 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.530
and you maintain the treatment when they
leave jail then you are giving them a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540
leave jail then you are giving them a
 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.449
leave jail then you are giving them a
chance what if you're throwing them in

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459
chance what if you're throwing them in
 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.520
chance what if you're throwing them in
jail and not providing any treatment or

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530
jail and not providing any treatment or
 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.680
jail and not providing any treatment or
treating them in jail and then throwing

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690
treating them in jail and then throwing
 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.699
treating them in jail and then throwing
them out they will relapse so and that

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709
them out they will relapse so and that
 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.650
them out they will relapse so and that
costs an enormous amount of money to put

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660
costs an enormous amount of money to put
 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.630
costs an enormous amount of money to put
people on jail because they are addicted

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640
people on jail because they are addicted
 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.120
people on jail because they are addicted
to drugs it's very very costly it's not

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130
to drugs it's very very costly it's not
 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.880
to drugs it's very very costly it's not
doesn't make any sense you your tax

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890
doesn't make any sense you your tax
 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.860
doesn't make any sense you your tax
dollar goes into the criminal justice

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870
dollar goes into the criminal justice
 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.100
dollar goes into the criminal justice
system is much less expensive to treat

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
system is much less expensive to treat
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.160
system is much less expensive to treat
and if you treat that person you're

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
and if you treat that person you're
 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.750
and if you treat that person you're
giving that person a chance and you're

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
giving that person a chance and you're
 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.610
