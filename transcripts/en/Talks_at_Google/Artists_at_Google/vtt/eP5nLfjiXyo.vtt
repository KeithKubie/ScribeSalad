[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.029
DAVID: I'm pleased to introduced
legendary nature photographer

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.290
Art Wolfe.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.510
His accolades could fill
a whole talk by itself,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.530
but that isn't
why you came here.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.410
So I'll just highlight
two quick ones.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.750
He won "Nature's" Best
Photographer Award

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.280
of the Year and the North
American Nature Photography

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.900
Association's Lifetime
Achievement Award.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.700
He's here to talk
about his new book,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.370
as you can see on the screen,
"Photographs From the Edge--

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.880
A Master Photographer's
Insights on Capturing

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.440
an Extraordinary World,"
where he presents some

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.142
of his techniques
and pictures, the way

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.850
he got them from around
the world in some

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.340
of the most exciting places
that you can imagine.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.978
Please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Art Wolfe.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.490
ART WOLFE: Thank you.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.250
Well this will be the
first and last time

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.270
I ever give this talk.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.750
This is my 100th
book, and my staff

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.260
informed me about
a week and a half

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.630
ago that I was going
to give this talk.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.600
And I said, now
what was that book?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.610
What was it about?

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.110
And it's a look back over
40 years of taking pictures.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.420
That's pretty cool,
but as a public talk,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.230
they're all unrelated stories.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.870
There's no connection.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.484
So I have padded some of
the more interesting stories

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:27.900
in the last couple
days, and those

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.560
that arrived five minutes early
saw I was redoing that as well.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.640
So this is very
fresh in my mind.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.670
I thought it was going
to be an hour talk.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640
David said I have
five minutes max--

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.740
It's a joke.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.180
But I'll talk fast.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.030
So I'm just going to give
you a little bit of history.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.770
I grew up in Seattle.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.510
It was a postwar family.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.960
I was born in 1951.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.680
And when I turned 16, I got
my first car, an old beater,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.940
and started heading
to the mountains.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.750
So vacations were always
in the nearby Cascades

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.150
or the Olympics.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.470
And I loved the mountains.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.680
And as I got into
my early 20s, I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.500
started moving up out
of the forested valleys

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.340
up onto the very
edges of the glaciers.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.390
Here I am up on Mount Baker.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.250
I have no idea how old I was.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.070
In fact this book,
"Photos From the Edge,"

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.660
is a chronological look
back over time with clarity

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.590
because I am really bad
at remembering names.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm really bad at
remembering where

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.100
I was last week, because
my whole life has

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.950
been just travel, travel,
travel, no five day workweeks.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.030
It's just gone all the time.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.440
So frequently, and
probably today,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.860
when I look back at a photo,
I'll say it's either 12 or 15

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.250
or maybe 20 years ago.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.790
In fact I have not even a clue.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.480
But show me a photo,
and I can tell you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.280
all the things about
that photo, what was

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.770
the circumstances around that.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.957
So I have one of those
photographic memories for that.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:08.540
If I don't know,
I'll just make it up,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.240
because I'm very creative
about that as well.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.890
So here I am.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.540
I went through a phase when I
started climbing the mountains

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.720
and renaming peaks.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.300
You might suggest that I
had delusions of grandeur.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.020
I was renaming mountains all
the time, putting flags up

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.390
on top of mountains.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.340
And none of those names stuck.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.960
But at that age, you think
you can change the world.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.540
So in 1969 I was on top of
a mountain called Snow King,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.230
and I renamed it Apollo Peak.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.940
Well, or so I thought.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.500
And eventually I became program
chairman of the Boeing Alpine

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.080
society.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.030
Though nobody in my family
ever worked for Boeing,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.720
one of my best
friend's father did.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.212
And so we got into the
Boeing climbing club.

00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:53.920
And it was one of
those years where there

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.560
was nobody working for Boeing.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.750
And so I was named
program chairman,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.660
and suddenly I was now booking
famous speakers and climbers

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.920
to our club to give talks.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.800
So I commiserate with David.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.310
And during that
period of time-- now

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.300
this is in the early
'70s-- my sphere

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.860
of friends started expanding
out into the climbing community.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.500
And eventually I
learned how to climb.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.430
I started guiding
friends and family

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.050
up Mount Rainier and the other
volcanoes of the Northwest,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.720
constantly learning
about reading weather

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.410
and learning how to belay and
use ice axes and pitons and all

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.970
those kind of things that are
required to climb mountains.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.220
And eventually I was
invited to participate

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510
on the first expedition of
the northeast ridge of Mount

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.040
Everest, first time
a Western group

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.440
was permitted into mainland
China on through to Tibet

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.030
and up the northeast
ridge, which

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.230
was the route from which George
Mallory and Andrew Irvine

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.880
disappeared in the early 1900s.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.520
It was a rag tag group
of Boeing employees.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.740
And the reason we were able,
by the way, to gain that access

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.960
is that we were selling
jets now to China.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.240
And so we parlayed that
into an invitation.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.620
So here we are in a blue
bus going across the Tibetan

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.550
Plateau.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.450
This was our base
camp at 16,000 feet.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.360
We were on that mountain
for three months.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.450
And we virtually got
to within 800 feet

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.650
of the summit on a route that
we had no knowledge about.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.060
There was no Google
Earth back then.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.800
There was no living
person that we could

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.340
call about the high route.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.070
There was no ladders placed.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.520
It was virtually
an unknown to us.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.590
And none of us were
professional climbers.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.830
So we were the only
expedition on that mountain

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.110
on that winter of 1984
that did not lose a life.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.240
Everybody else was
on the south side,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.300
and it was a brutal
year for climbers.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.100
So these photos,
I was learning how

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.450
to take pictures at altitude,
starting at 16,000 feet.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.220
I topped off at around
25,000 feet at the North Col.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.130
And I never went over
there with dreams

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.870
of standing on the summit,
but I wanted to go over there

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.380
because I studied
history and geography

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.350
and I remembered
all the years I was

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.790
in junior high and high
school knowing about the Red

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.500
Guard of the Maoist troops.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.310
I wanted to see what
Lhasa was and what

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.190
Tibet was all about, because
no information really

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.560
was coming out at the time.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.774
And so if I had
to stand or climb

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.190
on this mountain
for three months,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.210
I would do that just to
have that experience.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.050
But I was learning how to use
foregrounds and backgrounds.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.700
I remember at that
time I was using Nikon

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.760
and I had batteries going from
my pocket to keep them warm.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.895
That was attached to
the cameras frequently.

00:06:56.895 --> 00:07:00.880
And in that era, film would
break in the super cold

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.280
of the temperatures there.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.250
But it was this photo, this
photo that I remember most,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.590
because I was sick
with cerebral edema

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.210
early on in the
expedition, which

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.790
is the swelling of the
brain in the brain case.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.360
And the remedy for
that is to evacuate you

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.780
out and lower elevations.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.840
But in fact there was
a 17,000 foot pass

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.550
that we had to get
out, to get me out.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.660
And that was dangerous.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.380
So I stayed in camp, and
eventually over the weeks

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.330
I got better.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.470
But I was sick at the
time I took this picture.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.920
I was laying in a tiny
little tent freezing.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.870
And I heard these sounds
that sounded like cow bells.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.760
And out of the blowing mist
and snow came these yaks,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.270
caked in snow.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.520
And even at the moment I
took the picture I thought,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.140
there's nothing in this
image that says modern times.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.520
If Marco Polo had a
camera back in the day,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.380
he surely would have being able
to take a picture like that.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.780
And it changed my life, because
though I started in Seattle

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.870
with pictures of wood ducks on
Green Lake and climbing Mount

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.960
Rainier and all
those kind of things,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.510
it was seeing cultures that
really haven't changed much--

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.200
and I knew en route to
Tiber and to the mountain

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.110
that I saw my first
TVs in Lhasa and I

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.630
thought, oh my God, these TVs
are going to really open up

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.800
the world to the people.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.890
Cultures will inevitably
change, and they would.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.070
So when I was photographing
Tibetan people-- because they

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.340
all arrived in Lhasa,
Tibet on February 27, 1984.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.950
It was the lunar new year
of that particular year.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.840
So there were
thousands of pilgrims

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.334
that had ventured from
all corners of Tibet.

00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:44.750
And when I was
photographing them,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.510
it really was obvious
that they had never

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.620
been photographed before,
because they would just

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.200
stare at the camera with
no reaction, no hesitation,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.889
no giggles.

00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:55.430
You know, all the
things that we feel

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.580
when we're being
photographed, they just

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.710
look blankly into the camera.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:05.540
And I knew if I survived
this expedition,

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.150
this is where I would like to
spend much of my future, which

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.640
would be traveling the
world to remote places,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.210
photographing cultures that
would change with time.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.650
And that's, in fact,
much of what I've done.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.290
Though David eloquently
introduced me

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.130
as a nature photographer, I see
myself as more of a journalist.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.970
I photograph virtually
everything besides weddings,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.100
bar mitzvahs, and graduations.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.530
Everything else from back alleys
of cities around the planet,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.130
mining it for the abstracts,
a lot of cultural work, nudes,

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.420
wildlife, landscapes,
cultural, anything

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.840
that piques my interest,
I'll photograph.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.210
The most interesting
story for me,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.730
being on that mountain
for three months,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.830
is you get used to blue
sky, gray rock, and snow.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.730
And my background's
painting and art.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.040
I love color and things
that nourish my soul.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.810
And there was nothing up there.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.110
And yet there was
this monastery,

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.630
one of the highest
monasteries on the planet,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.690
called the Rongbuk Monastery.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.850
It had been bombed to
oblivion by the Maoist troops

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.200
as they were invading Tibet.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.260
And so I would go down there
and just explore the rubble

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.430
of this ancient monastery.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.780
Nobody was living
there at the time.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.950
And it was on my
third trip that I

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.920
started noticing
these murals that were

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.520
exposed to the harsh elements.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.650
And on the fourth
trip, I started

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.890
to see an opening in
the corner on the floor.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.780
I started pulling rocks away.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.650
And I saw that there
was a chamber in there

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.250
that was largely intact.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.110
So I went back to
camp, got a headlamp,

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.510
and came back and explored.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.680
And this is what I
found, amazing murals.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.900
Not perfect, but colorful
and beautiful nonetheless.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.450
And I delighted on bringing
other members of the expedition

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.680
down to discover this discovery.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.760
Since then, from
what I understand,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.805
the Rongbuk Monastery is
repopulated with monks.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:17.140
It has been rebuilt. But back
then, that's what it was.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.430
I lost 45 pounds
in three months.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.210
So I highly recommend
it for losing weight.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.710
Look at that
Walkman, pretty hip.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.430
Walked around in long
johns, yeah, stylish.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.670
I went back to Mount
Everest two years later

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.530
and saw what most
people see when

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.050
they go into the Khumbu Valley.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.000
This is the route from
which most expeditions

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.340
will launch for the summit.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.080
You remember "Into This Air,"
the book by Jon Krakauer?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.590
He is a friend of mine,
as was Scott Fischer.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.860
He lived a couple
blocks from me.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.720
And Scott would always
come to my summer parties.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.550
And so when I watched the
movie earlier this year,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.040
I think they got
Scott pretty well,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.760
Jake Gyllenhaal as the actor.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.690
But this is one of the more
famous mountains en route.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.500
It's called Ama Dablam.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.880
It's very fluted with
avalanche slopes, indeed

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.750
a very difficult but
sublimely beautiful mountain

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.480
rising out of the mist.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.340
One year I went down
to Easter Island.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.130
It was, again, in
the very early '80s.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.710
And I had a headlamp.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.310
I was traveling by myself.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.600
I camped out under these moais.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.910
And this is-- you know,
I'm not a conspiracy--

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.780
I just don't believe in
phenomenon unless I see it.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.110
But I had such vivid
dreams sleeping

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.940
below these giant
monolithic statues

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.330
that I swear to God
somebody touched me,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.900
and I was so frozen with
fear that it took me

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.610
a couple minutes before I moved.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.090
And I sat up and I looked
around with my headlamp,

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.525
and there was nothing there.

00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:55.650
And I'll never forget that.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.130
That's nearly 40
years ago and I still

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.130
have that as a vivid memory.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.510
One year I had the
worst trip of my life.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.800
I went to Siberia in
the winter of 1986.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.670
Everybody was unhappy
in Siberia in 1986.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.270
There was not much
to photograph.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.410
I was invited by the
Russian government

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.500
to come and photograph
Lake Baikal in Siberia

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.360
so that there would
be tens of thousands

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.810
of tourists that would follow.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.930
And in fact I was so
miserable that I never really

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.440
promoted it.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.950
But the only shot that I really
liked on that entire trip

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.140
was this group of
overturned boats.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.780
And I called it winter layover.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.080
What I liked about
the shot was it

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.330
looked like a
serigraph painting.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.010
It doesn't look so much
like a true photograph.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.910
And it's just largely
because of the aluminum

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.210
gray is wearing through
this thin paint.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.625
The bright overcast
light gave it

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.260
a kind of a different quality.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.540
And I shot it with a
tight shot so that I made

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.580
it an abstraction of the boats.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.330
But it's been one of
my favorite photos

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.390
and it was the only saving grace
I had out of that entire trip.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.480
I've not been back
to Russia since.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.330
I had Russian handlers that
would get me so drunk on vodka

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.340
that I can't even look
at vodka to this day.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.870
These are stories that do not
go out of the room, right?

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.830
Any place on the planet
that intrigues me I'll

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.190
wind up going there.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.230
And one of the places
was Ellesmere Island,

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.750
the large island to
the west of Greenland.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.630
It's the most northern
land in the Canadian Arctic

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.750
archipelago.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.970
And when I got up there, it
was in March, very, very cold,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.344
56 below zero with
the wind chill factor.

00:14:43.344 --> 00:14:44.510
These are some of the shots.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.310
Arctic fox would come up
near my camp late in the day,

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.100
beautiful inquisitive.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.440
But it was these stupid
rabbits, these 25 pound Arctic

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.790
hares that really were so fun
to watch because they would

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.060
virtually stand up on their
back legs and duke it out

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.980
like they're trying to hit
each other in the face.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.430
So those are strange things.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.540
I was traveling with
high school friends once.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.260
We went up to Churchill.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.410
We rented a little mobile
car with tracks on it

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.820
and went out and
photographed polar bears.

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.370
And I remember sitting on top of
this little vehicle that wasn't

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.710
much higher off the ground.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.270
It had a hatch on that.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.800
We'd photograph it, and
then invariably and always

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.260
the polar bears would come
towards us, because they

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.310
were extraordinarily curious.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.410
And so there was a real art
of how late do you stay up

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.340
on top of the vehicle before
you close and make sure

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.190
you lock the latch.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:42.350
This would be three or four
years before Tundra Buggies,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.670
an entire tourist
industry came to Churchill

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.710
to photograph polar bears.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.730
This was just some
high school friends

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.520
that were going
out there traveling

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.570
amongst polar bears that were
very, very curious at the time.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.610
It still remains to
be an amazing place

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:58.666
to see these great bears.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.040
And impact in a
month's time I'll

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.940
be back there for the first
time in about 20 years.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.120
I traveled up there on other
occasions in early March

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.430
when the first day
a mother bear comes

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.890
out of a den with her
three cubs, very first day.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.920
We were there a week
waiting for this to happen.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.700
And we finally found that to
be in the late afternoon light.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.250
The last of those three
cubs is definitely

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.290
the runt of the litter.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.840
On the west coast
of Somerset Island,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.840
3,000 whales congregate
in the river estuaries.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.760
And they're mammals
just like we are.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.012
They slough off
skin once a year.

00:16:45.012 --> 00:16:47.470
Where we kind of lost a little
flake here or there all year

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.420
long, they lose it all at once.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.070
And they come into
these shallow rivers

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.170
and they wiggle in the gravel.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.470
But from an aerial
perspective to look and see

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.520
all these beautiful white whales
in one glance, 3,000 of them,

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.554
is a pretty amazing sight.

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:03.970
And when you walk
along the shore,

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.020
they'll literally swim close to
you and watch you walk along.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.609
They're called the sea canary
because they're very animated.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.890
They have all these
chirps and sounds.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.200
Most people see
whales briefly, right?

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.020
You just see a fin
and then it's gone.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:18.970
It's underwater.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.290
It's a real mystery
for most of us.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.250
But these little beluga
whales, which are 15 feet long,

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.550
they're more like a dolphin
in a way, really animated.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.560
One year I spent
$25,000 on the hunch

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.550
that we could go across
the Drake Passage

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.160
and locate the first
colonies of emperor penguins

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.250
on the Weddell Sea.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.820
Well $25,000 that many years
ago was a lot of money for me,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.460
and it is still a
lot of money for me.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.470
But we spent 11 days in Punta
Arenas, the most southern city

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.850
on the planet, waiting
for the weather to clear.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.290
And then we all
got in a DC-6, we

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.610
meaning the four people
I was traveling with

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:08.130
plus an all women's expedition
that were heading to the South

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.490
Pole, a Japanese team that
was heading to the South Pole,

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.080
and one Norwegian.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.580
And the rest of
us, the four of us,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.420
were heading out
to the Weddell Sea,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.580
the opposite direction
to see if there were

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.400
colonies of emperor penguins.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.870
And these are 90 pound birds.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.630
So they're about that
high off the ground.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:26.670
They're extraordinary.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.120
A lot is now known about it.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.590
But when we went
down there, it was

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.960
speculated that they
actually existed down there,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.440
but there was no proof.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.100
So we flew down in a DC-6
and then got in Twin Otters

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.890
and flew out to the coast.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.180
And we found these
colonies of 10,000

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.290
up against frozen icebergs
locked into place.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.580
And the entire colony is mobile.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.410
If the wind shifts,
they all kind of

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.140
move around these blocks
of ice for wind protection.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.000
And these photos were taken
at-- well, the following day

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.280
it was overcast, but this
shot was shot at 2:30

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.620
in the morning in the
month of November,

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.620
which are the longest days
of the summer down there.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.390
So they have one chick.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.740
They arched their heads
over the one chick.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.000
And they make this
very beautiful sound.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.560
And what they're doing
is imprinting their sound

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.995
on that chick, because when
they all go out to sea,

00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:28.660
they all are identical except
for their individual sounds.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.910
So that chick's got to be
able to locate their parents

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.460
or die trying.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.010
So it's a very
interesting story.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.580
I would travel back and
back again over the years

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.950
to the Himalayas.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.670
I have been up to the
Baltoro Glacier and up to K2

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.940
in the Karakoram
range of Pakistan.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:56.220
I've spent a lot of time
in Mongolia, Bhutan, Nepal.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.500
And on one occasion we
traveled across Western China

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.622
to the Khunjerab Pass and
dropped down into Pakistan.

00:20:02.622 --> 00:20:03.580
And I'll remember this.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.670
It was late in the
month of November.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.240
The onslaught of winter
was surely coming.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.720
And I saw this family coming
out of the high pastures

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.100
of the Himalayas.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.110
And very interesting family.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.100
There was two camels.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.810
The first contained the wife
and kids all on one camel,

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.936
and then all their
supplies and their bedding

00:20:23.936 --> 00:20:25.560
and their supplies
on the second camel.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.990
But it was riding
that little donkey

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.830
that wasn't much bigger than a
dog that really was remarkable.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.370
It was those kind of scenes
that you see, you photograph,

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.390
and you'll remember for
the rest of your lives.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.530
I started working on books.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.155
I initially did work for
"National Audubon" magazine,

00:20:45.155 --> 00:20:48.520
for "Smithsonian," and
"National Geographic."

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.140
And then I started
working on books.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.610
And I've been fairly prolific,
although it came as a shock

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.610
that this book that
I'm talking about

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.450
is my 100th book,
because I had no clue.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.210
You could tell me I had done 40
and I wouldn't even bat an eye.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.990
I don't keep track of
those kind of details.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.400
One of the books was
called "Migrations,"

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.290
and virtually it was patterns
of animals on a world scale,

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.700
from schools of fish under
the sea to, in this case,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.770
little brown bats
that were tucked away

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.540
in a cave in Kentucky,
in the Ozarks.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.430
And I remember I was in
there with a professor

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:33.070
from the University of--
those senior moments

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.390
will come to all of you.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.750
So you just breathe and you
change the dialogue-- Arkansas,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.360
there you go.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.260
It's like Tourette's.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.940
You just pull it back out.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.060
Anyway, I remember crawling
on my knees for about 3/4

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.610
of a mile with a
flashlight in my mouth.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.450
And the cave wasn't much higher.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.580
And an entire world population
of little brown bats

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.240
hibernate in these caves.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.340
And with much fanfare
and a lot of pleading,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.460
the professor who did
a census every year

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.140
allowed me to crawl
into this cave.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.640
He says, "It's not
going to be fun."

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.280
I said, "I'm ready for it."

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.170
And so I came eventually
out of about 35 minutes

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.850
of crawling on my knees into
this tiny little chamber,

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.460
completely black.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.330
There's no odor.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.680
There's nothing.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.660
It's just quiet, and then
you turn on the light.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.650
And it looks like
a carpet above you.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.450
These bats are like
300 per square foot.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.890
So they're all hibernating.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.310
And then he tells
me, "You have like

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.140
five minutes because
the heat of your body

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.364
will start to wake them up.

00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:35.780
And if they wake
up, they're going

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.238
to burn enough
calories that you're

00:22:37.238 --> 00:22:40.830
going to wind up killing a
bunch of these endangered bats."

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.065
So in the dark I'm trying to
use flash and photograph them

00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:45.915
and not stand up
because my head would

00:22:45.915 --> 00:22:47.270
crush all these little bats.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.800
So these are some of the
memories for "Migrations."

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.810
Once I have an idea
for a book, I really

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.430
don't stop until
I've got what I want.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.380
I would fly in an
ultralight over Africa

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.120
with this crazy French pilot,
and we would just scoot

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.150
down right on the top of grass.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.440
Another minute we'd be 500
feet above the ground circling

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.000
over herds of wildebeest or
Cape buffalo in this case.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.370
Life is interesting.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.662
This is a lake in the Rift
Valley with flamingos.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.490
I previsualized the shot
out of Jackson, Wyoming

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.730
where we would shoot
this right at sunset

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.490
so it would be
all about shadows,

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.770
not so much about the elk.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.810
So this was "Patterns."

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.180
This was a book
that was inspired

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.920
by the work of MC Escher.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.890
Another book I did was
called "Endangered People."

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.810
It was sanctioned by
the United Nations

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.730
and it was published
by the Sierra Club.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.620
And I would travel.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.160
This was shortly after
coming back from Everest.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.470
And so I would go into
Irian Jaya and photograph

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.720
the Dani people like
this, one of the oldest

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.220
if not the oldest agricultural
societies on the planet.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.710
And they were only discovered
during World War II when

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.805
American pilots were flying over
New Guinea and the Irian Jaya,

00:24:03.805 --> 00:24:05.430
and they looked down
through the clouds

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.600
and they saw fields in a
place that nobody knew there

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.140
was a population of people.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.180
So as late as the 1940s nobody
knew about the Dani people.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.040
So I went in there
and photographed them.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.720
They cultivate
gourds, and that's

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.600
what they wear on their penis.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.950
And that's all their clothes.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.710
That's the extent
of their clothes.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:32.960
Today, there's no doubt baseball
caps and T-shirts and shorts,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.860
but basically the same people.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.960
They've been overrun
by the Javanese

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.220
from the island of Java.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.710
But Irian Jaya is the Western
portion of Papua New Guinea.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.300
Five more minutes, OK.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.030
Well, all right, I'm
just going through.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.710
So "Tribes" was a book.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.190
I traveled all over
the earth photographing

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.210
technologically
primitive cultures, ones

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.920
that specifically
adorn themselves

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.210
during ceremonial occasions.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.930
These were the Xingu
Indians in the Amazon basin.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.010
And at the end of
a big ceremony,

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.930
they would have this
wrestling match.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.950
From my perspective, I
love and I'm motivated,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.580
and what gets me out of bed
is working on a project that

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.870
will see the light of day.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.530
I love to inspire, to
educate, to inform people.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.580
And basically all
the work I've done,

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.450
whether it's culture,
wildlife, landscapes, is

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.660
about inspiring people.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.620
And it's been a great life.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.430
Two days ago I was
up in the San Juans

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.490
photographing breaching orcas.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:41.110
Two weeks ago I was on
a volcano in the Congo

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.240
photographing the world's
largest lava lake.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.850
I spent a week in the wintertime
in South Georgia Island

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.420
in an all out blizzard
with something

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.350
like 100,000 king penguins
working on a book called

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.140
"The Living Wild."

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.390
So it's been a great life.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.570
For "The Living Wild,"
I spent two weeks

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.170
trying to find and
photograph a wild panda.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.160
Almost all pandas
you've ever seen

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.030
have been photographed
in captivity.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.810
They look somewhat
natural, but a wild panda

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.070
is a very tough subject to get.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.286
Tigers were believed
to be-- were

00:26:17.286 --> 00:26:18.410
heading towards extinction.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.130
The leading biologists
in the late '80s

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.820
were predicting that there would
no longer be any tigers left

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.680
in the wild by the year 2000.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.400
And in fact this year,
this year and last year,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.180
there's been a tiger boom.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.520
So there's a lot of
good stories out there

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.960
that wouldn't necessarily get
to you through the chatter

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.060
of the news which
highlights, you know,

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.260
atrocities and bad stories.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.442
But there's more
whales in the ocean

00:26:44.442 --> 00:26:46.150
than there has been
in the last 50 years.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.170
There's more mountain
lions in the United States

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.870
than there has been
in the last 200 years.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.570
So there's a lot of
really positive stories

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.790
that don't necessarily
get out there.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.160
Volcanoes are a love of mine.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.060
I love the power, the
awe inspiring look

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.920
of being around a volcano.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.440
I've done a lot
of work on Hawaii.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.990
I've spent time on
the top of Mount Etna.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.520
Last year, I traveled to
Iceland when the earth was

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.190
bleeding this river of lava.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.570
And can you imagine hovering
in a helicopter at 12

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.340
below zero, and then a
change in the wind comes up

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.400
and it's 65 degrees?

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.190
And that's part
of the experience.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.230
And this river of lava was
coming out of the earth.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.790
It was like the earth was
bleeding blood and fanning out

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:37.670
into this giant delta.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.960
And a week and a half after I
was out of there, it stopped.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.920
And that's the unpredictable
nature of the volcano.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.040
This was shot-- this
is not in the book,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.370
but this was shot two
weeks ago in the Congo.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.940
And it's at 11,000 feet.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.930
I thought I would bring
enough clothes for this.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.700
I'm on the equator, and I am
absolutely freezing to death.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.640
And below us was this
cauldron of a lake,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.770
largest volcanic lake on the
planet, which didn't look

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.690
like much until it got dark.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.240
And then you could see it.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.290
And we arrived on the
summit around 4:00 PM.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.820
And at 4:35, a fissure
opened up and started

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.070
bleeding, all that
lava that's coming

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.350
down out of that opening.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.520
So pretty extraordinary stuff
to see that, to photograph that.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.470
Undoubtedly this will
go into a book that

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.410
will come out in about three or
four years called "Primordial."

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.200
On that trip, we
also photographed

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.740
the annular eclipse of the sun.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.520
So this is the moon
in front of the sun.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.510
It's much rarer of a phenomenon
than the total eclipse

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.660
of the sun.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.600
And that's what it looks like.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.800
So you know what, I
think that's a good place

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:57.020
to end this narrative, because
I know we also have questions.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.770
This would be maybe
the appropriate time,

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.170
because otherwise I've
got like three hours.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.720
No, let me just show
you one more thing,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.020
just because I know you guys
like this kind of stuff.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.890
Hold on just a sec.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:20.360
I did a film with an
Australian group of filmmakers.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.010
Look at all that
we're missing here.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.490
It's a good thing you called me.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.042
And it's now on Netflix.

00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:28.250
It's called "Tales By Light."

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:32.190
So I had a crew of photographers
come out from Sydney.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.360
They're all in their 20s.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.060
And they kept
calling me grandpappy

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.440
with their Australian accent.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.200
But we got along really well.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.604
So we went to Africa.

00:29:42.604 --> 00:29:43.520
We went to New Guinea.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.024
We went to Ethiopia, Uganda.

00:29:46.024 --> 00:29:47.440
And they had a
little [? Robie ?],

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.110
which is a little vehicle
that we could put a camera on.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.770
And when we were doing the
Maasai Mara, East Africa,

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.360
we could hear lions in the
bush, but we couldn't quite

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.280
get the car to where they were.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.760
So we put the camera on
this, drove it in there.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.460
And we could hear
all this chatter.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.960
And I said quickly
reverse it out,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.220
and I'm taking pictures as
we're reversing the little car.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.590
And all these kittens
were following it.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.060
And you could see the
mother in the middle.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.930
And to get shots that we cannot
have gotten handful of years

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.550
ago, a 16 wide angle and
mother's picking up the baby

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.790
right in front of the camera
from a perspective like that.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.070
I think that's part of
what really excites me

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.300
as a photographer.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.770
Technology is changing so fast.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.380
It's hard to keep up with
it, by it's enabling me

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.260
and my colleagues
to photograph shots

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.340
that were only mere dreams
ago, from the stars at night

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.370
to these new perspectives.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.580
This guy was a little
pissed off at this camera

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.410
on this [? Robie ?]
as we call it.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.680
It literally picked up the
entire endeavor by the lens

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.540
and tossed it about
seven feet in the air.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.670
So maybe that's an appropriate
place to end there.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:05.894
All right, so I do--
how are we doing?

00:31:05.894 --> 00:31:09.640
DAVID: Oh, it's up to you.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.360
ART WOLFE: I do travel
quite a bit, as you know.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.100
And on some of those occasions
I take people back to places

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.460
I really love.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.210
One of those places is Myanmar.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.000
Myanmar is a place
that's changing fast,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.130
because when I first went
there about 10 years ago,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.910
there was hardly any tourism.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.600
And now every year
there's a lot more.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.101
But it's still an
amazing place to go.

00:31:32.101 --> 00:31:32.767
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:35.761
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:38.515 --> 00:33:39.220
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.500
ART WOLFE: So that's enough
of a commercial there.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.690
But people that go with us
have a great amount of time.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.250
We set up good shots.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.260
We know the area.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.300
So if you're inclined,
just talk to me afterwards.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.490
Otherwise I'm very happy to
talk to you about anything

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.555
you might want to
ask a question about.

00:33:58.555 --> 00:34:00.430
DAVID: Please come up
here and ask questions.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.010
ART WOLFE: Don't be shy.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.990
I should acknowledge
Rob Shepard.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.380
He has worked with us
for a number of years.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.060
He was the editor on this book.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.949
He used to be the
managing editor

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.340
for "Outdoor Photographer."

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.190
So our history goes
back a long time.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.370
I think he and Deirdre
Skillman in my office

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.650
did a great book on
putting this book together.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.639
And it's the first time I
can look back with clarity

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.080
and know when it happened.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.650
So for old people like
me it's really important.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.100
Yes?

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.489
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that technology has actually

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.030
changed landscape
photography quite a bit.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.870
So I wonder, do you always
go back to your trusty SLR

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.429
or do you explore other
things like smartphones?

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.659
ART WOLFE: You
know, the answer is

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.770
I photograph with everything.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:51.510
I have a smartphone that allows
me to photograph in the moment.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.500
And many of those photos
populate my lectures.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.280
So yeah, I'm not
a snob about it.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.980
If you take a workshop
from me or travel with me,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.780
I don't engage in
whether one camera

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.430
is better than the other.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:06.087
It's all about what
the subject is.

00:35:06.087 --> 00:35:07.670
And the camera you've
got in your hand

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.330
is the one you should be using.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.040
So, yeah, all those cameras.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.370
I have high end cameras,
but I also have the phones.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.909
Yeah?

00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:18.450
AUDIENCE: What are
some tips that you

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.470
could give to people who
do work the nine to five

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.980
that still want to be good
photographers, especially up

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.390
here in the Pacific
Northwest, just to encourage

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.120
them to get out and shoot?

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.920
ART WOLFE: Yeah, you know,
you live in the Northwest,

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.070
and we live, I believe, in
the best part of the country

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.590
because an hour and a
half drive from Seattle,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.740
you can be in the
northern steppe forest,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.420
out on the coast,
in the mountains,

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.010
in the old growth
forest-- I mean,

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.787
there's so much at a
really quick access point.

00:35:46.787 --> 00:35:48.370
There's a lot of
lectures being given.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.930
I teach a lot of workshops.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.730
I think just getting out there
and discovering the place

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.550
that you-- I would
presume many of you

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.090
have moved here from
out of the state.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.870
There's an amazing array
of subjects to shoot.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:04.820
And I think it's just
great for the soul.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.240
I mean, I love to work
seven days a week.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.860
I never take a vacation.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.970
For me, taking pictures
actually delivers energy to me.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.610
So I love that fact.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.070
Creative types, people
that are creative,

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.440
whether it's cooking or
dance or poetry or writing,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.330
photography, they live longer
lives than the average person

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.960
because the word is passion.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.535
If you have that passion,
in anything, do it to help.

00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:32.590
I sound like an
evangelist on the stage,

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.160
but it's really true.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.020
I study a lot of art history.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.150
And the famous artists, if
they didn't drink themselves

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.550
to death, they lived long lives.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.965
So yes, anyway?

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.690
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think about drone photography?

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.190
ART WOLFE: I love
drone photography.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.740
I think drone photography is
offering us points of view

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.080
that you would
not otherwise see.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.520
So you know, it's like
one of those things.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.649
There's a love-hate
relationship, right?

00:37:02.649 --> 00:37:04.940
People don't like the sound
of a drone over their head,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.090
but they love looking
at the pictures.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.150
We all saw the BBC's
"Planet Earth,"

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.270
and many of the photos
in "Planet Earth"

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.890
were shot from drones.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:17.050
And the same people
that love that

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.790
are the first ones that would
complain if they hear a drone.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.340
So you know, I think being
pragmatic is really critical.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.830
It gives us an
opportunity not to have

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.880
to hire a helicopter,
which is much louder

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.990
and noisier and intrusive.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.880
But like everything else,
drones have their place.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.630
And they have a lot of places
where they shouldn't be flying.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.835
And a lot of people that
don't know how to fly it

00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:41.710
should not be flying.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.640
So I think it's already at the
point where you need a license,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.940
and you need to be smart.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.860
The minute some yahoo from--
I forget where they were.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.730
I think they were French-- flew
it into the Grand Prismatic

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.550
Spring in Yellowstone, the
entire National Park system

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.720
banned them from the parks.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.730
So there you go.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.240
But I do love the technology
of seeing something

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.280
from a different point of view.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.390
Yes?

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.920
AUDIENCE: So what, if any,
postprocessing have you done

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.170
or have you experimented with?

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.836
And what did you think
about the stuff--

00:38:15.836 --> 00:38:21.480
ART WOLFE: So postprocessing
in the digital means making

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.760
your image look
analogous to the film

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.430
that you may have been
using prior to switching

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.050
from film to digital.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.930
So what we do in Lightroom
is 25 points of vibrancy,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.860
five points of saturation,
a little bit of contrast.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.630
And bing, bang, boom,
you're basically

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.960
like a piece of Velvia
film that we would use.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.408
That's pretty much
the extent of it.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.530
Yes?

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.312
AUDIENCE: So how do you
balance the taking pictures

00:38:52.312 --> 00:38:53.270
and the postproduction?

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.320
How much time do you
take culling your photos

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.540
and then processing them?

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.790
ART WOLFE: OK, great question.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:03.410
So at any given
day-- for instance,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.590
as I've just indicated, I
was in Africa two weeks ago.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.790
And that was a 10 day trip.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.070
Every day before I
go to bed, I would

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.210
see everything I
shot during the day,

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.190
and pull the favorites
into a collection,

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.610
and more than likely work on
them until 1:00 in the morning

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.510
before I go to bed.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.939
Because I know if I
didn't do it then,

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:25.480
it's not going to
happen the next day

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.246
because there's all
these new photos that

00:39:27.246 --> 00:39:28.120
are going to be shot.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.530
So I'm compulsive
on getting it done.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.590
Yesterday afternoon, I
was being driven back

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.940
from the San Juan Islands.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.970
And I had the laptop on my lap.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.260
And I was working on the images.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.890
And I think they
got posted today.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.170
So I don't ever delay it.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.696
It's done right on
the day I shoot.

00:39:48.696 --> 00:39:50.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.234
ART WOLFE: It helps
to be type A. Yeah?

00:39:53.234 --> 00:39:54.400
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.210
So with the transition
from film to digital,

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.730
is there anything you found that
you had to unlearn or relearn

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.584
or do differently?

00:40:02.584 --> 00:40:04.000
ART WOLFE: It was
remarkable to me

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.750
because the people
in my office said--

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.080
and I have a staff
that go back 26 years.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.320
Several of the women in my
office have gone back 26 years.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.974
And they told me when the 12
megapixel camera came out,

00:40:18.974 --> 00:40:20.390
you either buy one
or you're going

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.764
to be a dinosaur,
because we were

00:40:21.764 --> 00:40:24.810
doing a lot of testimonials
for film and technology.

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.880
So I got a digital camera.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.970
I got a computer.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:29.880
I got hard drives.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.780
I got all the things you
would need to shoot digitally.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.470
And then I went
off to Antarctica

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.900
with 500 rolls of film
and my film camera.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.110
And on the route south across
the Drake Passage, I went out

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.820
and I thought OK,
I've got to find out

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.690
what the heck digital is about.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.350
So I took a pitcher
of water beating up

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.870
and rain out on the
side of the boat.

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.940
And five minutes
later I was uploading

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.440
it to see if I can do that.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.550
And when I saw
the image come up,

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.580
virtually I never have
taken a shot of film.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.670
So it was absolutely
like a meat cleaver.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:08.770
The switch from film-- and all
500 rolls of film came back.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.104
And I gave that film away.

00:41:10.104 --> 00:41:11.020
I didn't even sell it.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.060
I just gave it away.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.340
So it's all about the image.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.210
And that was when digital
was on par with film.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.070
Now it's outpaced it tenfold.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.710
And it keeps getting better
and better and better.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.950
I'm able to shoot
breaching orcas on Sunday

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.120
afternoon that they
would have been

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.720
all but impossible with film.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.970
So there's no regrets.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:34.970
There's no looking back.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.550
I can make the digital
capture look like any film

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.560
that I preferred.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.890
So I know that many of my
colleagues struggled with that.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.300
They love their film.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.020
I'm not emotional about that.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.650
It was about the subject and
whether I could get it better.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:50.850
Thank you for that question.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.650
AUDIENCE: Pointers about
shooting in Antarctica?

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:56.816
I'm going there in December.

00:41:56.816 --> 00:41:59.840
So any advice on
photography in Antarctica,

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.342
I would much appreciate it.

00:42:01.342 --> 00:42:03.050
ART WOLFE: If you're
going to Antarctica,

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:07.012
I think that if you bring--
what kind of camera do you use?

00:42:07.012 --> 00:42:08.160
AUDIENCE: A Nikon.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.300
ART WOLFE: Nikon.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.490
And with Canon, they
have a 100 to 400 zoom.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:17.160
Nikon undoubtedly has
something that equates to that.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.500
And if you don't own it,
then you could rent it.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.450
You don't have to go out
and buy expensive equipment

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.439
for one trip.

00:42:24.439 --> 00:42:26.480
But that would be a great
one because really, you

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.240
don't need much more than 400.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.645
You know, I use wide
angles and midranges.

00:42:32.645 --> 00:42:34.710
You know, the
penguins are close.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.290
The landscape's big.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.500
Unless it's an iceberg that
you can't get close to,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.500
there is no reason to
bring big glass down there.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.620
So 100 to 400 would
be really adequate.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.804
AUDIENCE: How do you deal with
the weight and the walking?

00:42:48.804 --> 00:42:49.720
So that's been a big--

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.412 --> 00:42:52.870
ART WOLFE: There's
not much weight.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.680
AUDIENCE: 200 to
500, that's pretty--

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.020
ART WOLFE: 100 to 400 is a lens
of about that big and about

00:42:59.020 --> 00:42:59.540
that.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.900
You can carry that,
one camera body.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.250
Even today you don't
really need a tripod.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:09.650
I mean, there are times where
I bring a tripod always,

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.370
like the volcanoes
at night or stars.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:18.790
But for the most part, today--
I used to advocate tripods

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.490
on everything.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.900
But today you really don't
know-- you know, frequently

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.560
with the high end Canon
cameras that I use,

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.630
I'm shooting at ISO 4,000.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.720
Noise is more of a
manifestation of length

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.480
of shutter speed than ISO.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:43.040
And so I can shoot all day
long with ISO 4,000 or 2,000

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.160
and tweak it a little
bit with noise reduction,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.890
and I'm good to go.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:48.390
Yes?

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:50.046
AUDIENCE: Do you just need
a thick [INAUDIBLE] 4,000

00:43:50.046 --> 00:43:51.620
and just shoot,
shoot, shoot, or do

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.350
you send it to an auto
ISO, 4,000 to the max?

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.410
ART WOLFE: I don't use
auto ISO, although I have

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.100
friends that just swear by it.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.840
When I'm shooting
a breaching whale,

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.110
like I was on Sunday afternoon,
and I have no clue where

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.870
they're going to come
up, in a 360 degree view,

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:14.090
I put it at 4,000 so
I could shoot at f/22.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.120
And so I found that
I was just reacting.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.130
And if the whale was within
a fairly big radius, at f/22.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.310
It's going to be in focus.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.530
I don't have time to
even switch and try

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.190
to focus because the whale's
gone, underwater again.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:33.420
So that's why those faster
ISOs really serve me.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.800
Right after the eclipse images
I shot, I was along a river.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800
And I had-- and if you
look on our website,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.290
you'll see these photos.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.700
Giant hippos and crocodiles
were duking it out.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.260
So ISO 4,000 gave me depth
of field and shutter speed

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.930
when they were happening.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.040
And I'm not really
compromising quality.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.110
I also have a 50
megapixel camera

00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:00.840
that I always shoot at ISO
100 for the big landscapes.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.770
But for action type
shots, 4,000 now

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.570
is frequently what I'm using.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.210
I'm not a tech-- I really don't
like talking about technology,

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.840
but it would be ridiculous
not doing it in this group.

00:45:20.648 --> 00:45:22.636
DAVID: You get the
honor of last question.

00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:24.760
ART WOLFE: You better make
this damn question good,

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.330
because this is
the very last one.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.221
AUDIENCE: Well is
there any anyplace

00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:30.970
that you haven't been
that you want to go?

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.880
ART WOLFE: Yeah, I
want to go to Socotra.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.450
Does anybody want to
go to Socotra with me?

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.280
You want to go?

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.300
AUDIENCE: Maybe

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.320
ART WOLFE: It's an
island off Yemen.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.840
It's only accessed through
the capital of Yemen.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.340
It's halfway to Somalia.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.470
And they have the most bizarre
tree life on the planet.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.350
So that's why I
want to go there.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.710
And I've been waiting.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.310
I waited eight
years for the Congo

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.080
to quiet down before I went in.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.070
I have no delusions
that I'm going to become

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.210
a mercenary photographer.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:10.850
I waited until there was a peace
treaty signed in Goma, Congo

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:12.820
before I went up
on that volcano.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.790
I think Sanaa, which is
the capital of Yemen,

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.017
has quieted down.

00:46:17.017 --> 00:46:18.600
I just want to get
out to that island.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.070
I want to go to Oman.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.550
I want to go to Saudi
Arabia and that area.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.230
Israel I've not been to.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.450
So there's pockets
that I've not been to.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.960
I've not been to
Spain yet, though I

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.310
have five books on Spain.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.490
So I know all about Spain.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.360
But I've relegated a lot
of the easier countries

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.010
to places that I'll
go in my old age.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.600
So I just had a
birthday yesterday.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.120
I turned 65.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.260
And I'm ready to go
tomorrow morning.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.130
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
though about going to space?

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.360
ART WOLFE: My staff has
really advocated that.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.120
Yeah, get on that rocket.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.620
No.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.640
You know, there was a-- I
would love to photograph

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.400
the earth from orbit.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.880
There's no question.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.770
Any colleague of mine
would really like to do it.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:15.660
Unless you're a billionaire,
that's been unaccessible.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.765
Probably in my lifetime
it will be accessible.

00:47:18.765 --> 00:47:20.930
So I'd love to do that.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.270
OK David, thank you.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.260
DAVID: Thank you very
much for coming today.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.885
ART WOLFE: All right,
thanks everybody.

00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:25.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.500
Thank you.
