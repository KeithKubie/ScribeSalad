[music playing]

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.170
NARRATOR: Los
Angeles, California.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.710
April, 2017.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.620
All right, Todd.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.170
You got the results?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.960
Yeah, and they're
very, very interesting.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.540
NARRATOR: Giorgio Tsoukalos is
online with anthropologist Dr.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.670
Todd Disotell to receive
the results of a DNA test

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.880
that was performed on
an elongated skull.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.540
TODD DISOTELL: They did get a
good, clean DNA profile from

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.920
the maternally inherited DNA.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.750
So this particular specimen
is actually not found

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.580
in the new world, not found
amongst Native Americans,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.540
and it's typically
found amongst Europeans

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.420
and Middle Easterners.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420
In fact, the hundred
percent match

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750
was to a Scottish individual.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.380
This makes no sense whatsoever.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.330
Really?

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.330
In a South American skull?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.040
This is all very strange.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.170
That could mean that
people from Europe

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.250
got to South America, you know,
1,500 years earlier than we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.880
currently understand that.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.250
That's amazing.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.420
Unfortunately, the
condition of the sample

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.960
did not yield any y-chromosome,
but that's not surprising.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.540
There is between a couple
hundred to a couple

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.540
thousand times as much maternal
DNA in every cell of the body.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.120
So what does that mean?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
What have we not found
out because of that?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.210
Well, so one, that would
allow us to definitively

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.790
determine the sex.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.250
And knowing who the
father was would

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.790
be very, very informative.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.620
Unfortunately,
we're missing that.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.500
Right.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.670
Do you think that a
case can be made at all,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.170
and again, this is complete
speculation, that perhaps

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.830
it is not necessarily human?

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.460
Is that a possibility?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.500
TODD DISOTELL:
Well, it's possible.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.460
But still, we actually
don't know what this is.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.080
Since we didn't get
any definitive result--

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290
obviously, a scientist always
wants to try to do that.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.500
- This is extraordinary.
- Yeah.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.000
But still leaves open the
possibility of something

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580
interesting.
- Right.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.420
So I think that we have
something here that definitely

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.170
merits further investigation.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.880
That it's worthy of
study or opening up

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960
a new area of inquiry
and some new hypotheses.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.670
And the results
confirmed the fact

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.710
that there is a mystery there.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.830
First of all, we
couldn't figure out who

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.330
the father is of that thing.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.710
Number two, it has
the European DNA--

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.500
two things that make no sense.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.540
And it had a missing
sagittal suture.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.540
So I do think that that is
an extraterrestrial skull.
