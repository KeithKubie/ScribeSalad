JEN PERSON: Hello.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.329
I'm Jen Person for
the "Developer Show."

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:06.370
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.680
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.840
The Google Photos
Library API gives you

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.480
the ability to build photo
and video experiences

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.770
in your products that
are faster, smarter,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.050
and more helpful.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.820
And it's now
generally available.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.775
For an overview and links to the
docs, head on over to the post

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.320
linked in the description below.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.210
The Cloud Firestore SDKs support
offline persistence on the web,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.970
in addition to Android and iOS,
managing all your data locally

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.090
so you can execute
advanced queries

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.320
purely against the local cache.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.290
And now the Cloud
Firestore Web SDK

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.720
has multi-tab
offline persistence,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.660
so your users can read and
modify their local data

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.690
even when they open your
app in multiple tabs.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.720
The code to turn it
on is on the post.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.330
Cloud TPUs were designed
from the ground up

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.380
to train and run
cutting-edge ML models,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.850
with each Cloud TPU
v2 delivering up

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.580
to 180 teraflops
of compute power,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.379
and each Cloud TPU v3
providing up to 420 teraflops.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.900
And now, Google-designed
Cloud TPUs

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.160
are publicly available in beta
on Google Kubernetes engine.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.370
GKE also supports
preemptible Cloud TPUs

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.270
that are priced 70% lower than
the standard price of Cloud

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.330
TPUs.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.990
Details are on the post.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.560
Stackdriver Workspaces
are a place for you

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.410
to organize all the Stackdriver
resources you care about,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.460
in ways that match your needs.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.180
They can track your existing
Google Cloud Platform projects,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.760
as well as any Amazon
Web Services accounts

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.470
that you want to monitor.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.980
Screenshots and links to
get started are on the post.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.000
We recently launched
the What-If Tool,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.410
a new feature to the open-source
TensorBoard web application,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.450
which allows you to analyze ML
model without writing any code.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.190
Given pointers to a TensorFlow
model and a data set,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.000
the What-If Tool offers an
interactive visual interface

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.160
for exploring model results.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.790
Screenshots and links to
demos are on the post.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.710
All known machine-learning
algorithms

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.650
are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, which

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.860
are inputs that an attacker has
intentionally designed to cause

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.970
the model to make a mistake.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.360
The Unrestricted Adversarial
Examples Challenge

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.730
is a community-based
challenge to incentivize

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.740
a measure of progress
towards the goal

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.620
of zero confident classification
errors in machine learning

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.850
models.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.980
For examples and a
link to participate,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.170
take a look at the post.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.500
Chrome 70 beta includes
the Shape Detection API,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280
updates to the Web
Authentication API, and more.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.750
For details on all the
features in this release,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.474
head on over to the post.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.476
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.810
There's some great run-on
sentences in this one,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.110
so it's going to be fun.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.810
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.360
JEN PERSON: Yeah.
