00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.270
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Thank you so much
to everyone for coming out to Noir

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.760
at the National Book Festival
and thanks to the Library

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.470
of Congress for having us.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.180
And we owe a special debt to
Colleen Slogan and Nicolas Brown

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.110
for arranging this event
and putting Noir at the Bar

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.410
in the national spotlight.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.820
For those of you who've never
been to a Noir at the Bar,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.180
it's an event that was
started about a decade ago

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.250
by the crime fiction book blogger
Pete Rozosky in Philadelphia.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.990
Basically, a group of crime fiction
writers get together in a bar,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.790
drink, and read short
stories or excerpts of novels.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.710
Given the bar setting, the alcohol,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.760
and the fact that crime fiction
writers tend to enjoy hanging

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.040
out in the outskirts of
respected literary society,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.300
these readings are usually
raunchy and full of vulgarity,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.880
but generally stayed true to
Noir or Neo-Noir tradition.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.180
See, you learned something.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.480
That's it, though.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.980
That's all you'll learn tonight.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.340
Given that this is a
family event and we'd

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.220
like to come back next year, we're
going to cut down on the raunch

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.840
and the swearing, but we'll still
have a fair amount of sketchiness

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.230
and shady characters,
which leads us right

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.230
to our first reader,
Louis Bayard [laughing].

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.730
There he is.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.710 position:56%
Louis eight novels include the Edgar
nominated, "The Pale Blue Eye,"

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.750
the New York Times notable,
"Mr. Timothy," and the recent

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.140
"Lucky Strikes" named one of the
best young adult titles of 2016.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.970 position:56%
His other novels include, "The
Black Tower," "The School of Night,"

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.480
and, "Roosevelt's Beast."

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.000
His essays and articles have
appeared in the Los Angeles

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.770
and New York Times, the Washington
Post, Salon, and book form.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.900
He was also the author of
the Downton Abbey Recaps

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.260
for The New York Times, which
he embarrassingly called

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.380
"Downtown Abbey" well
into the second season.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.180
Here's Louis.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.280
[ Applause ]

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.290
&gt;&gt; Louis Bayard: I knew Ed
would spread lies about me.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.590
I knew it.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.330
It's just one of those things
that you knew was going to happen.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.630
Well, welcome, everybody.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.930
It's great to be here.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.690 position:56%
And thank you, Ed, for organizing us
all and getting us here [applause].

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.300
Yeah. I think it's hilarious we're
in the children's space right now

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.510 position:56%
and I've been -- I'm already busily,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380
fiercely editing what
I have to read tonight.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.730
Just a brief introduction.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.760
A few years back, a
friend and I were leafing

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.990
through the DC Noir anthology

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.660
in would Jim Grady was
permanently featured.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.190
I -- at least Jim Grady.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.490
Maybe [inaudible].

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.110
And we realized suddenly that
there were no gay writers in it.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.830
At least no writers that we'd
ever dated before between us.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.190
And that led to this whole
conversation about Gay Noir

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.660
and whether such a
thing was even possible.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.750 position:56%
I, of course, contended that it was,
and to prove it, I wrote this story,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.050
which was eventually published

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.190
in the City Paper's
annual fiction issue.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.320
And, in fact, the story is
set in DC in the late '80s

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.530
and it's titled, "Chesapeake."

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.440
Not after the bay, I
should add, but the bar.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.340
The Chesapeake house, which was
a really sleazy gay strip club

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.780
that used to draw a crowd
back in the day not very far

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.440
from here, in fact, very close by.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.450
So this is how this story begins.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.570 position:56%
And this will be -- this will be PG.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.290
A quarter century ago, or
maybe it was a million years,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.500
I dated a full lipped, morally
unanchored charmer named Benjamin

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.240
who was in his third
year of Georgetown Law.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.990
Better to say I tried to date him.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.060
One night, because he
wouldn't cut me loose

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.580
and because I couldn't cut myself
loose, and because abjection came

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.130
as naturally to me then as
breathing, I followed him

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.140
without his knowledge from
Badlands down P Street.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.590
He crossed DuPont Circle,
cut up New Hampshire, then,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.810
a little shy of U Street
he paused in front

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.540
of a cinnamon brick
apartment building.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.060
Like a mariner back
from the Spice Islands,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.150 position:56%
he gazed up at a second floor window

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.850
where a lamp was even now
extending a tongue of light.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.260
He nodded to himself and then
made straight for the vestibule

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.830
where he waited for
the answering buzz.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.250
In less than a minute his shadow,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.400
unmistakable with his
lacrosse shoulders,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.800
flickered across the
apartment's curtains.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.520
This much I knew.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.900
He would eat before
he did anything else.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.240
Twenty minutes later an order
from Trio Pizza arrived.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.140 position:56%
I slipped in after the delivery guy,
followed him to the second floor,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.750
watched a door spring open, saw
a pair of hands, not Benjamin's.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.640
Apartment 203.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.920
The blaze of revelation subsided as
I planted myself opposite the door.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.190
If I were to have the confrontation
I wanted, needed, feared,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.120
I'd have to sit there for
the rest of the evening,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.540
my back against the wall.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.480
Instead, I fell asleep and woke an
uncertain number of hours later.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.300
A slender young man was standing in
the open doorway of apartment 203

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.700
in a pair of oversized sweatpants.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.000
I lurched to my feet.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.820
"Sorry, I'm Knox.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.530
Like the fort.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.170
Yeah." "Benjamin's gone, sweetie."

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.840
The voice was soft and low,
but with Carolina vowels.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.370
"I doubt he even saw you there.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.730
He was in a hurry to get to class."

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.770
Even in my sleep dazzled state
I could discern two things.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.070
The young man was lying and this
lying was a form of charity.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.740
"I'm Joey," he said.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.700
"You should come in."

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.520
He made a pot of Irish breakfast
and poured it out in beer mugs.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.700
He fed me Danish and Jiffy Pop.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.490
He loaned me a comb.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.920
The clock radio on his kitchen
counter had ticked just past 11AM

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.590
when he leaned across his
biscuit crate coffee table

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.780
and folded his soft, white fingers
around my long, thin, veined ones.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.080
"You know, he's not
worth this," he said.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.980
It occurred to me to deny it, but,
in the next breath, Joey said,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.220
"I think I'm done with him too."

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.710
Decades later I'm still unpacking
the grace of that moment,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.860
one man able, in just a
few words, to free two men,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.830
to take them both out of the hunt.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.980
"Do you have a place
to stay tonight?"

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.260
he asked. The answer was, "No."

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.620
I had just been evicted from
your apartment in Mount Pleasant.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.600
My belongings were somewhere
in the attic over city lights

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.480
and I was waiting to hear
about a studio in Shaw.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.020
I was 23. I'd come to
Washington not for a career,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.970
but for a boy and I was dying.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.530
But we all were.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.110
"The couch pulls out," said Joey.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.300
I lay on that couch
for about a week.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.600
Joey cleaned around me.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.390
He was a terror about dust.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.780
And when he got tired of that, he
draped the Thursday classifieds

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.990
over me, "just in case," he said.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.920
I wasn't very employable then.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.240
Two years of a crunchy liberal arts
college in central Pennsylvania,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.830
segments of office slavery,
a moderate acquaintanceship

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.530
with Word Star and MultiMate.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.550
The old people here
will know those things.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.850
But I beefed up my
resume as much as I dared

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.720
and flooded every office in town.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.320
No one called back.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.080
For cash I took gigs bussing
tables at the American Cafe,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.760
answering phones at an
optometric association modeling

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.570
in the deep background
of a Sheraton print ad.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.550
Sometimes, in a brief
flush of solvency,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.650
I would offer to write
Joey a check for the rent,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.120
but he waved his hand at me.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.450
"When the ship comes in."

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.770
Never once did I see him write a
check of his own nor could I begin

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.230 position:56%
to say whose name was on the lease
or who was paying for our groceries.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.390
The bowls of citrus fruit on the
kitchen counter, the whole chickens

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.860
in the freezer, the packages
of Tuna Helper in the cupboard,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.530
they were just there waiting.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.830
Most days Joey slept until one or
two in the afternoon and it wasn't

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.640
until eight or nine in the
evening that he would put

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.050 position:56%
on his denim shorts and his two polo
shirts and go off to see his friend.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.400
Friend being, in this case, a
category rather than an individual.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.640
The one job I knew him to
hold down was as a dancer

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.270
at the Chesapeake House
and only because he invited

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.720
on impulse to watch him perform.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.970
Of the three guys dancing
on the runway that night,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.770
he was the oldest, which
is to say he was 23,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.840
but the most boyish in appearance.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.660
He wore a jock strap, gray
athletic socks, and white Tretorns,

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.150
and he moved in a benign fog,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.280
as though we were all
part of his dream.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.700
I hustled him out of the place --

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.650
I hustled out of the
place before midnight.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.990
Joey told me later I'd
missed the Scottish fantasia.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.290
That's oblique enough.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.820
Right? That's oblique enough.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.040
[ Laughter ]

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.700
Our schedules were ideally matched.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.510
If I wanted to bring
a trick home from --

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.430
[ Laughter ]

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.730
&gt;&gt; Keep going!

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.090
&gt;&gt; Louis Bayard: If I wanted
to bring a gentleman home

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.850
from Tracks [laughter] or the Frat
House, Joey would already be gone,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.140
and by the time the gentleman
was living the next morning,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.600
Joey was just coming back,
laden with rolls and oranges.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.900
"Have a blessed day!"

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.200
he'd call out.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.860
Our only moment of intersection
came late in the afternoon when,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.950 position:56%
like an old married couple, we would
sit on the chapped leather couch

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.830
and watch the squawk box.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.040 position:56%
Neither Joey nor I had any sure idea
of what was going on in the world,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.830 position:56%
but we both found the news
mysteriously restful, like listening

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.840
to traffic reports for
highways you would never travel.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.630
So it was that, one afternoon
in June, our eyes came to rest

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.880
on a perfectly unremarkable
press conference,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.150
three legislators before
a thicket of microphones.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.040
The third man was halfway through
his remarks when Joey said, "Oh.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.520
That's Earflaps."

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.340 position:56%
Well, Earflaps, in addition to being
a Kansas republican is a sometime

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.190
patron of the Chesapeake House.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.430
So, from here the tale
becomes increasingly twisted.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.700 position:56%
It includes blackmail, an unexpected
death, and rueful life lessons.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.450
And you can Google the rest of it
on the internet at your leisure,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.750
or maybe, cross your fingers,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.440
look for it in the
next DC Noir anthology.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.510
Thank you very much.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:39.980
[ Applause ]

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.480
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Do you have a
copy of your book [inaudible]?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.780
&gt;&gt; Louis Bayard: Yes.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.080
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: OK [laughing].

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.490
Thanks, Louis, I guess [laughter].

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.060
Kathleen Barber's debut novel is
"Are You Sleeping" a suspense novel

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.270
out now from Simon and Schuster.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.380
It's received praise
from Book Reporter,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.470
Pop Sugar, and, yes, the Opera.com.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.060
She attended the University
of Illinois

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.310
and Northwestern University School
of Law and now lives in Washington,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.330
D.C. When she's not writing,
Kathleen enjoys traveling the world

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.110
with her husband and spending lots
and lots and lots and lots and lots

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.120
and lots and lots and lots
and lots of time on Twitter.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.510
Here's Kathleen Barber.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:35.100
[ Applause ]

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.400
&gt;&gt; Kathleen Barber: Thanks, Ed.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.190 position:56%
I do probably spend way too much
time on Twitter so if you're looking

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.130
for someone to follow, that's me.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.240
Thanks so much for having me.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.010 position:56%
I've -- this is also a confusion --
I have never been to Noir at the Bar

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.660
so this is my first chance.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.740
So if I do it wrong,
don't blame Ed, blame me.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.600
OK. In retrospect, I should have
listened to our friends who scoffed

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.000
when we solicited recommendations
for a cat sitter.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.720
"The cat will be fine," they said.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.900
"You're going away for a
long weekend, not a month.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.030
Just leave some food and water and
the cat will take care of himself."

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.880
But George Harrison, the cat,
not the Beatle, was our baby

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.040
and he had this bad habit of
wedging himself into spaces

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.790
from which he could not escape

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.750
like between the refrigerator
and the wall.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.300 position:56%
And I had horrible visions of him
slowly starving to death while James

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.710 position:56%
and I drank wine with an ocean view.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.880
So we found a cat sitter online.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.350
Her name is Megan and she had
hair the color of cotton candy.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.760
I didn't like the way
that she looked at James,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.670 position:56%
the way her mascaraed lashes drooped

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.510
and her teeth caught
her glossy lips,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.820
but James said it was
all in my head.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.090
Besides, George Harrison
seemed to like her curling

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.430
around her tattooed
ankles almost immediately

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.410
and that was all that mattered.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.410
Our trip went a bit sideways
when someone stole my purse,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.160
which had my driver's
license inside,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.490
which meant I no longer had
the identification necessary

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.170
to board an airplane.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.410
It could have been a complete
disaster, but Megan happily went

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.810
to our place, followed
our directions

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.600
to unlock a specific desk
drawer, and found my passport,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.010
which she then overnighted
to the hotel.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.570
So we gave her a bonus and
promised to recommend her to others

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.740
and then we forgot about her.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.320
Months later, I came home and found
the cat's dishes in the middle

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.290
of the living room floor.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.490
I looked to George
Harrison for explanation,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.000
but he merely licked a paw
and stalked out of the room.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.960
I shrugged and returned the dishes
to the kitchen where they belonged.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.530
The next day I came home to
find the dishes moved again.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.770
When I questioned James, he
looked at me like I was crazy.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.830
"I haven't been doing that."

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.130
"Do we have a poltergeist?"

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.710
I wondered.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.290
"Maybe you're just not
getting enough sleep, Hun."

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.800
I might have accepted
his explanation

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.990
if things hadn't started happening.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.350
I found the silverware
piled on the table,

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.300
the books rearranged
spines facing in,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.530
a wine glass we hadn't used
drying on a kitchen towel.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.230
James accused me of doing
all this to screw with him

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.310 position:56%
and I wondered if I was cracking up.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.590
But then some money went missing.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.450
Not much, but enough
that we noticed.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.560
And I realized somebody
must be coming to the house.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.220
But who? There are no
signs of a break-in

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.870
and James' mother was the
only one with a set of keys.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.010
I doubted she was leaving her
retirement community to prank us.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.210
And then we remembered Megan.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.870
It was so obvious.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.990
She must have made a
copy of our house keys.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.150
"We know what you're
doing," James told her

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.430
over the phone, "and
you need to stop."

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.620
"I don't know what
you're talking about,"

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.390
she said coolly and hung up on us.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.680
But the call put a stop to
things, or we thought it did.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.500
One week later, James
called me into the study.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.660
He gestured to an open desk
drawer and asked, his voice tight,

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.630
"Have you moved anything?"

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.040
I knew that drawer.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.910
I knew what he was asking me.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.360 position:56%
That was the drawer where James
kept the pot he sold and I could see

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.660
from where I was standing

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.390
that it was strangely
empty except for a scale.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.270
It wasn't like James was
some sort of drug dealer.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.100
He was a hobbyist just procuring
some stuff from his younger cousin,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.700
this skinny skateboard punk
who actually was a drug dealer,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.580
and then, you know, distributing
it to some friends all

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.620
of whom were happy to reimburse
James for his cost and maybe also

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.910
to throw in a little extra
for his time and effort.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.410
Hardly Walter White.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.710
But still.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.390
I kept my hands as far
away from that as possible

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.630
and I sure hadn't moved anything.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.930
"Megan." I said.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.620
"Who else could it have been?"

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.070
Because, of course, there
was no other answer.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.270
We had told Megan where we
kept the keys to that desk,

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.330
had basically handed
her unfettered access

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.970
to our records and our secrets.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.060
How had we have been so stupid
to think she would be put off

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.760
by one half-baked phone call?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.040
"Do you think she's been taking
small amounts for weeks now?"

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.970
I asked, "Distracting us
from her theft with things

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.270
like moving the cat's dishes?

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.740 position:56%
And do you think she took everything
in retribution for that call?"

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.950
"I don't know," James growled,
"but we have to get it back.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.250
I'm going over there."

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.070
I ran to put on shoes
and met James by the car.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.850
There was a cold, unfamiliar
look in his eyes,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.090
something that made him look a bit
dangerous, which was ridiculous

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.710
because James couldn't
even hurt a spider.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.880
He was always trapping
those things under glasses

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.950
and releasing them outside.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.140
Still, I had a feeling
I needed to go with him

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.960
to make sure things
didn't get out of hand.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.100 position:56%
Megan seemed bewildered to find us
on her doorstep, which was ludicrous

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.230
because she had been breaking
into our home for weeks

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.180
and had just stolen
a bunch of drugs.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.430
She held the door open less
than a foot and asked us

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.830
with faux concern whether
George Harrison was all right.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.610
I snarled at her, "There's no
need to bring the cat into this."

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.750
James isn't a big man, but
he was bigger than Megan

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.480
and he pushed the door wide
open and barreled inside.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.570
I followed him closing
the door behind us

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.880 position:56%
as Megan's eyes got wide with worry.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.850
I started to tell her that she
should stop looking so surprised.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.410
She was the one who
had started all this,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.320 position:56%
when I noticed a paperweight
pinning down some mail by a table --

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.350
on a table by the front door.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.200
And not just any paperweight.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.120
It was our paperweight.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.050
A glass globe that my late mother
had given us as a wedding gift.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.370 position:56%
We kept it in the study atop the
desk whose drawers Megan had raided.

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.000
I snatched it up and
waved it at her.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.050
"You stole this too?"

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.910
She narrowed her eyes,
shook her head,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.610
claimed she had no idea
what I was talking about.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.250
"Just give us back our stuff."

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.340
James said reasonably.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.960
She insisted she didn't
know what we meant,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.750
that she didn't have
any of our stuff.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.050
"Then what's this?"

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.260
I demanded waving the
paperweight at her.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.120 position:56%
She ignored me looking over my
shoulder with wide, frightened eyes,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.390
her mouth dropped open slightly.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.330
"That's not how she usually looks
at James," I thought absurdly.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.610
I turned to follow her gaze and
saw James was holding a gun at her.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.200
"Wow!" I said, "Where
did that come from?"

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.680
"That's it," Megan
said, all false bravado

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.070
as she pulled her phone
from her pocket.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.370
"I'm calling the cops."

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.950
But I couldn't let her do
that, especially not now,

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.880
not with James waving
around some gun

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.020
that he got from who knows where.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.820
I knew that, but I didn't
know what I could do about it.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.180
I didn't know that I had
done anything about it

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.220
until I heard James'
shocked inhalation and looked

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.930
down to find Megan
crumpled on the carpet.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.730
James looked at me horrified.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.620
"What did you just do?"

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.590
I looked down at the
paperweight in my hand.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.420
Blood dripped off the green
glass sphere staining the carpet.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.740
I frowned.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.350
I had always thought this
paperweight was blue.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.070
But I couldn't worry
about shades of blue

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.910
and green while there was a
woman lying dead on the carpet.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.210
We left her there.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.080
We didn't know what else to do.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.470
We thought back to every Law and
Order episode we had ever watched

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.680
and acted accordingly, wipe down
any surfaces we might have touched,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.940
disposed of my shoes
in a random dumpster.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.960
James wanted to throw away the
paperweight, but I couldn't bear

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.020
to part with it so I took it
home and washed it lovingly,

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.320
hid it underneath the bed.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.480
And then we held our
collective breath.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.150
When no one arrived to arrest us
the next day or the day after that

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.490
or the week after that, we
thought we were in the clear.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.080
We thought we got away with murder.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.760
And then I came home one afternoon
to find George Harrison's dishes

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.280
in the middle of the
living room floor.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.880
I swallowed the panic that
was rising in my throat

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.020 position:56%
and carried the dishes into the
kitchen where, on the kitchen table,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.180
was a newspaper clipping held

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.760
down by two globe-shaped
paperweights,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.310
one green and one blue.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.510
Choking on terror I peered down
at the clipping, Megan's obituary.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.040
And written across it in red marker
were the words, "Wrong answer.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.810
Better luck next time."

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.510
So thank you.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:17.130
[ Applause ]

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.430
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: You guys
probably noticed I jumped

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.700
up here pretty nimbly the first two
readings, but I'm too 43-year-old

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.450
and too out of shape to keep doing

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.980
that so I'm doing the
stairs from now on.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.280
Thank you, Kathleen!

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.570
We have Kathleen's book to
raffle off so check your tickets.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.960
For ticket -- oh, no,
the number, 144301.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.340
Really? Wow.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.090
OK. Is it me?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.970
144300.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.480
I don't think we did these
raffle tickets right [laughing].

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.970
144308?

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.340
All right.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.640
We'll do one more and
then we'll come back.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.250
We'll figure out what
happened in the break.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.500
144256.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.800
&gt;&gt; Yay!

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.100
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Oh!

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.400
Oh, it worked.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.700
OK. Good. All right.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.500
We're on base.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.510
[ Applause ]

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.050
I'd encourage you not to
applaud after the raffle tickets.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.350
The winner did nothing.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.650
Literally nothing to win.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.910
Our next reader is some shmuck.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.210
Oh, it's me.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.140
My most recent novel is tearfully
titled, "You're As Good As Dead."

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.800
I also write a monthly column for
the Washington Independent Review

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.030 position:56%
of Books and I'm the Managing Editor
of The Thrill Begins on behalf

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.860
of the International
Thriller Writers.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.580
For this reading, I'll be joined
by jazz singer Sara Jones.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.550
Sara won the Billie Holiday Vocal
Competition and sang for years

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.270
with the US Army Field
Band Soldier's Chorus.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.620
She performs at venues
throughout the region

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.870
and teaches at Towson University.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.170
This story is called, "I
Love You, But I Don't."

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.940
Jake hurried through the
crowd on Main Street.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.600
He loosely held a metal
chain in a sweaty right hand.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.200
Meredith tugged his left.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.500
"Come with me!"

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.800
she urged him.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.320
Buildings burned on
either side of them.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.210
The riots had started a half
hour earlier and this section

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.310
of the city had been
abandoned by authority.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.610
"How much money is
going to be there?"

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:31.910
Jake asked.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.790
"Lots." Meredith stopped
walking, looked sideways at him

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.870
as looters rushed past,
"You getting nervous?"

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.980
He stopped with her and shrugged
trying to come off as nonchalant.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.280
"I'm good."

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.800
Meredith kept staring.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.100
"No. I am.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.680
It's just I should
have brought a shotgun

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.160
or something instead of this chain.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.760
I'm not really a chain guy."

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.760
"But you're a shotgun guy?"

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.210
"You're saying that like you
don't think I am [laughing]."

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.980
"I don't. I love you, but I don't."

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.340
Meredith started walking again.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.640
Jake followed her.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.110
They'd been watching TV in his
tiny apartment when the results

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.700
of the court case had
been announced.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.210
A white cop who had shot two
black children had been acquitted.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.650
The shooting had been videotaped

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.580
and the cop had shouted
racial epithets as he fired.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.760
And right before the trial he'd
had, "I shoot black people,"

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.230
tattooed on his forehead, and,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.030
"I'm definitely guilty,"
tattooed on his neck.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.710
But a Grand Jury still
acquitted him.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.270 position:56%
The city had already been close to
collapse and that pushed it too far,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.790
broke something inside of
everyone no matter their race.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.300
The crowd thinned as looters headed

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.590
to the rich stores
where the cops waited.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.980
Jake followed Meredith
in a different direction

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.020
through side streets until they
reached a small, secluded shop.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.480
"M&amp;W Musical Instruments?"

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.780
Meredith nodded.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.080
"This store is loaded.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.380
Trust me."

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.100
Jake tried the door,
"And it's locked."

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.700
Meredith looked at the long
window facing the street then

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.060
down to his chain.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.700
"Well, it looks like you
got a key," she smiled.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.740
And that little smile
sparked something

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.040
in Jake the way it always did.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.810
It took one swing for
the entire window

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.660
to shatter sprinkle
the ground with glass.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.370
He hefted the chain in
his hand feeling proud,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.040
glanced over at Meredith to
see if she was impressed,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.100
but she was already walking
between rows of instruments.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.450
"So, where's the safe?"

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:13.750
"It's in the office."

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.790
Meredith walked slowly like
she was wading through water,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.330
her fingers traced the
curved wood of a harp.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.990
"The owner keeps important
stuff out of sight."

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.290
Jake nodded.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.590
And how do you know him?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.890
"He's my husband."

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.190
Everything stopped.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.490
"You're married?"

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.940
"Just a little bit."

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.240
"A little bit?"

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.540
"Jake, it's OK.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.840
We're going to separate.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.140
He's not very nice to me."

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.930
"I can't believe this."

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.380
"This store means everything
to him," Meredith said.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.160
"Let's burn it down."

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.800
"What? Burn it down?"

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.550
"That store across
the street's on fire.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.010
We can spread it over here."

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.940
"What if someone sees us?"

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.600
Meredith reached into her pocket,

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.060
pulled out a small,
silver hand gun."

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.360
Jake pointed, "That's a gun!

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.770
I didn't know you had a gun!"

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.940
"You seem more upset about
the gun than I'm married."

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.330
"Oh, I'm a democrat."

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.710
Jake rubbed his forehead.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.440
"Why do you lie to me?"

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.180
Meredith ignored him, walked
deeper into the store.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.530
"I didn't think we'd be
together forever," Jake lied

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.790
as he followed her, "but
it's been a couple of months.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.870
How could you not tell
me you're married?"

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.170
Meredith wasn't listening.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.320
She was staring at
something Jake couldn't see.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.060
When she spoke again, her voice
was soft and dreamy and distant.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.480
"He taught me to sing."

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.130
"Who?" Meredith ignored his
question, but it didn't matter.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.960
Jake knew who.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.570
"We'd sit in that small room
in the back facing each other

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.430
so close our knees touched.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.350
When he shut the door,
it was so quiet,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.780
I felt like we were
buried underground.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.120
That was before he changed,
before the hitting."

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.070
"Why didn't you tell
me any of this?"

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.100
But her mind was somewhere else.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.120
Her body in two words, a foot
in each she started to sing.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.010
&gt;&gt; Sara Jones: You
don't know what love is

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:59.230
until you've learned the
meaning of the blues,

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:04.620
until you've loved the
love you've had to lose.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.110
You don't know what love is.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:17.300
You don't know how the lips
hurt until you've kissed and had

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.650
to pay the cost, until
you've flipped your heart

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.060
and you have lost.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.640
You don't know what
love is [singing].

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.330
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Jake walked out.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.220
He stopped and looked back
at Meredith one last time,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.030
stared at her tall
silhouette in the middle

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.430
of that dark store,
and then he left.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.490
He walked nearly a mile
dragging his chain behind him

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.580
like a disappointed snake.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.650
Meredith had always
seemed unattainable to him,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.550
but there is something about
that distance that drew him.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.850
No. Not the distance.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.250
The moments it was absent.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.990
The surprising moments when she
turned toward Jake completely his,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.870
carefree and excited.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.860
Walking away from her was unreal.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.380
It made his insides feel like
a box of loose puzzle pieces.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.670
And then he heard her singing.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:14.180
&gt;&gt; Sara Jones: You don't know
how hearts burn for a love

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:19.210
that cannot live yet never dies,

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:24.300
until you've faced its
dawn with sleepless eyes.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:31.550
You don't know what love is.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.070
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: It was impossible.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.190
He was a mile away and
the night wasn't quiet.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:41.110
There were shouts from Main Street,
sirens, the low roar of fire.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.490
Jake turned and followed the sound
all the way back to the shop.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.410
He stood in the shadows and stared
inside, stared at Meredith's body

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.240
on the ground and a man
kneeling next to her.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.410
Jake recognized him from a
photo he'd seen on her phone.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.710
"Who's that?"

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.010
he'd asked.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.400 position:56%
"Oh." Meredith had replied, "No one.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.090
Some guy named Will."

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.800
Now will rose to his feet
and Jake stepped back deeper

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.110
into the shadows.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:06.890
The nearby fire warmed him,
cast enough light for him

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.010
to see Will walk over to a wall
and rest his head against it,

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.290
and to see the gun Will held.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.090
Jake hadn't realized
he was inside the store

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.290
until the glass cracked underfoot.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.750
He knelt next to Meredith,
turned her over,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.750
saw the hole where
her face used to be.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.830
"She was trying to
burn my store down."

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.520
Will pointed to a burning
two by four in the corner.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.840
"I saw her carrying that.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.180
She was trying to burn
my store down."

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.110
Jake wasn't aware that he was
wrapping the chain around his fist.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.470 position:56%
He barley understood he was standing
or that he'd thrown a punch,

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.390
not until an ache from
the chain reverberated

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.470
up his arm and Will fell back.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.100
Will looked for the gun, but
it had flown out of his hand.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.710
Jake punched him again
this time across the jaw.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.090
Will hit the floor hard,
uncontrolled, unconscious.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.890
Jake enrolled the chain from
his fist and picked up the gun.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.480
He perched his foot on
the other man's chest,

00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.770
aimed the gun at his head, "this is
for Meredith," he said, and fired.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.440
The bullet exploded
into his own foot.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.700
Jake cried out and fell
down grabbing his ankle,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.360
the pain making him see white.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.220
Meanwhile, the fire had
spread to the walls.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.010
The front of the store collapsed.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.110
Smoke whirled toward
Jake like a sheet.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.960
He dragged himself away from it.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.000
"The entrance should be
this way, shouldn't it?"

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.370
Jake wasn't sure anymore.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.940 position:56%
He was blind in the dark,
coughing, his foot bursting in pain.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.360
Smoke filled his mouth until
it felt like something solid

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.140
and lodged in his throat.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.760
Jake tried another
direction still blind.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.970
His arms gave out as
the smoke thickened.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.270
Everything around him burned.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.510
The end.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.080
[ Applause ]

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.410
Thanks. And thanks to Sara.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.710
Isn't she really good?

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.510
Isn't she great?

[ Applause ]

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.510 position:56%
So I got a copy of my latest book to
raffle off and Sara has two copies

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.890
of her CD, Daydream a Little.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:01.020
So if this works right, 144292.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.380
144292. Oh!

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.330 position:56%
Molly! You -- you can get Sara's CD.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.630
That's a good one.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.930
Yeah. She has my book.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.190
144298. Oh!

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.970
And the other copy of Sara's CD.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.890
And 144306.

144306.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.630
All right.

144305.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.130
Really? OK.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.430
We'll do one more.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.970
144297.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.340
No one? Really?

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.640
All right.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.940
OK. All right.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.240
I don't know.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.540
I don't know.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.840 position:56%
I'm not good at raffling [laughing].

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.280
Colleen Shogan is the author

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.260
of the Washington Whodunit mystery
series featuring Capitol Hill

Detective Kit Marshall, "Calamity
at the Continental Club," third book

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.290
of the series came out
in July of this year.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.240
She won't a Next Generation Indie
Award for best mystery in 2016

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.470
and was RONE finalist
for mystery in 2017.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.250 position:56%
She works at the Library of Congress

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.030
and helps lead the
division responsible

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.720
for the National Book Festival.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.760
So everyone here has to
be really nice to her

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.550
if you want to come back next year.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:37.340
An inexplicably proud Pittsburgh
native, Colleen now lives

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.510
in Arlington, Virginia
with her husband, Rob,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.910
and her beagle mutt, Conan.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.510
Here's Colleen Shogan.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.050
[ Applause ]

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Thanks, Ed.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.920
It's been a long day, but I'm
happy to be here tonight and I hope

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.590
in future years for the
book festival we're able

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.720 position:56%
to do even more evening programming
featuring local writers and authors.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.180
That's sort of our goal and
we hope to build that out

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.850
in future years for
the book festival.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.700
So stay tuned and keep coming
to see us year after year.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.660
I'm going to read a
chapter from my latest book,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.770
"Calamity at the Continental
Club," and, as Ed said,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.880
I'll give you a little
bit of a setup.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.980
Kit Marshall is a Capitol
Hill Washington, D.C. sleuth

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.420
and in this installment

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:29.820
of the series she's attending
a historical society reception

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.640
and weekend at a very
fancy Washington,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.410
D.C. member's only club
called the Continental Club.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:41.870 position:56%
And, as usually what happens to Kit,
she happens to find a dead body.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.640
So this is the point in the
story in which, you know,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.170
the mystery really gets started.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:51.360
Without a moment's hesitation,
I sprung to the man's side.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.400
The face was contorted,
but I still recognized him.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.610
It was Grayson Bancroft dressed in
the same suit he'd worn to dinner.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.820
Obviously, Grayson never
made it to bed last night.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.600
His skin was extremely
pale, not a good sign.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.390
Tentatively, I reached
to feel for a pulse.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.600
After grasping his stone cold
hand for only a second I recoiled.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.850
The president of the
Mayflower Society was dead.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.550
Now, it was time to panic.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.270
The eerie silence consuming the
entire building prevented me

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.760
of lending out a scream.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.140 position:56%
Instead, I scrambled around the
corner and flew down the last flight

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.530
of stairs to reach
the main entrance.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.730
The concierge desk sat empty.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.290
Didn't anyone start the day early

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.150
in Washington even at
the Continental Club?

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.930
The delicious aroma of freshly
baked rolls wafted in my direction.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.440
Of course the Continental
Club was a prime location

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.480
for a beltway power breakfast.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.830
I followed my nose, which
led me to the entrance

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.490
of the garden dining room.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.460
Two well-dressed businessmen
were waiting to be seated.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.760
"Could someone help me?"

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.840
I asked. My black capris
running pants, a hoodie,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.640
and yellow tennis shoes
didn't inspire confidence.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.600
The club's host took one look
at me and wrinkled his nose.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.220
"I'll be with you in
a moment, ma'am.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.450
As soon as seat these
two gentlemen."

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.400
Given the circumstances,
waiting was out of the question.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.700
"Sir, I'm sorry.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.280
But I need your assistance now!"

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.310
My voice was only a
decibels shy of a scream.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.850
I'd gotten his attention.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.350
"Please. I have to ask
you to wait your turn."

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.210
The two men in suits shook
their heads in disgust.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.510
He left me no choice.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.790
I hadn't wanted to spoil
breakfast for the eager diners.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.440
"There's a dead man upstairs.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.250
He's inside the library."

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.550
That did it.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.500
All three men stared
at me mouths agape.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.450
Given their reactions, I might as
well have announced the arrival

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.290
of Queen Elizabeth's corpse.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.160
The host stammered,
"What did you say?"

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.500
I cleared my throat and spoke in my
clearest, most sophisticated voice,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.550
"His name is Grayson Bancroft.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.350
I don't know what happened to
him, but someone might want

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.980
to attend to the matter."

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.130
I turned on my heels and retreated.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.800
The club staffer followed
behind apparently deciding

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.360
that the two guests were
no longer a priority.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.510
When he caught up with me, he
put his hand on my shoulder.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.810
"Can you show me..."

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.110
and his voice trailed off.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.410
I turned to face him.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.710
"The body?"

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.010
He gulped.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.310
"Yes." "Follow me."

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.610
I motioned toward the stairs.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.110
Once we reached the first floor
landing we continued past the

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.550
portrait and reached
Franklin's statue.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.190
I pointed in the direction
of the library entrance.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:19.800
Fortunately, although not for
Grayson, the body remained

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.850
in exactly the same spot.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.440
"He's the leader of the Historical
Society group we're hosting

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.830
for the next three
days," the host said.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.170
Despite my best efforts, I
couldn't hide my exasperation.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.610
"That's what I was
trying to tell you."

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.540
He knelt down besides Bancroft.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.480
"Are you sure he's dead?"

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.180
"I'm no medical examiner,
but his hand is cold

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.010
and I can't detect a pulse.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.610
And he's not breathing.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.830 position:56%
If you could stay here, I'm going to
call an ambulance and the police."

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.630
I nodded. If I'd had my phone
I could have texted Doug

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.880
until the alerts on
his device woke him.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.030
My best laid plans for a jog
this morning had gone awry.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.530
I squatted next to the
body for a closer look.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.410
The twisted features
definitely belonged

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.220
to the man I met the night before,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.850
enough to make a positive
identification.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.540
Unfortunately, Bancroft
didn't seem to be at peace.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.890
Grayson had been in
relatively good shape.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.190
His weight appeared average

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.520
and he was likely a few years
shy of Medicare eligibility.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.800
If he suffered from an
illness like cancer,

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.070
the effects of such a serious
disease certainly weren't apparent.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.480
Was it a heart attack?

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.780
Perhaps he smoked.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.220
I got closer to his
face and sniffed.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.700
I was particularly sensitive
to the smell of cigarettes.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.060
Although I detected the lingering
fragrance of a men's cologne,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.190
there was no hint of tobacco.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.410
Something seemed odd about
the placement of the body.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.480
If he'd been a victim of cardiac
arrest, wouldn't he have fallen

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.210
to the ground in a crumpled heap?

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.040
Instead, Bancroft was lying
perfectly flat on his back,

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.130
arms and legs spread wide.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.160
It was as though he'd
been in the middle

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.890
of making a snow angel
when he'd died.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.940
I returned to the library
and bent down again.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.020
The expression on his face
seemed frozen like something

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.600
out of the ordinary had happened to
him and he'd been unable to react.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.580
There was no other
way to describe it.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.130
Grayson Bancroft had
been surprised to die.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.910
When staring at the
expression of shock

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.940
on Bancroft's face
I noted the small,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.570
red mark on the dead man's neck.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.390
It was on the left side
inches above the fitted collar

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.230
of his buttoned down dress shirt.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.920
It was quite noticeable and I was
almost certain it hadn't been there

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.220
the night before.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.700
Leaning over the body, I moved
closer for a better look.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.080
It wasn't a birth mark
or a mosquito bite.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.480
To my untrained eye, it
appeared to be a puncture wound.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.020
"Who are you and what
are you doing?"

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.450 position:56%
I drew back immediately at the sound
of an authoritative female voice.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.590
A petite woman whipped
out a badge and flashed.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.860
"Detective Maggie Glass,
DC Metro Police."

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.870
I stood up and offered her
my hand, "Kit Marshall.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.440
I discovered the body."

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.380
The detective was joined
by several EMTs.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.330
Their visit would be brief
because I was certain

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.790
that Grayson Bancroft was deceased.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.660
I moved away while the emergency
medical personnel surrounded the

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.420
body and confirmed the death.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.390
Glass motioned for me
to exit the library.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:59.640
The middle-aged detective
was short in stature,

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.500 position:56%
but I could tell she meant business.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.450
Her brown hair was
pulled back in a ponytail

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.580
and she wore a fitted black
suit that was professional,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.910
yet also sporty in case a
hot pursuit was called for.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.660
Silver button earrings
provided a feminine touch.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.960
She pulled out a notebook

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.040
and grabbed a pen from
her jacket pocket.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.010
"Miss Marshall, you're a guest
here at the Continental Club?"

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.010
I briefly described the reason for
our visit and explained I lived

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.700
in Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.000
"Where do you work?"

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.180
Apparently the district police
ask this question as an opener.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.760
Maybe they also attended too
many K Street cocktail parties.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.060
"Capitol Hill.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.360
I work for a chief
of staff for a member

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.160
of the House of Representatives."

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.460
"A political type I see.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.760
No surprises there.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.910
How did you come to
discover the deceased?"

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.340
MY workout attire corroborated
my story

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.040
and Glass didn't question why
I stumbled across Grayson.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.720
She continued to write
furiously in her notebook.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.400
Without looking up,
she kept talking.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.260
"Only a few more questions,
Miss Marshall.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.760
This seems open and shut.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.490
The coroner will take it from here.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.060
It was most likely a heart
attack or an aneurysm.

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.540
We see these all the time and
men of the deceased's age group."

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.840
I cleared my throat.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.140
That got Glass's attention.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.360
She glanced up from scribbling
furiously in her notepad and asked,

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.840
"Do you have something to add?"

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.870
"Detective, I'm sure you
noticed the odd position

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.590
of the body on the floor."

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.890
"Not really.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.540
I wanted to let our medical
experts confirm the death.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.970
Let's take another look."

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.270
She motioned with the pen

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.320
that I should follow
her inside the library.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.900 position:56%
Glass circled the body several times
and paused to write in her notebook.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.090
She indicated the medics
should join us.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.720
"Fellas, does this look
like a heart attack

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.580
or an otherwise natural
death to you?"

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.560
The younger guy shook
his head, "Seems weird.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.090
Like he hit the ground
and just froze."

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.100
The other EMT rubbed his chin,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.200
"Can't see I've seen anything
like this in real life.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.390
It reminds me of something
I saw on cable TV."

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.690
"What do you mean?"

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.990
I asked. "You know.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.910
One of those channels with
the historical documentaries.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.210
It's like that town in Italy

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.850
where the volcano erupted
thousands of years ago."

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.150
"Pompeii?"

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.450
I offered.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.810
He raised a triumphant
finger, "You've got it!

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.720
Everyone was killed and then
preserved instantly by ash.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.830
This guy looks like one of those
unlucky people stopped dead

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.130
in his tracks."

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.440
Glass stared at the paramedic for
a long moment before speaking.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.740
"Well, one thing's for certain.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.120
There was no volcano in the
middle of the Continental Club.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.430
So what killed him?"

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.910
The detective bent down
to take a closer look.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.910 position:56%
She immediately noticed the red mark
on the dead man's neck and motioned

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.570
for the History Channel
watching medic to join her.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.870
"What do you see here?

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.170
Is it a wound?

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.470
A bug bite?"

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.110
The paramedic hesitated
almost as if to say

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.630 position:56%
that answering her question exceeded
his pay grade, but he complied

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.010
without protest even
whipping out a small pen light

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.050
to shine on Bancroft's neck.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.710
"I'm not a medical examiner,
ma'am, but that's not

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.860
from a mosquito," he concluded.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.890
Glass grabbed the pen light
and peered at the small blotch.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.740
"That's helpful, but what is it?"

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.310
"Maybe an injection site.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.700
You can see the dot in the center.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.400
There's a bit of blood around it."

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.450
Detective glass must have agreed
with the medic's conclusion.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.590
After examining Grayson's neck
again she leaned back and said,

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.090
"Thank you for your help.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.780
Everything had happened so fast
I hadn't had much time to think

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.660
about the consequences of
finding the mysterious mark

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.840
on Bancroft's body, an
odd and inauspicious start

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.670
to my morning had suddenly turned
into something more sinister.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.530
Detective Glass jotted
down more notes

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.400
and tapped her pen to her forehead.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.100
To no one in particular
she stated the obvious,

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.350
"I don't like how this
is shaping up."

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.650
I drew nearer.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.730
"Detective, I'm clearly not
going for a run this morning.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.200
Do you mind if I return to my
room so I can speak with my fiance

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.430
and put on more appropriate
clothes?"

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.320 position:56%
With an absentminded sideways
glance, Glass answered, "Of course."

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.020
Then, she quickly added, "Don't
go anywhere else, Miss Marshall.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.930
You may have just become a
key witness to a murder."

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.140
I was no stranger to
those fateful words.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.940
Thank you.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:42:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.340
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Thank you, Colleen.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.600
Oh. We can do the raffle.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.900
Do you have a book to give away?

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.200
She does.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.480
All right.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.130
Calling number 144255.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.430
&gt;&gt; Right here.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.730
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Oh!

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.030
Someone -- OK.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.980
It worked kind of.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.370
Con Lehane's newest book, "Murder
at the 42nd Street Library,"

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.710
came out earlier this
year from Minotaur.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.270
It's the first in a new series
featuring Raymond Ambler,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:38.120 position:56%
Curator at the 42nd Street Library's
fictional crime fiction collection.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.190
He's also been published in Alfred
Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.320 position:56%
and has a different mysteries series
featuring a New York City bartender

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.970
named Brian McNulty.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.990
Over the years Con has been a
college professor, union organizer,

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:53.460
labor journalist, disciple,
and has tended bar at two dozen

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.410
or so drinking establishments.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.410
He teaches fiction
writing and mystery writing

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:00.470
at the Writer's Center in Bethesda
and is the only person I know

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.980
who still uses a fax machine.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.510
Here's Con Lehane.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:13.060

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.160
&gt;&gt; Con Lehane: I'm really surprised
about that fax machine thing.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.980
Is that a -- I didn't know
they had been replaced.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:26.620
I also think this is the first time
in the history of Noirs at the Bar

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:33.130
that we've had a signing
interpreters so thank you.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.510
It's a great --

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.390
So Ed said who the series is.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.690
So that pretty much covers it.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.450
This is the second
book in the series.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.290
It's called "Murder in
the Manuscript Room"

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.070
and it's coming out in November.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.620
Maybe -- all right.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.630
So I'm going to read
a short section.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.470
Now, you should be able to follow.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.070
Ambler is the Raymond Ambler,

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.460
the Curator of the
Crime Fiction Collection

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.660
at the New York Public Library,
the 42nd Street Library.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.400
What struck Ambler
was a coincidence.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.730
A week before he'd gotten a
call from an upstate prison --

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:23.620
actually the call was from
his son who is in prison.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:27.130
You have to read the first book
to understand why he was there.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:32.140
But a lifer there told his son
he was a friend of his father

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.010
and wanted to talk to him.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:39.050
The prisoner, Devon Thomas, in
fact had been Ambler's friend,

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:43.050
a very good friend from 6th
grade until Devon dropped

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.780
out of high school at 16 to run

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:50.530 position:56%
with the Black Peoples' Party the
last time Ambler had seen him except

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.990
in a Daily News photo
wearing handcuffs.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.530
On his monthly visit to his
son the previous Saturday,

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.210
Ambler looked up his friend.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.500
Devon told him he was in prison
for a murder he didn't commit.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.920
"My kid brother did the murder."

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.440
Devon told him.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.970
His hard stare faltered.

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.080
"Trey was a snitch.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.510
I took the rap because I knew
someone would kill him in here."

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.810
"And now?"

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.160
Ambler asked?

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.020
"He died a couple of weeks ago."

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.270
A skeptical person might
doubt Devon's story

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:31.870
that he'd spent his adult life in
prison for a crime he didn't commit

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:34.670
out of loyalty to his brother.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.750
Ambler believed him.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.080
He'd met Devon in 6th grade
at a new school for Ambler.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.560
The first day he was
surrounded in the hallway

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.950
by a half dozen would-be -- he
was surrounded in the hallway

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:55.190
by a half dozen would-be hoodlums
taunting him for some imagined

00:45:55.190 --> 00:46:00.440
or fabricated slight when he
felt an arm around his shoulder.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.960
It was Devon, who amiably
brushed aside the thugs

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.460
and walked him into the classroom.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.250 position:56%
Ambler knew some of the history
behind Devon's arrest and conviction

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.230
because it was major news
in the tabloids at the time.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.830
In the early '80s, a group of truck
drivers took on a corrupt union

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:22.520
in the garment trucking industry.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.610
One of the leaders of the
insurgence, Richard Wright,

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:30.190
was murdered shortly after he was
elected president of the local

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.840
in a government monitored election.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.890
"Devon Thomas killed
him," the newspapers said,

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:40.710
"in a feud between rival
gangs over drug territory."

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.940
"No way I killed him," Devon said.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.060
"I loved him like a father.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.380
Trey was a rat.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.570
A snitch. I didn't know.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.870
Never thought it.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.950
Never suspected until he
got scared and told me.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.760
Told me his handler
told him to off Richard.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.810
When he told me, I wanted
to kill Trey myself.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:06.250
You become a snitch because
you're paid or you do it

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.840
to keep yourself out of prison.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.960
His handler from the NYPD
told Trey he'd get off.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.700
Then, something went wrong and
the handler told Trey he'd have

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.950
to plead to manslaughter.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.980
They'd get him out in three years.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.400
Trey told me he wacked Richard
and was going up for it.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.950
I couldn't let him do it.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:28.280
I took the rap.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.310
I thought I'd get the same deal.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.750
They told Trey manslaughter,
a three year bid.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.980
Ha! I got life."

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.860
Devon's hair, still
kinky, had turned gray.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.940
Tight curls now where years
ago it was a giant afro.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.800
His eyes were clear, still
hard, still something friendly

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.720
in them too, a flash of
kindness behind the hard.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.930
His skin darker than
Ambler remembered,

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:04.420
his features as much European as
African, a slender nose, thin lips.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.510
He'd developed the prison
body, muscular, athletic.

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.590
As he talked he'd reach out
now and again putting his hand

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:15.470
on Ambler's forearm to make
sure he had his attention,

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.920
to reinforce the connection.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.310
He did this now.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.420
"Trey got the AIDS.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.230
I got compassion leave the
visit him in the hospice.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.210
He was out of his head a lot.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:32.810
Right before he died he told
me he didn't kill Richard.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.170
They killed him."

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.960
"Who's 'They?'" Ambler asked?

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.300
Devon shook his head.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.600
"I don't know.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.300
I got some ideas.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.160
I've been going back over
what happened back then.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.980
I'm using the prison
library, but it's slow.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:54.930
I thought you might see what you
can find in that library of yours

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.510
about what happened back then.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:58.810
I read about you.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.750
That's what you do, right?

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:05.950
You find out what really
happened when someone was killed?"

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.410
"Not exactly," Ambler said.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.350
"You can tell the truth now, right?

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:11.650
Your brother's dead.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.740
You didn't commit the murder."

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.960
Devon's eyes locked on Ambler's.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.390
"Who'd believe me?"

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.790
Ambler nodded.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.090
"I know you, Ray.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.160
We were bros."

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.460
Devon laughed.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.680
It began as a kind of giggle
catching on like an uncertain motor

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.240
until it became a chuckle
and then a full out laugh.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.790
The sound of it rolled back the
years to the endless summers he

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.510
and Devon, baseball gloves
and bats over their shoulders,

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.920
rambled through Flatbush
seeking out pick-up games

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.650
in schoolyards and vacant lots.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.310
The nights they played stick
ball under the street lights

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.590
between the parked cars on E and
19th Street off Beverley Road.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.890
OK. That's it.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.190
Thank you.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:04.700
I have a book to raffle off if
you think you can handle it.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.000
Eh [laughing]?

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:17.530
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Thank you, con.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.330
Please leave the stage.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:23.040
[ Laughter ]

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.300
Con has a book to raffle off

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:31.910
and the lucky winner is
-- you applaud for raffle?

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.210
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.510
I [inaudible].

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.110
Sorry. Sorry.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.410
I was very confused.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.710
144296. Oh!

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.510
Hey! The lovely lady in the back.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.340
That's my mom [laughing].

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.850
Shawn Reilly Simmons is the author

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:59.510

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.730
Sutherland, an onset movie caterer,

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.230
and of several short stories
appearing in various anthologies.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.560
She serves on the Board of Malice
Domestic, is a member of the Dames

which has published many
award winning anthologies

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.170
that writers are often
desperate to appear in

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.450
and will do anything
to curry her favor.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:22.310
On an unrelated note,
Shawn, you're very pretty.

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.110
Here she is.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:38.460
[ Applause ]

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Shawn Reilly Simmons: Thanks, Ed.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.980
You're very pretty too.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.590
I'm going to read a story called
"Humble Pie" and it appears

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:50.230
in this anthology Noir at the Salad
Bar, Culinary Tales with a Bite.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.610
Sort of the anti-cozy
culinary anthology.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:54.910
Humble Pie.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:59.220
Ivy always gave me that look.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.840
Her tight, prissy little lip twist.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.410
The laugh I could see
right behind her eyes.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.310
I smiled back like I always do.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.980
I stepped up to her judging
table to set down my pie.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.580
"Same kind as last year," Ivy said
with a small shake of her head.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.500
"I love mincemeat pie,
especially near to the holidays."

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.260
I smiled again.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.090 position:56%
"Well, good luck to you then, Sissy.

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:23.560
This might finally be your year."

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.300
Sissy. She was always calling me

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.170
that even though she knew
damn well I was married now

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:32.130
and should be called Mrs. Cecilia
Burns if she wanted to be proper.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:34.510
Ivy's eyes opened wide and
she fussed at her orange,

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:36.870
polka dotted scarf when
she saw Jean Brodie walking

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.190
up with a lattice topped
deep dish apple.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.930
She just about toppled her chair
over backwards jerking up like

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.950
that from her seat reaching
across the table to take the pie

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:49.220
from Jean acting all
friendly and whatnot.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.220
I heard Ivy call Jean a
dirty bitch -- b-word --

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.770
once in the bathroom
back in school just

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.790
because her daddy owned the
junk yard and repair shop.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.090
Ivy didn't know I heard her.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.450
I had my feet propped up on
the toilet like I used to do

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.800
so I could hear what
those girls were saying

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.010 position:56%
when they thought no one was around.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.870
I guess Ivy thinks Jean's all right
now since she's rick on account

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.650
of her husband owning the one
and only car dealership in town.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.310
Owned. It's Jean's now.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:20.020 position:56%
Her husband fell over one day on the
lot a year or so back right in front

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.720
of a couple he'd just
taken for a test drive

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.130
in a brand new Buick Riviera.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.860
I heard he clutched his chest
and called out for Jean.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.620
He was romantic like that.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.900
"Jean, you just have to come
up to our next fundraiser,"

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.270
Ivy said through her smile,
still tugging at her scarf

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.320
in that anxious way of hers.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.900
"We're raising money to buy a new
nativity scene for the square."

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.740
"So I've heard," said Jean.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.040
She folded her hands in front

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.770
of her showing off her
expensive leather gloves.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.190
"I like your scarf," I interrupted.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:50.020
Jean and Ivy both looked at me.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.370
Ivy smirked and tilted her
head, then turned back to Jean.

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.980
Jean squinted at me like I had
a toe growing between my eyes.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.280
"Like I was saying.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.940 position:56%
The little Christ baby from our old
nativity, the paint's all worn away.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.680
It's not right having him sit out
there all chip-faced and decrepit.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.160
It goes against God."

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.980
"How are you doing, Cecilia?"

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.440
Jean Brodie asked me a question.

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.740
"Fine, thanks.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.040
And you?" "I'm all right.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.720
And how is Mr. Burns?"

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.370
I beamed and reached up a
hand to straighten my hat.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:19.670
"We're both just fine.

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:20.970
Thanks for asking."

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:22.460
"Glad to hear it," Jean said.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.550
"I do see your husband from
time to time always out

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.220
and about in his tow truck.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.700
Sometimes he pulls old trade-ins
to the lot that don't run anymore."

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.890 position:56%
"Oh, he's on the road all the time,"
I said tripping over my words.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.370
"We'd have two or three
babies by now

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.290
if he could just be
home more often."

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:38.500
"Yes. I'm sure that's
true," Jean said wistfully.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.130
"Just remember, life's little
blessings come along right

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.970
when they're supposed to."

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:45.030
I nodded and smiled
like I always do.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:46.890
The children at the next
table rubbed sticky paint

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.230
onto maple leaves and pressed
them onto construction paper.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:53.220
"I just remembered," Jean said
acting all surprised, "Ivy,

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.890
weren't you and Marvin
king and queen

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.060
of the Fall Fest back in the day?"

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.850
"Oh, yes, we were," Ivy said acting
like she couldn't quite remember.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.830
"But that was so long ago."

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.780
"Yes, I suppose we've
all gotten a lot older.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.730 position:56%
Well, you ladies enjoy the seasons,"
Jean said in her grand way.

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:10.910
She waved to someone in
the crowd and drifted off.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.280
I turned back to Ivy.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.730
Her eyes burned into the
back of Jean's cashmere coat.

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:18.520
She had that same look on her
face that she did back in school,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.250
but this time she was too afraid
to call Jean a b-word out loud

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.400
in public not that
we were all grownups.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.900
A surprise bubble of laughter
rolled up my chest and I coughed

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.200
into my fist to keep it down.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.520
I sat on a cold, metal folding
chair and watched the rest

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.370
of the fall fest pies come in.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.670
I knew mine was different.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:38.830
It would be the one they'd
all be talking about after.

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.130
When it came time for judging,
Ivy and her friends hovered

00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.960
over the gingham tablecloth
all official

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.980
and whatnot in their frilly aprons.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.050
They tasted little bits of pie
from their plastic forks acting

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.140
out for all of us like they didn't
ever take big bites of anything.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.560
Then, they joked about getting
fat and watching their waistlines

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.840
like judging a pie contest was the
last thing they wanted to be doing.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.830
I watched especially close
when Ivy tasted mine.

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:02.750
I pressed my own hand
to my narrow side.

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:05.250
It was almost done hurting
from that last time.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.170 position:56%
Marvin was good about leaving the
marks under my clothes so when I was

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:11.040
out and about in town no one
could see my black and blues.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.100
I could keep my head up and look
at everyone in the eye that way.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.040
I slipped my hand into my pocket
and felt the folded piece of paper,

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.290 position:56%
smoothed edges from all those times
I had folded it and refolded it ever

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:22.000
since I found it last
week on laundry day.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.210
"We have a winner!"

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.510
Ivy shouted.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:29.190 position:56%
She stuck the big blue ribbon on the
table in front of Jean's apple pie.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:30.490
Some people tried to clap

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:33.580 position:56%
through their gloves while balancing
flimsy cups of cider in their hands.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.710
They sounded like that hurt
bird I found in the yard

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.690
that time flapping its
wings for no reason just

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.220
because it thought it should.

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.940
I knew that bird would
never fly again.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.240
Jean made her way to the table

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.820
and took a flowery bow thanking
all the judges one by one.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.580
She took an extra-long time
thanking Ivy holding both her hands

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.430
with her own and pumping
them up and down.

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.730
They looked like a couple

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.170
of overdressed milk maids
churning a pot of butter.

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:57.660
Then, Jean turned and smiled right
at me before she wandered off

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.960
in the crowd ribbon in hand.

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.410
I heard a few sirens that night,
but they were too far off for me

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.710
to place what part of town.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:07.070
I was in my usual chair
at the kitchen table,

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.130
the radio playing John
Coltrane low from the counter.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:11.500 position:56%
Marvin didn't have a taste for music

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.880
that he said white
people had nothing to do

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.220
with so I always kept an
eye out for the headlights

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.390
so I can turn it off quick just to
keep him from shouting about it.

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:22.980
I ate my pie slowly, one bite of
minced meat and a bite of apple,

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.510
taking sips of black
coffee in between.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:26.810
The letter I found written

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.810
in that prissy tight
handwriting lay open on the table.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:30.750
I read it maybe 100 times.

00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:33.120
Ivy still made those little
curlicue shapes on her y's

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.000
like she hadn't grown up at all.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.560
I bid on both pies after the
contest, had to pay a lot more

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.250
for Jean's than mine, of course.

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.130
The headlights skidded across
the windows and I looked up,

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:44.010
my heart beat slowing to a thud.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:47.070
I folded Ivy's note and
put it in my apron pocket.

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.750
My legs tingled when I stood up
and went to shut off the radio.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.990
The clock told me I'd been
sitting there for over an hour.

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.610
I'd eaten almost half of both pies.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:57.100
The kitchen door rattled open.

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.900
"They're gone," Jean
said, her cheeks flushed.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.070
She pulled her hat off and let her
hair spill down over her shoulders.

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.610
"Gone?" I asked.

00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:06.280
"They're dead," Jean said.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.980
"Break failure out on
the new two-lane highway.

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.800
Headlong collision
with a big wheeler.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.940
Marvin's tow truck was parked at
the edge of the Fall Fest lot.

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.870
Just took one snip."

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:15.170
"What about the truck driver?

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.470
Is he all right?"

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.690
I asked. Jean broke out a laugh
and pulled off her gloves,

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:20.170
her fingers black with grease.

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.470
"He'll live.

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:22.770
It's all perfect."

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:24.540
Jean put her hands on my
cheeks and pulled me close.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.030 position:56%
She kissed me that way that I like,
gentle at first, then more grown up,

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:29.500
her tongue sliding up against mine.

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.820
I kissed her back like I always do.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.040
"I got you something," she
said when we came up for air.

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.460
"What?" She pulled Ivy's
orange polka dotted scarf

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.720
from her coat pocket
and handed it to me.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.300
"How did you get this?"

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.390
"Ivy gave it to me when I promised
to come to the next fundraiser."

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.420
Jean laughed so hard
she lost her breath.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.870
I smiled and kissed her
again like I always do.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:59:08.400
[ Applause ]

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.700
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: Thank you, Shawn.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.920
Shawn is raffling off a copy of
the anthology her book appeared in.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.770
And the lucky number is 144310.

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:23.560
Oh! OK. I'll bring it to you.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:29.310
Yeah. OK. James Grady's first novel
became Robert Redford's Three Days

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:30.610
at the Condor.

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:31.910
Aren't you fancy, James?

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.350
And is under development for a TV
series scheduled for next year.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.580
Since Condor, Grady has
published more than a dozen novels

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:41.940
and three times as many short
stories across genres working

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.630
at Hollywood as a screenwriter for
HBO and CBS and as a staff writer

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.680
for the late TV empire
creator Steven Curnow.

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.150
He spent four years as an
investigative reporter here in DC

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:56.190
and has won literary awards
from Japan, Italy, and France.

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:58.620
Montana born and raised,
Grady now lives just

00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.550
up the Red Line in Silverspring.

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:05.420 position:56%
As an FYI, I asked and, no, he will
not introduce you to Robert Redford.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.510
But here's James Grady.

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:26.160
[ Applause ]

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.980
&gt;&gt; James Grady: I thought Robert
Redford was coming to hear Con read

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.400
so I've been looking
around hoping to spot him,

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.600
but I must have been misinformed.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.140
This is such a gas to be here
at the National Book Festival

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.810
and it's a double gas because
the book I'm reading from,

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:47.430
"Montana Noir," comes out Tuesday.

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:52.510
The Montana Noir anthology
of short fiction is part

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:59.280
of an astonishing legacy that now
encompasses 80 books published in,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.040
I think, 19 countries.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.010
There have been two
DC noir collections.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.370
I hope there will be a third.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:13.210
My short story takes
place eventually

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.260
in my home town of Shelby.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.970
The story's called,
"The Road You Take."

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.240
A big blue sky arched over
that prairie highway driven

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.980
by a low, white minivan.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.740
Roxy road behind Desiree
who'd called shotgun

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.210
when they left last night's
motel in a pine trees

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:43.150
and good money town
across the mountains.

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:47.930
Shotgun meant riding next
to Bear, 300 plus pounds

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:51.610
of watch-out crammed
behind the steering wheel.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:56.700
He stank of weed he wouldn't
share, cigarettes, and whiskey,

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.580
plus you might catch a paw
if he thought you'd sassed

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.900
or he simply got the
itch to pop somebody.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:07.990
But Desiree packed 60 extra
pounds of flesh on her 5'8"

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:14.460
in stiletto heels frame and the
big girl knew how to take a hit.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.790
Cherry road on Roxy's left
past the cooler behind Bear,

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:22.340
her golden blonde dye
job had more class

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.080
than Desiree's motel sink peroxide.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.070
Cherry craned to see
where they were going

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:33.690
as if there were some
destination besides the next gig.

01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:37.370
She was a few high school years
ahead of Roxy who wondered

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:40.200
of somewhere under
heaven there was a letter

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.360
or e-mail inviting her real name
to her class's 10 year reunion.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:52.190
That notion made Roxy laugh as the
white van rumbled her life away.

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.490
"What's so funny?"

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:58.480 position:56%
mumbled Star from the way back where
she road slumped amid suitcases,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.010
sound system speakers, cables,
minispots, make-up and custom bag,

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.540
telescoping dancing poles,
and the deflated ring

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.540
for bikini wrestling gigs.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.330
"What isn't funny?"

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.030
Cherry arched her back to stretch.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.930
Potholes on this two-lane
highway across the top

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:23.500
of the state retailed the
minivan, but Roxy saw no tremble

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:30.360
in the breasts some surgeon built
beneath Cherry's red sweater.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.640 position:56%
Roxy thought, "Wonder if Cherry paid
back the loan plus [inaudible] Luke

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.600
fronted her for that work.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.270
Wonder how much longer
I can keep him

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:45.550
from helping me go
under some knife."

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:50.630
Star said, "Nothing funny about
one of you skimming me stash."

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:54.910
"Not me!" said Desiree,
"And no way it's Bear.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.980
Crystal would make his head fart."

01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.740 position:56%
Whoosh came Bear's back hand toward
Desiree, missed because a gopher ran

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.750
across the road, made him swerve
the minivan and messed up his aim.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.840
"Almost," said Cherry of the
attempted varmint murder.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.910
"Star, Luke's rules say
no rips, no hold-backs.

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:19.980 position:56%
So there's no thieves in this ride."

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.620
Bear growled, "Don't
talk about Luke.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.070
I'm road boss.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:29.970
And no more asking to drive
or cozying up to the man."

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:34.340
"I'm just trying to stick
to my place," said Cherry.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.470
Roxy said, "Nobody's
skimming you, Star.

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:40.410
You could tell.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.220
Tweakers know tweakers."

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:49.590
So far Star steered clear of the
needle and the pipe, only sniffing.

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:54.970
She kept her high cheek bones,
tawny haired, stop-traffic beauty.

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:59.740
Her teeth and her tight TNA,
no tremor in her pony legs

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:06.080
when she stripped, but her
eyes were always black holes.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.680
"Catch some sleep," Roxy told
the beauty in the way back.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.990
"Sleep is when they
get you," said Star.

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:19.600
"You can really get got when
you're tweaked," said Desiree.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.720
"Don't care then."

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.610
Desiree stared out the windshield.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:28.590
There's a whole lot of
out there out there.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:32.100
The Western third of the state
was the Rocky Mountains marching

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.830
down from Canada, pine
tree crags soring more

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:38.470
than a mile above sea level.

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:42.410 position:56%
East of the mountains meant scrub
grass prairies and [inaudible] brown

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:48.290
and gold fields of rotated crops,
which, if you weren't born there,

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:52.790
looked like one terrifying
big empty.

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:55.200
In the two weeks Roxy had gone

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.900 position:56%
to community college a teacher had
said Montana held seven regions each

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.850
bigger than many other states.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:08.650
Where she was now was the Hi-Line
named for the railroad built

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:13.620
after the Civil War by a tycoon
who got free land along his tracks

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.050
from the Federal Government.

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:20.210
Got the feds to create cargo
and passengers for his trains

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.100
with public land giveaways
to homesteaders

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:28.320
who didn't understand it
rained next to never out there.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.780
Before Roxy's lifetime,
when the glaciers melted,

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:37.580
40 below zero blizzards roared over
the prairies a few times a year.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.940
Most homesteaders fled,
died, or went crazy.

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.230
The ones who stayed
leathered up rough and tough.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:52.610
Like me, Roxy's eyes
found the van's mirror.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.950
What the locals saw when she
stripped was chopped hair the color

01:06:55.950 --> 01:07:01.760
of dirt, nothing special behind,
and up front two small for no more

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.440
than five dollar tips, ice eyes.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:11.290 position:56%
And no matter the hoots, hollers,
and creep games nobody ever saw more

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:14.620
than what she was tough
enough to sell.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.800
Except Paul.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.900
Dead rabbit on the road.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.200
Bear swerved to run over it.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:27.310
His mirror showed him mountains
shrinking 40 miles behind them.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:30.920
They'd rolled east out to the
prairies, blew through Browning

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.390
on the Black Feet Reservation,
barreled through Cutbank

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.270
like that town wasn't there.

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:41.440
Coming up on the left horizon
Roxy saw three blue humps,

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.260
the Sweet Grass Hills,

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.730
mini mountains left
over from dinosaur days.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:53.920
She stared out the window, said,
"Here come the space aliens."

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.550
Like an Army of giants
10 stories tall,

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:03.460
100 windmills with spinning white
blades rose from the prairie.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:08.500
Big money invaders that, in
harmony with Montana's history,

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.590
were built elsewhere
and sent electricity

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:14.660
from the local wind out of state.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:22.350
A dozen miles beyond the Army of
windmills waited Shelby and Paul.

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.800
"Yay! I got cell service!

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:30.040
OK!" Desiree said waving her
cell phone registered by Luke

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.680
through some gonna-bust-it account.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:39.380
"Promise I'll work my gigs, but
first I need me some Candy Crush."

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.070
Every circuit girl had a
website for credit card chats

01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:48.650
and private downloads with viruses
run by some hacker in Russia.

01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:51.250
Once Luke's crew had gotten
all they were going to get

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:56.150
from a cyber troll, that citizen
might find his credit crashed

01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:57.890
and his bank tapped.

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:00.900
A touch of that coming
back to Luke to be washed

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.390
in his payday dollars now
yellow shack on Bozeman strips

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:10.230
of warehouses, seedy
motels, and bars.

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:13.360
Luke kicked a slice
of the hack score back

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.150
to the women he put online
minus any vig they owed him.

01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:23.070
Then there's the cash
from the dates.

01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:25.710
Roxy didn't do that.

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:29.770
"Yet," Cherry had whispered to
her a week before in Lincoln.

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:36.890
The truckers in Unabomber town
the mountains there in Lincoln,

01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:40.680
Roxy caught Cherry
sneaking back into the diner

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.850
from the highway patrol cruiser
parked out back, from the badge

01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:49.270
who had a kink, Cherry
parleyed into law-man tips

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.700
that got her nods from Luke.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:57.560 position:56%
But that badge wasn't clocked to
meet up with Cherry on this circuit.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.120
Cherry saw herself
caught in Roxy's eyes,

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:07.110
put a finger to her smeared
ruby lips, "We all got secrets."

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:09.340
Now, on that April morning,

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:14.400
the white van rushed past
the wind farm Army of towers.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.960
Shadows from the spinning
blades slashed Roxy.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:25.170
Cherry told the driver, "You're
belt's packing the take just fine."

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:29.890
"Shut up about my belt or
you'll get it," growled Bear.

01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:36.570
Cherry ignored him, gave Roxy
a look about -- about the take?

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:40.790
There's the take and
there's the books.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:45.830
The books are the circuit's fee
plus a cut of the door at bars,

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:51.440
bachelor blowouts, or frat house
gigs, negotiated taxes on beers

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.190
and booze, payout for
gas and motel rooms,

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:59.520
and independent contractor
fees to the stable.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.980
The books are for the law.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.450
The take is the everything else,
a cut of all the presidents tucked

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:12.940
into G-strings or tossed on a beer
stained floor, half the dollars

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:19.500
from dates cleared by the road boss
that Roxy still said, "no," to.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.060
Desiree said yes to such got-to-pay
dates from the same kind of guys

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.890
who mocked her as, "Fatty,"
back in high school.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:29.920
"So who's laughing now, huh?"

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.510
"Cherry picked," referring to
the big shots who were reeled

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:39.730
in by the blonde with big
breasts and big ideas.

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:42.560
Star let any guy with
the right cash hang her

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.880
up in whatever night he wanted.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:48.680
But the major dollars in the
take came from the envelopes

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.220
that nameless mooks brought to
bear as they traveled the road,

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.780
cash laundered into the
books as gross income.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:05.440 position:56%
The books and the take, what they
say you do, and what you really get.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.550
White signs on a green road sign
read, "Shelby, seven miles."

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:15.930
Bear's eyes goaded Roxy
from the rearview mirror.

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:18.160
"Maybe I'll stop."

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.670
Shelby'd been a gig on
the circuit last month.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:25.180 position:56%
A mesa rim float off to Roxy's left.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:29.340
Up on the right she saw the
truck-sized flapping American flag

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.780
near the highway crossroads.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.770
One road through town,
the other to Canada

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:39.170
or toward Great Falls past
the electrified chain fence

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:41.030
of a private prison.

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:43.810
The books claimed they'd
done great the first night

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.250
of their double header
gig in Shelby at Jammer's,

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:51.330
a former track side
slaughterhouse renovated to a bar

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:56.210
with a liquor license acquired from
a gone-broke tavern in polluted,

01:12:56.210 --> 01:13:02.770
poisoned Libby 246 miles away
in the pine forested mountains

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.590
of the Northwest corner
of the state.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:10.710
Jammer's owner clung to Shelby's
dreams that windfarm workers

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:16.590 position:56%
and prison guards someday were
going to drop enough dollars in town

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:21.620
to banish the white wash
windows off Main Street.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.420
Thank you.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:38.220
[ Applause ]

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.900
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: You can
always tell a Montana story

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.930
because it has the
word, "varmint," in it.

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:46.510
Sujata Massey's Rei Shimura series
has been nominated for the Edgar,

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:48.610
Anthony, and Mary Higgins
Clark Awards

01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:50.650
and won the Agatha and Macavity.

01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:52.920
She's also the author of
"The Sleeping Dictionary"

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.980
and "India Gray: Historical
Fiction."

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.110
She has a new series
coming in January

01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:01.640
from Soho Press featuring Bombay's
first female lawyer in the '20s.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.630 position:56%
The first book in the series is
titled "The Widows of Malabar Hill."

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:06.930
On a personal note, she's one

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.330
of the first thriller
writers I ever read seriously

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:12.570
and admire her a great deal so
I'm not going to poke fun of her.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:14.530
Instead, I'll make fun
of Con really quick.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:17.030
Of course nobody uses
fax machines anymore.

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:18.470
That's so out dated.

01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:19.860
Why would anyone use a fax machine?

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.660
Here's Sujata.

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:30.040
[ Applause ]

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.200
&gt;&gt; Sujata Massey: Hey, I'm so
surprised everybody is still

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.620
around for the last reader.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.630
But then I sat down
in one of those chairs

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:40.140
and I realized how incredibly
comfortable they are.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.950
I mean, we should have these chairs

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.720
and bean bags everywhere
that we appear.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.860
I'm going to read a little bit from
that first book in the new series

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.000
that Ed mentioned, "The
Widows of Malabar Hill."

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.060 position:56%
And the lead character in this book,

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.340
who's going to be narrating
this section that you hear,

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.460
is named Perveen Mistry and
she's a young woman lawyer.

01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:06.410
In fact, she's the first
woman lawyer in Bombay.

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:10.250
And she gets into a
lot of tight spots

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.680
as a woman lawyer doing
this difficult job.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.200
And you'll see where she is.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.950
I think you'll figure out
what happened to her just

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:22.290
as she's figuring it out too.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:27.400
Cat out of the bag,
Bombay, February 1921.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:33.220
When Perveen awoke, her throat felt
dry although her body was soaked.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:36.710
She'd sweated maybe for hours.

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:40.280
She was wrapped up in
a thick, rough blanket.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.150
Reaching out a few inches, she
tried to tug the cloth down,

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:47.500
but it just pulled tighter
around her curled up form.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.910
And then she remembered.

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:51.660
Bruce Street and the shock

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:55.730
of a cloth sack coming
down over her head.

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:59.560
She had a memory of fighting
against it and then being hit.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.290
She recalled a bumpy
ride and being hauled out

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:06.460
and hearing the lapping
sound of water.

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.690
She'd braced for the
feeling of sinking

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:12.140
like a stone into cold water.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.600
She knew she'd end her
life in the Arabian Sea,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.320
the body of water her
ancestors had crossed

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.510
to build their new lives in India.

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:27.140
At the Calcutta High Court,
Cyrus had sworn vengeance on her.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.650
The years between that time had
been filled with the excitement

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:36.100
of Oxford, returning to Bombay, and
working as a full-fledged solicitor

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.360
in her father's practice.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.450
Until the last few days,
she'd relinquished her fears.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:46.990
The attack had caught her off
guard despite the warning signs,

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.740
and the plan would come
off without a hitch.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:52.350
Her parents didn't know
about anything amiss

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:53.650
and enough time had passed

01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:58.390
so there'd be no suspicion
of the Soda Wala family.

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.910
And her death, once
it was discovered,

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.670
would allow Cyrus to
marry a new wife.

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:08.260
A loud ship's horn interrupted
her thoughts reminding her

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.440
of another possibility.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.970
She recalled the hulking
figure of Giant's boss, Ravi.

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:19.300
Ravi had been furious about the
changes Giant's legal victory had

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.290
brought about for all
the stevedores.

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:26.130
As revenge against her father,
Perveen, who'd shown her face

01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:29.620
at the docks, could
have been abdicated.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:34.910
Now she'd be left to die and
Ravi would escape prosecution.

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.480
But there was also
the Ferrite situation.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.090
Someone involved might worry she
was getting close to the truth.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.630
The telephone call from a
woman that had brought her

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.280
out at night could have been
a ploy and the disabling

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.760
of Ramchandra's rickshaw
had been intentional.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.060
This, of course, pointed

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.810
to the attacker being
connected to the caller.

01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:57.650
She'd been taken around
eight in the evening.

01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.540
What time was it now?

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:02.670
She slid her stiff right
hand over her left forearm

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:07.640
until she felt the rectangular
face of her French wrist watch.

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.580
She could not read
the time in the dark,

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.320
but it was comforting
to still have it.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.730
She wondered if she
had anything else.

01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:18.340 position:56%
Groping with both hands, she found
her beaded purse trapped in a corner

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.270
of the sack near her feet.

01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:24.330
How surprising the
assailant hadn't taken it.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.710
Perhaps it was meant
to be an identifier

01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:30.490
after she was nothing
more than a pile of bones.

01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:34.470
The fact she'd been left alive
might mean somebody was nearby

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:36.130
keeping guard.

01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:38.100
She wanted to know.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:42.260
Clearing her scratchy throat,
she began shouting in Marathi.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.650
"What are you doing sticking
me in a bag like this?

01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:47.860
Kidnapping's a crime!"

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.180
She shouted for five minutes
changing the language to Hindi

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.830
and then to English steadily
raising her level of profanity.

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:59.890
Hearing nothing but silence,
she gathered she was alone.

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:01.970
If she were truly alone,
she could try

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.780
to escape the bag without
interference.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.190
Feeling more determined

01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:10.780
than frightened now Perveen began
exploring the scratchy sack.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.430
The top end was sewn
straight across,

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:16.070
but the end near her feet
was drawn tightly together

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:18.380
as if it had been tied with a rope.

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.250
She could not possibly untie
something knotted on the outside.

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:25.660
The only way out would be
to tear the straight edge.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.590
Perveen searched through
her small, beaded purse,

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:33.280
which contained a few coins,
business cards, the vile of attar,

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.780
and her mother of pearl
fountain pain.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:40.410
She removed a metal hairpin from
her braided coronet and tried

01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:42.460
to stab it through the cloth.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.820
The thin pin broke
on the 5th attempt,

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.000
but she really needed
a sharp bit of metal.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.160
She thought of the whale
bones inside her brassiere,

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.810
but she didn't have enough space to
move her arms to unhook her blouse.

01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:00.080
So she took the fountain
pen and rubbed its nib

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.850
against the sharp, broken hairpin.

01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:04.900
It took only a few
minutes of industrious work

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.760
to give the pen's nib
a knife-like sharpness.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.830
She was elated when
she pushed the pen

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.650
into the bag's fabric
and it went through.

01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:14.530
Diligently, she stabbed the cloth

01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:17.330
until she made an opening
of a few inches.

01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:21.360
Then, with her hands, she tore
it open the rest of the way.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.530
Squeezing herself out, she
slowly released her arms and legs

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:26.560
from the tight ball they'd been in.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.050
Her right foot throbbed with
pain and so did some spots

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:32.230
in her back and one elbow.

01:20:32.230 --> 01:20:34.580
But she was free.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.640
In a short, dark space
that smelled of dust.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.990
Groping around, she identified
many more sacks around her.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:45.930
The crowding gave the
impression she was in a storeroom,

01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:50.020
perhaps one of the many go-downs
built in rows near the harbor

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.870
or at Ballard Pier itself.

01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:57.000
Goods were held for months and
sometimes years in the go-downs.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.360
She remembered her brother Rustam's
frustration about a shipload

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.100
of nails that should have been
delivered to Mistry Construction,

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:09.270 position:56%
but had been accidently stored after
the unloading and forever lost.

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:11.550
She tried to think logically.

01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:13.310
She'd been loaded into this place.

01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:15.940
There had to be a way
to the outside.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.090
First, she searched the low ceiling
hoping to find the base of a shoot.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:23.180
There was none, at
least not near her.

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:27.970 position:56%
She shifted her investigation to the
cold cement walls around the sacks.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:32.650 position:56%
Moving made her feel the impact of
begin in a windowless, doorless box.

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:35.930
She was becoming frightened,
realized that not knowing

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:38.140
where she was in relation
to the bag she'd broken

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.640
out of made her feel lost.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.400
Perveen said a silent prayer and
afterward her mind felt clear.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.180
If she'd been brought to a
place already filled with goods,

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.100
she'd probably been left close
to the front of the space

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.040
and whatever door existed.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.770
She crawled back to the spot
where the destroyed bag lay.

01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.940
Then she sat down and
felt everything around it.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:03.080
A raised edge on the wooden
base caught her attention.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.920
When she touched it, she
realized it was one edge

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.150
of a large wooden square.

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:11.990 position:56%
She was able to pry up the square
and pushed one of her hands through.

01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:15.400
Her initial confusion was
followed by the realization

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:19.780
that she'd been loaded
up onto a shelf.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:23.570
This was the reason for the
very low ceiling above her head.

01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:26.970
The way out was to drop down
to the next level, though,

01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:31.920
how steep the fall would be and
what she'd land on was unknown.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.320
Sometimes people kept guard
dogs in the storerooms.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.110
There were even rumors of
certain merchants keeping snakes,

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:43.170
which would dissuade
both thieves and rats.

01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:45.800
She whistled to see if
a dog might move below,

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.800
but there was no sound in response.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.680
Perveen slowly fit herself

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.000
through the opening feeling
her way down with her feet.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.760
But then her tired arms
couldn't hold her anymore.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.700
She slipped straight down
landing in a sitting position

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.980
on another group of sacks.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.690 position:56%
She sat there for a while making
sure no bones were broken, although,

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:08.080
when she gathered the
strength to stand,

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.690
she had a searing pain in her hip.

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.610
Resolutely, she bumped her way
around the room to the area

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:16.950
where she saw some
thin streaks of light.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.120
A ventilated wooden
door, she decided,

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.620 position:56%
after exploring it with her fingers.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:24.390
Unfortunately, it was locked.

01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:26.470
Pressing her eyes to the
narrow bits of light,

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:29.520
she realized the door was
near an area with people.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.370
She heard the rumble of
men's voices and, again,

01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:34.810
the blowing of a ship's horn.

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:38.050
She must be at the
harbor very close by.

01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:39.350
She could hear voices.

01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:42.680
That also meant someone
might hear her.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.980
"Help me!"

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.090
she called in English
and then in Marathi.

01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:49.950
She shouted again and
again, but nobody heard.

01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:54.180
Perhaps it was still too early
or the storeroom too distant.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:57.190
Starting around seven,
the dock became lively,

01:23:57.190 --> 01:24:01.020
but then there might be too much
noise for a tiny cry to be heard.

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:03.840
She had to draw attention
to the door in hopes

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:07.410
that the earliest workers,
the tea makers, the sweepers,

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:09.950
and the stock loaders might hear.

01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:12.390
Perveen put her hand in her purse.

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:14.330
She could write a note
and push it through one

01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:17.240
of the ventilation holes,
but the laborers reporting

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.340
to work were all illiterate.

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:23.130
Then she felt the cool glass
of the vile of rose attar.

01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:27.370
If she spilled it, she'd
create an overpowering aroma.

01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:30.330
An expensive feminine
scent that was unusual

01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:33.720
for the dock might draw men
to the storeroom's door.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.470
If she could push the
ana and pisa corns

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:40.840
through the ventilation holes
they might catch someone's eye.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.570 position:56%
Perveen opened the vile and spilled
it along the open edges of the door.

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:48.450
Then, she pushed an ana
through hearing it clink

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:51.520
as it hit cobblestones outside.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.820
"Take the money!"

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:56.050
she bellowed feeling like
a huckster at the circus.

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.550
"Money! Money!

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:01.510
Money!" Thanks.

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:14.120
[ Applause ]

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.420
&gt;&gt; E.A. Aymar: All right.

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.720
Thanks, Sujata.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.020
And thanks again to
everyone for coming out.

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:22.530
I was purposefully not making eye
contact with our very helpful timer

01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:24.250
because I know we're
a couple minutes over.

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:25.970
So thank you so much.

01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:27.270
Thanks to the Library of Congress,

01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:29.070
Colleen Shogan, again,
and Nick Brown.

01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:32.680
If you enjoyed this event, but you
really want to hear more swearing,

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.760
our next Noir at the
Bar returns October 7th,

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.060
the Wonderland Ballroom.

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.050
Hope to see you there
and thanks again.

01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:43.930
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
