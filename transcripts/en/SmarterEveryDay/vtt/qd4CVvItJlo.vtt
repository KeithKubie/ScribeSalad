00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.110
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in the olympics the most athletic team

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.130
always wins right? No. It's actually more complicated than that because

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.130
there's physical objects in the olympics. Now the team that is able to manipulate

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.220
these physical objects better than the other team usually wins.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.240
For example, curling. This curling stone is very heavy, and if you can figure out how to

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.330
manipulate it across the ice better than the other team you will win.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.350
So physics is a huge deal and a knowledge of physics is very important.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.400
So today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna start a three part series on equipment used

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.470
in the olympics and how it interacts with the world around it. Today we're gonna focus

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.510
on ice skates. There are three major types of ice skates used in the olympics.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
The figure skate, the hockey skate and the speed skate.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.590
This is my new friend Glenn. He's a figure skating coach.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.480
It's really awesome. [laugh] So everyone already knows that angular momentum trick right?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.690
So large moment of intertia, bringing it in.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.710
Small moment of intertia. That's pretty awesome. So show me your skates.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.730
What makes you be able to do that? Cause I mean, I would mess up

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.760
because of the toe pick, so where are you actually rotating?
(Glenn) I'm actually spinning backwards.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.790
My blade is spinning backwards, and I'm spinning on a small area

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.830
we call the ball of the foot. Also my bottom toe pick is touching

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.870
the ice. So it's allowing me to put forward pressure down

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.920
without sliding forward like I would on a hockey skate.
(Destin) So that's how you're able to keep from

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.940
falling backwards?
- Right.
- Yeah I'm not really getting it. He's saying he's rotating about this point

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.950
but he's dragging that toe pick. Clearly this is a good excuse to break out the Phantom.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.360
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.010
Alright.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.020
OK now this is making sense. You see I used to think that they pivoted on

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.060
one spot under the ball of the foot. Looks like I was wrong. They're actually

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.090
skating backwards and he's dragging that toe pick to maintain his balance.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.110
That's pretty cool. Alright, it's time to move onto jumps. OK Glenn's gonna show

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.160
us three of the main jumps in figure skating. Here's the waltz jump,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.220
the salchow,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.240
and the flip. There's a gouge where you left the ice,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.270
- I pushed off my toe pick.
- Pushed off the toe pick, and then there's another gouge..
- And I landed

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.300
on my toe pick. But then I go down to my blade.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.320
So I'm pushing off the ice,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.350
and I'm landing on the ice, with my toe hitting first

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.390
and then my blade.
- OK Glenn's gonna do a jump and he's gonna land

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.420
with his toe pick, which is how they always land. It adds stability.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.470
It's in the landing of these jumps where the design

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.530
of the figure skates really start to show. You can spike yourself down into the ice

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.580
with the toe pick and then you slowly rock the blade down. In fact the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.590
curvature of the bottom of the blade is called the rocker. After it's planted firmly on the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.640
ground you'll notice it doesn't immediately move away. The skater imparts

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.710
the momentum from his opposite leg back into his lower foot and then he moves.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.730
So it's a three step process. Spike, plant,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.800
move. Interesting. But a question I have is that, if the bottom

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.820
is rounded, how do you sharpen a round blade? So this seems like a good

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.870
opportunity to move from the figure skate to the hockey skate. So let's meet my friend Nick

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.890
who's the director of hockey operations at UAH. [hockey sticks fall over] So you want to show me..

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.950
I'm sorry.
- Second time.
- [laughs] Sorry dude, show me the blade,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.970
how's this work.
- So the blades here, if you look, it's two

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.990
separate edges so I'll draw it up here for you.
- OK.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.030
- Blade actually..
- So this is a cross-section.
- Looks like that.
- No way!

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.060
- A lot of people think it looks like that but it's actually, there's a hollow in here.
- Really.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.100
- Yep.
- Can we see the sharpener? I like the name [wrestling announcer style] Blademaster!

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.130
- This is the wheel, which actually sharpens the skate.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.150
- How do you hold the blade up there? Is this a sled or something?
- Jig, slider, everybody's got their own little nickname for it.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.240
- OK and so then if the wheel were turning, you would bring that in there

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.260
let me focus. OK I can see that curvature that you're talking about, can you go closer

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.280
if you would to the wheel?
- So that's the radius of the skate,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.310
3/8ths, half, 5/8ths.
- I'm not sure I understand. You're saying

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.360
this hollow right here..
- Yeah some of them will look like that,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.390
some of them will look like that, some of them will look like that.
- This is completely eye opening to me.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.420
I had no idea that ice skates had two different working edges.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.450
So why would a player prefer a deeper hollow vs a shallower one?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.510
Well think about it. If you have a shallow hollow you're able to sit on top of the ice and glide

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.550
very easily so this is very good for speed. But if you have a deep hollow,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.570
your points are gonna cut down into the ice and plow so you'll go a lot slower however

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.590
you'll get much better grip. And if there's one thing a hockey player needs it's good grip.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.600
Have you ever seen them stop and change directions?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.980
 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.680
So I've asked a couple of hockey players to show me how this double edge is used to stop on ice.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.730
 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.800
Behold, the awesomeness of physics! [laugh]

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.850
Isn't that crazy? Look at what he's doing. He's controlling that edge

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.860
and scratching the top layer of ice off, but he's doing it in such a way that it's converting

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.920
that shear energy into power which he's using to decelerate.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.930
Some people want to believe that hockey players are just dumb brutes but I'm not buying it.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.940
I told this player I wanted him to stop on a very specific spot on the ice.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.960
so I could zoom in with the phantom and catch the ice spray, and he did it on the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.980
very first try. Can you imagine the math that's going on in his brain in order to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.030
automate this feedback loop? He's constantly sensing his deceleration

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.080
and somehow his brain's converting that information to signals to control

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.100
the angle of his skates and feather the exact amount of ice that he's shearing off.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.140
To complicate matters, he's got ice in between him and his target and he has to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.260
anticipate the total amount of impulse left in that ice so he can

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.310
stop exactly where he wants to. Let's ask him to see if he can explain exactly what he's doing

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.350
because I'm pretty sure hockey players are physics geniuses. You don't gotta take your glove off man

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.380
Ben, thank you very much. Do you have any, like if you had to say

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.410
anything about that hockey stop, how exactly do you do it?

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.440
- Well you're just trying to find a balance, because you have two, there's two edges

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.510
on the skate blade, so you wanna find that inside edge,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.550
you know if you get over the top of your outside edge you go over.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.570
(Destin) So you're trying to find that edge on the ice and just shave a fine mist.
- Just the inside one.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.590
- So like a noob, somebody that's just learning how to do that, would they just chatter across the ice?

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.610
- Yeah. When I started playing I was like three years old so,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.650
maybe by the time I was like six I could stop.
- Yeah.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.670
- So a couple of years, but like..
- Did you just hit that puck without looking?

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.730
- Yeah.
- He just hit a puck and you hit it without looking.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.750
- I mean I saw it.
- Yep I'm right, they're geniuses.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.760
So if we want grip for a hockey blade we don't want it for a speed skate right?

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.770
Which might explain why speed skaters are always falling. This was

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.820
counterintuitive to me, but the bottom of a speed skate isn't pointy. It's actually a flat

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.850
sharp 90 degree angle. To see speed skaters in action let's

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.900
go to the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee and check out the US junior long

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.910
track championships. OK look at how the skater starts off the line. You see that

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.920
open stance? They do this because ice skate friction is asymmetrical.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.980
They glide easily going forward but they dig in on the sides.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.040
So to propel themselves skaters have to push off the sides of the blade.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.090
The larger this angle alpha is, the harder they can push. That's why they line up with their

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.120
foot at almost a 90 degree angle to the direction of skating. Speed skates are

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.140
flat which means each individual stride has to be perfectly level when the foot hits

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.170
the ice. This can be a problem because when you extend your ankle the blade tries

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.190
to come up off the ice. The solution to this is called a clap skate.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.230
Clap skates allow a long track skater to keep their blade on the ice

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.290
longer into the stride. I'll let Adam explain.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.310
- The clap starts to come out, like this, and once they pick their skate up it just kinda

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.340
just flies back like that. And so that extra push

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.640
that makes the clap, gives you a lot more contact on the ice.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.660
And so you can get a lot more power.
- All this talk about ice skating

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.690
and we didn't even explain why it's slippery in the first place. So there's this thing called friction melting.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.710
If you're moving something along ice it creates this really thin layer

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.740
of water, think like nanometers thick. That is why you can

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.760
slip on ice so easily. The coefficient of friction can be defined by this equation.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.840
It's very interesting. OK a couple more things you might be interested in. Number one,

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.890
we've been making infographics of all these winter sports. You can go download those and share them with whoever

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.930
you like. Also I'd like to thank the sponsor that lets me do crazy things

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.940
like try to explain sports I don't really understand. So that's audible.com. You can support

videos on winter olympic sports, the next couple of videos, I'm gonna try to get them out

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.180
pretty quick, are things like curling, and other stuff like that. It's pretty cool. Anyway,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.270
subscription consider that please. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.320
thanks for listening to me I appreciate that. Have a good one. Why are you putting

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.350
your hands out all the time? Why do I always see figure skaters do that?
- Because my coach

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.380
told me to, over and over. It helps with my balance.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.390
Using my arms

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.400
to rotate, turn myself.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.450
And to be a little more dramatic.
(Destin) [laughs] You gotta have a little finesse

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.520
to it right? That's awesome.
