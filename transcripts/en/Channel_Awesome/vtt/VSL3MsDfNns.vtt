00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.560
So I'm not going to lie.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.700
The idea of there being a Bambi 2

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
I surprisingly found... interesting

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.960
The reason?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.580
I really liked the first one.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.820
I think it's a unique, important, even groundbreaking film.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.560
It's a movie that lets the art tell a lot of the story.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.640
It doesn't have to over explain. It doesn't have to create a bad guy. It's just a little slice of life.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.960
The sequel had an interesting premise,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.740
at least from my point of view.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.880
It takes place literally after Bambi loses his mother.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.780
Yeah, spoiler alert.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.360
I think most of you know that, though.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.180
Bambi's father requests that somebody else looks after him

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.820
because he's gonna be too busy,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.040
but the owl suggests that maybe he should raise him.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.960
Thus, the rest of the film is just watching Bambi grow up

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500
with his father, who has never been a parent before.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.780
Again, no complicated stories,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.940
no bad guys, just a little chunk of this one life.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.980
In some respects, it's exactly what I was looking for.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.980
It's kinda what I thought I would get,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.060
kinda what I was expecting, and it's well done.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.760
On the other hand, though, it IS a sequel being made years later

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.100
to something that was REALLY unique

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.420
and always just kinda did its own thing.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960
So, the idea of trying to recreate it years later

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.580
DOES feel a little...

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.640
off.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.180
It's not something you can necessarily blame the film for;

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.040
it's just kind of what's inevitably gonna happen.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.740
The artistry is REALLY good.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.200
This movie does everything in its power to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.980
recreate the the look of the original "Bambi",

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.060
and the feel,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.180
and the pacing.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.200
And, for the most part, it does a really good job.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
When it has to look like calming winter, it looks like calming winter.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200
When those extreme colors have to come in

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.680
with the heavy shadows that are somehow red and blue and so forth,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.080
they bring that back too, and it's really effective.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.460
The backgrounds are never too crisp, either.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
They're just a little blurred,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.900
again, just like the original film,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.400
but, seeing how they're using artists and technology YEARS later,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520
you can tell it doesn't quite feel...

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520
I don't wanna say "authentic", but

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.420
a continuation, necessarily.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.700
You're always aware they're trying to capture

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.280
the magic and the originality of the first one,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280
and that never, ever leaves.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
It's kinda like the sequel to "2001".

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
It's not a terrible movie, but the first one

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.520
was just so incredible and just so amazing

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.280
that you kinda know you're never gonna recapture it.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.700
And that lingers over the entirety of the film.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.700
But, on top of that, there are some other problems, too.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
One is: there are songs of the time period thrown in,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and they are kind of distracting, which,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.240
again, not to act like all the songs in the original "Bambi" were timeless, but

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.560
these really do kinda take you out of the environment.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280
Not "Tarzan" bad, or "Return to Neverland" bad,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.640
but still noticeable.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.700
The biggest problem, or maybe I should say "pet peeve",

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.540
is the father himself, played by Patrick Stewart.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.820
Now Patrick Stewart is a perfect choice.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
He sounds just like the original actor,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820
he seems strong and firm, and,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.460
yeah, this is a really good actor.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.740
But I guess the way I always imagined the father

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.480
was stern, and strict, and didn't really laugh that much,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.480
and didn't really show much vulnerability.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.040
He was the leader of the forest.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.060
He couldn't show weakness.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.920
He had to be tough all the time.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.260
So, I figured that would translate over into him being a parent.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.940
And, while that's what they're clearly trying to do,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.840
he does show a little too much vulnerability.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840
He plays it more like the confused parent,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.160
the fish out of water,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.660
not "yuck-yuck" or anything like that, but,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.880
clearly, he doesn't know what he's doing,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.380
and, of course, eventually,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.500
he lets his guard down,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.880
and he goes play with Bambi, and has fun,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.060
and then he realizes, "Oh, he was supposed to be stern and strict,"

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.080
and, yeah, it's just kinds that thing.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.020
It's not awful; it's just not how I imagined that character.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.360
There was so much more mystery and strength to him

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.600
when he only said one or two things.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.700
When he first sees Bambi in the first one,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.200
he just stares down at him and doesn't say a thing.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.000
That is so intimidating!

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.400
I thought that was the father I was going to get.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.100
But, instead, we get lines like,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.040
"A prince doesn't 'woo hoo'."

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.300
- {Woo hoo!}
- {Bambi!}

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.140
{A prince does not... "woo hoo".}

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.380
"A prince walks tall! A prince doesn't show weakness!"

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.240
It's stuff you imagine the mother from "Brave" saying.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.700
In my opinion, it would have worked a lot better

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.820
if they show Bambi as a child with his father,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.960
and the father is strict, and stern,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.520
and doesn't show much humanity,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.120
and then you cut to years later when he's older,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.420
THEN he confronts the father about why

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.600
he was so stern and strict, and the effect it had on him.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.360
That seems like a time when Bambi would talk about it,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.740
but, when he cracks at his father because he thinks

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.820
he's being too mean, and he's trying so hard

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.100
to be everything he wants,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.640
it just kinda feels formulaic.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.040
And, of course, the father feels hurt

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.620
but can't show the emotion,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.820
but the he has to see something that Bambi

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.580
does that proves his worth, and -- you know it.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.400
But, again, it's not done... bad.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.280
It is still just sort of watching Bambi's life,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.460
and it's done very similar to how the first film is.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.100
A lot of playful moments, a lot of nice artistry,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.160
a lot of dark moments, but a lot of nice stuff, too.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.620
Any problems I have are kinda nitpick-y.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.600
For, example there's this one deer that's

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.480
kind of a bully, but he's not the villain or anything,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.720
he's just kind of a jerky, fragile kid,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.860
and I think they're building up that this is the bully

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.860
that then confronts him years in the future.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.500
He even says at the end, "One day, we'll meet up again,"

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.420
and I'm thinking, "You didn't need to make

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.240
that connection." I like that this was just a jerky deer.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.480
It's the forest, it's nature, predators. You just kinda get it.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.980
There's also a particularly messed up scene where

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.060
one of the hunters in  the distance uses a deer call,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.980
and it sounds like his mother,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.840
{Mother?}

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.460
(ghostly voice)
{Hellooo... Hellooo...}

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.200
{I'm heeere...}

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.040
I didn't know whether I really liked this

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.860
or found it really silly, but it is kinda disturbing

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.240
and uncomfortable, but in a good way.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.760
So, overall, it is good.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.500
It just can't be the first one like I feel it's trying to be.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.040
But I really give credit to the directors, and artists,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.180
and writer for trying to be the first one.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.280
They didn't have to. They could have just

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.440
thrown some direct-to-DVD light animation,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.800
"Oh, Bambi and Thumper get in trouble,"

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.940
and all sorts of bull crap like that, but...

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.400
they do put in the good pacing,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.000
they do put in the character, they do put in the artistry,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.240
they do put in the suspenseful moments.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.900
In some respects, I didn't want to know

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.180
what happened to Bambi in between those years.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.300
It's kinda like finding out what happened to Batman

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.420
after his parents died. You kinda like it being a mystery.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.640
But we got "Batman Begins" that showed

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.500
everything that happened, and, if it's done well,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.240
it's done well.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.980
This is kinda the same thing.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.600
If they are gonna show what happens,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.180
this is not a bad version of it.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.060
I say, if you like the first film and are a little curious

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.640
to see if this is a good follow-up,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.840
you'll get an actually okay flick.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.620
You can tell a LOT of effort went into

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.940
trying to capture the voice of the first one,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.680
and it doesn't go unappreciated.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.860
If you like the first movie and are even the

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.400
littlest bit curious about how this one is,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.400
I think you might actually like it okay.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.760
Step out into the meadow and take a look.
