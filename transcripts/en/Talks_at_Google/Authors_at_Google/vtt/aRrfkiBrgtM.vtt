MAX SALTONSTALL: My
name's Max Saltonstall,

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:04.290
and I'm happy to be here
with the Serial Box writers.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.456
I want you to introduce
yourselves, but also tell me

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:08.039
what are you writing right now.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.580
MAX GLADSTONE: Hi,
I'm Max Gladstone.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.986
I write fantastical
legal thrillers mostly.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400
The most recent book
was "Last First Snow,"

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.030
and I am also the lead
writer for the "Bookburners"

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.970
serial for Serial Box, which
I am very excited about.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.330
And I also write on
Lindsey's serial,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.424
so I will now pass
it along to Lindsey.

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.090
LINDSAY SMITH: My
name is Lindsay Smith,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.260
and I'm the author of several
different YA espionage

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.520
flavored books-- "Secret and
Scandal," which are historical

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.770
thrillers, and then
"Dreamstrider," which

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.440
is a high fantasy thriller,
also, but for Serial Box,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.025
my project is called "The Witch
who Came in From the Cold,"

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.400
or as we're shortening
it to "Cold Witch," just

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.860
for hashtag purposes, I think.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.380
And that is an exciting
spy thriller also set

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.750
1970s Prague,
where there's magic

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.850
and espionage in equal measure.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270
ELLEN KUSHNER: I'm Ellen
Kushner, and probably

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.280
best known for my novel, "Swords
Point" and the three-- two

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.330
books that came after it.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.800
I'm writing a third right
now, and my big thing

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.080
when I wrote "Swords Point"
was that I wasn't ever

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.360
allowed to repeat myself.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.996
I couldn't just
write endless sequels

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:16.370
with the same
characters in them.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.730
So every time I
attack that world--

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.580
and I use the term
advisedly-- I try

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.830
to take a different viewpoint
or a different style.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.800
I've also written
interconnecting short stories.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.340
So "Tremontaine" has been a
really interesting and fun

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.540
departure for me.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.300
When you ask what am
I writing right now,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.880
I should be writing the
fourth "Riverside" novel,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.310
but I'm actually writing
the final episode

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.350
to "Tremontaine,"
which takes place

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.800
15 years before "Swordspoint."

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.980
MAX SALTONSTALL: Awesome.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.950
So this is a different
way of publishing.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.800
What's it like writing in
this serial model for you?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.690
You've all written
traditional novels before.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.550
MAX GLADSTONE: For me it feels
a little bit like homecoming

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.770
actually, because
when I was a kid,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.760
I started off doing a lot of
internet forum role playing.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.950
So I was active on Usenet
role playing forums and things

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.639
like that, and the
first long form piece

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.180
that I ever wrote was this
enormous, sprawling kill all

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.880
of the characters that nobody
wants to play anymore epic that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.810
was like 300,000 words
long, and I wrote

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.750
over the course of a year when
I really should have been doing

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.160
a whole bunch of school, and got
to the end of it, and realized,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.470
oh, that was a lot of fun.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.550
I guess I could do this
maybe for money somehow.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.680
That would be nice,
but that was very much

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.600
writing chapters
when I had time,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.620
and then posting them,
and getting feedback

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050
on the chapters,
and then thinking

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.080
what I need to do next,
and then doing that.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.720
So coming to Serial
Box, where we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.180
have a sort of
episodic structure,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.846
where, for example,
in "Bookburners," we

00:02:44.846 --> 00:02:48.810
have sort of supernatural secret
agents working for the Vatican

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.110
running around the world
trying to track down magic

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.380
and then sticking it in a
box, and then never looking

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.463
in the box, because that
always works really well.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.600
So having a separate story about
them each week, and each story

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.870
needed to cohere and get
people really excited,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.410
and then leave them
satisfied, but also excited

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.780
for the next one felt
like-- I don't know.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.050
Oh, I've been here before.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.830
This is great.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.331
Let's go.

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:16.080
LINDSAY SMITH: Yeah,
I agree with what Max

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.050
is saying about posting online.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.525
I think for writers of
a certain age that's

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.620
how we grew our craft,
whether you wrote fan fiction

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.180
or serialized stories like this.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.917
Well, I wrote 1000
words today, so I'm

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.250
going to put it on the internet.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.410
See what everybody thinks of it.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.700
So you learn how to
build those hooks

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.940
and so on to lead into the
next episode, the next chapter,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.190
whatever the case may be.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.310
And that has been
for me the most fun

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.100
part of doing the
serialized storytelling--

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.950
is we have to plan
it out in advance.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.180
Figure out where all the
different little twists

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.050
and turns are going to go.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.180
This is definitely
the project that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.880
made me swear off of
just drafting wildly

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.000
out into the void, because
it's so much more fun

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.706
to have the roadmap and
know what's coming up next.

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:03.830
And we're getting really
excited for all the twists

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.620
and turns that we're
about to execute

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.454
on poor, unassuming readers.

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:09.370
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh, that's
the really fun part.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.078
I want to talk about
that later, but just

00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:14.589
to answer your question,
it's like summer camp.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:16.130
You're hanging out
with your friends,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.838
because the really
important thing for me

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.980
is not so much the
serial aspect as the fact

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.230
that it's being written by
a bunch of different people

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.830
with their strengths,
and their annoying bits,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.560
and their cleverness,
and willingness

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.070
to work really hard,
but really it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.340
almost like you've all
gotten together and gone,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.970
let's put on the show.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.150
And that aspect of
collaboration is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
one of the real reasons
I wanted to do this,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.375
because if you're with the right
people, it's just a lot of fun.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.500
MAX SALTONSTALL: So how do
go about planning these?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.740
Because it's not the one
thing you're going to write.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.820
It's you're writing it
over many, many steps.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.850
Do you have a consistent
process that you've

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.349
used across the team?

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.140
ELLEN KUSHNER: Across
each individual team?

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.556
Because what we've found is
that each team is a little bit

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:01.050
different, partly because
of what it is we're writing,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.240
and partly because
personalities may vary.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.742
And also we try to all go
like, oh, well Max has already

00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:08.700
done "Bookburners," and
I know how they did it,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.950
so we'll do it that way,
and found quite a few bumps

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.490
in the road that way that
we've had to-- thank you.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.780
I thought it was just us.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.774
MAX GLADSTONE: I do.

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:17.660
That was your first mistake.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.880
ELLEN KUSHNER: But
it works for you.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.630
And have you been told,
oh, don't do that.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.671
"Tremontaine" tried that.

00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:23.530
It was a disaster.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.430
Why don't you it
like "Tremontaine?"

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.630
Here's what they do.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.290
What's your experience been?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.220
LINDSAY SMITH: Well
for me, for "The Witch

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.160
Who Came in From the Cold,"
we brought everyone together

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.430
for what we called
a story summit.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.307
So it's myself, Max, and then
two other writers, Cassie

00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:40.470
Claire-- Cassandra Clarke.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.969
I'm sorry.

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.080
Cassie Clarke.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.780
Wrong name.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.080
And Ian Tregillis, who are
also really outstanding

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.130
fantasy writers, and we
just kind of tossed out

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.990
ideas for different types of
episodes we wanted to have.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.820
People had really keyed
in on certain characters

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.460
in the series bible that we
had put together beforehand.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.180
There's this one
character-- I think

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.430
everybody's going to love her.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.715
She's really sinister,
and fun, and awesome.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:06.340
So everybody wanted to write an
episode from her point of view,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.427
so it was kind of like fighting
over who gets to do what, when.

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:10.760
ELLEN KUSHNER: We did that, too.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.000
LINDSAY SMITH: Have a
character to fight over?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.250
ELLEN KUSHNER: Same character.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.880
Yeah.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.060
No, the awesome
sinister one, yeah.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.410
LINDSAY SMITH: But then
we took all these ideas

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.960
and had them on
these note cards,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.080
and we just kind of
slowly shaped them

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.980
into an arc that would
work for an entire season.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.940
And just kind of using
basic story structure,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.932
figured out what peaks and
valleys we wanted that to take

00:06:32.932 --> 00:06:35.140
and where the different
points that we'd come up with

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.300
would fit along that
larger season long scale.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.115
And eventually it grew
into 13 discrete episodes

00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:42.997
that we divided up
amongst ourselves.

00:06:42.997 --> 00:06:44.580
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.379
So you had the whole
thing, and then you

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.420
chopped it into episodes?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.300
LINDSAY SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.716
ELLEN KUSHNER: Because we were
very like episode, episode,

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:51.330
episode.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.230
LINDSAY SMITH: Yeah,
well for the witch series

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.740
it's very much-- it's
a lot less episodic.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.940
It's more kind of like
an HBO drama or something

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.150
where the episodes kind
of flow into each other,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.300
even though there's a
finite point for each.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.508
ELLEN KUSHNER: You know what?

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:06.385
I'm totally lying.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:07.130
Totally lying.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.050
What we did was we
had this giant arc,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.020
but it was pretty nebulous, and
then we would sort of go, OK,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.370
in order to make
giant arc work, it's

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.580
going be this, this, and this.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.080
MAX GLADSTONE: So
for "Bookburners,"

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.210
when the time came to plan
out the actual season,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.530
there were a lot of empty
spaces still in the outline,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.730
because we knew overall
what story we wanted

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.600
to tell for the entire
season, but it's

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.930
a very episodic structure.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.040
Basically each week--

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.165
MAX SALTONSTALL: "X-Files."

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:35.610
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah,
"X-Files," exactly.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.651
Each week something weird
is going on in Denmark,

00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:39.940
and we need to go out
and investigate what,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.990
and it might not be in Denmark.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.727
Sometimes it is.

00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:45.310
ELLEN KUSHNER: But
it's always rotten.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.184
MAX GLADSTONE: But it's
always rotten, right.

00:07:47.184 --> 00:07:50.590
So because of that,
we needed a number

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.420
of episodes that just kind of
worked along that model, where

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.220
there was a monster of the
week, or there was something

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.090
that we needed to go do where we
were basically giving a holding

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.220
beat for character development,
if that makes any sense.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.680
So there were episodes
where it was really clear

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.320
that characters
needed to transition,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.820
and to grow, and develop, and
then there were episodes where

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.730
the current stressor
was on the team

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.500
as a whole trying to figure out
the solution to some problem,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.849
which then allowed us to
hold up the different facets

00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:21.140
of the team to the light and
see how they were handling

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.080
particular sorts of
stress and response.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.580
Because of that, we
have these 16 episodes,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.770
and there were some that
were very pivotal plot

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.680
episodes where we knew
exactly what we needed to do,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.500
and there were a lot
that were like, oh,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.618
and then we'll figure
out something later,

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:34.659
and it'll be really cool.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.380
And that worked pretty well.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.679
Well, it allowed actually for
a lot of generative experience

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.400
while we were running
through the serial.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.650
So during the first flight
of episodes, basically

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.880
each writer on the team--
myself, Margaret Dunlap,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.330
Mur Lafferty, and Brian
Francis Slattery--

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.146
all wrote one episode,
and then we had four.

00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:57.770
We were looking at
them, and then there

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.394
were some natural
outgrowths from there

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:01.530
that we could weave into
the overall series arc

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.645
that we were working on.

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:07.580
I think for all of
the teams that I've

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.510
been on there's been
this sort of moment

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.480
of trying to figure out
a creative vocabulary,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.646
or a common creative
vocabulary for putting together

00:09:14.646 --> 00:09:15.849
characters and story lines.

00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:17.390
For the "Bookburners"
team, it really

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.350
was tabletop role playing.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.515
Once we all-- we were
all coming in from very

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:24.140
different artistic philosophies,
very different writing styles,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.300
but once we figured out
that we'd all gamed before,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.270
we could be like,
OK, let's think

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.990
of these as fake characters, and
let's flop them up on the board

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.530
and get some aspects.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.650
Once we have that
together, then we

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.080
have enough of a story engine
that we can build it out

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.645
into a long term thing.

00:09:37.645 --> 00:09:39.020
LINDSAY SMITH:
That's interesting

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.311
that you say that you really
focused on the characters,

00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.810
and statting them
out, and so on,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.160
because I feel like for
"Witch" our main drive

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.950
was kind of getting
the aesthetic down

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.530
for what we wanted.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.905
We wanted the foggy,
cold Prague city streets.

00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:53.780
MAX SALTONSTALL: That
visual comes out really

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.250
quickly when you
start reading it.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.690
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh, great.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.840
The trench coats, and
the cigarette smoke,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.465
and everything.

00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:58.796
MAX SALTONSTALL: It feels cold.

00:09:58.796 --> 00:10:01.066
I want a coat when
I'm reading that book.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.440
LINDSAY SMITH: And we talked
a lot about our favorite spy

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.610
novels, and television
shows, and everything, too,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.109
to just kind of key
in on what those

00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:10.530
aesthetic-- those
feelings, and vibes,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.820
and tropes that we
wanted to twist and toy

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.327
with a little bit,
but of course,

00:10:14.327 --> 00:10:16.660
bringing in the magic element
as well with a lot of fun.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.201
ELLEN KUSHNER: And
with "Tremontaine"

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.990
we were in a really different
place, because the novels

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.100
already exist.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.360
So the first trick
was to find writers

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.750
who could write in
that world comfortably,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.530
and for that, I kind of
needed to know that they knew

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.640
and loved the books,
but then we also wanted

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.280
to expand and do
something that I didn't

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.240
do when I was 25 years old.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:50.300
So we got Alaya Dawn Johnson,
who not only likes my books,

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.940
but I think it's also
important-- loves

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.390
all the same books I do.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.340
So the influences are
going to the same.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.420
We're both riffing
on the same thing,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.040
and she's also been
studying in Mexico,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.480
so we brought in this
whole aspect of a culture

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.790
that I had never messed with
by having them be traders who

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.090
were importing stuff
into this extremely

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.390
cod, European-ish city.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.110
So that's been
exciting, and then

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.720
Malinda Lo, who's
primarily written in YA

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.830
and is really famous for
having done the first queer

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.300
Cinderella for YA.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.860
So we knew she was
going to fit in,

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.480
and then since there's a lot of
boy on boy action in my books,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.050
we said, why don't we
get an actual gay man?

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.860
So we got Joel Derfner, who
is a famous for gay haiku

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.490
and for "Swish."

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.860
And he's done mostly
memoir, but I've

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.126
been working with him
on a mystery novel,

00:11:41.126 --> 00:11:42.500
so I know he can
write the living

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.070
hell out of period stuff, and
he also just makes us all laugh.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.109
We can get pretty heated,
and Joel will always

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:52.400
break the tension by saying
something either incredibly

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.590
wise or incredibly silly.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.359
And then our show-runner
and her partner wanted in,

00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.400
and they had a great
episode, which actually just

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.400
came out this morning.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.770
And we also brought in a
guest writer, Paul Witcover,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.350
who is not only a
really good writer,

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.770
but is the only reviewer who
ever truly understood me.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.010
So I fought hard for Paul.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.490
So this is our little gang.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.406
I actually did a piece
about this for tor.com,

00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:19.540
because it's kind of
like "Seven Samurai."

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.020
Put together your
people, each of whom

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.534
has a different strength,
and it's just crazy.

00:12:25.534 --> 00:12:26.950
You see them all
in a room and go,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.533
well, this is going
to be interesting,

00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:31.470
and it's just been splendid.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.300
I know I'm talking a lot about
backgrounds and personalities,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.430
but for us-- and
also had to play

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.280
well with others,
because this was really

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.584
such a weird collaboration with
me in this odd power position,

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:45.000
but I realize that,
since I'm only

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.420
writing the pilot
and the series end,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.230
it was really going to be
their world and their stuff.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.920
So I had to go, what?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.420
No.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.820
You can't rent a carriage.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.110
Useful things like that,
but let them really

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.500
engage with and create
the new characters

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.259
and make them their own.

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:05.800
MAX SALTONSTALL: So you're all
giving up a lot more narrative

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.740
control than in your
previous setting.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.000
What's that like through
both managing the team,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.054
but then trying to let go
more than you're used to?

00:13:15.054 --> 00:13:16.470
LINDSAY SMITH: I
actually love it,

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.970
because I feel like having the
four people just completely

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.960
amplifies the creative
power on the team,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.090
and I love seeing people
come up with ideas I never

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.080
would have thought of no
matter how much time I

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.290
had to work on it.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.940
And it's just
fascinating, because I

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.067
would be thinking of just these
silly fixes to plot problems,

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:36.400
and someone would come out
completely out of left field,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.430
and, oh, it's so much better.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.180
I love that so
much, but then being

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.140
able to have that
voice of series control

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.430
where I just say, all
right, this doesn't quite

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.430
fit this characterization,
or I don't think this

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.360
would actually happen.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.740
The CA would not stand for
this-- something like that

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.010
in the plot and so on.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.970
It's good to have someone
who can direct the ship,

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.910
but just letting everyone
run wild with the creativity

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.780
is so cool.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.407
I really love seeing
that come together.

00:14:04.407 --> 00:14:06.740
MAX GLADSTONE: There's an
aspect of crowd surfing to it.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.660
Everybody's crowd surfing
on everybody else,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.710
and then we get into a
weird topological state.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.180
MAX SALTONSTALL:
It's like everyone

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.595
is sitting on each other's
knees [INAUDIBLE] falls over.

00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:15.740
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, somehow.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.944
And it's a lot of fun.

00:14:17.944 --> 00:14:19.360
The hardest part
for me, actually,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.880
wasn't the world building
or the creative aspects.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.310
I really enjoy running with
stuff that other people do.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.000
Yeah, that looks a little weird.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.650
Let's push it more and see
what happens, but was honestly

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.930
it's voice and language related.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.290
I spend a lot of time polishing
the work that I put out,

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.520
just the books that I
publish, and draft, and draft,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.470
and draft, and draft to the
point of real obsession.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.260
And realizing when I was going
into other people's episodes

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.494
that, OK, this is
somebody who's not me,

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:53.660
they have their own style,
they have their own work,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.785
they have their own rhythm.

00:14:54.785 --> 00:14:59.120
You need to figure out how to
respect that and then also make

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.850
sure that all the
series is speaking

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.510
with almost the same voice.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.960
MAX SALTONSTALL: But they're
writing the same characters.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.320
MAX GLADSTONE: They're writing
the same characters, yeah.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.694
MAX SALTONSTALL: And you don't
want those to sound weird.

00:15:07.694 --> 00:15:10.490
MAX GLADSTONE: Well, I don't
want them to sound weird,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.360
but the characters
are actually--

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.972
I don't want to say easy, but
once you build these people,

00:15:16.972 --> 00:15:18.680
they're sort of live
in everyone's heads.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.330
And it's interesting to see
different people's takes

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.670
on them, but I think for all of
us who sat in the story summit

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.469
and were really getting into the
architecture of each character,

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.260
we understand them well
enough [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.270
ELLEN KUSHNER: Have you also
gotten these weird moments

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.900
of synchronicity
where you realize

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.944
that people are writing--
they're all writing

00:15:36.944 --> 00:15:38.735
at the same time things
about the character

00:15:38.735 --> 00:15:40.100
that they couldn't
have talked about,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.060
but that are nonetheless true.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.490
LINDSAY SMITH: Yes.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.260
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.343
ELLEN KUSHNER: It happens.

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.767
There's a whole thread of
sympathy with a character who

00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:47.600
is supposed to be kind
of bad, but everybody

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.340
got that moment of pain
for-- I'll say-- them,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.510
and made it run
beautifully, and they

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.930
couldn't have worked it out.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.960
They just knew.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.610
When you're talking about
lots of different people

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.475
writing the same voice, we
had that little experiment

00:16:03.475 --> 00:16:04.260
in audio.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.750
I know you, Max, have the
amazing woman of a 1000

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.764
voices, Xe Sands, reading
everything and everybody,

00:16:09.764 --> 00:16:11.180
but we thought,
oh, let's push out

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.290
the boat a little
on "Tremontaine,"

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.590
and there have been audio books
of the other books already.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.890
Let's get some of the same
actors who worked on them.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.470
So we took three major
viewpoint characters,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.763
and we have three fantastic
audio book readers.

00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:23.263
And I thought, oh,
that'll be great.

00:16:23.263 --> 00:16:25.920
And I kind naively
didn't realize

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.497
that they were all going to
have to sound like each other.

00:16:28.497 --> 00:16:30.080
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.000
ELLEN KUSHNER:
It's a lot of work,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.541
considering we also have someone
with a foreign accent, which

00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:34.130
we invented.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.440
So they all had to memorize the
same made up, foreign accent.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.475
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh, wow.

00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:40.600
ELLEN KUSHNER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.550
MAX SALTONSTALL: You like
to do things the easy way.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.383
ELLEN KUSHNER: Yeah.

00:16:42.383 --> 00:16:44.414
No, I just-- but this is
the way I kind of live

00:16:44.414 --> 00:16:46.580
my entire creative life,
which is, oh, it'll be fun.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.349
It'll be easy, and
then fortunately

00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:51.390
work with good people who
can then deal with when

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.900
it turns out not to be easy.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.442
So that's been an
amazing experience.

00:16:54.442 --> 00:16:56.816
MAX SALTONSTALL: I think that's
the first audio book I've

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:59.060
listened to, because I'm
listening to your series,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.060
and those different
voices actually really

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.360
effectively bring me to
different parts of the world.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.568
And I haven't gotten, I
think, to the confluence yet,

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:07.625
and I'm curious to see
now how that resolves.

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.500
I want to hear more
about this writer summit.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.288
You keep alluding to it.

00:17:11.288 --> 00:17:13.079
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh gosh,
it was really cool.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.222
Just being able to--

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:16.430
MAX SALTONSTALL: What was it?

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.869
LINDSAY SMITH: It was
we all came together

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.980
at Julian's apartment
for an extended weekend

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.020
to just brainstorm season one
for "The Witch Who Came in

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.169
From the Cold" and just
figure out what on earth

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:28.960
are we going to do.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.499
We all have the series bible
in front of us that's got--

00:17:31.499 --> 00:17:33.540
MAX SALTONSTALL: You had
written that in advance?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.414
LINDSAY SMITH: I had
written the series bible

00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:37.630
that outlined all
the major characters

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.351
and how they related both
to the world around them

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.100
and to each other.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.180
MAX SALTONSTALL: With
the Venn diagram?

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.888
LINDSAY SMITH: Yes,
we've got-- so here's

00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:47.869
the really confusing part-- is
we've got KGB and CIA spies all

00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:49.410
hanging out in
Prague, but then there

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.350
are also two factions
of magic users,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:56.080
as well-- the Consortium of Ice
and then the Acolytes of Flame.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.050
And so there might
be a CIA person

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.880
who's Flame, a CIA person
who's Ice, KGB who's

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.582
Flame, KGB who's Ice.

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.790
So there's a whole lot of
different alliances at play

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.800
here.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.270
So that made it
nice and confusing

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.524
to start right off the bat, but
it's really worked out nicely,

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:12.940
but the series
bible laid all that

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.856
out-- all the information
about the characters

00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:17.090
and what these different
organizations represent.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.030
And then also because it
was a historical series,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.250
I did a lot of work on just
like outlining the time period,

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.830
and I had experience with
that from my historical novels

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.560
that I'd written set
in the '60s, as well.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.430
So focusing on
what sort of songs

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.015
might they hear on the radio,
or what hot gossip might they

00:18:34.015 --> 00:18:35.890
be talking about their
favorite movie actors,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.230
whatever the case may be, just
to give that nice background

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.937
touch.

00:18:39.937 --> 00:18:42.020
So we had all that before
us, but we didn't really

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.330
have an overarching
plot, and so it was just

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.650
these four writers in a
room tossing out these ideas

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.300
and shaping it into
something story-like.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.632
And once we had it
all hammered out,

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.590
I really don't think we
deviated from it hardly

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.950
at all in terms of here
are the major notes we need

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.340
to hit within each episode,
and it's really great

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.810
to have that structure.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.020
I come from a place
where I used to draft

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.500
without any clear outline.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.916
I just knew a couple things I
wanted to happened somewhere

00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:09.390
down the road in the story.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.750
I'm a convert now to
planning in advance,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.120
and it's also really
helped us deconflict

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.427
when we have the questions
of, now wait a minute,

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:18.635
would this character do this?

00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:20.301
Is this going to line
up well for what's

00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:22.800
going to happen three
episodes down the road?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.820
And so it allows us to
avoid the big, big conflicts

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.650
that we could have there.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.734
I love having that roadmap,
though, for the story.

00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:31.150
MAX GLADSTONE: I'm
so glad to hear

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.920
you say that, because working on
both "Witch" and "Bookburners,"

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.821
at this point, I'm now a note
card and permanent marker

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:37.320
addict.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.450
LINDSAY SMITH: Yes.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.330
MAX GLADSTONE: There's so
much fun and freedom that

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.520
happens when I kind of
know where I'm going,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.130
and then I get to
decide how I want

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.780
to attack a particular
scene knowing

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.610
what's already going happen.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.654
It's fun.

00:19:51.654 --> 00:19:53.820
LINDSAY SMITH: In a way,
it's almost more creatively

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.030
freeing to have this
structure in place

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.590
that I don't have to think
about while I'm writing.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.150
To already have that brain work
done so that my brain can just

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.870
focus on the language,
and the tension,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.800
and so on, I actually
think it helps.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.400
It makes for more creative
writing, rather than

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.992
constrictive.

00:20:08.992 --> 00:20:11.200
ELLEN KUSHNER: I've never
written so fast in my life.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.690
It's so fun, but just to
make it clear we all start

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.759
with the three day total thing.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.050
MAX SALTONSTALL: Bring the
whole writing team together.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.758
ELLEN KUSHNER: Yeah,
we all get together.

00:20:21.758 --> 00:20:23.580
In my case, it's
been my living room.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.280
And also food-- critical.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.700
We just basically eat
nonstop the whole time,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.560
because you cannot think without
infusions of blood sugar,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.440
and because-- so Julian kept
us supplied with bagels,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.005
and by the end we were just
main lining chocolate bars.

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:43.130
We could not have come up
with a title for the show

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.080
without the chocolate bars.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.800
MAX SALTONSTALL: I'll
come to the next one.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.463
It sounds like it was fun.

00:20:45.463 --> 00:20:46.546
ELLEN KUSHNER: No, no, no.

00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:48.650
You can't, because you
can't read the thing

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.210
with all the cards on it.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.740
And then also in all
my novels there's

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.400
a big thing where everybody
drinks chocolate instead of tea

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.150
or coffee, and I
thought I've got

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.340
it very clear in my head
what the chocolate is like.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.173
It's like coffee in
that you drink it black,

00:21:02.173 --> 00:21:03.390
and it can be quite bitter.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.180
So I decided to make
it for the group

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.940
so that when they walked in they
would be served hot chocolate,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.680
and actually managed to do it.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.020
And those who wished
could add cream and sugar,

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.580
but we were so
high, because I kept

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.710
putting out more chocolate.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.452
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.452 --> 00:21:21.609
The entire weekend, but that
was historical research.

00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:23.150
MAX SALTONSTALL:
And then at the end,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.010
everyone gets paid
in chocolate, right?

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.930
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh, yeah.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.650
So we all did the
exact same thing,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.270
and I also want to point
out that our show runner

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.410
and writer, Racheline
Maltese, did

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.490
this up as a blog post
that's on our blog that talks

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:40.200
about the process a lot more
clearly than I know I am,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.420
because it really is interesting
that it recapitulates

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.900
television in that you're
in the white room together,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.100
but only for three
days, and then everyone

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.520
goes back to Mexico, or
Los Angeles, or wherever.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.050
And you're left with--
thank god for Google Chat,

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.430
and you're not paying me to say
that, but it really is true.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.670
All your other meetings are
when everyone's time zone can

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.810
fit together, and their
schedules can fit together,

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.505
and we can talk on a screen,
or we chat a lot on Slack,

00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:12.830
I guess, we use.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.800
But it is a funny mixture
of that real intimacy

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.154
and everybody being in a room,
and then suddenly you're not,

00:22:21.154 --> 00:22:23.070
and you still have to
work out those problems.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.653
MAX GLADSTONE: You
have to be thinking

00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:27.970
about while you're writing, what
would Brian say about this bit?

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.850
ELLEN KUSHNER: Or a quick note
to somebody, occasionally even

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.450
texting them going, I know
this is really irritating,

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.908
but I've got to
ask you this thing.

00:22:32.908 --> 00:22:34.340
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.580
MAX SALTONSTALL: Did you
guys use a similar process

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.880
on "Bookburners" for the--

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.630
MAX GLADSTONE: Something
a little similar.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.220
We went into the story
summit with much less

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.530
of an idea of what we were
doing than either "Tremontaine"

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.270
or "Witch."

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.940
LINDSAY SMITH: The guinea pigs.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.689
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah,
well we didn't really

00:22:49.689 --> 00:22:50.580
know what we needed.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.510
ELLEN KUSHNER: You
were inventing it.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.280
MAX GLADSTONE: We'll
figure it all out.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:52.780
ELLEN KUSHNER: You invented it.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.280
MAX GLADSTONE: Exactly.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.071
We're just going to
build the raft as we're

00:22:55.071 --> 00:22:58.292
trying to sail down the river.

00:22:58.292 --> 00:23:01.240
I guess rafts have
sails-- some rafts.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:07.360
So I'd written up a brief pitch
document for "Bookburners"

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.830
outlining the concept, a few
basic characters, and then

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.619
we'd passed it around to
all of the different writers

00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:16.035
and people who were interested
or involved in the project.

00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:19.870
So it accumulated edits
and edits after that,

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.700
and then track changes
things, and then

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.890
comments in the margins.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.640
Then margin comments
on the comments that

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.370
were in the margins originally.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.290
So by the end, we had this
sort of everlasting gob stopper

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.680
of a sort of show
document, and we all

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.410
sat in my living
room thinking, OK,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.290
so what's actually
true after all of this?

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.590
And everyone had
issues with what

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.350
had been contributed so far
ranging from some characters

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:52.850
seemed way too flat
or sort of shadowy.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.130
We had, I think, first
a two or three hour long

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:59.670
conversation about the thematics
of the world and the set

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.800
up, because some of us were
more or less comfortable

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.170
with the notion of,
OK, so you're trying

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.440
to grab magic and put it away.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.480
Is that censorship?

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.140
Is that taking care of
dangerous atomic materials?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.870
What's the dominant
narrative here,

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.460
and what do people
think about it?

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.490
And once we dialed in
enough on that question,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.410
we realized that that was
sort of the issue at the heart

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.570
of all of the characters.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.140
We're dealing with
something that is dangerous,

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.974
that is complicated.

00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:29.264
Everyone has a dramatically
different opinion about it.

00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:31.660
Everyone has a dramatically
different relationship to it.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.740
So that's where the
conflict is going

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.120
to come from inside the team.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.360
What's going to stop or
enable all of these people

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.281
to come together?

00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:42.780
Then the comfort
outside of the team

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.350
is stuff trying to eat them
usually, so that's nice.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.660
And from there, we
basically boiled

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.380
the characters
back to the barest

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.820
outlines, and started building
them up, and saying, OK,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.160
how do these people connect
with this thematic structure.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.860
Where are they going?

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.810
What do they want?

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.540
And some folks ended up
entirely changing roles,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.310
and backgrounds, and
personalities in this process.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.660
And then we had to
build up who they

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.040
were once that had happened,
but the first couple days

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.509
were all taken care of.

00:25:15.509 --> 00:25:17.050
In some ways, the
serious bible stuff

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.230
had already existed
for "Tremontaine"

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.940
and had already
existed for "Witch."

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.000
Once that was done, though,
everyone was very much on board

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.750
with what had happened,
because they'd all

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.610
had hands on the clay,
and then story structure

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.080
could be much more
fluid, and we all

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.700
had a common sense of the truth.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.890
So when someone says
this doesn't actually

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.050
sound like Liam, or this
isn't quite Sal's thing, then,

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.184
oh yeah, OK, yes.

00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:40.850
I remember that.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.980
MAX SALTONSTALL: That's cool.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.210
It sounds like a fascinating
brainstorming session

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.240
that kicked off all of these.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.530
In my experience,
facilitating a good brainstorm

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.879
is actually really challenging.

00:25:50.879 --> 00:25:51.670
So what did you do?

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.830
You don't just want
to throw people

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.850
in a room with
bagels and chocolate

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.435
and say go make a book, right?

00:25:55.435 --> 00:25:57.840
How did you actually
structure it, if at all?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.630
Or what, in retrospect,
worked really nicely

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:05.086
to get everybody working
towards something together?

00:26:05.086 --> 00:26:06.710
LINDSAY SMITH: What
we started out with

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.930
was we wanted everyone
to come to the story

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.666
summit with an episode
already ready to pitch.

00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:13.040
This is a thing
that I would like

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.650
to see happen in this season.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.790
Most of those ended up
changing a little bit,

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.770
but it was really a
good starting point

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.480
to know we've already got
these dots that we can

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.090
connect as we shape the season.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.800
MAX SALTONSTALL: And
that'll be after they've

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.650
read the story bible to know--

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.380
LINDSAY SMITH: After
they're read the bible.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.754
MAX SALTONSTALL: So you've
set down the context, and then

00:26:30.754 --> 00:26:31.526
bringing a pitch?

00:26:31.526 --> 00:26:32.400
LINDSAY SMITH: Right.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.483
Right, so we're all working
with the same language

00:26:34.483 --> 00:26:37.190
for the story, and we've got
that fluency for the series,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.770
and from there, we
can start reshaping.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.340
How do we want the story
to actually progress?

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.490
This is the starting
point in the series bible.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.279
Where do we want to go with it?

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.820
So that's kind of
what we focused on,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.220
and everybody had their episode
ideas, and then we also--

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.860
because our focus is on both
espionage and witchcraft,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.985
we had everybody come up with
a magical item, or spell,

00:26:57.985 --> 00:27:02.090
or element that they wanted to
see come to life in the story.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.030
So that kind of
gave us a MacGuffin

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:09.590
to work with in the
different episodes, as well.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.020
I forget the rest
of the question.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.360
MAX SALTONSTALL: How to
structure the brainstorming so

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.460
that but it's not
just a bunch of people

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.360
all hollering at a white board,
but it's something useful.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.860
LINDSAY SMITH: It was
almost like watching

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.470
like fractals
diffuse or something.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.710
We started out with these
really big blobs of ideas,

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.360
and as we made it
into a larger arc,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.530
and then into
individual episodes,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:34.290
that's when it got these finer
levels of granularity, I guess,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.020
is a good way to put it.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.780
We just kind of shaped
it down into an episode.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.800
All right, here's what
this slice of time

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.960
looks like, and then here are
the three acts of that episode,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.285
or here are the little bullet
points for that episode.

00:27:46.285 --> 00:27:48.420
MAX SALTONSTALL: Did you
first collaboratively make

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.620
that whole arc so that you
could then carve it up?

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.480
LINDSAY SMITH: Yes, and that's
where the note cards really

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:52.940
came into place.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.340
We had this nice
big bulletin board

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.360
that we were sticking
things to, and we got them

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.080
in the right order, and then
we broke them down further.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.540
It really worked out
nicely to just branch down

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.530
into the individual story beats.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.200
MAX GLADSTONE: Two aspects
of both of the summits

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.650
that was involved in that
were huge-- there was a time

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.840
structure that we
imposed on everything.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.950
This is Margaret
Dunlap's notion.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.430
I think this is coming off
of the way [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.150
MAX SALTONSTALL: She's
worked in television.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.150
MAX GLADSTONE: Yeah, she's
worked in television,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.590
and she was choosing "The
Middleman" writer's room,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:30.160
and she has a sense
of breaking time up

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.020
into 45 minute increments.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.410
You have 45 minutes on, and
then 12 minutes off basically.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.440
It was in the 45 you
consider yourself

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.290
to be in a Faraday cage.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.230
Phones are down.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:43.530
Computers are off.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.270
There's nothing going
on except for focusing

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.880
on this particular story issue.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.660
Nobody leaves.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.950
Nobody does anything.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.680
Then 12 minutes where you can
just go, and catch breath,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.550
and do whatever you
need to do, and then

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.880
come back for the next 45.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.720
And that really helped,
I think, make sure

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.950
that everybody was 100% involved
in solving the questions that

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.660
really needed to be solved.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.910
And also I think the focused
story summit aspect of it--

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.740
the fact that we were only there
for three or four days-- really

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.790
added a bit of fire.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.060
You know that you need to
get everything done or most

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.474
everything done
within that time.

00:29:22.474 --> 00:29:23.890
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Did you know what

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.080
you needed to get done
in those three days?

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.730
MAX GLADSTONE: Well we knew
that after those three days

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.930
we were not going to
be co-located probably

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.890
until the next one unless
something very strange

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.300
happened.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.510
So anything that involved us
talking to one another really

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.790
needed to be finished in those
three days, and going in we

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.530
knew that what we
hoped to get out of it

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:49.450
was a plan for the series, an
episode by episode breakdown,

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.830
and episode assignments,
and then a sense of who

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:57.960
the characters were, because
once we had the episode

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.530
timeline and a good
sense of the characters,

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.425
the rest can kind of
take care of itself.

00:30:03.425 --> 00:30:05.050
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Ellen, you perhaps got

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.060
the biggest story bible
going into that brainstorming

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.685
session, right?

00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:08.970
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh lordy, yeah.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.678
MAX SALTONSTALL: How
did you structure it

00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:11.991
so people could contribute?

00:30:11.991 --> 00:30:13.990
ELLEN KUSHNER: Well, we
really do the same thing

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.574
that everybody else
did, and I was not

00:30:15.574 --> 00:30:17.781
the leader, which was a good
thing, because that left

00:30:17.781 --> 00:30:20.640
me free to make chocolate and
wave my hands going no, no, no,

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.230
or yes, yes, yes.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.450
So Julian Yap, who
is our publisher--

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.700
we were actually supposed
to have Margaret Dunlap, who

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:33.340
is a television person, and
she was snowed in, in March.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.650
Good old New York City.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.314
And so Julian stepped
in, and he went,

00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:38.230
OK, I'm going to try and
do what Margaret did,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.479
but I don't know if I can
do it, and he was brilliant.

00:30:40.479 --> 00:30:45.570
He was fantastic, any
he was the team leader,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.400
and kept us all more
or less on track,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.280
and also knew when to shut
up and just let us get wild.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.740
And we did-- that 45 minute
thing was absolutely brilliant,

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.720
but you really felt that
things were taking off

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.889
when the timer would go off,
and first of all, you wouldn't

00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:00.180
believe it had been 45 minutes.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.040
It felt like 12, and
then nobody wanted

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.567
to stop because we were right
in the middle of this really

00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:04.130
great idea.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.890
It was very interesting
to watch how that worked,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.520
but we basically knew
what the ending needed

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.204
to be of the three days and just
let him guide us through it.

00:31:14.204 --> 00:31:15.120
MAX SALTONSTALL: Cool.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.802
So releasing in this format,
you have a different way

00:31:17.802 --> 00:31:19.760
of engaging with your
readers and your friends.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.770
So have you found that
that sort of community

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.395
has evolved differently
now that you've

00:31:23.395 --> 00:31:26.225
got this different style
of putting it out there,

00:31:26.225 --> 00:31:28.495
or is it similar to other
books that you've written?

00:31:28.495 --> 00:31:30.620
MAX GLADSTONE: That's been
the hardest part for me,

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:35.160
honestly, because I'm not having
done a lot of publicity stuff

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.630
before I started
publishing books.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.960
My norms were set
by novel publishing.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.630
So here's a thing.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.679
I took nine months to write it.

00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:45.470
It's out there now.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.410
I'm going to spend
a month basically

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.800
not shutting up about it
ever and running around

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.099
like mad trying to shove
it in people's hands.

00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:53.640
Read my book.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.181
Read my book.

00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:54.860
Read my book.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.920
And then I go back
into my cave and don't

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.920
talk to anyone for a long
time-- another nine months

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.980
as I'm writing another book.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.700
And this way, having something
coming out every week,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.150
I can't do that.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.640
I can't do the
always on publicity

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.600
push that I do post novel
launch, because that would,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.170
for one thing,
exhaust the community,

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.580
and for another thing, I
would be a pile of jello.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.810
So finding a good pace for
that has been really hard.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.430
I'm really impressed, honestly,
with how Ellen's done it.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.752
You seem to have a
fantastic mix going on.

00:32:28.752 --> 00:32:30.460
ELLEN KUSHNER: Yeah,
it's a little weird.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.090
I just love it, and I
was told a while ago

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.900
that I had a really good
connection with my readers

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.860
and had been
encouraged to do this.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.600
I probably spend too much
time connecting and stuff,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.200
but the thing that I've learned
after promoting a ton of things

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.500
over the last few
years is, just when

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.170
you think you've
completely saturated

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.460
and everyone is sick of
it, a month later you'll

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.122
get somebody going, oh, you
mean there's an audio book?

00:32:54.122 --> 00:32:55.090
Come on.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.560
I did nothing but talk
about it for 90 days.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.682
So you can't ever stop really.

00:32:59.682 --> 00:33:01.140
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Yeah, fair enough.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.870
ELLEN KUSHNER: But you have to.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:02.730
You really have to.

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:06.530
LINDSAY SMITH: "Witch"
hasn't come out yet.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.320
It doesn't have
until January 13,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.340
I believe, but I'm really
excited to get-- in publishing

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.415
terms, at least-- what we would
consider immediate feedback

00:33:15.415 --> 00:33:18.440
on our stories, because
I think at this point

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.950
every single one of the books
that I've published so far

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.658
it was about three
years between the time

00:33:22.658 --> 00:33:24.830
I started writing it to
the time it was on shelves.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.200
So it'll be really
nice to have what

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.951
feels like all this
instantaneous comments

00:33:29.951 --> 00:33:31.950
on it from readers and
hearing people connecting

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.074
with the story, and I think
it's going to be really

00:33:34.074 --> 00:33:36.810
cool because I remember this
myself as somebody who's

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.532
a fan of television
shows and so on.

00:33:38.532 --> 00:33:40.740
Oh my gosh, let's talk about
what happened this week,

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.050
and getting really into
it, and theorizing.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.352
I can't wait to just
be the fly on the wall

00:33:45.352 --> 00:33:47.810
for the online discussion for
how that's going to play out.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.030
ELLEN KUSHNER: That
is the best part.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.600
I am telling you.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:56.620
If for nothing else, for
that experience in forever,

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.220
you are essentially
reading the novel

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.260
over somebody else's shoulder.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.270
When the reviews
start coming in,

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.780
they are more like
recaps than reviews,

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.780
because it's a short piece, and
people want to talk about it.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.600
And you watch them guessing
what's going to happen,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.020
and loving, and then
hating, or hating

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.570
and then loving characters.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:18.920
Oh, it's such crack.

00:34:21.624 --> 00:34:23.290
One of the interesting
things about this

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.873
that we haven't
talked about that much

00:34:24.873 --> 00:34:29.420
is how we have to set our
brains to thinking like TV,

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.530
but being book people.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:36.270
The one, I think,
piece of vocabulary

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.870
that we've all
learned to share is

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.760
don't talk about it as a novel.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.920
Talk about it as a series,
and they're not stories.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.290
They're episodes.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.120
And you really have
to think that way,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.760
or you will get a
little nuts, and it also

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.750
keeps a big group of
people from going off

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.130
in all directions
when you think,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.820
I'm writing the
episode in which.

00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:03.460
So the pay off for
that in a way is

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.890
getting to watch people
engage as if it were a TV

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:09.005
episode, but secretly
thinking, god,

00:35:09.005 --> 00:35:12.280
it's like I'm reading my
book over their shoulder.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.130
It's just a lovely
fusion of the two.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.660
LINDSAY SMITH: And I
think what the great thing

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.960
about the episodes, too,
is, even though you talked

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.810
about how we have to all make
sure the characters all sound

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.160
the same, there's a
continuity of story,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.430
each episode you
really do you feel

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.380
the writer who wrote it, too.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.760
We've got Cassandra Rose Clarke.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.650
She's got this great witty
dialogue that she does.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.340
Ian Tregillis has these really
wonderful Baroque descriptions

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.680
of things that are
really engrossing.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.250
So each episode, even though you
feel the overarching continuity

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.470
of it, you can
tell who wrote it,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.730
and it's really, really cool
to see that all coming together

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.145
into this beautiful patchwork.

00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:52.020
So I think that's going
to be cool to see how

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.797
readers engage with that, too.

00:35:53.797 --> 00:35:56.380
MAX GLADSTONE: It's like you get
a different directorial voice

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.560
in each episode.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.260
MAX SALTONSTALL: So because you
could pick up just one episode

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.610
and then not continue on,
you have this bigger burden

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.330
to make people care
right from the start.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.600
So how do you do that?

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.850
LINDSAY SMITH: Great question.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.916
I'll find out in
a month, I guess.

00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:13.290
MAX GLADSTONE: I
think not hiding

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.310
the ball becomes a
lot more important

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.200
in the episodic structure than
it is in novel length prose

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.100
fiction.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.360
So it's showing people what
they're getting themselves

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.600
in for almost as
soon as possible.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.020
So in "Bookburners,"
basically the first scene

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.710
you know demons are
possessing people,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.570
and things are getting
shoved into walls,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.460
and magicky stuff is
happening, and people

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.280
are bleeding from their eye
sockets, and it's great.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.180
If you get there and
you're like, oh yes, I

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.638
want more of this, this is
good, because we have more of it

00:36:40.638 --> 00:36:41.890
to provide to you.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.790
And similarly, I think
we start off "Witch"

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.854
with this very strong hit of
what's going on in the series.

00:36:46.854 --> 00:36:49.020
LINDSAY SMITH: Yeah, we
wanted to make it very clear

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.410
up front that there's
spy craft in here,

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.010
but there's also
witchcraft going on.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.770
And I think the first episode
really strikes a nice balance

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:01.510
for setting up these two
different woven together type

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.011
of themes.

00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.218
MAX SALTONSTALL: And how
they interact in that world.

00:37:04.218 --> 00:37:06.700
LINDSAY SMITH: Yes, because
I think the very first scene

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.822
starts out these spies
who are on this look out,

00:37:08.822 --> 00:37:11.280
and they're very clearly spies,
and they're using espionage

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.840
terminology, but by the
end of that first scene,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.220
I think you realize that
there's something paranormal

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.280
or supernatural
going on as well.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.896
I think as soon as we make
that clear to the readers

00:37:20.896 --> 00:37:22.270
I think they'll
be like, OK, yes.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.450
This is what I'm here for.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.250
I'm set.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.500
MAX SALTONSTALL: They're
pretty explicit about hunting

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.590
a golem [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.050
Not the usual run of the mill.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.070
ELLEN KUSHNER: I actually
had to learn to do that.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.530
It was very interesting.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.260
We had the meeting, and
that night I sat down

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.520
and started writing the pilot.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.160
And I thought, this is great.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.770
I'm going to introduce each
of the major characters,

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.930
and each of them will
be looking at the city.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.600
And that way I'll
introduce the city

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.160
from all these different
viewpoints to everybody,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.900
and just make it
all very delicious,

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.510
and write scenes
with witty dialogue,

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.325
and have them going
to the next place

00:37:57.325 --> 00:37:59.700
that they're clearly going to
be so that next week you'll

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.920
want to see them there.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.160
And I turned it
in with great joy

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.500
and was told by pretty
much everybody, Ellen,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.380
this is really fun
to read, but it

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.185
reads like the first
chapter of a novel.

00:38:10.185 --> 00:38:11.310
You've got your characters.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.120
You've got your setting,
but where's the tension?

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.970
I'm like, well, the
tension is that you

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.580
care about my
characters, and you

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.690
want to know what's going
to happen to them next.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.610
And I sat down, and
took a few breaths,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.540
and waited for the
next few episodes

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.900
to come in, because
what we kept finding

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.945
was that little jewels would
turn up that nobody had thought

00:38:29.945 --> 00:38:33.550
of during the meeting, or
that little extra Phillips

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.590
and curlicues would be
added, which were going

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.080
to need to be planted earlier.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.900
So I actually refused to
rewrite it until we had,

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.810
I think, four more
episodes done.

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.890
Then I read them all
and went, right, got it.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.460
Went back in and figured out
the two strands of tension

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.140
that I could
legitimately work in

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.360
right now that would
have pay off later,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.800
and turned it in, and
was perfectly happy,

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.700
and was blissfully
unaware of how

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.440
absolutely critical it was
that readers read it and want

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.637
to go on, because I'd been very
much thinking about my fans

00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:07.470
would all want to read
this, because they're

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.210
big followers of the world.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.390
And with any luck some
new people would come in.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.090
Almost all of the reviews
and things I've seen

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.840
and the jumping up and
down is from people

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.470
who had never heard of me.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.130
And so the stakes were
higher than I realized

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.740
to make them love my world,
and what we were going

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.500
to do with it, and my people.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.810
So I'm still kind
of fanning myself

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.520
on the couch with the smelling
salts about, thank god,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.560
I didn't quite understand
how important that

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.960
was, and thank god it worked.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.210
MAX SALTONSTALL: Or you could
just put it down, right?

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.010
You won't pick up a book as
easy as just one episode.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.750
The first one is
free, and I don't even

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.361
like your first character.

00:39:47.361 --> 00:39:48.360
She's kind of atrocious.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.100
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh, yeah.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.683
MAX SALTONSTALL:
Which is intentional,

00:39:50.683 --> 00:39:53.015
but immediately it's an
interesting journey of, OK, now

00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:54.640
I've got this second
set of characters,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.223
and then this third
set of characters,

00:39:56.223 --> 00:40:00.220
and who do I want to
latch onto, because I

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.490
don't want to care about her.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.377
She's mean.

00:40:02.377 --> 00:40:03.960
ELLEN KUSHNER: And
one of my hallmarks

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.700
with all my characters always
is I love to flip expectation.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.650
So there are all
sorts of things you

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.316
think you know that are going to
turn out to be different later,

00:40:10.316 --> 00:40:11.110
so hang in there.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:11.531
Don't give up.

00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:12.531
MAX SALTONSTALL: OK, OK.

00:40:12.531 --> 00:40:13.640
I'll keep going.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.810
So what does a
part two look like?

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:21.400
What is a next sequel or a
series in a serial format

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.670
feel like or behave
like as an author?

00:40:26.734 --> 00:40:28.400
LINDSAY SMITH: Have
you actually started

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.530
on season two work
for "Bookburners" yet?

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.410
MAX GLADSTONE: We
have, actually.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.368
LINDSAY SMITH: Awesome.

00:40:32.368 --> 00:40:37.370
MAX GLADSTONE: So it's
been a lot of fun.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.990
So the first
exposure to any world

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.645
or any group of
characters you're

00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:43.770
doing a lot of exploration.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:47.404
You're setting
boundaries where what

00:40:47.404 --> 00:40:48.820
is possible in
this world, what is

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.501
possible for these characters?

00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:52.250
And then you bring
them to a crisis moment

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.310
in which a few more of those
questions get answered.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:00.030
That means that the next step
is exploding those boundaries

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.220
or warping them
somehow, figuring out

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.130
what of the underlying
truths of the first season

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.270
you're going to start
shifting and changing.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:12.410
So the climax of the first
season of "Bookburners"

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.570
is pretty society shaking,
and all the characters

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.690
are kind of reeling
from that at the end

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.847
and are pushing into
changes that they

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.180
want to make in the world,
and the way they do business,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.000
and the way they
interact with magic.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.451
And that is the engine,
because that creates conflict

00:41:31.451 --> 00:41:33.950
among the characters, between
the characters and the society

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.033
that they're a part of,
and between the characters

00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:37.330
and the writer world.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.680
So the first season is
about-- or the first book

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.620
is often about characters
exploring the world,

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.100
and then the second one is
actually trying to change it.

00:41:47.955 --> 00:41:49.080
LINDSAY SMITH: I like that.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.610
I like that a lot.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.240
For me, it feels
a lot like writing

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.620
any sequel where you want to
give people more of the same,

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.230
but different.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.380
So have them feel like they're
still in the same universe,

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.970
but the stakes have changed
and that the characters have

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.522
been irrevocably
changed by whatever

00:42:03.522 --> 00:42:05.730
catastrophic thing happened
at the end of season one,

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.042
because that's how it
always happens, right?

00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.500
So I think what
we're going to need

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.300
to look at is where our end
game is for the whole series.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.130
And now that we've
had our fun playing

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.300
in this exciting new
playground in season one

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.560
our characters finally
understand their place

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.120
in the world, like
you were saying,

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.960
and what they want
to get out of it now.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.979
So we need to look
both at where we're

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:31.520
going for the end of the season
and for the end of the series

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.710
way out off in the distance, and
start making things even more

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:39.380
complicated, or looking
for new little twists

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.800
to bring in that explore
themes that we haven't gotten

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.720
to touch on yet in season one.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.760
For me, that's what
a series is about--

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.330
is looking at all the different
permutations within the world

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.290
and how you can make them add
up into horrible and exciting

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.026
things.

00:42:54.026 --> 00:42:55.650
ELLEN KUSHNER: And
again, I started off

00:42:55.650 --> 00:43:02.160
thinking like a book person,
and as episode 9 and 10 came in,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.990
and I knew I was going to have
to start writing the season

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.025
finale, my initial
response was, oh, well,

00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:10.420
let's just kill them all.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.359
Then we can start over
with more fun toys.

00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:13.400
I'm done with these toys.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.056
I played with
these toys already.

00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:19.270
And gently told no, in TV
you don't do [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.310
You have to keep them
and have them become

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.940
different in the next series.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.812
So fortunately, by the time now
that I've read 11 and 12 and I

00:43:27.812 --> 00:43:30.270
see the possibilities, and I
sat down and started writing--

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.190
and again, I was like, but I
cannot take this responsibility

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.684
upon myself We have to have
another giant meeting to decide

00:43:35.684 --> 00:43:37.850
what season two will be
like so that I can set it up

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.260
in the 13th episode.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.770
It's like, no, no.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.270
It's OK.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.930
Just go.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.890
And damn it, the muse
comes down and goes,

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.530
you can have some fun with this.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.330
And what I found
myself doing just

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.360
instinctively without planning--
because no one would let

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.260
me plan for this.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.590
No one would enable
me to plan-- was

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.120
that there are
secondary characters who

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.650
are going to become really
important in the next season,

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.120
and suddenly I
found myself writing

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.437
from their point of view, which
is my secret way of telling you

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.520
that you are now going to
be following this person

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.030
and taking an interest
in them, and I needed

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:16.110
a minor, minor, minor character,
the nurse to somebody who's

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.770
sick, and suddenly she
came to me full blown.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.900
And I realized that she's
really interesting seeing,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.020
and so now she's
running in my head.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.130
And there are characters
that people just love.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.790
The thing that I'm just
starting to be able to get-- we

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.230
just posted episode five,
and I'm writing episode 13,

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.620
but I know who
people love, and I

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.536
know who people are
really worried about.

00:44:37.536 --> 00:44:39.910
And while I'm not going to
let that change our decisions,

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.780
because we already had the
chocolate and the bagels,

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.460
I know what satisfaction
I can give them

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.950
by engaging with these
characters in a particular way.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.830
And then we'll have another
giant three day meeting,

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.530
I presume, and sort out what
the arc is for next year,

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.140
but I was told not only
could I not kill everybody,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.650
but that someone needed
to be happy at the end,

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.365
that I couldn't just leave
a trail angst behind me.

00:45:06.365 --> 00:45:07.990
So I know who's going
to be happy, too,

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.380
and they're very sweet.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.060
LINDSAY SMITH: At
least temporarily.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.455
ELLEN KUSHNER: Oh, yeah.

00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:14.580
MAX SALTONSTALL: So as
you're prepping that finale,

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.440
what kind of feedback
are you then getting

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.110
from the rest of the team.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.380
ELLEN KUSHNER: Nothing.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.510
Oh, well, I-- no, I
shouldn't say this.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:25.302
No, I'm going to finish
a draft, and I'm late,

00:45:25.302 --> 00:45:27.760
but I hope there will be time
for me to send it out to them

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.220
and make sure that they're
all comfortable with it

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.920
before we can go farther,
including-- we're all messing

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.670
with each other's
characters all the time,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:40.070
and even though technically
we all co-own and co-create

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.080
everybody, I very much
have a sense of who brought

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.510
what Barbie to the game.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.060
There's no question about that.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:53.170
Alaya, for instance, is the
god of [INAUDIBLE] and all

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:57.010
of her [INAUDIBLE]
people, and that really we

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.460
need to check in with her
before we mess with it,

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.450
and that Rafe is
really Joel's man,

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.479
and we will check in with him.

00:46:04.479 --> 00:46:06.770
That been something we do
that I don't know if you guys

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.400
do as much.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.780
We sort of own
characters, again,

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.470
like kids just playing
with their dolls,

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.250
but I think also at this
point having read and edited

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.396
12 episodes I've got
a pretty good idea,

00:46:19.396 --> 00:46:20.895
but I do want to
check and make sure

00:46:20.895 --> 00:46:22.530
that they're OK with everything.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.571
LINDSAY SMITH: That's a
really interesting point,

00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:27.060
because I think we've ended
up writing the POVs of pretty

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.290
much all the major characters
over the course of 13 episodes,

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.219
but Max and I co-wrote
both the pilot,

00:46:32.219 --> 00:46:34.760
and then we're getting ready to
co-write the season finale as

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.480
well.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.490
And we both kind of
instinctively gravitated

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.060
toward the opposite characters
for the first episode

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.400
and the last episode
to write the POVs.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.120
So the main character,
Gabriel, who's

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.870
an American CIA
operative, and then Tanya,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.030
a KGB officer who is also
a witch for the Ice--

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.630
so I just naturally picked
up on the Russian characters,

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.213
because that's kind
of my background--

00:46:57.213 --> 00:46:59.497
is writing about Soviet
Russia, and then Max

00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:00.580
gravitated toward Gabriel.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.090
It was kind of Max's
invention anyway.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.459
So we just clutched
onto them even

00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:07.250
though throughout the
course of the episode

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.372
we would obviously write in
all the different personas.

00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:13.490
MAX GLADSTONE: It'll be fun
to go back to both of them

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.031
and see how the
polarity has shifted.

00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:17.540
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh, yeah, it's
going to be very different.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.415
MAX SALTONSTALL: What
about you in terms of--

00:47:19.415 --> 00:47:22.630
MAX GLADSTONE: We don't have
a lot of very strict ownership

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:23.900
of anyone.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.920
All the characters are
sort of public property

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.790
within the "Bookburners" team.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:33.390
People who are bringing
specific world building elements

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.270
tend to end up more like the
source of truth for that.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.450
So I knew things
about Grace going

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:45.100
in that were sort of important,
and I ended up being, I think,

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.250
the final line of yes or
no on decisions with her.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.140
And some people
were more invested

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.140
in particular elements of
the magic system, or humor,

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.629
or guns, the ongoing
question of when

00:48:00.629 --> 00:48:02.670
people are allowed to be
carrying guns in Europe,

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.990
for example.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:08.580
But the characters are all
everybody's property for us.

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.530
MAX SALTONSTALL: Cool.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.610
Has your reading
habit changed now

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.206
that you've started writing
in this different style?

00:48:14.206 --> 00:48:15.830
LINDSAY SMITH: That's
a great question.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.788
I'm definitely reading
a lot more spy thrillers

00:48:17.788 --> 00:48:18.610
than I used to.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:23.140
I've always enjoyed it, but
Ian brought up the Tim Powers

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.390
series "Declare," and so on,
so I'm really getting into that

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.770
and also trying to read more
about witchcraft and folklore

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:34.310
type spells so we can weave that
in more-- I guess authentically

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:35.060
is the right word.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.720
I don't know, but
something [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.861
MAX GLADSTONE: 100%
authentic witchcraft.

00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:39.304
This witchcraft felt very fake.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.780
I continue to read
eclectically and oddly.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.600
You never know what's
going to be useful.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.641
LINDSAY SMITH: Very true.

00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:51.030
ELLEN KUSHNER: Although,
I actually-- I guess

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.700
I'm reading nonfiction that I
might not otherwise have read.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.320
We have this whole
mathematical navigation,

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.070
figuring odds, card
playing plot, which

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.249
turned out-- I had no idea.

00:49:02.249 --> 00:49:03.790
I had to call my
poker playing friend

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.530
to ask how you could count cards
and be a better poker player,

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.400
and he said, well, you know,
Descartes invented that.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.540
And my heart skipped a beat,
because that's our plot.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.460
We had basically reinvented
reality, as one does,

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.690
and so then I started reading
all about 17th century science

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.840
because there was a
great encyclopedia that

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.040
explained how it all
worked, because really

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.044
to have people inventing science
and mathematics when you don't

00:49:32.044 --> 00:49:33.710
really know the history
of it yourself--

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.418
fortunately I have a
very good friend who

00:49:35.418 --> 00:49:37.590
is a mathematician, who
got the biggest kick out

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.920
of being on group calls with
us and giving us advice,

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.370
but I just found a book called
"How Paris Became Paris," which

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.510
is not about the 19th century,
which is what we all think of.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.210
Haussmann blowing everything up
and making straight beautiful--

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.510
the Paris that we know.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.510
Apparently in the
17th century, Paris

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.430
became an ultra modern city.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.070
It was like the Tokyo of its
day because they did things

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.190
like sidewalks and
outdoor lighting,

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.476
and while my city is a
mishmash of everything,

00:50:07.476 --> 00:50:09.600
it's very hard for us to
imagine a city where there

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.370
is no natural
light-- or excuse me,

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:15.810
no non natural light at night.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.901
And you know that people did
go out at night sometimes,

00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:21.150
and you have some vague idea
that there were lanterns.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.200
Well, it turns out
that householders

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.864
were responsible
for hanging lights

00:50:25.864 --> 00:50:27.530
so that there wouldn't
be as much crime,

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.410
and there's just all this
stuff in this wonderful book.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.310
And sometimes it just
confirms something

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:35.290
that you made up that
you hope you can fake,

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.910
and it just makes
you feel better,

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.140
and sometimes you get
new exciting new ideas.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.890
LINDSAY SMITH: I think
watching television

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:45.370
has changed for me more than
reading, because it's already

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:46.960
got the episodic format.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.570
I was really getting
into in my head

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.100
outlining "Jessica Jones"
as I was binging that,

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.077
and "Daredevil," and so on.

00:50:54.077 --> 00:50:55.660
Paying a lot more
attention to the way

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.770
they do the little hooks
at the ends of episodes

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.579
and so on to guide
you into the next.

00:50:59.579 --> 00:51:01.120
So for me, it's more
paying attention

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.490
to craft elements like that.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.240
MAX GLADSTONE: That's
a really good point.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.031
I found myself much
more aware of, oh well,

00:51:06.031 --> 00:51:09.420
and here's your act break.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.212
Here are your plot
element changes.

00:51:12.212 --> 00:51:14.670
MAX SALTONSTALL: But you're
not going to let me binge read.

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.597
ELLEN KUSHNER: Well, we are.

00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:20.430
There are clearly people
who are holding off

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.650
until the whole thing is
done so that they binge read.

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:22.800
LINDSAY SMITH: Oh, really?

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.900
ELLEN KUSHNER: And that's
frankly what I do with TV.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.149
I can't remember when I
watched something once a week,

00:51:27.149 --> 00:51:28.089
so I just wait.

00:51:28.089 --> 00:51:29.380
So I have sympathy with people.

00:51:31.914 --> 00:51:33.580
MAX GLADSTONE: Having
have now caught up

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.570
with "Steven Universe," I am,
for the first time in maybe

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.840
a decade, waiting for the next
episode of the television.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.520
I just thought
they were all done,

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.134
and then you got the boxed
sets and then watched them.

00:51:45.134 --> 00:51:47.550
MAX SALTONSTALL: But now you're
inflicting this exact pain

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.490
on your fans, you realize?

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:49.656
MAX GLADSTONE: This is true.

00:51:49.656 --> 00:51:50.570
Yeah, I don't know.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.520
We pass it on.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.110
MAX SALTONSTALL:
So you've all taken

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:58.390
interesting cultural collages.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.120
How did you get yourself
into the cultures

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.170
that you're borrowing from or
even fabricating to then bring

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:06.834
them into these stories.

00:52:06.834 --> 00:52:08.250
MAX GLADSTONE:
Well, "Bookburners"

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.870
is pretty straightforward
because it's

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.140
operating in something that's
basically the modern world.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.640
MAX SALTONSTALL:
But you're not part

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.040
of the Vatican [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.384
MAX GLADSTONE: Well, no.

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:18.800
MAX SALTONSTALL:
As far as I know.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.310
MAX GLADSTONE: No, not at all.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:22.914
That would be really weird.

00:52:22.914 --> 00:52:26.170
MAX SALTONSTALL: It's
the best cover ever.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.740
MAX GLADSTONE: That's
the way I go for it, Max.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.930
So yes.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.850
So the hardest part
was-- and remains--

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:38.950
figuring out what
kind of picture

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:42.680
we could draw of
interior Vatican politics

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.170
without either deeply offending
people, which we don't want

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:49.660
to deeply offend
too many people,

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.150
or just getting stuff wrong.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:58.080
And so we're drawing heavily off
of childhood religious history,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.480
and current experience,
and also the notion

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.280
that this is a sort of
enormous sprawling bureaucracy,

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.040
and many of the writers
who are on the team

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.060
have a lot of experience
in one or many of those.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:15.580
So often for me
trying to write stuff

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.590
that I don't have direct
physical or personal experience

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.230
with is a question of
I'm talking to as many

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:24.860
people as I can, but then
trying to identify what

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.630
in this system corresponds
with something that I do

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:31.680
have direct physical
experience of.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.842
If there's some correspondence
that I can find,

00:53:33.842 --> 00:53:35.550
then it kind of breaks
open a little bit,

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.495
and it becomes much
easier to navigate,

00:53:37.495 --> 00:53:39.620
but there's always the risk
of getting stuff wrong.

00:53:42.357 --> 00:53:43.940
LINDSAY SMITH: For
the "Witch" series,

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.020
I think we focused
more on making things

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.350
feel authentic than accurate.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:53.190
So what I mean by that is, as
the resident Russian scholar

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.960
for the team, I
can kind of step in

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.580
and say, I don't
really think they

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.880
would make a big deal about
Christmas at this time of year.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.300
I don't think the KGB-- someone
would say this this directly.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.580
There would be a little
more subterfuge about it,

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.340
but by the same
token, I can't exactly

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.600
go over to Lubyanka,
the KGB headquarters,

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.970
and read through their archives,
what hasn't been burned down

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:15.970
in 1993.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:20.140
So we just try to strive to
hit the right cultural notes

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.990
and make it the feel immersive
without being completely

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.490
accurate, and
nobody in the story

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.750
is necessarily going to
have all the answers either.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.750
People are only going to
be aware of their slice

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.060
of the universe at
that time, and the same

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.340
went for the witchcraft
elements, too.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.440
One of the other things
we did at the story summit

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.965
was figure out how our magic
worked, and we tossed out

00:54:38.965 --> 00:54:40.840
a bunch of different
ideas, but we ultimately

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:46.690
settled on a medieval elemental
type magic, a lot of chemical

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:51.620
symbols, and use of
different elements including

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.390
herbs, and grasses,
and minerals,

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.050
and things of that sort.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:57.810
So once we laid
down that structure,

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.890
even though our spells
probably don't really

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:05.350
work out exactly internally,
logistically-wise, they still

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.740
have the right feeling
of a cohesive universe

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.570
for the spells, and so on.

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.150
MAX SALTONSTALL: Now, you've
taken on a big amalgamation.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:16.775
ELLEN KUSHNER: You don't really
want me to answer that, do you?

00:55:16.775 --> 00:55:18.250
Or do you?

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:20.670
The thing is that I
created the original city,

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.330
and the reason I think that
Julian wanted me to do this

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:27.310
as part of Serial Box was that
he said it's just a fun place

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:29.570
to hang out.

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:32.967
And one of things that's been
particularly fun for me-- well

00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:34.800
first of all, creating
it-- that it was sort

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:39.210
of every city and culture that
I had read about and really

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.670
enjoyed, and I got to mix
them all up in a big stew pot.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:46.540
So I had Elizabethan London, and
the Regency London of Georgette

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.430
Heyer, and a whole lot
of 18th century Paris,

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.390
"Liason Dangereuse,"
certain amount

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:54.240
of Damon Runyon
for my low lives,

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.460
and my own life in
the '80s in New York

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.900
when it was a very dangerous,
and very edgy, and also very

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.590
gay city.

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:05.360
And I just put it all
together and had a good time,

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.020
and I also am very
aware now since I'm

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.030
a New Yorker how much
a city will change

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:13.420
during your own
lifetime, but one

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.130
of my complaints
about fantasy novels

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.960
is people don't
understand that, if you're

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.590
living in a particular
world, you're very conscious

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:21.494
of its changes.

00:56:21.494 --> 00:56:23.410
I think if we all went
back to Ancient Greece,

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:24.650
it would all look
the same to us,

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.450
but you had-- I can't
remember who it was,

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.760
but one of the Greeks
saying, ugh, it's

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.506
not like it used to be, and
everything's terrible now.

00:56:31.506 --> 00:56:33.130
And so you've got to
assume that people

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.360
are hypersensitive
to those changes.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.200
And so one of the things that
we're doing with "Tremontaine"

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.330
is quite consciously
setting it at a time

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:46.050
when some of the things
that happen in later books

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.800
that everybody's read
aren't happening yet.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.880
It's the prelude to what's been
happening in "Swordspoint,"

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.107
and that's been
really interesting,

00:56:55.107 --> 00:56:57.440
and then of course, everybody
brings their own strengths

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.210
and interests.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.860
One of the things
that I remember

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.710
after "Swordspoint" people said,
well there's no middle class.

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:02.800
I'm like, yeah there is.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.650
Just my characters
aren't interested in it.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:07.100
So we added them
in a later book.

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.000
I collaborated on one with
my wife, Delia Sherman,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.190
and just as with New York City,
or Paris, or anywhere else

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.400
you go, you're only going
to see certain parts of it,

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.050
and you're only going to be
interested in certain parts

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:19.550
of it.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.770
There are other parts we
just haven't been to yet,

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:23.340
and that's really
what "Tremontaine"

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.424
has been able to do with
our cast of writers.

00:57:25.424 --> 00:57:26.340
MAX SALTONSTALL: Cool.

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.100
Well, thank you all very
much for joining us.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.620
I look forward to
the next episode.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.180
LINDSAY SMITH: Thank you.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.230
MAX GLADSTONE: Thank you.

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.780
[APPLAUSE]
