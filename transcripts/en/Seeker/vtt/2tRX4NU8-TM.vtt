00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.889
What happens when you have two black holes,
quantum particles and a hell of a lot of gravity

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.370
all in one place!?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.370
Traversable wormholes!!

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.589
AKA a time machine?

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.300
Many of you guys might’ve seen this demo
of how a wormhole works.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.020
So if you have two points on a piece of paper…

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.610
Like two planets in space that you want to
travel between really quickly.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.500
If you fold space in half, you can get the
two points (or planets) to connect.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.560
This is the idea of how a wormhole works…
and possibly time travel.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.960
But for that to exist, we’d need huge warping
of spacetime, which is really hard for us

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960
to do.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.960
But for black holes?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
Easy peasy.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.739
With Einstein’s theories came the idea that
if there are two black holes, they could be

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.420
connected through a wormhole.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.079
Also known as the Einstein-Rosen bridge.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.760
You bet your Benjamin Sisko that you would
not be able to travel through that wormhole

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760
though.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.960
The wormhole wouldn’t be traversable because
it would be too unstable to remain open.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.140
It would require a lot of quantum negative
energy to counteract the immense gravity from

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.260
the black holes…
it’s really complicated, and we can make

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.749
another video about it if you want let us
know.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.389
Up until now, scientists thought that nothing
came out of a black hole, but something known

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.190
as Hawking radiation has been predicted by
Stephen Hawking himself to be emitted from

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.920
black holes.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.920
A theory brought by Steven Hawking himself.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.320
Hawking radiation states that black holes
are not eternal that they will slowly emit

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.930
more and more of their matter till they evaporate
out of existence.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.680
Except… if this Hawking radiation leaves
one black hole, it could end up spawning another,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.270
which could cause those two black holes to
become entangled

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.290
I know what you’re thinking, entanglement
with black holes?!

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.030
What the Ferengi is going on here?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.950
Becoming entangled just means that they have
a connection, that they share the same quantum

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.950
particles.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.869
It’s like as if the two black holes are
related to each other.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.479
And THIS is where the fun stuff comes in about
possible time travel.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.670
Quantum mechanics says that if two black holes
are quantum entangled there may be a wormhole

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.320
that connects them together, if this is true,
then any particle that falls into one of the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.860
black holes can in theory come out of the
other one.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.719
So in a way, from this Hawking Radiation,
it built sort of a bridge between the two

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.610
black holes--aka a possible traversable wormhole.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.189
There’s quite a heated debate about this
new theory because some believe that nothing

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.840
escapes a black hole and it’s filled with
a forever increasing density while others

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.850
believe black holes to be totally empty.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.530
If a black hole is totally empty then there
is no possibility for a bridge, a connection,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.910
or a time-traveling traversable wormhole.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.770
But that’s just the theories right now..

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.890
And more math is needed to figure it all out.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.390
So until the day we can actually observe and
experiment with wormholes… we’ll just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.420
have to slingshot around the sun or travel
faster than warp 9.997.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.260

Carl Sagan used the idea of a wormhole as
a form of time travel in his 1985 Science

00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:16.010
Fiction Novel Contact which caused a bit of
a debate in the science world.
