hi my name's Adam I'm studying

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439
hi my name's Adam I'm studying
 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.039
hi my name's Adam I'm studying
mathematics and physics at a level the

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049
mathematics and physics at a level the
 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.110
mathematics and physics at a level the
cosmic background microwave radiation is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
cosmic background microwave radiation is
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.670
cosmic background microwave radiation is
obviously convincing evidence for the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
obviously convincing evidence for the
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.140
obviously convincing evidence for the
big bang theory but it's still just a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
big bang theory but it's still just a
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.110
big bang theory but it's still just a
theory as the theory of evolution could

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
theory as the theory of evolution could
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.419
theory as the theory of evolution could
be potentially blown apart by fossils of

be potentially blown apart by fossils of

rabbits in the same rock strata as

rabbits in the same rock strata as

rabbits in the same rock strata as
dinosaurs my question is what piece of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
dinosaurs my question is what piece of
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.250
dinosaurs my question is what piece of
evidence

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
evidence
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.019
evidence
if found could potentially bring the Big

Bang Theory to its knees okay Adam well

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
Bang Theory to its knees okay Adam well
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029
Bang Theory to its knees okay Adam well
that one's a tough question as a person

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
that one's a tough question as a person
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.980
that one's a tough question as a person
who's not seen any evidence that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
who's not seen any evidence that
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870
who's not seen any evidence that
contradicts the Big Bang Theory it's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
contradicts the Big Bang Theory it's
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420
contradicts the Big Bang Theory it's
hard to imagine what that I'm evidence

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
hard to imagine what that I'm evidence
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.000
hard to imagine what that I'm evidence
might be but we used to have evidence

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
might be but we used to have evidence
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130
might be but we used to have evidence
that seemed to contradict it we used to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
that seemed to contradict it we used to
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229
that seemed to contradict it we used to
have evidence that some stars were older

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
have evidence that some stars were older
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.389
have evidence that some stars were older
than universe and this is obviously a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
than universe and this is obviously a
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.770
than universe and this is obviously a
problem now we fixed that problem by

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780
problem now we fixed that problem by
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.700
problem now we fixed that problem by
understanding better how that we can

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
understanding better how that we can
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160
understanding better how that we can
tell the ages of stars and we measured

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
tell the ages of stars and we measured
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840
tell the ages of stars and we measured
better the age of the universe and to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
better the age of the universe and to
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610
better the age of the universe and to
get it to work out we had to understand

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
get it to work out we had to understand
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170
get it to work out we had to understand
that the universe is accelerating and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
that the universe is accelerating and
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.240
that the universe is accelerating and
therefore is older than we had thought

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
therefore is older than we had thought
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.810
therefore is older than we had thought
so because of those changes we're now

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
so because of those changes we're now
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.900
so because of those changes we're now
able to say it fits but it wasn't so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
able to say it fits but it wasn't so
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820
able to say it fits but it wasn't so
long ago that the evidence did not fit

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
long ago that the evidence did not fit
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280
long ago that the evidence did not fit
so if something like that would happen

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
so if something like that would happen
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929
so if something like that would happen
again if we would discover that the age

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
again if we would discover that the age
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.130
again if we would discover that the age
of stars are incorrect or that things

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
of stars are incorrect or that things
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870
of stars are incorrect or that things
just don't fit the story then maybe

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
just don't fit the story then maybe
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149
just don't fit the story then maybe
something strange would happen we could

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
something strange would happen we could
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.219
something strange would happen we could
imagine for instance that more detailed

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
imagine for instance that more detailed
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600
imagine for instance that more detailed
measurements of the cosmic background

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
measurements of the cosmic background
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.870
measurements of the cosmic background
radiation wouldn't fit the predictions

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
radiation wouldn't fit the predictions
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270
radiation wouldn't fit the predictions
now is that likely I don't think so but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
now is that likely I don't think so but
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399
now is that likely I don't think so but
it is certainly a theory that could be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
it is certainly a theory that could be
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.640
it is certainly a theory that could be
falsified if strange and mysterious data

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
falsified if strange and mysterious data
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340
falsified if strange and mysterious data
were discovered
