00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:03.950
SPEAKER 1: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.350
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.270
Today we're in for a real treat.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.580
I have the distinct privilege
of welcoming my friend

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.520
and former professor,
Dr. Phil Kesten.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.330
Dr. Kesten is the Associate
Professor of Physics

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.200
and Associate Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Studies

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.244
at my alma mater,
Santa Clara University.

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:21.660
And I'm excited
to welcome him now

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.650
for the Physics of Star Trek.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.586
Thank you, Dr. Kesten.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.610
PHIL KESTEN: Thank you.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.280
Well, this is the place that
we have to start, I think.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.580
This is one version.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.210
For those of you that
are somewhat Trek geeks,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.030
you'll know that this is
just one of the versions.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.400
The first one said where
no man has gone before.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.780
The network decided that was
inappropriate at some point.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
But really this sets the
tone for "Star Trek."

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.220
What we want to focus on
is where they wanted to go

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.340
or needed to go, how far away,
how fast they needed to go,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.320
because that demanded some
science and technology, shoot,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.420
that was unheard of when "Star
Trek" started in the mid '60s.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.380
And I don't know why
this says 2014 there.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.940
That's bad on my
part, because 2016

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.970
it's still weird and
strange and unbelievable.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.602
So where will we go today?

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.390
I'll spend just a
few minutes talking

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.970
about "Star Trek," although I
hope that you know what it is.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.950
Talk a little bit about the
technology and the science,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.140
the physics of "Star Trek."

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.870
I'll take a brief look around,
spend a little bit more

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.210
time on holodecks
and on warp drive

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.530
and then I'll offer
you some conclusions.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.080
But first of all, we
have to say, as you know,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.010
"Star Trek" is deeply
embedded in our culture.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.250
I think this picture sums it up.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.540
Here we see Einstein, Hawking,
Newton, and Data playing poker.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.638
It seems perfectly
natural, don't you think?

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.930
Deeply embedded in our culture?

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.180
Absolutely.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.670
How many of us have used
some, perhaps all, of these?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.510
He's dead Jim.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.240
You know, that's
one of my favorites.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.690
And, of course, I'm a
doctor, not a physicist.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.002
Well, I can't use that one.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.270
Let's take a look
at our old friends.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.470
These are all the publicity
shots from the series.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.070
Here they are from
the original series.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.080
Sadly, so many have left us now.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.650
"Star Trek," a real franchise.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.930
Yes.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.340
"The Next Generation,"
early into the '90s.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.670
"Deep Space Nine" came
along in the '90s.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.030
We had "Voyager."

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.050
And finally "Enterprise."

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.080
And lots of movies.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.180
In fact, the next
movie you probably

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.880
didn't know this--
I'm going to guess--

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.920
is coming out in two days.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.240
Yeah.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.410
And there's a new TV series that
will be coming out in January.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.840
You may not know this.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.140
This is not germane to the
physics of "Star Trek,"

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.460
but Paramount sold most of the
rights of "Star Trek" to CBS.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.730
And CBS is coming out with
a new TV show in January.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.731
But they're very clever.

00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:47.271
They're going to show you the
first one on public television,

00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:48.670
but all the rest
of the episodes,

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.500
you're going to have to
pay for CBS access to see.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.470
I'm going to pay.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.710
This is just an aside, but I
don't know what you guys think.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.020
I love the reboot.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.330
I love the JJ Abrams reboot.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.874
And to me, this
just says it all.

00:04:07.874 --> 00:04:08.540
I mean, come on.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.498
Look at these two guys.

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:11.610
They're the same person, right?

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.140
Old Kirk and new Kirk.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.399
Why are we so captivated
by "Star Trek"?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:25.380
Why were we so captivated
in the '60s by "Star Trek"?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.500
In answer, I offer
these two photographs.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.870
Where were they taken?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.730
California?

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.860
Asia?

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.430
Someplace we don't know?

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.680
Well, I know the
first one for sure.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.640
I took it.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.960
I took it in Colorado in
Rocky Mountain National

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.460
Park up at 12,000 feet.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.290
The second picture-- well,
I didn't take that one.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.900
That was taken by the
Opportunity Rover on Mars.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.534
Yeah?

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:00.950
When you think
about it, there are

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.500
places that are
things that are not

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.030
on this earth that
are like Earth,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.980
and I think that's
what captivates us.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.170
Hey, you know what?

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.240
On Mars, there was
once water flowing.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.780
On your left, a stream on Earth.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.570
On the right, what's
left of a stream on Mars.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.670
And you know what?

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.430
We find the same
kind of conglomerate,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.860
these little chunks
of pebbles rounded

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.570
by water flow stuck together.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.320
We find the same thing on
Mars that we find on Earth.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.810
Water once flowed on Mars.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.350
Oh, wait a second.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.930
Water still flows on Mars.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.510
This is a picture taken on the
rim of Hale Crater on Mars,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.160
and you notice these streaks
that are coming down--

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.460
these streaks.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.930
Well, you might say yeah, OK.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.330
I could believe that was water
flowing once upon a time,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.790
but these streaks change.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.820
In 2015, just last
year, NASA was

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.050
taking pictures of
this same region,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.380
and those streaks
change over time.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.720
The temperature
there is warm enough

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.700
that the frozen ice and
the permafrost melts.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.530
Sometimes explosions of steam
come up from the surface.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.500
Can you imagine that?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.050
And look at this picture.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.890
This is Mars at sunset.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.150
You could almost imagine
looking out toward the hills,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.240
toward the ocean, and seeing
this here in Silicon Valley.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.080
So I think this is
why we're captivated

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.950
by "Star Trek," because
we're tantalized by the fact

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.330
that there's a universe out
there which is something we

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.896
can almost put our fingers on.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.640
Now let's talk about the
science and technology.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.340
First of all, you must know
that the creators of "Star Trek"

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.470
were amazingly prescient.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.840
They got so many things right.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.840
Here is one of the things
that you may not know.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.150
I love this.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.545
One of my favorite episodes
of the original series,

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:26.930
"Yesterday and Tomorrow," they
come in contact with something

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.690
they called a black star.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.190
What was it?

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.850
It was a black hole.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.765
Now, shoot, if we
had a movie today

00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.640
and we talked about
black holes, which we do,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.010
nobody would say anything.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.780
The physicist who coined
the term black hole

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.650
did it two years after
that episode was made.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.560
These guys were
getting a lot right.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.110
And it's not an
exaggeration at all

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.620
to say that their vision of
the future, in many ways,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.919
drove the development of
science and technology

00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.710
that we have today.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.120
I'll show you some examples.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.220
Well, there's Uhura wearing
a Bluetooth headset.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.240
And you'll have to
use your imagination

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.200
in this big white area.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.350
"Star Trek" personnel looking
at a desktop computer.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.740
That image I got, it was
of one of the promo images

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.600
from the original pilot in
which Majel Barrett was playing

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.730
Number One, second in command,
and it was a very young Leonard

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.640
Nimoy.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.550
Flat panel monitors.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.686
We think nothing
of it these days.

00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:28.280
1960, oh my gosh.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:34.610
1965, 1966, TVs were
this big and this deep.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.549
And there's Captain Kirk
walking through a door that

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.959
opens automatically for him.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:40.500
I don't know if any
of you ever heard

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.700
him say this but
Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.040
when asked what he found
amazing about "Star Trek"

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.500
when he was a kid, he said
the thing that amazed him most

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.112
was the doors that opened
when you walked through them.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.965
Jim Kirk using a flip phone.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.580
Yeah.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.310
I mean, really what
was he thinking?

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.810
You know?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.210
And there's Riker
working on his tablet.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.770
I guess it probably-- here it
wouldn't be an iPad, would it?

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.355
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:18.021
PHIL KESTEN: No.

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:18.521
Ssh.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.350
That's the technology.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.590
What about the science?

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.630
Turns out, well, first
of all, clearly there's

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.210
lots of physics, lots of
science in "Star Trek."

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.670
We'll spend a
little time talking

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.810
about the different pieces.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.330
Is it right?

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:36.990
Is it wrong?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.000
Good or bad science?

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.680
For example, mirror universes.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.860
What do you think?

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.430
Is this a fanciful science
fiction or could there really

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.200
be mirror alternate universes?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.160
Turns out, in theory, OK.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
This is Brian Greene
talking here--

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.950
Brian Greene from Columbia,
who has become one of the-- I

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.460
think of as one of the
Carl Sagans of today, one

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.790
of the public faces of physics.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.970
And basically what
he says here is, hey,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.440
if the universe is
infinite, why wouldn't we

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.990
have an infinite number
of ways to combine

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.720
the infinite number of things
we have in this universe?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.790
So mirror universe
is allowed in theory.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.220
Oh, tractor beams.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.590
Oh, we've seen this a
million times in "Star Trek"

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:41.090
and also other science
fiction movies and such.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.550
You know, the ship needs to grab
a hold of something or somebody

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.080
or attack a ship, they
send up that tractor beam

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.130
and they grab hold.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.340
Oh, come on.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.510
That can't be right.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.460
I mean, how could you
possibly imagine doing that?

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.115
When I first started to talk
about the physics of "Star

00:10:56.115 --> 00:11:00.780
Trek," I said, come on.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.940
That's got to be
just science fiction.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.350
Turns out it's not.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.470
In fact, we are using
tractor beams today.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.970
OK.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.740
You're not going to go out and
grab a spaceship with a tractor

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.420
beam today, but with
the equivalent--

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.310
the optical equivalent,
of a tractor

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.600
beam, which folks call
either optical tweezers

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.400
or single-beam gradient traps,
by taking two or more laser

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.860
beams and focusing
them in a certain way,

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.310
you can grab hold of
an object-- an object

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:42.400
how big-- maybe on the size of
cells-- and move them around.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.830
People have also
learned how to do

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.370
this with focused sound waves.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.230
These are called
acoustic tweezers.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.720
So check this out.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.130
Here are five images of,
in this particular case,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.130
it's called a vesicle.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.750
It's a substructure
withinside an algae cell.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.770
Algae cells tend
to be pretty large.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.700
And these are five images taken
over the course of 260 seconds.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.479
If you look closely, you
can see that-- well, it's

00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:17.520
a little hard to see, but
there is some structure

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.370
in the cell that's not moving.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.054
The only thing that's
moving is this vesicle,

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.470
and it's because
it's been grabbed

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:31.240
by one of these optical
tweezers and moved around.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:40.970
People can do this with single
atoms all way up to nanotubes.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.310
There are some very cool
pictures out on the web.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.216
Unfortunately, I couldn't get
the permission to use them,

00:12:47.216 --> 00:12:49.090
so you'll have to go
search the web for them.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.940
AUDIENCE: There's this tool
called Google that you can use.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.700
PHIL KESTEN: Oh, cool.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.200
I've got to learn about that.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.700
Yeah.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.616
AUDIENCE: "Star Trek."

00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:59.190
PHIL KESTEN: Yeah.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.960
Worm holes.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.920
Real physics?

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.560
Goofy.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.060
Which?

00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:09.466
AUDIENCE: Well, there
are some special cases.

00:13:09.466 --> 00:13:10.590
PHIL KESTEN: Special cases?

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.340
So you're saying it's OK?

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.760
Maybe wormholes?

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.260
Yeah?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.500
Yeah.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.960
Turns out, in theory, there's
nothing wrong with wormholes.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.770
We don't know how
to make them yet.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.550
We haven't seen any yet.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.367
But the theory allows for them.

00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:27.950
What are they?

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.610
There kind of like short
cuts through space time.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:39.710
So I could get from here to
here without going through all

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.940
the stuff in between.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.240
This requires a
higher dimension.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:54.260
The way I like to think of it
is this-- the earth-- well,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.540
let me ask you.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.570
How many dimensions
do we live in?

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.326
How many dimensions is this?

00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:01.160
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.660
PHIL KESTEN: No,
you're all wrong.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.810
It's two.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.710
Come on.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.430
It's two.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.230
I mean, I rarely go up and down.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.690
I mean, once in a
while, but right?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:20.730
And so for example, if you want
to fly from here to Athens,

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.350
you get on your plane or
maybe you go up a little bit,

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:28.060
but basically you go
in a curved plane.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.082
Only when you realize that the
Earth is three dimensional do

00:14:31.082 --> 00:14:32.290
you think hey, you know what?

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.085
I could drill a tunnel
from here to Athens.

00:14:35.085 --> 00:14:38.070
It would be a lot
faster, a lot straighter,

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.190
but I need that higher
dimension to do that.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.260
And this is what
wormholes will allow

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.202
us to do if we can access
that higher dimension.

00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:50.580
We'll talk about the higher
dimensions in just a bit.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.904
So wormholes?

00:14:52.904 --> 00:14:53.403
OK.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.097
Time travel.

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.180
That's got to be science
fiction, don't you think?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.450
Anybody going with me on
the ride for time travel?

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.780
Can't possibly be
good science, right?

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.504
AUDIENCE: We can go forward.

00:15:09.504 --> 00:15:11.880
We are all time
traveling right now.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.850
PHIL KESTEN: Well, this in
fact is-- this is what I say.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.040
Only one speed.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.680
One second per second, right?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.900
That's it.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.390
AUDIENCE: With some variance.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.570
PHIL KESTEN: Well, yeah,
except here's the thing.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:37.850
And Einstein understood this
more than 100 years ago.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.370
Because the speed of light
is absolute-- by that I

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:48.010
mean if I run alongside
of a light beam,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.000
the light beam is still
moving at the speed

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.620
of light with respect to
me, even if I'm going fast.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.220
Because the speed of
light is absolute,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.900
clocks in relative
motion to each other

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.050
run at different rates.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.300
So if I've got a clock in
my hand and somebody else,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.710
oh, Captain Kirk is
on the Enterprise,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.142
and he zooms past
the Earth, I look up,

00:16:11.142 --> 00:16:16.730
I see his clock as running
slow compared to mine.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.790
So clocks in relative motion
run at different rates.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:29.700
So if we can build a
wormhole and have the two

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.890
ends of the wormhole
move at different rates,

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.277
time will run at different
rates at the two ends.

00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:39.110
And therefore by going
through the wormhole,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.710
you could travel to
a different time.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:49.040
I should say this
is not theoretical.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.890
We know this is true.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:17:00.930
Einstein's theory was proven
experimentally back in 1941.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.910
All of you use this
physics probably every day

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.410
of your lives, because
every one of you

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.000
has a smartphone
that has a GPS on it.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.720
True or false?

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.530
It's got to be true, right?

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.920
So we're all used to this now.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.829
I used to be great at
remembering maps and things.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.000
Now, if I don't have my
phone in front of me,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.480
I don't know how to get home.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.000
We all use this.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.720
Well that GPS system
would crash and burn

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.440
without making corrections
for relativistic effects,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.430
because all of the clocks
and all of the GPS satellites

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.970
are moving relative to us.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.250
So how do we make
this time machine?

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.430
I've just drawn here
two places in space.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.960
It makes it seem like space
has somehow been folded,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.500
but that's just for the picture.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.570
It could be a flat space,
but I've made a wormhole,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.710
and I'm making the two
ends of the wormhole move

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.650
relative to each other.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.290
And that means,
as I say, time is

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.102
running at different
rates between the two ends

00:18:03.102 --> 00:18:05.560
and therefore if you go in one
side and come out the other,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.520
you come out at
a different time.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.050
This was first
described by Kip Thorne.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.590
Some of you may know his name.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:19.900
He was the science guy
behind Interstellar, Caltech

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.440
physicist.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.360
So time machine?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.340
Could be.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:33.140
Ah, now here's a favorite bit of
physics-- the inertial dampers.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.160
I mean, look.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.070
Time machines and wormholes,
that's like crazy stuff,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.680
but inertial
dampers, all they do

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.180
is make sure that
you don't like get

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.260
smacked against the wall
when you take a hard turn.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.930
Here you could see they're
banking into the turn here.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.810
Surely we must be able
to make inertial dampers.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.910
What do you think?

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.842
AUDIENCE: Inertia is
a property of matter.

00:18:55.842 --> 00:18:56.800
PHIL KESTEN: You think?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.680
So you're saying no,
it's not possible?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.760
This guy's on top of it,
because you know what?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.950
You can't make inertial dampers.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.330
There are certain laws of
physics you can't beat.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.330
Here's what Newton said.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.220
You might remember this
if you've taken physics

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.780
in high school or college.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.070
Newton said that that
force and acceleration

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.406
are related to each other.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.350
What kind of acceleration
do we typically experience?

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.420
On the surface of the Earth,
we call that acceleration 1

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.680
G. Doesn't really
matter what it is--

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.410
9.8 meters per second
squared, but it's

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.740
1 G. Stand, sit in
Earth's gravity,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.670
and that's what you're feeling.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:38.920
If you're on an
airplane taking off,

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.780
you might experience
perhaps 0.2 G,

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.240
although it's in the horizontal
direction and not the vertical.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.600
The guys who are taking off in
things like the space shuttle,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:55.150
they might experience 3 G.
The largest acceleration ever

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:01.420
experienced by a human
being who lived was 46 G.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.550
Again, I encourage you
to use that Google thing

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.596
and look up the video of this
guy in that first test of 46

00:20:11.596 --> 00:20:12.865
G. Unbelievable.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.110
He lived, but he was really
not a very happy guy.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.820
But you know what?

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.420
If you're going to do
anything on a starship,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.150
you're going to experience
way more than 46 G,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.700
and there's nothing that
you can do to stop it.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.310
That's just the universe.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.703
Is that a question or let's go.

00:20:39.703 --> 00:20:41.328
AUDIENCE: What if
you could stop matter

00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:42.859
from interacting
with Higgs field?

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:44.900
PHIL KESTEN: What if you
could stop matter from--

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.060
AUDIENCE: Interacting
with the Higgs field?

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.020
PHIL KESTEN: Yikes.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:48.520
OK.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.830
But I would say you can't.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.730
In "Star Trek" science
fiction you might,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.450
but not in the real world.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.900
And that's the thing,
and I've got to tell you.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.810
So I teach this physics,
and a lot of it's fun.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.920
But I always say if
it's not real physics,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.135
it's just somebody's goofy idea.

00:21:12.135 --> 00:21:15.020
You've got to stick
with the universe,

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.940
and the universe
is just not going

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.770
to let you get away from this.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.566
So if you're going to do any
kind of big accelerations,

00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:22.774
you're going to be a pancake.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.180
I have to show you
this little slide,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.470
because this talk is about all
sorts of fantasmic science,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.354
which is real.

00:21:32.354 --> 00:21:34.270
So we have to at least
keep ourselves grounded

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.120
and look at one piece of "Star
Trek" physics which can't work.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.440
All right.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:40.940
Holodecks.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.620
Holodecks were invented for the
second round of "Star Trek."

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.750
They didn't have
them originally,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.960
but the creators of
"Star Trek" needed

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.917
more potential storylines.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.090
So what was the holodeck?

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.380
The holodeck was a room.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.210
It looks like this
when you don't

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.470
have any programs running.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.470
It's just an empty
place, but what can

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.750
you do with the holo emitters?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.610
You can project whatever scene
you want and not just visually,

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.850
but you can interact with it.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:24.240
So if you project a
chair, you can sit in it.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.996
If you project someone with
a sword, you can fight him.

00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:31.120
Of course, you have to make
sure the interlocks are

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.170
on so that you can't
actually be hurt.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.157
Another great set
of story lines.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.810
Can we make a holodeck?

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.340
Could we even imagine it?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.420
Oh, yes.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.640
Holograms, yes, no problem.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.180
We've been making and
displaying holograms now

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.475
for almost 60 years.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.630
What is a hologram?

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.580
A hologram is a recording
of the light waves

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.440
which bounce off an object.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.820
You're seeing me right
now because there

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.950
are light waves bouncing off
of me and going to your eyes.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.660
Now, these are
waves, and that means

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.950
that if you hold your
hand up like this

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.640
and you move it around while
you're looking through a window

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.070
you get different views.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.880
If you move your
head back and forth,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.060
you see different alignments,
things front and back,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.484
in front of and
behind each other.

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:40.150
And that's what you
get with a hologram,

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.030
because it's recording not
the light intensity like you

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.550
get with a photograph but
the light waves themselves.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.020
Now, if you want to make a
full what's called transmission

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.080
hologram, you not only
need a laser to make it,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.470
but you need a laser to
reconstruct it, to display it.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:06.580
So here is an image-- this
is from a museum in France--

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:12.380
of someone holding a
transmission hologram which

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.923
has been imprinted
on this cylinder,

00:24:13.923 --> 00:24:18.810
this transparent cylinder,
being reconstructed with a laser

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.580
beam.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.400
And you hold that in your
hand, then you move around,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.290
you see this woman.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:30.320
You see behind her, you see
her in different perspective,

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.640
because what you're doing is
reconstructing the light waves

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.226
that were originally recorded.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.710
Not a whole lot of us
have a laser around

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.710
to reconstruct a hologram.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.990
Not only that,
but you have to be

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.280
in a very specific position
with respect to the laser

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.410
and the hologram to see it.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.020
Well, that doesn't work well
for the kind of applications

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.550
we typically want to have.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.830
So people usually make what's
called a reflection hologram.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.891
That kind of hologram can be
reconstructed with white light.

00:25:10.891 --> 00:25:14.440
It just doesn't give you
a very big depth of field.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.290
Some of you may have
a reflection hologram

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.630
like say on your credit card.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.930
You may have seen-- they're
shiny little things,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.990
and if you tilt your card,
you can see just a little bit

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.200
of perspective.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.040
So easy to reconstruct,
but you're not

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.977
going to believe that this
is a real world, right?

00:25:34.977 --> 00:25:36.685
It's not going to look
like the holodeck.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.340
But at least we
can make holograms.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:51.790
But, OK, let's say we could
make a great hologram,

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.926
how do you make a
hologram have substance?

00:25:53.926 --> 00:25:56.050
AUDIENCE: How do you do it
without killing everyone

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.280
in the hologram?

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.780
PHIL KESTEN: Oh, you don't have
to use a high-powered laser.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.852
You don't have to use
a high-wattage laser.

00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:03.352
Yeah.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.058
And you spread the light out.

00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:13.300
But even if we
could-- like I say,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.860
even if we could conquer
this problem of being

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.290
able to reproduce
a very large scene

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.910
and being able to see
it from different angles

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.370
so that you could
actually be in a room

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.450
and see the whole world around
you projected from a hologram,

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.409
how could we possibly give
it-- that can't be, right?

00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:34.867
I mean, holograms,
it's just light.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.366
Turns out, you can give
holograms substance.

00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:46.865
A lot of people are
working on this.

00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:48.575
The people, probably
the most advanced,

00:26:48.575 --> 00:26:51.215
is this group in Japan.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.300
They are working
on something called

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:02.070
a Visuo-Tactile Projector
to project a hologram.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:06.200
And then they used
focused ultrasound waves

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.230
to give tactile response.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:18.130
So you can project
holograms of raindrops

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.000
and stick your hand
underneath and feel

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.870
them hitting your palm.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:28.750
You can play a
holographic piano.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.030
It's a projection of a keyboard.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.890
There's no substance
there, but you

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.890
can feel it and play the keys.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.030
And now here is our true
test of Google technology.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.071
Can I show you this video?

00:27:42.071 --> 00:27:42.820
What do you think?

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.653
Is it going to work?

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.300
Oh, it could work.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.849
This is from this
group in Japan.

00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:55.640
The first part's
uninteresting, but it just

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.970
shows you their setup.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:12.630
And here is a holographic
gecko, and this guy

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.810
can feel it on his arm.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.920
But this is the best part.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.400
This is a holographic
gecko that's

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.719
running through
a dish of liquid.

00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:20.260
Look at this.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.900
Watch this.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.730
Oh, my gosh.

00:28:29.481 --> 00:28:30.272
Is that incredible?

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.580
So holodecks may
be in our future.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.410
But let's face it, all that
other stuff is just for fun.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.900
What's the real deal?

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.280
Warp drive.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.570
Right?

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.720
Why warp drive?

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.550
Because warp drive
is what lets us get

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.380
someplace far away in a
reasonable amount of time.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:07.690
And shoot, if we can't do that,
all the rest of "Star Trek"

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.476
falls apart.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:17.300
Now you may, if you're not
familiar with this physics--

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.320
the "Star Trek" physics--
you may at some point

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.790
have asked yourself-- if you
know about relativity-- you

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:28.030
say, well, I know I can't go
faster than the speed of light.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.426
Einstein said that.

00:29:30.426 --> 00:29:34.740
So what could possibly
get me someplace far away

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.680
in a short period of time?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.240
What could possibly let me go
faster than the speed of light?

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.130
And this is a spoiler alert.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.570
Nothing.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.580
You can't go faster
than the speed of light.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.470
But we want to go visit Spock.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.440
He's on Vulcan.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.120
Vulcan is very far away--
16 and 1/2 light years.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.340
That's around 100,000
billion miles.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:15.300
Vulcan is a fictitious planet,
although it orbits a real star.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.100
That star is 40 Eridani A.
It was discovered by William

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.160
Herschel in the late 1700s.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.520
Gene Roddenberry endorsed it
as the home star of Vulcan

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.050
in the early '90s.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:35.730
It takes a long time for a light
to get from Earth to Vulcan.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.160
So it would take us
a really long time.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.770
Although I do have
to ask the question,

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.070
is Vulcan near or far?

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.600
And I have to say,
you know what?

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:50.100
Vulcan actually is pretty near
us on the scale of things.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.660
You look up in the sky in the
winter, and you see Orion.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.890
Many of you, I'm
sure, have seen Orion

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:05.384
in the sky-- his famous belt
and his dagger, shooting a bow.

00:31:05.384 --> 00:31:10.170
If you're on Vulcan, you
could look up into the sky

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:15.660
and see Orion, the
exact same Orion.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.340
The stars look the
same in the Vulcan sky.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.590
So Vulcan isn't that far away.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.910
It's kind of near.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.180
Oh well, it is far,
because you know what?

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.700
The fastest humans
have been able to go

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.880
is about 37,000 miles an hour.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.100
That's Voyager 1.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.970
We launched Voyager
1 in the late '70s.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.020
It's now 12 billion
miles or so from Earth.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.749
So in those many years, it's
gone that-- yeah, go ahead.

00:31:46.749 --> 00:31:48.540
AUDIENCE: Isn't Voyager
still accelerating?

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.940
I thought it had a
low power-- Isn't

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.380
Voyager still accelerating?

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.780
I thought it had a low
powered ion drive [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.900
PHIL KESTEN: No.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.911
It has no real source of power.

00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:02.410
Yeah.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.030
It is still broadcasting though.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.440
It gets a little bit
of light from the sun,

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.830
but it's distance-- so
that number is in miles.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.050
The way I think
of it is in what's

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.110
called astronomical units.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.750
One astronomical
unit is Earth to Sun.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.540
Voyager is 134 times
farther from the Sun

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.820
than Earth is right now.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.950
So it's outside the limits
of the solar system,

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:32.040
and it's taken since
1977 to get that far.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:40.440
At that speed, it would take
300,000 years to get to Vulcan.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.665
Kind of bad if we want
to go visit Spock.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.790
We need a warp drive,
but what are the rules?

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.980
The rules are this-- you cannot
exceed the speed of light,

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.950
even on Star Trek.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.926
You just can't.

00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:57.550
You actually don't even want to
go close to the speed of light,

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:03.240
because if you did it,
your clock would not

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:08.390
run at the same rate at
the clocks back home.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:15.390
You go to Vulcan, you come
back, everybody you know dead.

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.920
Dust.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.220
That's how much of a
difference the time would be.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.600
Well, that's really not a
very good way to do things.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.490
Certainly not for a
"Star Trek" episode.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.580
Here's what you have to do.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.350
You have to bend a space, or to
use the "Star Trek" language,

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.940
you have to warp space.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.250
Here's the way I
like to imagine it.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.920
Imagine, you know those
balloons that the clowns make

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.501
like animals out of?

00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:44.000
Right?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.480
And if you squeeze the
balloon, imagine that space

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.947
is like one of these balloons.

00:33:50.947 --> 00:33:52.530
And here's Earth
where we're starting.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.530
That's our ship.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.860
We want to go to Vulcan.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.430
We squeeze the balloon,
it pushes the balloon out

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.680
behind us, squeezes it
in front of us and hey,

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.276
suddenly Vulcan is closer
and Earth is farther away.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.170
If you want to
achieve warp travel,

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.330
you have to squeeze
space in front of you,

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.060
stretch it out behind you.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.420
So here's a ship.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.719
Look at space in front of it.

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.010
It's all nice and
evenly spaced, but if we

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:26.830
can squeeze the space in front
and stretch it out behind,

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:31.489
maybe do it even
more aggressively,

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:35.726
suddenly we are
where we want to be.

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:38.032
You don't have to
go fast to do it.

00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:39.365
Shoot, you could walk to Vulcan.

00:34:43.092 --> 00:34:45.590
So you don't go faster,
you just get closer.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.530
This is the trick of warp drive.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.331
Does not involve
the speed of light.

00:34:54.037 --> 00:34:55.980
Oh, but really, come on.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.950
Can you really bend space?

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.829
We would certainly need
a fourth dimension,

00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:04.620
because if we have
three-dimensional space,

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.786
and you want to bend it,
you need a fourth dimension

00:35:06.786 --> 00:35:09.090
to bend it into.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.260
Is that possible?

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.590
How would we even know
if it were possible?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.540
Look around the world.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.793
I don't see four dimensions.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.372
I do see four dimensions.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.820
Here's how I know.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.950
I look for light rays
that are cheating.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:36.120
See, light rays
have to go straight.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.350
If you find a light ray
that's not going straight,

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.212
it knew something about
the fourth dimension

00:35:41.212 --> 00:35:42.170
that we might not know.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.780
Einstein actually
proposed this just

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:52.080
after the turn of the
century-- the last century.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:03.600
He said massive objects
must bend space time.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.520
To do that, there has
to be a fourth dimension

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.760
to bend space time into.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.630
Here's how we would
see it, he says.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.830
Imagine a big massive object
that could bend space time

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.650
and far, far beyond it is
an object, say, a star.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.580
We can't see the star because
the light from the star

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.616
gets blocked by this big object.

00:36:22.616 --> 00:36:25.240
Of course, light from the stars
is going out in all directions,

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.580
including this direction.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.610
But light from this direction,
if it gets caught up

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.820
by the bending of space, might
end up coming back toward Earth

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.000
anyway.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.150
Now, we don't know that.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.960
We just look out and see
light coming toward us.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.010
So we say, well, where is
that light coming from?

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.350
We trace a straight
line back, and we

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.437
say the star is out here.

00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:47.020
Except some of the
light from the star

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.420
could have come in another
direction and bent back to us.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.440
Gosh, we see two or three
or four or multiple images.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.090
This is what Einstein proposed.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.790
It was experimentally
verified in 1919

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:05.000
by looking at stars close to the
sun during a solar eclipse when

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.520
you could see those stars
that were so close to the sun

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.260
and you could see that
their path was being bent

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.616
by the curvature of space.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.810
They're called either Einstein
Rings or Einstein Crosses.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.010
Here's an example of
an Einstein Cross.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:27.550
These four objects
are the same star.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.516
That star is directly
behind this massive quasar.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:36.316
Yeah.

00:37:36.316 --> 00:37:38.196
AUDIENCE: Why are
there only four?

00:37:38.196 --> 00:37:39.320
PHIL KESTEN: Who said that?

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320
Why are there only four?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.890
Well, let me show
you this picture.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:43.181
Then I'll answer your question.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:52.450
This is also one star
directly behind that guy.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.430
So now you might say, well, why
are there an infinite number?

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.940
And the answer is,
it's just geometry.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.120
The two things are
not exactly lined up,

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.960
and depending on quite
how the alignment is

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.460
determines where exactly
you get the images.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.750
If it's like perfect alignment,
you get a beautiful circle.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.280
If it's close, you get an
almost beautiful circle.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.920
And if it's off
a little bit, you

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.526
get dots-- sometimes
two, three, mostly four.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.190
So what do these Einstein Rings
and Einstein Crosses tell us?

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:31.370
They tell us that space can be
warped into four dimensions.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.240
Can we make warp drive?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:47.470
Well, the first paper on warp
drive was published in 1994.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.010
Miguel Alcubierre.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:54.540
He's a physicist at the
University of Mexico.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:59.300
He published this first paper
in "The Classical and Quantum

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:04.540
Gravity Journal" which, if you
go pick up a copy sometime,

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.130
like for me anyway,
I look at it.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.360
I can understand the titles
typically of the papers.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.180
That's it.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.190
This is part of the abstract.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.310
I reproduced it because
in his abstract,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.300
he uses this phrase-- warp
drive of science fiction.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.430
And this is the best part.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.470
When he was interviewed
a few years later

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:28.430
and asked why he originally
thought about investigating

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.120
this, he said I was
watching "Star Trek,"

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.660
and I thought there must
be a way to do this right.

00:39:37.996 --> 00:39:39.370
A lot of papers
have been written

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.390
on the subject since then.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.986
There are physicists who
call warp drive Alcubierre

00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:46.020
drive because of his work.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.620
The invention of warp drive.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.760
On the left, Zefram Cochrane
demonstrated warp drive

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.080
in April of 2063.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.908
I'm sure many of you
saw the documentary.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.700
"Star Trek, First Contact."

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.130
And on the right, there he is.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.200
That's Miguel Alcubierre.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.320
Now, can we do it?

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.600
First of all, it takes a
heck of a lot of power.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.050
So much power that the only
way to generate that much power

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:44.750
is through
matter-antimatter reactions.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:52.440
Now, we do make antimatter right
up the street at the Stanford

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.670
Linear Accelerator.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.570
Not only do we make it,
but it's being made for us.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:03.950
There's some antimatter
in you right now,

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:10.040
particularly if you eat
salt or oranges or bananas.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.050
All those have a
lot of potassium.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.450
Salt substitute,
lots of potassium.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.570
About one in every
10,000 potassium atoms

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:23.260
is radioactive potassium 40.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.580
About once every
10,000 times that

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:33.220
radioactive potassium decays, it
creates an antimatter electron.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.190
So for example, the
potassium in a banana,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.560
you get maybe one antimatter
electron every couple hours.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.220
The potassium that
you have in your body,

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.260
it's probably about
200 grams, you

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.370
get maybe 100 antimatter
electrons an hour

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.750
being made in your body.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.180
And as you know from watching
"Star Trek," as Scotty

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.750
was always freaking out about
the matter-antimatter engines

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:02.340
overloading, you know,
and those antimatter

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.170
electrons being
created in your body,

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.940
as soon as they
encounter an electron,

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.880
they annihilate-- explosion.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.440
Well, tiny little explosions.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.060
So nothing to worry about.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.560
OK.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.030
So we do make antimatter.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:19.160
At SLAC they make it about 0.1
trillion antimatter electrons

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:19.670
per year.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.670
Sounds like a lot.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.630
Well, if you consider
the fact that it

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.530
takes 3 trillion electron
antimatter electron

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:31.150
collisions just to
light a flashlight,

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.430
probably we don't have
enough antimatter just yet

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.390
to make warp drive.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.510
So it's possible in theory.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.310
You squeeze space in front of
you, stretch it out behind you.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:51.560
You don't have to go fast,
but you end up far away.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.070
You can go someplace far away.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.041
Takes a lot of power.

00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:00.667
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:43:00.667 --> 00:43:01.500
PHIL KESTEN: Please.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.166
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you're not moving,

00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:05.802
is the inertia an issue?

00:43:05.802 --> 00:43:08.374
The lack of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:08.374 --> 00:43:09.040
PHIL KESTEN: Oh.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:17.720
Under warp drive, you
could be going very slowly.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.650
Now, if you've been
attacked by the Romulans,

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.510
and you're making a hard
bank to get away from them,

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.410
then you're getting
squished like a pancake.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.850
But you're right.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.230
If you're not accelerating
rapidly, then yeah,

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:35.688
you don't have to
worry about that.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:43.840
So my summary, the
physics of "Star Trek."

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.810
Mirror universes?

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.360
Hey, maybe.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.120
Tractor beams?

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.050
We're already doing it.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.710
Wormholes?

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.090
Theoretically possible.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:51.820
Time travel?

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.740
Theoretically possible.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.080
Inertial dampers?

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.850
Seems like the
simplest piece of this.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.210
No.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.700
Holodecks?

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.410
Sort of.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.950
Warp drive?

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.610
In theory.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.152
I think this is a great start--
great start to the future--

00:44:08.152 --> 00:44:09.235
and I leave you with this.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.300
Dif-tor heh smusma!

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.770
Live long and prosper.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.780
And if you take only one
thing away from this talk,

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.350
take away that last line,
because there in fact

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:30.715
is a proper response to
live long and prosper.

00:44:30.715 --> 00:44:34.500
It is peace and long life.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.982
Thanks very much.

00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:41.688
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.850
AUDIENCE: A couple decades
ago, Lawrence Krauss

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:50.540
had a similarly titled
book where you sort of

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.790
inspire-- it was using the same
title-- The Physics of Star

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.776
Trek.

00:44:54.776 --> 00:44:56.900
PHIL KESTEN: I teach a
course at Santa Clara called

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.920
The Physics of Star
Trek, and his book is

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.040
the required text for my class.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.634
If you have not looked--
you read the book?

00:45:04.634 --> 00:45:06.050
AUDIENCE: I've
looked at it, yeah.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.460
PHIL KESTEN: If you
have not read this book,

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.460
you have to go buy it.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.780
First of all, it's small.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.440
And it's like this thick
and every page is fun.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.720
So you have to buy this book.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.480
It's fantastic.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.990
AUDIENCE: Subspace
communication is

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.380
similar problem to warp drive,
and is that possibly an easier

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.570
problem?

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:28.430
PHIL KESTEN: So I'm fascinated
by the idea of subspace.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.400
You would think that
subspace is, again,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.630
just a sort of a staple
of science fiction.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:38.790
But I think of subspace this
way-- this is my own idea.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.050
I haven't read this anywhere.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.640
But if we consider space
to be four dimensional,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640
we live in a
three-dimensional space,

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.720
so we clearly are living in
a three-dimensional slice

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.520
of four-space.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.940
But there are other
three-dimensional slices

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.990
besides ours if there
are four dimensions.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.700
And so one could
imagine that we could

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.510
use one of those other
three-dimensional slices

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.660
for, say,
communication subspace.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.770
So actually I think that
subspace communication is not

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.370
out of the question.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.290
Yeah.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.910
AUDIENCE: So what
about those food

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.550
replicators in "Star Trek"?

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.300
PHIL KESTEN: Yeah.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.560
AUDIENCE: You know,
tea, Earl Grey, hot.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.910
PHIL KESTEN: So I did not
talk about replica-- well,

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.260
replicators are really a low-res
form of transporter beams.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.654
And I chose not to
address them, but let

00:46:33.654 --> 00:46:34.820
me just say a couple things.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.030
First of all, physicists have
been operating transporter

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:42.200
beams since the late 1990s.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.440
Not quite the "Star
Trek" transporter beams,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.080
but transporter
beams nevertheless.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.810
However, if you sit
down and ask yourself

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.960
how much data is required
to record and move-- well,

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.220
certainly if you want to
get in the transporter beam

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.050
and I'll pop out in Paris
for lunch kind of thing,

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.390
the amount of data
required for a person

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:12.720
would require-- if you stored
all that data on stick drives--

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.410
and by the way, you know you can
get like a terabyte stick drive

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.690
now, right?

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.630
It would take covering the
entire surface of the earth,

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.970
water and land, 4 meters
deep in terabyte stick drives

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.960
to record one person.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.460
So how much data would you
need to do your Earl Grey tea?

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.700
Not that much, but still a lot.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.069
It's a hard problem from
the data perspective.

00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:38.610
AUDIENCE: So what you're saying
is we need better compression

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:39.109
algorithms.

00:47:41.427 --> 00:47:43.010
PHIL KESTEN: Yeah,
I don't-- well, OK.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.700
You might do that
for Earl Grey tea.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.726
I don't think I want you
to compress me though.

00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:50.225
I don't want any
loss of resolution.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:58.785
AUDIENCE: So I think
Dr. Harold White at NASA

00:47:58.785 --> 00:48:04.109
is working on trying to
use energy to bend space.

00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:06.650
Are you at all familiar with
the experiments that he's doing?

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.900
PHIL KESTEN: I am not.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.810
PHIL KESTEN: But I guess sort of
taking it on face value, energy

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.640
and mass are the same.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.220
As Einstein told us,
E equals mc squared.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.560
So I have no problem
imagining that you

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.490
could use energy in the same
way as mass to curve space.

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.600
And additionally, so a
problem with space travel

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.470
today is that planets
travel at different speeds.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.380
So even if you can get there,
like with the Pluto fly-by

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.710
that we did last year,
even if you can get there,

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.260
you have to slow down
after you get there.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.580
Is that still a problem
with warp drive?

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.790
PHIL KESTEN: No.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:47.920
No, it's not.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.880
Because, again, in warp drive,
you are not really moving.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.190
You don't have to move at
all if you didn't want to,

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:59.330
because you're squeezing space
as opposed to traveling fast.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.930
PHIL KESTEN: So acceleration
is not required for warp drive.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was speaking more

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.270
about the difference in velocity
between different planets,

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.360
which I imagine between
different star systems

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.410
would be greater.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.700
PHIL KESTEN: Yeah, and
drop it out of warp

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:19.780
has always been something that
they kind of hand-wave around.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.570
I would say sort of
on the surface, no.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.240
Since you're not
accelerating, you

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.280
can just drop out and
match whatever speed you

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.439
want to match, the
planet or whatever.

00:49:29.439 --> 00:49:29.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.070
AUDIENCE: How fast
could you bend space?

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.736
Seems like if you
couldn't bend it fast,

00:49:37.736 --> 00:49:39.871
it's not a real useful idea.

00:49:39.871 --> 00:49:41.370
PHIL KESTEN: Bend
it a lot you mean?

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:41.911
AUDIENCE: No.

00:49:41.911 --> 00:49:43.065
How fast could you bend it?

00:49:43.065 --> 00:49:45.496
PHIL KESTEN: Oh, how
long does it take?

00:49:45.496 --> 00:49:47.120
AUDIENCE: So you were
saying, oh, look.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.911
I could bend space.

00:49:47.911 --> 00:49:50.020
I can make these two
things appear closer,

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.400
but how fast could you do it?

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.290
PHIL KESTEN: Oh.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:59.920
Well, if you look at
the Alcubierre's paper,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.800
so what he's talking
about, and this

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.320
is what people think is the
right approach for warp drive,

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.270
is to bend space only within a
local bubble around your ship

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.670
or whatever you want to call it.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.450
So you're not bending space all
the way from here to Vulcan,

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.880
you're just bending
space locally

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.430
around you, which is
a very fast process,

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.330
assuming you have
the energy to do it.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.640
And it takes some funky
energy, I have to say.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.650
It's not just a lot
of energy, it also

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.160
takes negative energy,
which is kind of funky.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.480
But physicists have
created negative energy.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.650
So we know that that's possible.

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.610
Again, not on the scale that
you need for warp drive,

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.179
but we have done it.

00:50:47.179 --> 00:50:49.470
But, yeah, you don't have to
do it over long distances,

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:54.890
so it's not a
time-consuming process.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.097
OK?

00:50:56.097 --> 00:50:57.680
AUDIENCE: Can you
speculate what could

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.850
be the physics of alternating
the frequency of the shield

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.730
to Borg attacks?

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.600
PHIL KESTEN: Oh, shields?

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:13.260
Well, energy can be focused.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.230
I mean, we do this.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.360
I showed you the optical
tweezers, for example.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.439
So you could imagine
focusing some form of energy.

00:51:20.439 --> 00:51:21.980
After all, acoustic
waves are energy,

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:26.020
although they don't travel
through space, but light.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.590
I think the kind
of shields that we

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.500
see in "Star Trek," the
thing that surrounds

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.980
the ship, probably unlikely.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.970
But a defense shield where
you focus energy on something

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.510
that's coming towards you,
that's not at all unreasonable.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.240
And the amount of
energy that you need

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.300
is actually well within
the range of something

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.784
we could even do today.

00:51:48.784 --> 00:51:52.560
AUDIENCE: Those who do Star
Wars models shoot lasers at it.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.780
Not "Star Wars" the movie,
Star Wars the-- yeah, right.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.280
Yeah.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.160
We talk a lot about
that Star Wars model.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.870
Interesting physics.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.395
Very, very difficult
to make real, but yeah.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.244
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:08.244 --> 00:52:09.160
Thank you, Dr. Kesten.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.060
PHIL KESTEN: Yeah.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.110
