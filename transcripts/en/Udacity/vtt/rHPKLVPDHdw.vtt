00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To answer this question, let's look at the scatter plot--you see there're certain sizes of people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then there are certain weights associated with these people, and it's hard to make out

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but I think there's a dependance whereby the taller a person is the heavier the person is.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, there's lots of exceptions--this person is a remarkably heavy person for size,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
this is a remarkably light person for about the same size, and we all know that some people are

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
heavier and thinner and thicker for these sizes, but if you'll expectively, you can see a slight

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
upper trend that appears to be approximately linear.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can't tell this right now--we don't understand how to analyze

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
where the data depends as a linear but you get the juice of it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
By looking at the data alone, you can tell that weight increases with size.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So for now, I'll check the second box over here because the other ones are obviously incorrect.
