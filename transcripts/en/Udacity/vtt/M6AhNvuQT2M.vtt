00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.290
So from a dominant pedigree's perspective, we

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.820
find that affected parents have affected children,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.500
and the trait does not skip generations. If we look at the pedigree over here,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.080
we know that unaffected parents don't have

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.390
affected children. Notice that there's no scenario over

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.700
here, where a child has unaffected parents,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.800
instead. Every child that's affected has affected parents.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.290
And as far as skipping generations go. I mean, you can

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.220
see on both sides of the pedigree, of the family tree

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.000
here, that we have affected

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.080
great grandparents, affected grandparents, affected parents,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.080
and then affected children. So the trait does not skip generations.
