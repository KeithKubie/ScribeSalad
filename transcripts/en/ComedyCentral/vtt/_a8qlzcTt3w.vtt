&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.708
BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, I
WAS GRILLING OHIO CONGRESSWOMAN

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.079
MARSHA FUDGE, WHICH IF YOU ADD
MARSHMALLOW AND GRAHAM CRACKERS

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:22.155
WOULD MAKE A CONGRESSIONAL
S'MORE.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:27.127
WOULD MAKE A CONGRESSIONAL
S'MORE.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.797
&gt;&gt; MUSIC TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.235
BE A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE
MUSICIANS COME TOGETHER.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.771
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT FAIR TO SAY
YOU WANT TO ROCK US OUT WITH OUR

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.373
CAUCUS OUT?

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.708
&gt;&gt; YES

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:42.943

WILLING TO SAY THAT?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.945
&gt;&gt; UH, ROCK US OUT WITH OUR
CAUCUS OUT

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:49.950

LOT OF AFFECTION FOR YOU RIGHT

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.519
NOW FOR REASONS I CAN'T EXPLAIN

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.121
(APPLAUSE)
DO YOU HAVE A PAC?

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.022
&gt;&gt; I DO.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.858
AND IS IT CALLED FUDGE PAC?

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.626
IT IS NOT?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.594
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.628
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THINK IT'D BE A
GOOD NAME, THOUGH?

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:02.763
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.834
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EVERYONE WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE A BUMPER STICKER

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.070
SAYING "I AM A FUDGE PACKER."

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.838
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.239
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:12.873
&gt;&gt; I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
