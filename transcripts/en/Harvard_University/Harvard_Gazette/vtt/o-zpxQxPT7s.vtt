00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.919
I think it's still hitting me, the fact that
I was able to be at the Olympics with almost

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.109
every country on Earth represented in some
way or another, in some sport, all staying

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.109
in one village.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:38.440
It's amazing to be able to meet all these
people and to experience all these different

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.230
cultures.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.910
Fencing is a game of physical chess.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.160
You have to be able to out-move your opponent
on the strip with speed, agility, and endurance.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.860
But you also have to be able to outsmart them,
to trick them.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.970
Being able to make split-second decision off
of little, tiny pieces of information in the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.460
sport, that also helps in real life.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.379
Our best ability as fencers is our ability
to compartmentalize all the stuff we're doing

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.379
in our life.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.290
To wake up in the morning, go to classes,
do work, come straight to practice.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.000
To lift for a few hours, to work as a team,
cool down, we have a team dinner.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
And then go straight to the library or straight
to your room to do homework or study for tests

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.789
or writing essays, it all helps us improve
our academic as well as our athletic performance.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.600
The fact that I took a year off from school
and trained full-time, I believed that if

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.829
I put in all the time and effort, I would
make it to the next level to the Olympic level.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.600
That definitely gave me the confidence to
believe that, now I'm back at school, if I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.740
work hard enough in school, I can reach certain
academic levels.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.159
I'm hoping that the rest of my time here can
help prepare me physically as well as mentally.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.700
I'm just excited for another few years here
to grow as an athlete and as a person before

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.200
I start my journey to the next Olympics.
