there was things up so he was a budget

00:49:43.449 --> 00:49:43.459
there was things up so he was a budget
 

00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:45.819
there was things up so he was a budget
that was agreed to but I think people

00:49:47.889 --> 00:49:47.899
did not spend their budgets the money
 

00:49:47.899 --> 00:49:49.569
did not spend their budgets the money
went into a central envelope we had an

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:49.579
went into a central envelope we had an
 

00:49:49.579 --> 00:49:52.329
went into a central envelope we had an
open competition that we were able to

00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:52.339
open competition that we were able to
 

00:49:52.339 --> 00:49:54.729

committee with the community university
 

00:49:58.519 --> 00:50:01.239
committee with the community university
committee and so when someone comes up

00:50:01.239 --> 00:50:01.249
committee and so when someone comes up
 

00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:03.399
committee and so when someone comes up
there's I have a great idea fun me and

00:50:03.399 --> 00:50:03.409
there's I have a great idea fun me and
 

00:50:03.409 --> 00:50:04.989

here does the University for his new

00:50:04.989 --> 00:50:04.999

yarn thinking about losses for right you

00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599
yarn thinking about losses for right you
 

00:50:08.599 --> 00:50:11.169
yarn thinking about losses for right you
won't get funded very less like right

00:50:11.169 --> 00:50:11.179
won't get funded very less like right
 

00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:13.299
won't get funded very less like right
and so that's that flexibility that

00:50:13.299 --> 00:50:13.309
and so that's that flexibility that
 

00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:15.129
and so that's that flexibility that
institutional flexibility i think served

00:50:15.129 --> 00:50:15.139
institutional flexibility i think served
 

00:50:15.139 --> 00:50:18.069
institutional flexibility i think served
as well and so we grew and then at each

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079
as well and so we grew and then at each
 

00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:19.799
as well and so we grew and then at each
working group worked as a collective and

00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:19.809
working group worked as a collective and
 

00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:24.249
working group worked as a collective and
so when people apply to join the working

00:50:24.249 --> 00:50:24.259
so when people apply to join the working
 

00:50:24.259 --> 00:50:25.959
so when people apply to join the working
group of decide whether yes or no you

00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:25.969
group of decide whether yes or no you
 

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:27.459
group of decide whether yes or no you
can join or not and so some working

00:50:27.459 --> 00:50:27.469
can join or not and so some working
 

00:50:27.469 --> 00:50:28.629
can join or not and so some working
groups were like no we did want to grow

00:50:28.629 --> 00:50:28.639
groups were like no we did want to grow

them with the question positionality it

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:18.950
them with the question positionality it
 

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:22.450
them with the question positionality it
exists so when one mechanism that we

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:22.460
exists so when one mechanism that we
 

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.760
exists so when one mechanism that we
have right was we had an artist in

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:24.770
have right was we had an artist in
 

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.730
have right was we had an artist in
residency program so so every year we

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:27.740
residency program so so every year we
 

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:29.650
residency program so so every year we
were able fund a couple artists from the

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:29.660
were able fund a couple artists from the
 

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.540
were able fund a couple artists from the
communities themselves right and they

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:31.550
communities themselves right and they
 

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.820
communities themselves right and they
would make a proposal and the committee

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:33.830
would make a proposal and the committee
 

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.210
would make a proposal and the committee
again was was a blended committee and

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:36.220
again was was a blended committee and
 

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.650
again was was a blended committee and
and and they would do all kinds of stuff

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:38.660
and and they would do all kinds of stuff
 

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.650
and and they would do all kinds of stuff
right and and and and you know sometimes

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:41.660
right and and and and you know sometimes
 

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.720
right and and and and you know sometimes
they would serve riff off someone else's

someone proposed sound theater where is
 

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.170
someone proposed sound theater where is
the exact opposite right and so you have

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:56.180
the exact opposite right and so you have
 

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.150
the exact opposite right and so you have
this you had a synergy way back and

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160
this you had a synergy way back and
 

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.270
this you had a synergy way back and
forward with digital storytelling it was

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280
forward with digital storytelling it was
 

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.210
forward with digital storytelling it was
more and with radio it was more

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:04.220
more and with radio it was more
 

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.010
more and with radio it was more
centralized so we had this radio

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:06.020
centralized so we had this radio
 

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.200
centralized so we had this radio
production shop called radio works and

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:08.210
production shop called radio works and
 

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:11.410
production shop called radio works and
so we had using interns and volunteers

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:11.420
so we had using interns and volunteers
 

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.410
so we had using interns and volunteers
and team members you know we had a

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:14.420
and team members you know we had a
 

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.890
and team members you know we had a
partnership with two radio stations and

centrally the way right and and that
practice changed over time beginning it

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:27.950
practice changed over time beginning it
 

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.310
