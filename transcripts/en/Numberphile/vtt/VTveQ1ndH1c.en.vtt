00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
yes so we're going to talk about L-functions. I want to give you an example

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.220
first of all of one L-function that I
think you probably would recognize and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.570
this is the Riemann zeta function, which
depends on a complex number

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:22.150
s is x+iy. 'i' here is the square root
of -1, and you can define it either by

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.340
a sum over the integers, all the integers, all the positive ones. Or, this is a great discovery of Euler:

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.800
I can write it as a product over the
prime numbers. and so the zeta function

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.450
encodes information about the primes. It
contains all the primes and if you can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.670
unravel how the information in the zeta function is encoded you can determine

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.629
properties of the primes. That's one of
the L-functions, and let me tell you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.789
a little bit more about the Riemann zeta
function because that's gonna be part of the

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.230
story. So the Riemann zeta function is
defined as a sum over the integers or a

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.840
product over the primes, and these
formuli work if x is greater than one.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.290
But it turns out you can find formuli
that match these when x is greater than 1.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.659
When x is less than one work as well.
And here's what the Riemann zeta function

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.920
looks like. So these formuli work to the
right of the line x=1. So they work

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.780
out here. And they tell you the value of
the zeta function anywhere in this in this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.040
region. Now it turns out the zeta function has this amazing symmetry

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.320
which was discovered by Riemann, which say that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
the line that I have drawn in blue there
that passes though the point one half, that's

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.420
a symmetry line of the Riemann zeta
function. If I know the value the zeta

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.700
function at some point here, I reflect
that point through the blue line to get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.070
a point here and know its value here. I can deduce that very easily. So Riemann reflection

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.780
formula, the symmetry formula, tells us
that because I know he zeta

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.159
function in this range I also know in
this range as the reflection so that

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.880
just leaves this strip which we don't
understand. This trip is where the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.390
function is really mysterious. We know that in this strip,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.590
there are infinitely many points where the zeta function takes the value 0.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250
The belief is - and this is the Riemann
hypothesis - that these points where the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.350
Zetas function

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.110
takes the value zero, all lie exactly on
the symmetry line, and this is called the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.170
Riemann hypothesis. And this is one of
the great mysteries of mathematics.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.130
Riemann hypothesized this in 1859 and it's
been tested hugely since.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.950
BRADY: professor, it's well-known in mathematics that if any mathematician can prove the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.710
Riemann hypothesis, he or she is destined
for greatness.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.810
PROF: Yeah. BRADY: Why?

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.890
PROF:  Well, because the Riemann zeta
function encodes information about the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.160
prime, so if we know the positions of the
zeros, that tells us really important

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.740
information about the prime numbers.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740
BRADY: What information? What does it tell you that you don't already know?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.560
PROF: it tells us things we already suspect, because we sort of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.270
believe the Riemann hypothesis is true, but there are things we can't prove. So for example,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.010
how many primes are there up to a trillion? We have a formula that we believe is true but we

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.210
can only prove that formula if we know
the Riemann hypothesis is true.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.040
BRADY: So it's like a whole bunch of houses would suddenly have a foundation. PROF: Absolutely,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880
and there are whole books written assuming the
truth of the Riemann hypothesis,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.040
so the foundations of our understanding of the primes would disappear if the Riemann

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.730
hypothesis turned out to be false. It's
known there are infinitely many zeros of the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.590
Riemann zeta function inside the
critical strip, and it's known that at

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.990
least 40% of those do lie on the
symmetry line. It is known, and this is a

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.470
result of hugely extensive computations
that the first 10 trillion zeros

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.060
lie exactly on the symmetry line. That's the first ten thousand billion. It's known that

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.840
batches of zeros, much higher up, beyond the 10 trillion, lie on the line,

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.400
so I think the world record at the moment is there's a batch of zeros up beyond the 10^36th zero,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.120
That is the billion billion
billion billion-th zero, somewhere up there

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.020
there's a whole batch which we know
lie exactly on the line, so people have put a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.600
pretty huge effort into this, and there's
a long history of this:

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.940
Alan Turing, when he built the first electronic
computer, one of the first things he did

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.180
was compute the zeros of the zeta function. He found about the first 1000 lie on the line.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.000
BRADY: professor, if a mathematician one day finds a zero in the strip but not on the line,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.160
is that mathematician gonna be a hero or a pariah?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.280
PROF: [laughs] Well they would certainly be very famous, and I think mathematicians

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.640
very sanguine about this, they'll just accept the truth, they want to know the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.020
truth, that person would be famous,
but I think it would be a kind of

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.580
ugly kind of fame, not a beautiful kind of fame.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.620
So we got these properties and this is what I want to emphasize: we can write the zeta

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.660
function as a sum over the integers,
or as a product over the primes,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.260
and the zeta function has a symmetry line, reflection symmetry line,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.760
and we believe that all the zeros of the zeta function around that line

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.900
lie exactly on that. This is one of the great
mysteries in mathematics, and people have

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.870
spent 150-odd years
thinking about this. And one natural way

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.099
if you're given a mystery is to try to
understand: well, is this a more general

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.479
property? So are there other functions which look like the Riemann zeta function?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.420
And maybe by finding lots of those functions and comparing them that tells you the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.520
essential properties that make the
Riemann hypothesis true. Maybe it allows

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.630
us to prove it. So an example would be:
if you think about evolution,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.370
Darwin wanted to establish evidence for
evolution, so he goes to the Galapagos Islands,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.540
and he has to find lots of
finches that're all very similar but not

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.120
identical, and by making comparisons of
the similarities and the differences you

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.620
then understand the essential properties
that led them to evolve as they did.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.830
So we want to find the cousins of the
Riemann zeta function. To see whether

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.520
there are any, what might you do? Well you might look at this sum over the integers,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.550
and you might change some of these plus
signs into minus signs and see, well,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.509
can you have any combination of
pluses and minuses here? And it turns out

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.360
it's very rare that by changing some of
these plusses into minusses you can write

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.060
this sum, the resulting sum, as a product of the primes

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.199
but be slightly different to this product
but would resemble it. and you'd have something

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.440
that had a symmetry line that's very
very rare that that happens. to there is

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.210
one example of one. let me go back to the
Riemann zeta function going to split the

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.340
primes up into two classes: 2 will
always be special believe that is it is

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.880
but the odd primes

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.920
will either be - if you divide them
by 4 - either remainer of 1 or 3.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.360
So you divide 3 by 4,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.480
the remainders 3.
Divide 5 by 4

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.880
The remainder's 1. Because 5 is 4 + 1.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.280
7: divide that by 4, uh the remainder is 3.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.040
11 is 3. and 13 is 1.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.200
So the ones that are divisible

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.480
where the remainder's 3 will flip their
sign, so we put that one there

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.940
We'll put a 1 there,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.560
a 1 there, and we'll do the other 2.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.080
And that gives you an L-function which has a symmetry

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.080
property to expand these products out
you get a sum of the integers exactly like the

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.780
Reiman Zeta function so this is an
example of a function which is an L-function.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.240
a lot of these were discovered in the
nineteenth century. There are infinitely many

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.320
of them

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.720
BRADY: You said they were rare

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.480
Ya ya ya, um. despite the fact that there are many

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.660
they're extremely rare amongst all possible combinations of

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.820
plusses and minusses that you can have there.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.420
So we know there are infinitely many other

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.320
functions that look like the Reimann Zeta function. you can write them as a sum

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.070
of the integers, you can write them as
a product of the primes - they have a

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.090
symmetry line - and we believe they all
have a Riemann hypothesis. So that was the

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.460
19th century then in the 20th century
people found other examples of

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.250
functions that have those properties you can write them as sums over the integers,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.760
or products over the primes, they have a symmetry line, and we believe that they

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.120
a Reimann Hypothesis. And one of the heroes in this story's Ramanujan.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.700
Sir Ramanujam was studying the following function:

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.620
X times (1- X) to the power of 24.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.040
(1-X squared) to the power of 24.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:20.920
times (1-X cubed) to power 24
times (1 - X to the 4th)^24 etc

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.820
you get the point and what he discovered
was that he could write this as a sum of

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.940
powers of X. (1 times X) minus (24
times X squared) you can do at home

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:41.849
multiply this thing out. that's 24 times X
squared plus 252 times X cubed minus

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:46.720
1472 times X power 4 etc...

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.680
and this keeps going on and you get these beautiful

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.020
whole numbers coming out now here's the miracle.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.120
2 times 3 = 6

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:02.280
-24 times 252 = -6048. So these numbers have the

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:11.030
property that for example three times
five is 15 and if I go out to the 15th

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.680
number in this series

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.660
the the coefficient there,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:22.160
the integer that appears is 252 times 4830.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.160
This meant you could
associate an L-function with these

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:37.320
things. so here's what you do you write 1 - 24 over 2^s, +  252 over 3^s,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:51.600
minus 1472 over 4^s, + 4830 over 5^s, et cetera and this series follows

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.660
from Ramanujan's observation a couple more observations that I won't sort of explain

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.750
in more detail it follows that you can
write this series as a product over

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.950
primes just as we did for the Riemann
zeta function you can plot that in the

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.380
complex plane and he has a symmetry line
exactly like the Riemann zeta function

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.610
does and the zeros of this function are
believed to satisfy Riemann hypothesis.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.840
Now these functions are a class of functions called modular forms. They have certain

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.990
symmetry properties which we believe
give rise to the kinda general patterns

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.130
that you see in the Riemann zeta
function there is a symmetry line and

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.880
zeros on that line a Riemann hypothesis.
and these have been studied throughout the

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.380
twentieth century and Andrew Wiles in
his great work on Fermat's Last Theorem

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.090
used this connection between modular
forms that its functions like this and

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.800
L- functions that its functions like
this to proove Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.080
For all these L-functions we believe there's a
Riemann hypothesis so the big goal is to

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.660
say well can we find a pattern

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.910
can we see any similarities that would
give us a clue as to why the Riemann

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:05.040
Hypothesis is true, for any of them? and one of the things that's been done

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.649
recently is to produce a huge database
of millions of these L-functions with

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:13.990
all the properties tabulated in a very
clear and simple way and basically the

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.430
idea is to throw this out to the world
and say can you help us find the pattern?

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.329
and what you'll find there is the
Riemann zeta function, you'll find

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:26.720
Ramanujan's L- function, you'll find the
L functions that Andrew Wiles studied,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.990
you'll find even more exotic and weird L-functions that we believe all have a

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:38.000
Riemann Hypothesis. and you go to this
website you find these zeros, you'll find plots of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.800
these L-functions ... What's the pattern?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.740
BRADY: if I go to this database though, I'm not gonna make a

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.500
breakthrough, am I? Surly this is only a resource for
mathematicians

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.000
Well...

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.300
It's originally for mathematicians, but I think
these properties are accessible to a

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.019
wide range of people this database is
set up so if you click on any technical

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:00.610
word, up comes an explanation of that word now you put some mathematics to

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.269
understand that but looking at the
pictures I something anyone can do and

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:10.459
somewhere in there is a pattern that
mathematicians haven't spotted. so it may

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.960
well be that somebody else spots it. not
likely but it is possible

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:23.840
