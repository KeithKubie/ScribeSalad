00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:08.163
Every four seconds,

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:09.697
someone is diagnosed with

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.582
Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:13.754
It's the most common cause of dementia,

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:16.613
affecting over 40 million people worldwide,

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:19.133
and yet finding a cure is something that still

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.615
eludes researchers today.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.888
Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist,

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:27.935
first described the symptoms in 1901

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.395
when he noticed that a particular hospital patient

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:32.312
had some peculiar problems,

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.115
including difficulty sleeping,

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:37.485
disturbed memory, drastic mood changes,

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:39.651
and increasing confusion.

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.528
When the patient passed away,

00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.739
Alzheimer was able to do an autopsy

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.779
and test his idea that perhaps

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.200
her symptoms were caused by irregularities

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.163
in the brain's structure.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:52.114
What he found beneath the microscope

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.587
were visible differences in brain tissue

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.781
in the form of misfolded proteins

00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.115
called plaques,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.548
and neurofibrillary tangles.

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:02.926
Those plaques and tangles work together

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:05.345
to break down the brain's structure.

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:07.137
Plaques arise when another protein

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:09.780
in the fatty membrane surrounding nerve cells

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.477
gets sliced up by a particular enzyme,

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:15.062
resulting in beta-amyloid proteins,

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:16.861
which are sticky and have a tendency

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.448
to clump together.

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:20.400
That clumping is what forms the things

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.531
we know as plaques.

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.324
These clumps block signaling

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:25.826
and, therefore, communication

00:01:25.826 --> 00:01:28.162
between cells, and also seem to trigger

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.698
immune reactions that cause the destruction

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:32.832
of disabled nerve cells.

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:35.614
In Alzheimer's disease, neurofibrillary tangles

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:38.699
are built from a protein known as tau.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.589
The brain's nerve cells contain a network of tubes

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:43.613
that act like a highway for food molecules

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.176
among other things.

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.719
Usually, the tau protein ensures that these tubes

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.975
are straight, allowing molecules

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.892
to pass through freely.

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:53.601
But in Alzheimer's disease,

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.064
the protein collapses into twisted strands or tangles,

00:01:57.064 --> 00:01:58.896
making the tubes disintegrate,

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:01.401
obstructing nutrients from reaching the nerve cell

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.029
and leading to cell death.

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.365
The destructive pairing of plaques and tangles

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:08.697
starts in a region called the hippocampus,

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:11.116
which is responsible for forming memories.

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.829
That's why short-term memory loss

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.531
is usually the first symptom of Alzheimer's.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.415
The proteins then progressively invade

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:19.031
other parts of the brain,

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:20.865
creating unique changes that signal

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.281
various stages of the disease.

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.516
At the front of the brain,

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:28.052
the proteins destroy the ability to process logical thoughts.

00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:31.220
Next, they shift to the region that controls emotions,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.557
resulting in erratic mood changes.

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:34.781
At the top of the brain,

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:37.145
they cause paranoia and hallucinations,

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.198
and once they reach the brain's rear,

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.197
the plaques and tangles work together

00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:43.615
to erase the mind's deepest memories.

00:02:43.615 --> 00:02:45.236
Eventually the control centers governing

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:48.030
heart rate and breathing are overpowered as well

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.826
resulting in death.

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:51.865
The immensely destructive nature of this disease

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.864
has inspired many researchers to look for a cure

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:58.616
but currently they're focused on slowing its progression.

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:00.003
One temporary treatment

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.630
helps reduce the break down of acetylcholine,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.283
an important chemical messenger in the brain

00:03:05.283 --> 00:03:07.802
which is decreased in Alzheimer's patients

00:03:07.802 --> 00:03:10.865
due to the death of the nerve cells that make it.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:13.181
Another possible solution is a vaccine

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.642
that trains the body's immune system to attack

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:19.229
beta-amyloid plaques before they can form clumps.

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.030
But we still need to find an actual cure.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.780
Alzheimer's disease was discovered

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.449
more than a century ago,

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.113
and yet still it is not well understood.

00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:29.780
Perhaps one day we'll grasp

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.696
the exact mechanisms at work behind this threat

00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:34.910
and a solution will be unearthed.
