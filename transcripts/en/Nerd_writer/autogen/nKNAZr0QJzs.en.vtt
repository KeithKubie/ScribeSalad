00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.120
"The painting is one of the ugliest I've done."

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.000
This is what Vincent Van Gogh told his brother in a letter

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.540
referencing this painting,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.300
called "Night Café"

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.300
and, at first glance,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.620
you can see what he meant.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.180
This is a jarring image,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.460
even for Van Gogh.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.040
Especially when you compare it to his other famous scene of a cafe in Arles.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.780
Cafe Terrace at Night

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.660
Here Van Gogh captures that romantic sense of European cafes on Summer evenings,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.140
where friends gather to talk and laugh.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.240
The blue starry sky compliments the pool of orange and yellow gas light under the terrace,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.240
which spills out over the cobble stones tinged with violet and pink.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.640
Compare to that, Night Cafe is a painting of anxiety.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.020
If the exterior is the dream of French nightlife,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.340
the interior is the nightmare.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.180
If the exterior is a place to talk and laugh,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.480
The interior depicts the cafe as a place where you can ruin yourself, go mad, commit crimes.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.040
As Vincent wrote in another letter to his brother.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.540
From these letters we understand that the ugly quizy quality of this painting was intentional.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.160
In the same way that he used color to capture his emotional response to natural beauty,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.800
here Van Gogh uses color to convey the uneasiness of a low-class bar room after midnight.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.900
So, how did Van Gogh achieve this effect?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.400
And how can, a quote unquote, "ugly painting" also be a masterpiece?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.540
And to answer these questions, maybe, the  first place we should look is back in those letters.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.200
In reference to Night Cafe Van Gogh writes here,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.940
"I`ve tried to express the terrible human passions with the red and the green".

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.560
Everywhere it`s a battle and an antithesis of the most different greens and reds."

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.400
Van Gogh was an avid student of color.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.380
Specifically Charles Blanc`s analysis of Michel Chevreul color theory

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.740
and Eugène Delacroix`s paintings.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.940
Here Van Gogh learned of the concept of simultaneous contrast, which says that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560
He also learned of optical mixing

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.660
which favorite placing solid colors next to each other on the canvas

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.760
instead of actually mixing the pigments together

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.140
In order to get more vibrant colors and color relationships.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.640
And the basic insight is that every color in the painting and in the real world

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.180
is influenced by the colors around it.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.100
The impressionists and the post-impressionists

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.400
used this relativety to push the effects of color further than ever before.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.920
And, maybe, none more powerfully than Van Gogh.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.260
So, when he talks about a battle or an antithesis between greens and reds in Night Cafe,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.760
this is what he means

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760
Green and red are complimentary colors

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000
and exert a force on each other

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
just like blue and orange.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.640
But where`s blue and orange have a pleasing quality;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.300
there`s something punishing about green and red.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.320
The fact that was noted by another popular color theorist at the time — Ogden Rood.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.860
Van Gogh was aware of this too;

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.180
just a few months prior he experimented with a similar color palette

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.980
in his portrait of a Zouave soldier.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.980
Commenting to his brother,
