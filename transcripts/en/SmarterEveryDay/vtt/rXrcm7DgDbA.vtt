00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:02.482
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.812
So of everything I've studied on Smarter Every Day

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.747
if you know anything about my educational background

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:11.046
or my family history you know that space is this holy topic.

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.801
It's something that must be approached with reverence and respect, right?

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:18.607
That's why I've never really done a series on Smarter Every Day about space.

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:21.584
It's like it was never good enough or the timing wasn't right.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.432
Well I'm telling you right now the timing is right.

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:28.207
I would like to convince you to subscribe to Smarter Every Day

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:30.086
because I'm about to start a space series

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:32.675
and it's unlike any space series on the internet.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:35.483
A lot of space education I'm unsatisfied with

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:38.075
because it's like reading a dry Wikipedia article.

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:39.715
Well we're not going to do that.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.371
We're gonna do something different.

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.726
We're actually gonna go to the hardware.

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.245
Like wherever on earth the hardware is, we're going.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.123
And we're gonna check it out and we're gonna learn

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:50.254
stuff about it and it's gonna be amazing, at least for me.

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:51.622
But think about this.

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:53.518
The hardware doesn't build itself.

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:56.109
It's made by people, and it's operated by people.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.184
So in my mind, all of this would be a waste of time

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.995
if we didn't make that personal connection,

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.099
and get to know the people that are actually making this happen.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.363
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day or something.

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.389
[Woman laughing] I'm at astronaut Don Pettit's house..

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.555
- So this is my driveway..

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:12.593
- Right

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.216
- OK, and I like to set my telescope up here in the driveway

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:22.041
and look at what you can see from the Houston area,

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.561
and that street light..

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.994
- That street light right there?

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:30.509
- That street light right there. It's right at the end of my driveway

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.652
and it messes up your astronomical wahh, and so..

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:45.506
I.. I have this little surplus laser I got from a junkyard.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:53.177
And I made this little mount, and it points at the street light, and I'm gonna plug this guy in.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:54.917
(Male voice) I was wondering what the heck that was when I walked in.

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:55.821
- OK

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:56.665
- And so..

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:01.453
- It shoots.. OK there's the laser beam and this laser beam

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:05.005
should be pre-oriented through my nice little precision mount

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.039
at the street light.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.174
You can see it there on the sensor.

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:09.892
And let's just wait a...

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:13.423
[laughter]

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:17.069
(Destin) I've ahh.. That's amazing.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.919
- And now, for those who might want to do this,

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.472
a green laser does not work.

00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:23.214
- OK.

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:29.519
- That sensor is shifted more towards the near infrared and the red part of the spectrum,

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.071
so if you try a green laser you're gonna have trouble turning it out,

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:34.244
but a red laser..

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:35.692
- Well how do you know this Don?

00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:37.625
- Because I tried it with a green laser.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.566
- [laughs] That's right. So you actually..

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:41.346
This is helium-neon right?

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:41.998
- Yep.

00:02:41.998 --> 00:02:43.161
- Do you understand what this means?

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.357
We are about to hang out with astronauts,

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:47.012
which is amazing for me personally,

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:48.753
because I want to be an astronaut

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:51.341
and it's like I get to hang out with the people I want to be like.

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:55.608
Anyway, so no matter if you're over here on the space knowledge spectrum,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.072
and you think that the space program was cancelled when the shuttle was,

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:00.110
it wasn't by the way but some people think that.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.372
Or if you're way over here on the knowledge spectrum and you're a rocket scientist

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:07.735
and you know that the orbital inclination of the space station is 51.6 degrees and you know why.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:11.095
No matter where you're at, this is gonna be awesome

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:14.945
because space is finally gonna make sense in a much more real way.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.461
So this is how I'm gonna do it.

00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:21.792
I'm gonna put a space video up every month and I'm gonna put a normal Smarter Every Day video up with an ad every month.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.095
You can help any way you want but just share this stuff.

00:03:24.095 --> 00:03:26.093
You can support directly on Patreon,

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:31.787
or if you push out that traditional video I get to use that ad money to pay for the space video

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.733
but by all means share the space video because I want people to care

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:37.422
about space at least half as much as I do.

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.192
Anyway, that's what's going down.

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.231
So now I will show you a teaser for what's coming up,

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:44.759
because over the last several years I've shot stuff all over the world.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.370
These are some of the videos that are gonna be released

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.900
in the Smarter Every Day space series.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.286
Not all of them, but I just want you to subscribe

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.516
and go to space with me.

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.045
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.653
let's go to space.

00:03:57.653 --> 00:03:59.074
Have a good one.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.034
