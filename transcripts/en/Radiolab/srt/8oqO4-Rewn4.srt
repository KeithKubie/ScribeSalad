1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,770
You are listening to radio
lab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,520
S. E. Yup. Hey,

3
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,310
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,300
Today we have the story of just how hard
it can be to be who you actually are,

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,960
what it seems like the entire world
is doing its best to make you who you

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:26,940
actually aren't. I guess I could, I mean
this could be too many details, but um,

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,270
story starts for us. We
had reporter David Conrad.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,330
So for me it was back in late 2014 I
was living in Philadelphia as a Grad

9
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:40,830
student and at the time David was applying
for jobs and one of the jobs he was

10
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,970
applying for was at a radio show that
was doing a series about international

11
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,550
women's issues. And so I,

12
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:50,430
I had this on my mind and I was taking
a bus to the university and I just

13
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,400
overheard somebody talking about
their recent trip to Venice.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,920
And of course the classic tourist thing
to do when you go to Venice is to take a

15
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,640
ride on the canal boats, the
gondolas, you know, go down the canal.

16
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:04,470
Maybe someone sinks to the famous song.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,633
Awesome.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,780
It's very romantic on any case.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,250
The person sitting on the bus next to
David was telling their friend that they

20
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,251
had taken a Gondola ride with this
first ever woman Gondola in Venice.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,040
Yeah. And then we were like poking
around and we realized like how,

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,990
how did this become a, we know.
Who are you? I'm, I'm Kristen.

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,420
Kristen Clark, also a
journalist and radio producer.

24
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,540
[inaudible] and she and David are
partners and collaborators. I mean,

25
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,930
and this is what was interesting is like
we realize like how big a deal it is to

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,380
be a female gondolier this is like,
it's like a 900 year old tradition.

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,300
900 years. Yeah. All men. All men.
And it's always past father, son,

28
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:50,470
father, son, father, son, or like uncle
nephew down the line. So this is like a,

29
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:51,050
this has been

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,550
no ladies now, no ladies then no
ladies ever. No ladies isn't 900 years.

31
00:01:55,551 --> 00:02:00,440
Yeah. Just think about that for a second.
Almost a thousand years of all men,

32
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:03,650
men, men, men, men, men. And then
one day you get a woman, right?

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,880
As a headline woman breaks through
900 year old glass ceiling.

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,180
I thought that sounds like a
good pitch and you're kidding.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,730
It sounds like God kissed you on the
line. Yeah, exactly. It's under the,

36
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:18,080
it's under the like the perfect
empowerment story I guess. Yeah.

37
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:21,470
And so we're kind of just like googling
it and like it's all over the media.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,310
It seems like every outlet from the
Guardian to The New York Times to the

39
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,720
Financial Times to the
Cedar Rapids Gazette.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,150
[inaudible] made it all the way to cedar
rapids to newspapers in Germany and

41
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,310
China and Australia and they all,

42
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:36,350
all the articles laid
out the same basic story.

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,600
It was this Algerian woman from Germany
named Alex Hae showed up in Venice 20

44
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:42,350
years ago,

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,830
got around a gondoliers association that
never wanted to see a woman become a

46
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:50,180
gondolier and eventually became the
first ever female gondolier Venice,

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,060
the whole thing of course,
sparking this giant gender war.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,360
But that was sort of it pretty much the
headline and the picture was the story.

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,620
Many of the articles didn't actually
have all that many quotes from Alex.

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,450
And so for me it sounded like a great
simple opportunity to go back and tell a

51
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
deeper story. Yeah.

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,700
Just like who is this person? Why?

53
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,340
Why would somebody be so hell bent on
getting into this club that just so

54
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:18,900
clearly does not want them.
Yeah. So we, we emailed Alex

55
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,840
just we're, we're
interested in your story.

56
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,900
We're wondering if you might be willing
to spend a few days with us this summer.

57
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,720
And I was hoping it
would just be like, yes,

58
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm happy to meet with you for a couple
of hours and that would have been great.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,160
But we got an email back right away
that said, if you come do the story,

60
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,480
you have to spend a week with me.

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeah.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,260
And then there are all these questions
about like who we were as journalists,

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,640
what our purpose was, and a bunch of
demands. You have to stay in the city.

64
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,610
You can't stay in like one of
the suburbs and Margherita,

65
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:48,630
even though it's cheaper, like
you have to be in the city.

66
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,690
I want you to hear these sounds at
this time. I have a vision for things.

67
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,920
It's a little odd. Yeah. And I
mean the message was definitely,

68
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,550
I want to tell a different story. Right.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,760
Did you have any idea what
that meant? No, I didn't,

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,970
but we had that echo way. I
had that echo into my head.

71
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,350
So we flew to the Venice airport. Uh,
took a bus to city center really fast,

72
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,490
stepped off the bus and you could
smell the salt in the air from um,

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,220
from the grand canal and it was
kind of raining a little bit.

74
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,210
It was around midnight.

75
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,780
We're kind of getting our
bearings, grabbing our bags and we,

76
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,920
we look up and across the parking lot

77
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,370
there's Alex standing under a lamppost
just leaning against it with a cigarette

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,940
smoke kind of curling up into
the light of the street lamp,

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,580
short hair dark. It was

80
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,340
flipped back. Do you think
you were in a Fellini movie?

81
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,050
Really? I didn't know what to think.
This person was legit under a lamp.

82
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:57,884
Smoking

83
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,230
travel. So quick up close.

84
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:10,790
Alex look taller than I expected.
The strong belt, kind of a,

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,940
a face that was a little weathered,
like someone who works outside all day.

86
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,870
On the water finishing quite late.
So when you call it a just finished.

87
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,470
Perfect. How was your flight?
It was long. It was, you know,

88
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,210
we flew to Moscow first,
which is, since it was late,

89
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,650
we made a plan with Alex to meet up at
5:45 PM the next day on the steps of left

90
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,480
in each Shea Opera House.

91
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,980
Okay. Beautiful. For House. Yeah.
I was rushing all to find you.

92
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:42,960
So I left all the mess in the nucleus.

93
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,110
So anyway, the plan was to
go out on a Gondola ride,

94
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,420
which was one of Alex's
demands in that first email.

95
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,370
So we walked around the corner to where
they'd gone to Lewis Parked and oh my

96
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,230
God. The boat was just like shining.

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,960
So the Gonio was made for three
people's lawn, narrow jet black.

98
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:13,430
This was where the Nobel couples
sitting, Auntie cushions, golden trim,

99
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,380
and over there then what
was the seventh city?

100
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,120
Alex had had it about 12 years already.
Quite an old board when I got it.

101
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,250
And I had a name. This is called
pick us up, like I guess this.

102
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,720
And you choose it. Yes, yes.
Yeah, of course. All right, so

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,780
he wanted to come in. So
we climb into the boat.

104
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,550
Perfect angle there,

105
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,630
and Alex stands at the back holding
the or and we're down sitting in the,

106
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,060
in the lower seats. Kind of just like
pointing the microphone up. Alex,

107
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,440
I know you were just telling
us how annoying it is when
people snap pictures is

108
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,420
okay if I take photographs and
every once in a while, no. Okay.

109
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,320
You came here to study at first. No,

110
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:05,321
that's not what I said and it was pretty
much immediately clear that you came

111
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,130
here. I mean

112
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,750
that it was not going
to be an easy interview.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,370
You came in a study when
you study. I know, I know,

114
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:20,810
but I was wondering the ruling, right.
You got to do a lot of practice. Yeah.

115
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,600
We had a notebook full of questions and
things that we had pulled from all these

116
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:26,390
articles we'd read. That
pretty quickly became useless.

117
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,990
That's what I was asking
you is, is you didn't come.

118
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,570
And whenever I asked about being the
first female gondolier and there were the

119
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,810
first woman in 900 years to
do this. Oh, it's a Lodestar.

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Who that [inaudible] read that everywhere
and then let them in so little such an

121
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,000
over and over and over.
No, it was all set already.

122
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,670
Why would we need to repeat
things? We've already done.

123
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,670
This is very frequent journalism problem.

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,390
Like you become boring to the
person you're interviewing. Right?

125
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,300
You start flailing. Exactly.
And rework. We were like, uh,

126
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,350
you don't have anything. Why are we here?

127
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,820
How, what do you do? You know, we
just thought maybe we should just be

128
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,580
quiet. Probably.

129
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,790
We are about to make the Titus.

130
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,520
I haven't received 35

131
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,190
we moved away from the tourist centers
of the city and into these smaller

132
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,024
canals.

133
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,390
Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

134
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,070
As we'd go around these tight turns. Yeah.

135
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,000
Hello.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
Alex would sing out to let the other
boats know that we were coming.

137
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,120
So here we have a cross and this is why
I showed out my direction in order to

138
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,180
avoid accidents because you
cannot hear the gun arriving,

139
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,450
you know, we'd go into
these beautiful archways

140
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,030
whoa.

141
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:03,740
Past Hidden Gardens.

142
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,740
You don't necessarily need eyes in order
to appreciate the Gondola tour in every

143
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:16,190
channel as a defense song. Any, some
Jones, you have a lot of birds singing.

144
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,740
Does it fly any faces?

145
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,070
So this is a beautiful entrance,
you know, to, to show you

146
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,170
at one point I'd gone to look cut
through this rectangle of light

147
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,570
shining from an open kitchen door.

148
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,950
[inaudible]

149
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,000
it was nice. I mean this side of Venice
was unexpected and really beautiful.

150
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,430
But the whole time we were
sitting on our notepads in, uh,

151
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,100
we were definitely quietly panicking.

152
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,670
Well, you know, there, you know,
I didn't know this at the time,

153
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:03,260
but I thought the some, you know, I was
like, hmm, maybe a little too young.

154
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,010
And I think

155
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,080
Alex was testing us

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,460
and maybe a little bit too, oh yeah,
we don't have enough experience.

157
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,950
Maybe that was my concern,
but I liked the A,

158
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,620
I liked the enthusiasm
and I liked the, uh,

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,350
uh, there was an honesty, which I liked.

160
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,160
Did you ever figure out
what you were being, um,

161
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,110
sussed out for or what was going on
there? No, for sure. Not on the boat,

162
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,460
but we,

163
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,120
we actually made plans to go out to
dinner that night and considering how the

164
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,661
boat ride went,

165
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:46,290
we thought at this point we should return
to square one and leave the recorder

166
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,260
at home. Um, and just try and
have a conversation anyway.

167
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,620
We sit down outside and very few people
are in the restaurant where we're the

168
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,620
only table outside. They had to open
when we all, when we got there too,

169
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,930
we should say we met um, Alex's
girlfriend, right? Yeah. And we're making,

170
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:02,940
I think we're just kind of making
small talk and yeah, it turns out,

171
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,410
turns out Alex's girlfriend
is a photographer and she
done this photo essay of

172
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,244
Alex

173
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,930
and the photos are really
striking. Like one of them,

174
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,020
Alex is just like drowning
under the water. Um,

175
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,930
there's one that's just like
Alex's back is to the camera.

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,840
This ripped and muscular
back. Yeah. Like arms splayed,

177
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,980
like looking out the window over the
city of Venice. Venice as lone defender.

178
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,530
Yeah, just like so bad ass and like
kind of like superhero style. Yeah.

179
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,700
So we were just chatting about the
photos and asking Alex girlfriend, like,

180
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,081
you know,

181
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:40,740
tell me a little bit more about what
inspired you to take these photos and you

182
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:45,720
know, like small talk friendly stuff.
And she kind of was like, you know,

183
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,500
it was just, it's so strange,
you know, we thought,

184
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,240
we thought it was so clear.

185
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,890
We like the photos were so like they
emphasized every masculine quality on

186
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:01,360
Alex's body. Um, we, you know,
in our artists statement,

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,770
you know, we used all of the male
forms in Italian, you know, like Louis,

188
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,650
which means he instead
of lay, which means she,

189
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,080
but everybody at the photo
exhibit was like, Oh,

190
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,990
must have been a Typo or you
made a mistake. And she was like,

191
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:17,740
which is funny because I'm Italian,
so I should know. And I was like,

192
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,070
oh, pronouns, pronouns
Louie. He, Alex, she used,

193
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:28,540
he, he, Alex is a, he is Alex Trans, like,

194
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,110
oh my gosh, Alex is a transgender man.

195
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,660
Wow. What did you, what does
that mean to you in that moment?

196
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,040
What I thought that meant, um,

197
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,700
was Alex was probably born in a
body that he didn't identify with.

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,780
Yeah. I mean mine was, I didn't
think transgender. I didn't think,

199
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,340
I thought Alex is a guy. Of course
Alex is a guy. Really? Yeah.

200
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,460
I wasn't surprised. Were you surprised?
I wasn't that super, I mean I wasn't,

201
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:03,350
I'm not saying that the, the
pronounce it is accurate.

202
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:07,430
I would say that like flipping
into he not a thing like,

203
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,300
like it was like Alex is,
Alex is a he, Alex is, he,

204
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,410
he is sitting at the table with us. Alex
and his girlfriend come very quickly.

205
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,400
It was like him.

206
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,660
I'm looking at him and then I start
thinking about the story that we had come

207
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,100
here to tell. Um,

208
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,050
that was about all of the women things
that she had done. Her, her, her,

209
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:31,620
her woman hero, heroine,
first female in 900 years,

210
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,870
international symbol of female power.

211
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,570
You start thinking about
that and it's like,

212
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,643
um,

213
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,800
those things are really
hard to square in your head.

214
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,810
This real person is also these stories.

215
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:48,340
And how did that happen?

216
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,130
What has it been like for 20 years to
be inside of that story when you're

217
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,240
actually a man

218
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:04,430
[inaudible]

219
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,430
after who knows how many articles
have been written about Alex?

220
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,750
This is the first time that he is
publicly telling his story as a man,

221
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:16,310
and so we should probably just stop for
a second and talk about pronouns because

222
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:20,150
this is really important
for many transgender people
in moments when Alex was

223
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,600
publicly understood as a woman and was
getting international press for it,

224
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,140
we've decided with Alex's permission to
only use his name or his title of First

225
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,680
Female Gondolier.

226
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,360
While some of the people interviewed
for this story were unaware that Alex is

227
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:39,650
transgender and do use female pronouns
or do refer to him as a woman. We,

228
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,130
when we're talking about him,
we will only use male pronouns.

229
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,340
So after that dinner, we
made plans for the next day

230
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,600
on his motorboat and he would just take
us to a quiet spot and we would talk,

231
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,950
what's the agreement on the
water on the water? Shut up.

232
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,820
Stop it. [inaudible]
hello? Okay. He speaks

233
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,060
a lot of false starts.

234
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,680
Oh, well, I don't know. Maybe
I can ask it. Has anybody,

235
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,220
has anyone ever asked you what
Gender Pronoun you prefer?

236
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,910
Nope. Never. Never had ever.

237
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,240
So after getting some of the
basics out of the way, you know,

238
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,930
Alex kind of started
at the beginning. Okay.

239
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,240
Well, you know, it's a long
story. I was born transgender.

240
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,770
This is in Germany. Alex tells us
he was born with a female body,

241
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,030
but at a pretty early age. Knew
himself to be a little boy.

242
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,660
I knew already before I went to school
with three years I was standing on the

243
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:00,110
toilet to pee inside Alex is that,
you know, for him, he, you know,

244
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,440
he had the sense even when he was three
that there should just be something on

245
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,550
his body that wasn't
there. Yeah, yeah. No,

246
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,400
I was praying for a penis every night. My,

247
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,210
my parents knew about it.

248
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,710
His parents were actually both
doctors [inaudible] but they,

249
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,970
they were not supportive.

250
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,590
[inaudible],

251
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,300
you know, I, I heard them, you know,

252
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:24,120
they were talking about
all the weird stuff I did,

253
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,930
how you'd ripped the arms off of his
barbies, cutting them like, you know,

254
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,670
it was a black pencil
and like destroying them.

255
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,340
And where the way Alex dressed himself
when there was a swimming lesson in the

256
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,174
school,

257
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,230
I was there only with little tents or
you'd call them the bet based suit for

258
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,500
four boys. And you know, I was of course,

259
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:48,140
very aggressive as a child, a lot of
fights. You know, I got quiet. Uh,

260
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,520
I was quite a violent as a kid.
So now I can off about this. But,

261
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,720
you know, it, it, it was a
drama at home. It was a drama,

262
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,240
the constant, uh,

263
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,120
try of my mother to, uh,

264
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,130
get this behavior out of me.
Alex has pretty early on.

265
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,020
His parents basically gave up on him.
They ignored me as much as they could,

266
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,981
which was, you know,

267
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:19,270
in a way it was saving me because
I could wear whatever I wanted.

268
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,470
I could do whatever I wanted.
And then when Alex was 10,

269
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,770
a little brother was born and

270
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,520
that was a huge shock.

271
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,910
That was a terrible shock because, um,

272
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,460
basically it confirmed that my
mother wanted desperately at boy,

273
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,640
but she didn't accept me as her son.
That's what it, Alex said. Basically,

274
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,860
you know, that was the
first time he saw what like,

275
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,610
like it should look like basically
when a parent loves their kid.

276
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,680
So, um, when he was 15

277
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,533
[inaudible]

278
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,330
he ran away from home.
I escaped one handbook.

279
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,460
And in handbook you have a huge, um,

280
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,140
district called some Poli where they
have all the prostitutes and you know,

281
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,930
all the bad sings. And
that's exactly where I went.

282
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,560
Some people kind of took him
under their wing, um, got a job,

283
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,170
kinda figured out how to take
care of himself. I got lucky,

284
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,310
but I know also very unlucky

285
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,140
these stories. But I got lucky.

286
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,780
Did he ever think about like
transitioning to a male body?

287
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,630
He says he thought about it at one
point, but in the 80s, when I was 15,

288
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,700
the opportunities you're fair to
become. A men were very, very, um,

289
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,940
poor in particular. If you wanted
to go down the road of surgery,

290
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,970
what I can remember for my family was
constant talks about how operations went

291
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,540
wrong, how they went
wrong and what went wrong.

292
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,900
And so for me to go into
hospital to do an operation,

293
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,120
this is not going to
happen. And of course,

294
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:13,290
many transgender people don't end
up having surgery. But anyway,

295
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,910
after Homburg at some point,

296
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,670
Alex fell into filmmaking and ended
up in San Francisco working in,

297
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,040
in the film industry. And so 1986,

298
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,240
he got involved in a production that
sent him abroad to go scope out locations

299
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,130
for a film that was going
to be shot in Venice.

300
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,513
Yeah.

301
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,050
So shows up in Venice in 1886, 29,

302
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,480
I think. Oh, she's older.
He's not a kid at this point.

303
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,850
Originally he's just
supposed to say a few days,

304
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,180
kind of just enough time to do
some research and scope things out.

305
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,040
But somewhere along the way,

306
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,540
he sees these guys rowing their
boats down the canal and uh,

307
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,080
for reasons he can't entirely explain,

308
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,350
he's just transferred,

309
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,763
fixed,

310
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,500
fascinated by this kind of bought.

311
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,650
And I was fascinated by the rowing style
that you'll go forward so you actually

312
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,550
see where you're going.

313
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,410
So it was just a fascinated and I
just wanted to try it out myself.

314
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,890
Eventually. Um, Alex ends up actually
meeting a gondolier and asks like,

315
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,480
do you think I could do this?

316
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,020
And I actually ended up down at the
Gondola station as an apprentice.

317
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,770
Um, did they ask you, did they
ask you why you wanted to study?

318
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,190
I remember the first day I was
introduced by the head boss of the group.

319
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,960
Okay. So this is Alex.

320
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,700
She's going to be all mascot because
they saw Alex as a woman and there had

321
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,270
never been a woman
gondolier most of them. So

322
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,820
for sure this was like a kind of a joke.

323
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,880
There was a very old man
who will do the latest set.

324
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,400
Now we have gone to Leah with tits

325
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,780
for the first seven months.

326
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,110
Alex says he basically just
picked up after the guys.

327
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,990
You were the bus boy for everybody.

328
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So you needed to clean the boats and to
ship out the water like 10 20 times a

329
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:15,060
day. He says, it's really backbreaking,

330
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:18,570
grueling work for somebody that
everybody, everybody sees as a woman,

331
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,690
you think this would be like the
worst place on earth. But you know,

332
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:24,570
actually those first, those
first months in the city,

333
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:28,250
just kind of with the boys dirty
jokes. I thought this is great.

334
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,620
[inaudible]

335
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,690
Alex knew all the gondoliers nicknames,

336
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,550
walked and talked and acted like them
and cursed in the same way and he says he

337
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,670
felt like he was part of
this tradition of, you know,

338
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,380
learning from these old guys
who work mentors to him.

339
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,150
I was really like maybe the
best time of my, my life

340
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,600
[inaudible]

341
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,190
it was, it was like he was home
and then the, the travel began

342
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,150
[inaudible]

343
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,610
it started with the
journalist. Yeah. Is that

344
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,940
[inaudible] or those reporter Consuelo
Turin. We met in a noisy cafe,

345
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,380
so you know,

346
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,800
started in 99 to six with a translator
when consoler was a collaborator.

347
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,180
Often will have the names. Yeah.

348
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,020
She was a cub reporter in Venice working
for a very politically progressive

349
00:22:22,021 --> 00:22:26,760
newspaper and she was out looking for
her big story and she runs into our,

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
how do they encounter each other?

351
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,990
[inaudible] Alex a Consuelo saw Alex at
one of the gondolier stations and she

352
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:38,070
was like, Whoa,

353
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,190
this obviously this has
struck her attention and

354
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,180
[inaudible] it looked to her like there
was this woman rowing among men and like

355
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,230
the seeming kind of
blend right in the night.

356
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,290
[inaudible] was attracted by this
vision, unusual vision for Dennis,

357
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,440
so she observed her [inaudible].

358
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,520
I camped out for like a whole morning
and basically just watched Alex's

359
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:06,330
behavior. Hey, ultra
Couto the [inaudible].

360
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,500
Alex didn't want to talk, told
him I can't talk about it.

361
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,320
Told her basically I'm just a
student. They're teaching me.

362
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,030
Don't make this into a thing like
get, I mean they see [inaudible].

363
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,420
Consuelo said, listen, I recognize
that you don't want to talk to me,

364
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:24,620
that you're apprehensive and that this
might be difficult for you to go with

365
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,170
that.

366
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,620
And I get that this might even damage
your reputation with the other gondoliers

367
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,330
but needed around the importance.
This is an important story.

368
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,760
The way to the [inaudible], you're
a pioneer. I can't ignore you.

369
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,340
And so Consuela said
there are two options.

370
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,990
I'm going to write the
story no matter what.

371
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,070
So you can either talk to me and
we can do the story together or

372
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,970
I can write what I think

373
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,930
that we'll see. Alpha, you know,

374
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:59,220
I said it can't go out now.
And she said it will, it will.

375
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,730
And why wasn't Consuelo
persuaded that she should wait?

376
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,290
Well there were journalists coming
from all over the place. You know,

377
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,300
I think the story was going to get out
there and somebody was going to write it

378
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,830
and Alex never sort of stopped and
was like, listen Consuelo or whoever,

379
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,290
let me just tell you the real story.

380
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,220
The way out of this is to
speak and yet he stays quiet.

381
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,770
Do you have a sense of why? I mean,

382
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,580
so just to kind of give like some like
data points that might be helpful and

383
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:29,970
understanding kind of where
we were. So we're talking 1997

384
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,900
just to give you like a corollary thing
where we were in our discourse around

385
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:40,380
LGBT issues was like Ellen degenerates,
I think that year, this is,

386
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,050
this is so hard. But I
came out on her show.

387
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,260
I think I've realized that I am,

388
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,850
I can't even say the word,
why can't I say the word?

389
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
And like shortly after it was canceled,
Caitlyn Jenner was just a few years ago.

390
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,990
Like we didn't even really have
a grip on what transgender was.

391
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,270
That wasn't a conversation
that we were having in public.

392
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,450
Can you imagine what it would be
like to be like guys, guys, guys,

393
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,320
don't worry though.

394
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,470
I'm actually a man that wouldn't have
gone over so well with the dudes at the

395
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,450
Gondola station. Yeah.

396
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,520
So what ended up happening after
Consuelo and Alex had this,

397
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,930
had the show down about the article.
Well, a couple of days later,

398
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,880
Alex was on the way to
the Gondola station.

399
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,280
I found it in the newspaper
Shop, the headline

400
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,550
[inaudible]

401
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,040
we're not done. No speed.

402
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,760
[inaudible] a woman is challenging
the gondoliers so I was like,

403
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,120
oh my God, it's going to be hell.

404
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,920
So it's in the newspaper stand.

405
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,190
Alex shows up at the gondolier station
and of course there's a big hello,

406
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,720
a big unfriendly hello? Yeah, just
like, oh, Hello Gondola Sierra.

407
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,980
So far as they got really, really
angry, they were like, well,

408
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,880
we do everything to teach you well and
you know, now you're challenging us.

409
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,250
Alex has a lot of the
gondoliers stop talking to him.

410
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,020
They wouldn't even let him wash
their boats and then you know.

411
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,020
Then of course there were
the ones who said, ah,

412
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,650
I told you in the beginning [inaudible]
she was just going to Blab to the press

413
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,730
and woman. Is that a good thing or
did it do to turn the whole thing?

414
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:19,050
You know what's like a little
stone becoming a huge, huge thing.

415
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,120
By the way, this is right.

416
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:25,480
This is coming right before Alex is
about to take the very first exam.

417
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,220
There's actually a series of exams
and it gets a little complicated,

418
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:34,030
but eventually anybody who wants to be a
gondolier has to take this rowing test.

419
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,910
And by all accounts, Alex was good.

420
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,890
Like we talked to the guy who was the
head of the Gondoliers Association at that

421
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,910
time I e. Oh, this Guy
Fulvio Scarfo was like, yeah,

422
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,730
Alex or me is a more

423
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,870
good, the other main Gando yeah.
And this is the head of the guild.

424
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:58,710
Yeah. And we also talked to this
legendary rower named Franco Crayon

425
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,700
[inaudible]. He was also like, she
put them into Voila. [inaudible]

426
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,870
Alex is better than most of the guys

427
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,390
we talked to was [inaudible]
answer that. They call it. Yeah.

428
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,210
So anyway, Alex takes the
test and I failed the exempt,

429
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,280
which wouldn't have been,

430
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,760
that by itself wouldn't have been such
a big deal cause a whole bunch of people

431
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:20,810
fail the first exam.

432
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,280
But the thing was there was a feeling
that like something deeply unfair was

433
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,200
happening. See, I don't know all that

434
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,830
[inaudible] according to Consuelo,

435
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:34,700
a lot of people started to think maybe
the fix was it to see what other boys

436
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,900
there who failed,

437
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,910
who were better than other boys who
did not fail Alex's suspiciously.

438
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:44,360
Pretty much all the people that passed
were sons of gondoliers or from gondolier

439
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:48,290
families because they have
had the right last name. So

440
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,100
then I got angry. I got a lawyer,

441
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,440
Alex thought this was going to bring
attention to how corrupt the licensed

442
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,590
practices, how corrupt
this association is.

443
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:02,300
I wanted that the exam is repeated for
everybody and this lawyer was negotiating

444
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:06,620
and the gondoliers association was like,
if we let everyone retake the test,

445
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,190
that will basically be admitting that
we favor certain families over other

446
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:13,520
families. That was exactly what I
want, but it's not what they wanted.

447
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,400
They said, we don't want the
bad press of this, but then,

448
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,720
and this is another moment according to
Alex where his story just gets hijacked.

449
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,040
My lawyer negotiated without my
permission according to Alex,

450
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:29,240
without telling him the lawyer together
with the gondoliers association dug up

451
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:33,560
this old law that says, because
Alex is a woman, I mean he's not.

452
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,060
He's a man, but they thought he was a
woman and this law says that as a woman,

453
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,190
he had the right to take the test. Again,

454
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,060
this time with women judges in the
boat, when she came back and said, okay,

455
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:48,260
here's what we're going to do. Do you
remember what you said? I was pissed.

456
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,820
I was very upset. That
was not what I wanted,

457
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,710
has nothing to do with man or woman.

458
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,730
Do you think she was your champion
because she identified with you? Yeah,

459
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:01,490
for sure. It was not my
story. It's her story,

460
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,330
but unfortunately for Alex,
as soon as the lawyer did

461
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,393
[inaudible],

462
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,940
it became everyone's story.
Oh yeah, because press

463
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,150
there. When was it? In
the next two months,

464
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,810
every paper in town was writing about
it, spend it by a Gumbo ears examination.

465
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,360
Mrs. Nixon. That got banned from
[inaudible]. Then the story went global.

466
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,510
Jeremiah catches a crowd in every
to become Danny's first woman.

467
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,770
Going to the sexist sink first
female, good [inaudible] fight,

468
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,190
a male to leash, failed
gondolier blamed chauvinist

469
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,830
and then things escalate into a full
blown gender battle. The are of course,

470
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,050
super pissed because of all
this press that they're getting.

471
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,140
We talked to a couple of
key like gondolier guys

472
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,700
Alixandra Hey, well no, no.

473
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
They have some thoughts and feelings
about it and she had to pass a test.

474
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,000
She didn't as an disaster,
Alex is at one point,

475
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:59,480
things got so bad that
one of them was saying,

476
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,670
I'm gonna wait for you on a small and
street and there's a knife and kill you or

477
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:08,120
I'm gonna. So I grabbed the guy
and I said, where's your knife?

478
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,710
I'm hit get it out. You know,

479
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,960
do it that it was one that
this all the many Oz's.

480
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,780
So on the one side,

481
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:21,580
Alex said he has gondoliers wanting to
knife him on the other. It was too close.

482
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,020
Then feminism kicked in and then Alex
said he had all these women rushing in to

483
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:30,010
save him. Wait, where do you want me to
like us? They thought he was ashamed.

484
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,070
We read in the paper that she had tried
to take the test and had failed and had

485
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,680
called foul saying that the donations
were Maine and the United sexist and

486
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,570
wouldn't let women become gondoliers.

487
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,410
This is gene capital two is active in
the community of Venetian women rowers at

488
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,930
the time. Women by the way,
like there aren't any, well,

489
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,030
so there weren't any women
gondoliers at that time,

490
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:54,700
but there's a whole community
of female rowers. Um,

491
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,190
they have teams and they race, subbing,

492
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,220
doing venation Ryan for over 20 years
and being a female rower and Venice,

493
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,940
um, who was very difficult. Eleanor,
this woman rower I was talking to.

494
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,490
Thus the week I was with
my a rowing partners,

495
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,010
it was like, I'm routinely when I'm out
on the water, like old men yell at me,

496
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,660
Hey, what's your doing? Returned
back home in the kitchen,

497
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,380
cooking or cleaning your
house. Why are you here?

498
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,940
You're just a Contorno.
You are just a side dish.

499
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,500
They both told me when it comes to racing,

500
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,660
there's a big discrepancy
in the prize money.

501
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,590
The men are getting like four times
as much prize money as the women.

502
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,700
We are now trying to uh,

503
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,140
convince the city of Venice who
gives prices that we are like men,

504
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,040
we are not less than them.

505
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,460
You hear all these women
who have been, you know,

506
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,820
incrementally busting their ass to try
to be taken seriously in the sport.

507
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,380
We are here, we can do this.

508
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,620
And when they saw this press about
Alex fighting the Gondoliers,

509
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,600
they reached out. I sent one of the
other considers down to speak to her,

510
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,830
you know, come to our club and come
and work with us and help us out.

511
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:06,400
Help us teach people. You've got your
back. But she wasn't interested. No,

512
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:10,330
of course not because Alex, there
are two problems. First of all,

513
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,830
you cannot compare the ganglia
rollers with racing rose.

514
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,950
There are two different styles
of rowing. And second of all,

515
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,560
the sense I got was that it was kind
of like, I don't want to roll with you.

516
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:24,810
You guys all wear matching white
skirts. Like not my thing. So, uh,

517
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,610
I remember there was a lot of resentment.

518
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,760
Sure. A woman, how can you be one of
us in this battle for the equality

519
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,450
me and then they're convinced
that I'm a feminist,

520
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:39,860
that I am one of them

521
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,440
and I'm not. And all of
this comes to a head.

522
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:45,900
Yeah.

523
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,280
In October of 2004

524
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,480
when Alex has to retake the test and this
time with champion women rowers in the

525
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:57,240
boat judging them, it
was a lot of pressure.

526
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,680
Everything about this test is supposed
to be a secret. The location of the test,

527
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:04,800
the path that Alex is going to row. I've
had no clue where we're going to go,

528
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,920
but suspiciously, as Alex
stepped into the boat,

529
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:13,000
he noticed that there was a huge crowd
lined up all the way down the canal under

530
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,910
the ears and their friends and
they're shouting and yelling.

531
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,520
She was screaming all kinds of the
roads and all kinds of go home.

532
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,670
CanNot imagine the heat. He'd female
rowers in the boat glaring at him.

533
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:34,140
There's press lined up along the entire
way, plus the tourist plus every,

534
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:38,370
everybody say it was full of
people. I felt like I'm in a ring.

535
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,070
[inaudible]

536
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,680
I try to block it all out
because I needed to do next. Sam,

537
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,770
the I wanted to do a good performance

538
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,510
and uh, I wasn't able

539
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,683
[inaudible]

540
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,830
it was hell, one of the worst,

541
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,450
worst days of my entire
life and we lead on,

542
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,070
I don't wish that that was real hell.

543
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:35,720
[inaudible]

544
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,640

listen to your podcast. Hey,

556
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:15,240
I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich.

557
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:19,860
This is radio lab and we're turn now
to a story from Kristen Clark and David

558
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,850
Conrad. About Alex Hay,

559
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,120
transgender man who became somehow the
first female Gondola era in 923 years and

560
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:30,600
thus an international
feminist hero sensation.

561
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,400
And so we now find Alex being painted
by everybody in town in colors the he

562
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,950
doesn't particularly agree
with. And what's interesting

563
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,990
according to Kristen, is just how easy
it is to do that to someone. Okay.

564
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,510
So I'll tell you as we were doing
the interviewing and the reporting,

565
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,950
I'm like, I'm feeling like I have a good
grip on Alex's story. I'm feeling like,

566
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,341
Oh man,

567
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:55,250
I know what it feels like to be inside
of a narrative that feels really icky.

568
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,760
And so I feel like I'm kind of getting
it and I'm like understanding the full

569
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,450
Alex and like it's about all of these
other things that have nothing to do with

570
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:05,700
gender. So Alex's story isn't
about gender at all. And,

571
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,390
and for me that made sense
because I was like, in my life,

572
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,900
gender has been a box. Like, even
even when you're in the right,

573
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,000
even when you're in the right box,

574
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,420
gender is a box and it can feel shitty
to be in that box. And so I was like,

575
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:21,370
yeah, let's bust open those boxes
together. We're going to show you,

576
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,500
we're going to show people
who you are, Alex. But then

577
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,440
we would have these moments
where I would be like, hmm, wait

578
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,423
second,

579
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,370
like one night when we were in Venice,

580
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,360
we were like trying to park our
boat on the way to a restaurant and,

581
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,020
and like this guy is like trying to
parallel park his boat and Alex is kind of

582
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:44,970
sitting there like
chuckling at him and you,

583
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,300
you can hear like David
Chuckling in the background.

584
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,000
And so the two of them are
like, you know, joking about it.

585
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,360
And then Alex says like, he drives
like a woman, like an old lady.

586
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,780
And I was like, yeah, you know,
and kind of rolled my eyes at it.

587
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,310
But then later at the dinner he was
like, he was like, you know, though,

588
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:09,030
like I don't really think that like
a real woman could do this job.

589
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,660
And he was like, oh, like
macho about it. Yeah,

590
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:16,560
I remember you were shocked that
I was saying such a much a thing.

591
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,840
I remember that of course
a you are very right.

592
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,790
A woman can do everything,

593
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,790
but the,

594
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,930
this job is this going
to be very tough because

595
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,450
uh, it's a real, a cruel

596
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,400
community. Amens is very cool and rough.

597
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,390
But when you said that, but when
you said that I got, so I was like,

598
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,260
I'm so frustrated. Um,

599
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,560
and it was because I think I was attached
to the idea of like it being equal,

600
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,160
you know? I mean, I was, I was, I
was just like super confused. Like,

601
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,380
I don't know, I just,

602
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,070
I just want to know a thing that's
not, tell me what you want to know.

603
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,810
I don't, and I'll admit in the moment
I asked a kind of clumsy question.

604
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,250
Do you feel that it was just because
you seem to be almost like prodding me,

605
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,540
you know, having fun
and winging it, David.

606
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:18,150
And do you feel like you're fundamentally
on a different team from me?

607
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,020
Oh, okay. Uh,

608
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,060
I am on David's team,

609
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,610
but you can't see is it because
he's, you identify with me,

610
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,010
but that's is not a they, I can't help

611
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,390
that. How can I explain it to you?

612
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,440
Let's put it this way. When I'm
in a group of woman for example,

613
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,040
and they start to talk,
I feel uncomfortable.

614
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,090
The check things they have,
I call it a chicken check.

615
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,680
It's not really my cup of
tea. You know? I like it.

616
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,420
It can amuse me,

617
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,430
but the minute they think
that I am one of them,

618
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:08,110
it doesn't amuse me anymore and I
feel uncomfortable and I don't. I'm,

619
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:08,944
I'm a,

620
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,630
I'm a little alien there because they
think I am one of them and I'm not.

621
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,740
When I'm with the boys,
I'd feel comfortable.

622
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,460
If it is a nice group
of boys, which I liked,

623
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:25,240
then we have the same type
of humor on the, you know,

624
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:27,310
the same stupid jokes about woman

625
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,800
for Alex.

626
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,650
I think what was really striking is
that whatever it is that makes him feel

627
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:35,700
comfortable being seen as a man but
not as a woman, it runs very deep

628
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,570
for me. There is a difference

629
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,870
between men and women.

630
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,680
Not everybody or even every
transgender person would feel this way,

631
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,180
but the way that he sees it, if there
were no differences, there would be no,

632
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,400
no wish to do transition.

633
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:53,240
And there would be no two on
sexuality and six like that.

634
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,140
If it would be the same if it isn't

635
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,420
[inaudible].

636
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,570
So you were seeing him as like a
gender doesn't matter kind of icon.

637
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:10,290
And he was saying, actually
it does matter. Yeah,

638
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,230
we can I just ask a
simpler question. When,

639
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,780
when does he actually become the
first female gun to Lira? Well,

640
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:23,670
so Alex couldn't get one of these 400 or
so special gondoliers licenses because

641
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,900
he failed the test. Right.

642
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,810
In 2005, I opened up my own business.

643
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:33,590
He figured out that if he partners up
with businesses in town, like hotels,

644
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,240
he can actually refer them privately.

645
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,670
At the time, uh,

646
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,030
I was looking at all the Lords and I
found that it was possible to open up my

647
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:43,280
own business without
having a license. So I did.

648
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,330
And so for years he was just
kind of doing this quietly. Then

649
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,720
Alexandra, she said, not the Gumbo.

650
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,780
There she is [inaudible]
she works for a hotel.

651
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,280
Some of the gondoliers began to notice
that Alex was rowing passengers without a

652
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:01,310
license. And of course they didn't
like that she didn't bus it.

653
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,110
That's saying like, you can't do that.

654
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,950
She's not the part of our team that
is not have a driver's license.

655
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:08,690
You have to be a member
of this organization.

656
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:11,880
You have to have a specific license in
order to practice whether we can say she

657
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,100
is not a gondola driver.

658
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,710
I got some threats,

659
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,830
verbal threats and and damaging the
Gondola and since like that all kinds of

660
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:22,000
stupid little boy shit

661
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:24,780
[inaudible]

662
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,600
so when they understood they
cannot threaten me this way,

663
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,990
then the pressure at City Hall

664
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,100
to change the villa city basically said

665
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,580
like you can't row, you can't roll a
Gondola with tourists in it without,

666
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,450
without a license. And the law passed and
was signed and it became the real law.

667
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,170
Yeah.

668
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:47,120
And so one day Alex is out on his
boat and he just gets pulled over and

669
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:50,000
basically he's told you're
breaking this new law. And so

670
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,850
I wanted to defend myself.
So we went on trial in court.

671
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,040
It was Alex is one lawyer, City Hall
and the Gondoliers Association there,

672
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,840
Ford Lawyers for lawyers. I saw,
oh no, this last case any already,

673
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,150
but sit the whole,

674
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,110
no city hall fights back case goes
to the highest court in the land.

675
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,780
They lost again in front of a court, uh,

676
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,220
with me, a little stranger
from out of nowhere.

677
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,330
Now technically the decision just said
hotels can provide for their customers

678
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:28,200
the way that they need to.

679
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,530
So if they want to hire a chauffeur
who happens to row in a Gondola,

680
00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:36,300
they can do that. But what that actually
meant was that now for the first time,

681
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,450
Alex could be considered a gondolier

682
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,533
[inaudible].

683
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,450
That was a huge deal message along the
canal to women and paddles against the

684
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,990
tying up times came in, woman
bakes on Vinnies, Gondola Cartel,

685
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,470
Chicago Tribune came in, there's
female gone to live, rock the boat.

686
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,100
Female women came in.

687
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,090
And so this is where we get all of
those articles we read before we came to

688
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,970
Venice, Venice, the story
went all over the world.

689
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,290
And at every single one I have a gun to
their bravo. The message was the same.

690
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,710
We have our first woman Gondolier,

691
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,113
uh,

692
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,363
Rashad.

693
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,310
Oh,

694
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,100
totally. And not held true

695
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,690
the,

696
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,590
so that was something, it was unstoppable.
I could not go in there and say,

697
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,160
excuse me, you know, I'm
not really, you know,

698
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,000
the identifying, no, it was gone. Okay.

699
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,620
It was done. Alex,

700
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:49,030
at this point in 2007,

701
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:53,800
doesn't have any other income except
for being able to market himself through

702
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:58,060
hotels and eventually
online and sold. Of course,

703
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:00,070
I need to have a website.

704
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,330
People are actively seeking out this
person who has broken the gender barrier

705
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:09,190
and become the first female gondolier
inventist so it would have been stupid to

706
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:12,700
try to go against those.
This was already written.

707
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,270
So Alex decides to make his email,

708
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,340
his Facebook page and his website,

709
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,020
all premed Gondola era or
the first female gondolier.

710
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,460
Um, I'm wondering if creating
a website with that name.

711
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,100
Did that feel like taking control

712
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,150
of that narrative or was that narrative
taking control of your decision on that

713
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,530
website? It's nothing to do with
what I've on. That's a label.

714
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,950
You know, I cannot change
a label who has, you know,

715
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,380
20 years of history shot up.

716
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,230
Alex told us he was talking
to his therapist one day
at this transgender center

717
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:59,100
they have near Venice and she
said, you are like in the cage.

718
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,300
This is like a cage for you. You can't
get really out of this. You know,

719
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,680
it's a, it's a difficult situation.

720
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,560
It's a very difficult situation. But, uh,

721
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,383
I'm tired.

722
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,600
[inaudible]

723
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,500
no, I thought the nasty

724
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,823
[inaudible]

725
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,053
[inaudible]

726
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,753
[inaudible]

727
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,100
[inaudible]

728
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,640
by the time we met Alex, he'd been living
almost 10 years like this, you know,

729
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:46,641
just kind of between these two stories
at night out to his close friends.

730
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:50,970
But by day giving these tours as
the first female gondolier in Venice

731
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,140
and every few months,
every new tourist season,

732
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:57,880
these headlines would just regenerate.
First female gondolier first female,

733
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,570
gondolier first female.
And when we left Venice,

734
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:01,860
that's kind of where we left him

735
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,420
kind of hanging in the middle of that.

736
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,350
And the impression that we got is maybe
that's just going to be how it always is

737
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,184
for him.

738
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,460
By the way, we didn't see each
other. So fast forward six months,

739
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,000
we get an email from Alex. He
says he's in San Francisco.

740
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,630
Uh, things have been happening in
your life. Yeah, he had some news.

741
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,650
Well, you know, I remember
when we were sitting,

742
00:46:36,651 --> 00:46:40,880
when we were last talking in Venice
and we were sitting on the terrorists.

743
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,110
I remember that. Uh,

744
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,720
I was already in, I knew
there was something coming,

745
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,410
but I've, I wasn't sure what it was.

746
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,560
[inaudible]

747
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,150
it was a very difficult year.

748
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,010
I was kind of depressed,
which, you know, I'm not,

749
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,500
I'm not a depressed person
usually. And so I was hanging out.

750
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,400
Uh, I was not moving much.
I was hanging out on,

751
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:17,670
on my sofa and I was trying to think,

752
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,190
and I was a

753
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,060
more and more every day
I was unhappy about,

754
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,270
people are telling me that
I was a she and another he,

755
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,030
I don't know why I got completely
intolerant before I was like,

756
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,730
I don't care what they say to me. Uh,

757
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:38,890
I care that they're nice and now I
was last leg. I can't do this anymore.

758
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:39,790
I was so wrong.

759
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:44,780
[inaudible]

760
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,790
Alex was about to turn 50 at this point.

761
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,020
And it turns out that part of what was
happening was that he was beginning to go

762
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:57,710
through the early stages
of menopause. I was hot.

763
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,810
That was tired, sweat,
breaking out for nothing.

764
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,200
After fighting with the Gondoliers,
fighting with the feminists.

765
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,020
This was like a final insult. So, um,

766
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,440
I have this idea that homeless
might help with how I feel.

767
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:20,150
I started to take the, the testosterone
that was on the 7th of November,

768
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,310
which after six hours, uh, I get
the first smile on my face in, in,

769
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:28,670
in nearly a year. Like, you know, I felt,

770
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,540
felt good and the mood
swings, they stopped. Yeah.

771
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,930
So I'm now, I'm like, I,

772
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:37,580
I knew me because I was looking in
the mirror every day and I was like,

773
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:42,490
who is this monster? He decided to fly
to San Francisco, meet with a doctor. Uh,

774
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,630
some people wait like two years or
three years before they start to do a

775
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:47,464
surgery.

776
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,000
I wanted to do it now because for me
it was something like now or never.

777
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,900
Uh, so now, uh, I'm here in San Francisco.

778
00:48:55,901 --> 00:49:00,490
I've had top surgery on the
24 days. That's about, yeah,

779
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:02,600
four days ago. And

780
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,490
I wanted to start this year with
a buddy, which is confirming me.

781
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,180
People see me as a first
woman. I'm going to the end.

782
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:23,740
That means something for many
people, it's not fair to them.

783
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,620
So you know, I need to, I
needed to say something.

784
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,430
I changed on the Facebook
side or changed the name.

785
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,490
Now it's a Alexei Gondola truce
and I did already a state.

786
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,620
Then on my, on my old website,
there is a statement, it says,

787
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,900
dear guests, colleagues and friends,

788
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,570
after holding myself
back for three decades,

789
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,740
it's time for me to depart from my
wrong body. I am not changing who I am.

790
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,540
I am becoming who I am.

791
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,310
And is he, uh, back in Venice now? Yeah.

792
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,163
Huh?

793
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,080
Do you have any sense of what that's
going to mean for his job or his life?

794
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,830
I have no idea. I have no clue.

795
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,510
I don't know how my voice is going
to be in a month. It should drop.

796
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,310
I have no idea how my face is.
Gonna look in my buddies. I'm

797
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,410
gonna look in the three
years, three years from now,

798
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,300
we all leave it as a surprise.

799
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,300
Hello? Hello.

800
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,870
Well idea. That's scary.

801
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,753
Okay.

802
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,570
Oh, hello. [inaudible]

803
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,883
[inaudible]

804
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,180
thanks to report Kristen
Clark and David Conrad also,

805
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:37,181
thanks to Alexis Unger and summer and
of course a huge thanks to Alex for

806
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:39,920
sharing a very difficult story with us.

807
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,400
Are you worried about what the responses
might be to it? Oh my God, David.

808
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,300
I love warrior. You
think this is boring me?

809
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,810
I've been to worst, I guess.

810
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,270
I remember like when we were
sitting out on the balcony,

811
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:57,000
you had said something like, I
don't want to do another battle,

812
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,110
but I don't want to do another
bubble. But if I have to,

813
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:03,710
I will because I,

814
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,810
I hope that it can at least
help one person out then

815
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,223
[inaudible]

816
