00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.790
Here's a question - Why do we get goosebumps?

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.970
And is there a way we can take that knowledge,
and turn it into money?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:16.910
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with yet another
scientific invention that proves just how

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.630
awesome - and simultaneously terrifying - the
future will be.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.239
A research team from South Korea has developed
a sensor, capable of measuring goosebumps

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.400
on the human body in real time.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.650
The way it works is, they place a conductive
sensor on the surface of the skin - so when

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.140
a person develops goosebumps, and their skin
buckles slightly - it creates a drop in the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.840
electrical charge that's stored in the sensor.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.970
That allows researchers to precisely measure
how big the goosebumps are, and how long they

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.970
last.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.150
Now why would something like this be useful?

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.400
Well, goosebumps are a physiological response
- but they're also an emotional response,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.720
so being able to measure someone's goosebumps,
is a gateway to information about their emotional

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
state.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.170
It's kinda like the final frontier for biometric
monitoring.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.790
Obviously, not everyone's gonna be wearing
one of these things all the time - but in

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.110
certain situations, like film screenings - it
could allow marketers to see exactly which

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.720
parts of a movie people respond strongly to.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.540
From there, you can imagine personalized advertisements,
music, and tons of other services - catered

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.050
specifically to the user.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.940
The film industry has been doing something
similar for years now - albeit, without this

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.030
technology.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.310
But audience reactions to test screenings
have often informed the final edit of a movie.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.090
So being able to harness that information,
in a precise, measurable way - could be extremely

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.750
valuable to both marketers and advertisers.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
Potential dystopian future aside, this article
got me wondering - about why humans even get

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.750
goosebumps.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.790
What purpose do they serve?

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.880
And how did they become a part of our biology?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.470
Well, it turns out - they're a gift from our
animal ancestors.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.220
And like many of the things we've inherited,
they serve no modern function whatsoever.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.119
Beneath the surface of our skin, there are
tiny muscles, called arrector pili muscles,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.400
that attach to each individual hair follicle.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.909
When you're especially cold, those muscles
contract - creating tiny depressions in the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.560
skin, that cause everything around them to
stand up - including your hair.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.130
Goosebumps actually get their name - because
they strongly resemble the way a bird's skin

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.090
looks - after its feathers have been plucked.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.520
Of course in animals with thick fur, this
kind of physiological response makes total

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.520
sense.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.950
When their hair stands up, it creates an added
layer of insulation around their bodies, allowing

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.590
them to retain more heat.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.920
Goosebumps are also the reason that animals
hair tends to stand up when they feel threatened.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.230
That, in combination with the stance they
assume - makes them appear bigger and more

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.750
threatening to enemies.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.430
Obviously, this reaction is useless for us
humans - because we don't have thick layers

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.430
of fur.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.170
Well, most of us don't.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.980
But we still experience goosebumps, so what's
causing them?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.569
Well, it boils down to adrenaline, the stress
hormone.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.600
Animals release adrenaline when they're either
cold, or under stress.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.550
It's what prepares them for fight-or-flight
situations.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.100
Humans experience the same thing - but in
more kinds of situations.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.489
When we're cold, when we're afraid, when we're
under stress, or when we're feeling strong

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.970
emotions - all of those responses cause our
bodies to release adrenaline.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.660
And one of the hallmark features of an adrenaline
rush - is the contraction of our skin muscles.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.130
Hence, goosebumps.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.910
Aside from the fact that they serve no modern
purpose for humans - they're still one of

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.760
the most obvious indicators of our current
emotional state.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:39.019
Now whether or not companies should be harnessing
that information - is a topic of much debate.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.640
So I'm curious to know what you guys think.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.379
Could technology like this, be used for good?

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.120
Or is it just another way for people to sell
us stuff?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.970
Feel free to leave your responses in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.050
watching!
