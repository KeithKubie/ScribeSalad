00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.000
 In this video we will talk about another way 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.930
 for imaging data, called a histogram, 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.900
 which is a modern word for a less modern thing. 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.870
 I think it's probably right to say that the histogram 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.230
 is the most used way of presenting data. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 Let me show you how to make a histogram for some data 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 and I think you will understand the essence very easily. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.290
 I have some data here and 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.230
 I want to present them with a histogram. 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.970
 We'll see how often each of these numbers is. 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.900
 And to clarify this, let me write the numbers below 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.230
 and categorize them in the appropriate categories. 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680
 I have here 1. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.440
 I have 1. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.150
 I have 4, I want to leave room for 2, 3 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.280
 and put 4 here. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.520
 I have 2. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.220
 I have 1. 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.190
 Let me put this 1 on top, just above the other 1. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 I have 0 - let me put 0 left of 1. 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 I want to put them in order. 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.650
 I have 2, another 2. 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.820
 Let me put it above the first 2. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.100
 I have one more. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.510
 Let me place it above the other 2 units. 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.930
 I have another 0. 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.990
 I'll put it there. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.430
 I have another one. 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.810
 One more 1. 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.360
 Then I have another 2. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.700
 Another 1! 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 I have two more zeros. 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.690
 0, 0. 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.175
 I have two more pairs. 

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:37.770
 Two 2. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.790
 I have 3. 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.360
 I have two more units. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 Two units. 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.830
 Another 3. 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.290
 Then I have 6. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.050
 No 5, then I have 6. 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.480
 The place there was not necessary. 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.970
 But here I simply copied these numbers 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.620
 and I actually categorized them. 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.990
 Now I want to calculate how much of each of these numbers we have. 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.290
 Let me start at the bottom. 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.789
 I want to look at the frequency of each of these numbers. 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.780
 The frequency of each of these numbers. 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.790
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4 zeros. 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.660
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 units. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pairs. 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.500
 I have 1, 2 threes. 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.930
 I have one 4 and one 6. 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.590
 So we can write it this way. 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 We can write the number 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.100
 and then the frequency. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.990
 Frequency. 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.030
 I have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.800
 we can also put 5 there, 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.290
 although 5 has a frequency of 0. 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.630
 We have 6. 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.850
 0 was shown 4 times in this data table. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.570
 1 has been shown 7 times in this data table. 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.830
 2 was shown 5 times in this data table, 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.380
 3 was shown 2 times, 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.740
 4 showed 1 time, 5 did not show, 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.820
 and 6 was shown 1 time. 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.850
 I simply counted this dataset. 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.010
 But you may ask yourself how many times we see 0. 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.440
 I see it 1, 2, 3, 4 times. 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.040
 How many times do I see 1? 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.980
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 times. 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.690
 That we mean by "frequency". 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.960
 The histogram is actually just a graph, a kind of column diagram, 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.980
 showing the frequency of each of these numbers. 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.470
 It will look very similar to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.400
 this initial thing I drew. 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.020
 Let's draw some axes here. 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.040
 Here the different fields are the numbers. 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.390
 And that's because we're dealing with very clean whole numbers, 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.620
 which are repeated. 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.520
 If we work with data where the numbers do not repeat, 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.100
 people will often put the numbers in columns or categories. 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.290
 But here they fit in nice little fields. 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.800
 We have the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.870
 These are the numbers for the moment. 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.595
 And then on the vertical axis 

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:15.190
 we will set the frequency. 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.430
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.480
 This is 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.120
 0 is displayed 4 times. 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.860
 We'll make a small column diagram here. 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.820
 0 is displayed 4 times. 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820
 I'll do it just like that. 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.210
 0 is displayed 4 times. 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.010
 That's the information right there. 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.260
 1 is displayed 7 times. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.850
 I'll make a small column chart. 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.520
 1 is displayed 7 times. 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.630
 Exactly. 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.120
 I want to make it a bit clearer than that - 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.790
 1 is displayed 7 times. 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.890
 7 times. 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.815
 2 - I will do it in another color - 2 is displayed 5 times. 

00:05:03.815 --> 00:05:06.930
 2 is displayed 5 times 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.260
 Make a column chart, go up to 5. 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.770
 2 is displayed 5 times. 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.740
 3 is displayed twice. 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.250
 3 is displayed twice. 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.210
 We have two 3. 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.750
 4 is shown here once. 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.910
 4 is shown here once. 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.800
 5 is not displayed at all. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.100
 Here we will not have any height. 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.010
 Finally, 6 is shown 1 time. 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.140
 I will make 6 appear 1 time. 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.160
 What I did here is a histogram. 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.850
 Here is a histogram. 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.420
 A very modern word, but I think you will agree, 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.960
 that the idea is quite simple. 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.120
 We clarify the frequency of each of these numbers, 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.090
 then we present it on the chart, 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.260
 and we get a histogram.
