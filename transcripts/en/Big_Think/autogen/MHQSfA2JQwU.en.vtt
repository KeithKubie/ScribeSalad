takes too long there are some ways to

takes too long there are some ways to
overcome this it's a little bit funny to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
overcome this it's a little bit funny to
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800
overcome this it's a little bit funny to
think about it but but in some ways the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
think about it but but in some ways the
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480
think about it but but in some ways the
most practical way to ship very large

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
most practical way to ship very large
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.899
most practical way to ship very large
data sets is to use FedEx or UPS or some

it's not the sexy application that you
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.399
it's not the sexy application that you
would want for an Internet company but

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
would want for an Internet company but
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590
would want for an Internet company but
that's a that's a practical way to do it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
that's a that's a practical way to do it
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.289
that's a that's a practical way to do it
so that's the main technical barrier and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
so that's the main technical barrier and
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.620
so that's the main technical barrier and
then storing data in the cloud opens up

then storing data in the cloud opens up
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.529
then storing data in the cloud opens up
a lot of other challenges and

definitely don't want to expose without

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
definitely don't want to expose without
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830
definitely don't want to expose without
without giving it some consideration so

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
without giving it some consideration so
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420
without giving it some consideration so
the concern is is if if all of this

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
the concern is is if if all of this
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.660
the concern is is if if all of this
genetic information is in the cloud and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
genetic information is in the cloud and
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580
genetic information is in the cloud and
you're not careful about how that data

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
you're not careful about how that data
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.979
you're not careful about how that data
is protected it could leak out it could

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
is protected it could leak out it could
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.259
is protected it could leak out it could
you know you know could accidentally be

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269
you know you know could accidentally be
 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.839
you know you know could accidentally be
exposed to other people and then also if

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849
exposed to other people and then also if
 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.089
exposed to other people and then also if
big archives are made that has collected

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099
big archives are made that has collected
 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.190
big archives are made that has collected
many thousands of people this could

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200
many thousands of people this could
 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.530
many thousands of people this could
suddenly become an attractive target so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
suddenly become an attractive target so
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750
suddenly become an attractive target so
today we're a little bit guarded in the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760
today we're a little bit guarded in the
 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.339
today we're a little bit guarded in the
sense of this genetic information is

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
sense of this genetic information is
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.130
sense of this genetic information is
decentralized in many different labs so

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
decentralized in many different labs so
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.869
decentralized in many different labs so
that if there's a breach at one lab it's

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
that if there's a breach at one lab it's
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.210
that if there's a breach at one lab it's
relatively localized if everything gets

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
relatively localized if everything gets
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.280
relatively localized if everything gets
aggregated together it becomes a little

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
aggregated together it becomes a little
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.050
aggregated together it becomes a little
bit more risky because it becomes a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
bit more risky because it becomes a
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.819
bit more risky because it becomes a
little bit more attractive as a target

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829
little bit more attractive as a target
 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.729
little bit more attractive as a target
I think these challenges can be overcome

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739
I think these challenges can be overcome
 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.589
I think these challenges can be overcome

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599
the encryption technologies the
 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.229
the encryption technologies the
authentication technologies they exist

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
authentication technologies they exist
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.809

they certainly exists and there are

they certainly exists and there are

certainly possible to do so but we just

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790
certainly possible to do so but we just
 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.220
certainly possible to do so but we just
got to be so certain that we get it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
got to be so certain that we get it
 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.839
got to be so certain that we get it
right on the first try alright we don't

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849
right on the first try alright we don't
 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.819
right on the first try alright we don't
want to create this big database that

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829
want to create this big database that
 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.349
want to create this big database that
has all the student and Ike information

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359
has all the student and Ike information
 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.250
has all the student and Ike information
and then accidentally leave it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260
and then accidentally leave it
 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.629
and then accidentally leave it
vulnerable we just have to be really

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639
vulnerable we just have to be really
 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.450
vulnerable we just have to be really
careful about how that's engineering

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460
careful about how that's engineering
 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.520
careful about how that's engineering
