00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, the period of a mass spring system is given by this equation

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and notice that it's proportional to √m.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If I want the period to double, I need to quadruple m since √4 is 2.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The mass I should attach should have a mass of 4 m.
