00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 4851,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so suppose we have 100 people, and I'm not going to try and draw 100 people,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but here we have N people.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In order to be able to communicate with everyone else,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the first person will need a shared key with every other person,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so that's going to be N-1 key shared between Alice

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and the N-1 other people.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The second person already has a shared key with Alice

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but needs a shared key with everyone else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is N-2 additional keys.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The third person that has keys shared with Alice and Bob

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
needs a key with everyone else, and this continues until

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the next to last person, who needs a key shared with the last person.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That means we need the summation from N-1 down to 1,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or we can think of that going forward 1+2+...up to N-1,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and that simplifies to N-1 times N-2 divided by 2.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For 100 people, this would be 99 times 98 divided by 2,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is 4851, which might not sound too bad,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but 100 people is a pretty small number.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If we think of doing this for the billion or so people on the internet,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then we would need around 10 to the 18 keys.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This isn't really a solution, both because of the huge number of keys that are needed

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the need to establish all of these pairwise keys.

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We haven't really solved our problem.
