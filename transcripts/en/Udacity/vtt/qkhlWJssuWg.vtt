00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's start by discussing what the keyword this is for.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.530
This is an identifier that gets a value bound to it, much like a variable.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.930
But instead of identifying the values explicitly in your code,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.770
this gets bound to the correct object automatically.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.580
Now mostly, the rules for how the interpreter determines the what

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.450
the correct binding is, resemble the rules for positional function parameters.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.960
The differences between positional function parameters and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.150
the keyword this are designed to support your intuition about

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.000
which object should be focal when you're invoking a method or a constructor.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.590
There are a lot of misconceptions out there.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.260
So, let's clear them up by going through a list of the things that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.680
the keyword this specifically won't be bound to
