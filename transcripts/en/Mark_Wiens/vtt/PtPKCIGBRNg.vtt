00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:08.498
(mellow hip-hop)

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:18.970
- Oh that's superb, it's
called snakefruit in english,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.551
sala in Thai.

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.870
What a wonderful fruit.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.460
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.510
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Chanthaburi, Thailand,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.830
and this is day three of our eastern

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.163
provinces of Thailand food tour.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:34.320
Today we are driving
from Chanthaburi to Trat,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.040
and there are, we're gonna stop at two

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.750
legendary restaurants, and
that's the plan for the day,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.760
so I'm gonna share all
of the delicious food

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.410
with you in this video right now.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.688
And we've got a whole bag for the road.

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:51.438
(mellow hip-hop)

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.760
There's this one phrase
in Thai, (speaks Thai)

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.830
and that directly translates to,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.850
if you haven't eaten this dish,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.270
you haven't arrived to this destination.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.310
And every province in Thailand,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.640
almost every city has a
couple of these dishes.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.516
We are about to eat this
dish, and it was just about

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:31.123
a 15-minute drive from
the center of Chanthaburi.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:34.230
This is a place, it's in the countryside,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.545
it's gonna be good.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.045
(speaks Thai)

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.979
(mellow hip-hop)

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.996
(speaks Thai)

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.610
Here it is, the dish is
called kuay teow moo liang,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.840
and this is, if you ask
anyone from Chanthaburi,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.257
a dish that you cannot miss
when you visit Chanthaburi,

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.123
again the dish that you
haven't arrived to Chantaburi

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:43.320
until you've tried, this is the dish.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.490
You can choose your noodles,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.520
and then there's some pork in it,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.840
and then she also has
a beef version as well.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.890
I think it's all about the broth.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.110
In that broth simmering

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.520
you can see whole chunks of pineapple,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.198
and there's both chicken
and pork in there,

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:58.310
and so definitely the
first thing you have to do

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.560
is just taste that broth.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.830
Mmm, yeah it does have that kind of like,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.830
fruity, acidic touch from the pineapple,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.120
but like with all good bowls of noodles,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.020
it's time to season.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.910
I'm gonna go in first
for some chili vinegar.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.460
Oh this is some thick
and hearty chili vinegar.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.312
Oh that looks fantastic,
and then of course,

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:23.220
you gotta go in for the chili flakes.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.150
Stir this up a little bit,
and I went with senbei,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.910
which is this type of rice
noodle, the medium-sized.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.300
There's also a little bit
of vegetables in here,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.853
some water morning glory,
and then some other herb.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.180
Oh, that chili vinegar, that's good stuff.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.170
Overall, the entire dish is
a little on the sweet side.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.170
The broth is kinda sweet, but
balanced with that vinegar

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.753
and the chili flakes, it's good.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.593
I'd like to try the beef version next.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.088
And also some meatballs,
same noodles, same broth,

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:10.150
but this is (speaks Thai)
which is like braised beef.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.310
We gotta go in for that broth,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.610
and I'm go in for some
of those herbs as well.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.310
Oh that pineapple sweetness,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.930
and this chili vinegar is
the condiment of choice.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.663
This is where it's at.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.190
And mix that around, add a little bit

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.190
of those little chili
flakes, mix this guy up.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.190
Okay, and on this bite
I gotta go for some,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.411
a little bit of everything,
especially with that beef.

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.161
(mellow hip-hop)

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.600
Oh, that's still really hot.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.950
Okay, how 'bout a meatball.

00:05:03.782 --> 00:05:06.820
Oh, that has a pretty nice texture,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.590
and you can taste the
black pepper in that.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.976
Meatballs like that have
really started to grow on me.

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:13.726
(mellow hip-hop)

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.530
For me, it's okay, not amazing.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.045
It's a little on the sweet side,

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.300
but it's definitely a dish you have to eat

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.780
when you come to Chanthaburi,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.390
and the location, they're really friendly.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.090
The location here is fantastic,
the atmosphere is great.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.630
From here, we are driving towards Trat,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.342
and the next restaurant is the one

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:47.420
I'm most looking forward to today.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.050
We're gonna have a rice and curry feast

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.130
of local Trat dishes.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.650
It's about a 30-minute drive to get there,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.742
we're on our way now.

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:57.492
(mellow hip-hop)

00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:19.298
(speaks Thai)

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.560
That was about a 30-minute
drive to get to this restaurant,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.450
and this is one of the most
legendary (speaks Thai)

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.950
restaurants, which is rice
and curry restaurants.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.950
We just crossed over the border
from Chanthaburi to Trat,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.210
so we're about 20 kilometers
outside of Trat town right now,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.870
but we're in the province,
and we're here before 11 a.m.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.710
They only have a small
selection, but the good new is,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.150
they still have some
awesome dishes to try,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.519
and I ordered everything
they had that looked good.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.660
(speaks Thai)

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.010
And by the way, this restaurant is called

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.420
Khao Gaeng San Toong.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.660
I'll begin with this dish right here,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.160
which is called (speaks Thai) and

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.520
this is a dish that I've never had before.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.820
It's some type of fish, stir-fried with,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.930
I think it's cucumber, there
are some herbs in there,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.400
there's chilis, this looks fantastic.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.553
It looks awesome.

00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:34.750
(moaning happily)

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.873
Yeah, it's a very firm fish,
almost like, like a tuna,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.158
and then the cucumber
and the type of melon,

00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:46.460
it's really soft and sort
of melts in your mouth.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.780
You've got, I believe
that's holy basil in there,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.820
which has a little bit of a peppery,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.300
almost tingly sensation to your tongue.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.290
And then it has a, has a little bit

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.530
of a sweet/spicy balance to it.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.570
Next dish is (speaks Thai),

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.050
this is some type of
little snails or shellfish,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.130
I think some type of, looks
like little blood cockels,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.580
and then that's pineapple, but you can see

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.530
all the chilis folded in there as well.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.043
Oh, oh that's awesome.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.550
Something I love about the
food in this region of Thailand

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.550
is how they really mix
the savory with the sweet,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.100
but for the sweet how they
often use lots of fruit.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.480
Of all the dishes though,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.973
the dish I'm most excited that they had,

00:08:38.973 --> 00:08:41.673
that I had to order immediately
was the (speaks Thai).

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.010
Now, kwang is a, it's a type of deer,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.190
and it's stir-fried with naw sabparod,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.530
which is the top of the pineapple,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.040
you know that part with the
kind of spikes that come off

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.670
that you pull off the top of a pineapple

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.160
before you cut open a pineapple.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.650
That is what it's stir-fried with,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.330
and I think it's the bottom pieces of that

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.530
where they slice it up finely.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.820
I believe the official name
for it is pineapple crown,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.320
it's the top of the pineapple.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.790
Oh that is the dish.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.940
Absolutely sensational.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.220
You do, I mean if you think about it,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.477
you can actually taste the pineapple.

00:09:22.477 --> 00:09:25.730
I mean it has more of a subtle flavor,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.950
it has a texture that's
similar in a crunch

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.351
that's similar to a bamboo shoot.

00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:32.633
It has this really, like,

00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:35.573
satisfying crunch in your mouth.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.030
Okay, that's the dish.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.970
I think I better order
another plate before they

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.440
run out of it.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.260
Oh that's good, that's outstanding.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.317
Next dish is (speaks Thai),

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:54.000
and (speaks Thai) is king mackerel,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.870
but then they're made into
lukchin which are meatballs,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.203
or fish balls, and it looks
like a nice green curry sauce.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.610
That one's a little more
on the sweeter side.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.640
It does have kind of a
more green curry property,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.047
so I think they are using
green chilis in that,

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:19.047
and it has a nice refreshing
citrus-y taste to it.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.610
Maybe coming from those kaffir lime leaves

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.500
as well as the basil in
there, the sweet basil.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.983
The fish meatballs
themselves are very spongy.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.400
They have an extreme bounce to them.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.510
And finally, just 'cause they had it,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.450
we got a, this is a mackerel.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.503
It's kind of a candied, it's
definitely gonna be sweet.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.920
I knew it was gonna be sweet.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.180
It's okay, it's not my favorite.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.640
It almost has like, a sweet and salty,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.727
syrupy kind of taste to it.

00:10:49.727 --> 00:10:54.727
Put on a few chilis, and
this dish is also a stunner.

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:57.508
(mellow hip-hop)

00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:16.536
(speaks Thai)

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.790
And this is one of those dishes

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.280
that I absolutely had to order
another plate for dessert.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.820
There's nothing more
exciting in front of me

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.520
than this plate of food right now.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.834
That's just spectacular.

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:40.053
That is my favorite dessert.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.640
Wow, what a dish.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.420
You can really taste the
black pepper in there, too.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.276
Oh that's a pure happiness dish.

00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:55.026
(mellow hip-hop)

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:01.152
- Micah?

00:12:01.152 --> 00:12:02.090
- Was that Micah?

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.310
Micah, did you scratch my nose?

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.870
I just noticed I have a
little scratch on my nose.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.703
Okay.

00:12:06.703 --> 00:12:09.100
That was a spectacular meal,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.900
and even though they didn't have that many

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.200
choices of dishes to order,
all of them are good,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.047
specifically the deer
with the pineapple crown.

00:12:18.047 --> 00:12:19.500
And just, every time I say crown

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.680
I gotta go like this, pineapple crown.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.040
That's the dish you have to order,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.270
that's the dish you have to eat,

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.810
and it will be impossible
to stop at one plate.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.550
You'll have to eat two
back-to-back plates,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.190
one plate for dessert.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.310
Oh, my mouth is just rejoicing.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.330
That's one of those plates of food

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.630
where your mouth is rejoicing
after you finish it.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.660
We probably have just
about 15 or 20 minutes

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.670
before we arrive to the
center of Trat town.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.200
Whoa.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.250
And a little snakefruit to finish it off.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.970
If you could smell the car in here,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.410
the entire car smells like snakefruit.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.653
Kind of like that, that
fermented fruity taste.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.382
Alright. And we're off.

00:12:58.382 --> 00:13:01.132
(mellow hip-hop)

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.470
Welcome to Trat, and I can already feel

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.720
the relaxation setting in.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.440
That was just about a 15-minute drive

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.680
from the restaurant to get
here, and we're staying

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.400
at a place that's called
Baan Rim Nam Resort.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.280
I'll have the information
in the description box,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.480
but Trat is very well-known,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.420
especially as being a jump-off point

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.630
for many of the different islands.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.860
So, a lot of people just kind
of pass through this town,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.550
go jump on a ferry or speedboat,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.300
and head directly to the island.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.490
But, we have two full days here,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.570
have some very cool things planned

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.160
that I'm gonna share with
you in this video series.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.420
We'll be doing a full food
tour of Trat the town,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.210
and then also have a trip
planned to a village to cook some

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.570
local food that will all be
coming up in this video series.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.280
But for now, today we're
just gonna hang out.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.740
So I'm gonna end today's video right now,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.260
what a day it's been.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.140
What a spectacular meal.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.180
I still have the flavor of that deer

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.100
and those pineapple crowns
lingering on my tastebuds.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.453
Oh, that was delicious.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.780
