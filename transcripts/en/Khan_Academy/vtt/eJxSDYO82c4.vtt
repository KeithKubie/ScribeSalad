00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.340
Given capital F of x is equal
to g of x to the third power

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.940
where the graph of g and its
tangent line at x equals 4

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.970
are shown, what is the
value of F prime of 4?

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.710
So they give us g of x
right over here in blue.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.650
And they show us
the tangent line

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.940
at x equals 4 right over here.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.860
So we need to figure
out F prime of 4.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.040
So let's just rewrite this
information they've given us.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.640
We know that F of x is equal
to g of x to the third power.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.230
So I'll write it like this,
g of x to the third power.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.560
So we want to figure
out what F prime of x

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.636
is when x is equal to 4.

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:46.010
So let's just take
the derivative

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.710
here of both sides
with respect to x.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.760
So take the derivative
of the left-hand side

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.190
with respect to x, and
take the derivative

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.842
of the right-hand side
with respect to x.

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.300
So the left-hand
side, this is just

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.390
going to be capital
F prime of x.

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:05.960
Now on the right-hand
side I have a composite.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.850
I have g of x to
the third power.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.770
So first we can view this as the
product of the derivative of g

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.410
of x to the third power
with respect to g of x.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.360
So there we could
literally just apply

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990
what we know about
the power rule.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.150
The derivative of x to the
third with respect to x is 3x

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.860
squared.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.840
So the derivative of gx to the
third with respect to g of x

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.210
is just going to be three times
g of x to the second power.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.850
And then we're going to multiply
that times the derivative of g

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.680
of x with respect to x.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.904
So times g prime of x

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.820
And this comes straight
out of the chain rule.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.030
Derivative of this,
the derivative

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880
of g of x to the third
with respect to g

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.690
of x, which is this,
times the derivative

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.450
of g of x with respect to x,
which is that right over there.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.670
So now let's just substitute.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940
We want to figure out
what this derivative is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.900
when x is equal to 4.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.550
So we could say
that F prime of 4

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:19.590
is equal to 3 times g of 4
squared times g prime of 4.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.779
So what is g of 4 going to be?

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.070
Well, we can just look at
our function right over here.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.785
When x equals 4, our
function is equal to 3.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.160
So g of 4 is equal to 3.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.340
And what's g prime of 4?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.320
So when x equals
4, g prime of 4 is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020
the slope of the tangent line.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.160
And they've drawn the tangent
line when x equals 4 here.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200
So what is the
slope of this line?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.700
So we just have to think about
change in y over change in x.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.280
And I'll look at that between
two integer-valued coordinates.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.970
So it looks like between
these two points.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.460
And when we increase x
by 2, we decrease y by 4.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.450
So as you remember,
slope is rise

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.170
over run, or change
in y over change in x.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.790
So the slope of the tangent
line here, the slope

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.250
is equal to our
change in y negative 4

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.810
over our change in x.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.820
And this is going to
be equal to negative 2.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.141
So this simplifies to F
prime of 4 is equal to-- I'll

00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:40.590
do this in a new color--
3 squared is 9 times 3

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:51.450
is 27 times negative 2, which
is equal to negative 54.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.160
So F prime of 4 is negative 54.
