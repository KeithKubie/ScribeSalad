00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.630
Take a walk down memory lane.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.700
Excuse the mess.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.570
MIKE WOLFE: Oh, this
isn't messy for us.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.500
FRANK FRITZ: Uh-uh.
- These are what I really like.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.770
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.300
This is the largest collection
of Marx toys on display

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.400
anywhere in the world.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.930
Collecting toys is a fever.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.270
I hope there's no cure.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.830
MIKE WOLFE: There's, like,
so much stuff to see in here.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.770
I love it.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.000
You know you're
getting older when

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300
the toys that you
played with as a kid

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.430
are now considered antiques.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.000
So Francis, is everything
I'm looking at here for sale?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.500
A lot of stuff is for sale.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Here's a really nice toy.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200
This one was made
in Great Britain.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.270
You don't see too many march
toys made in Great Britain.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.670
FRANK FRITZ: A lot of these
toys I've had, or still have.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.070
But the Goofy toy--

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.200
I don't have this one.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.330
Missing one ear, though.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.030
FRANK FRITZ: It is
missing one ear.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.430
But the ears are
made out of rubber.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.630
You can make them
and put it back in.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.170
Or you can just leave
it the way it is.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.300
Does it work?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.600
Oh, oh, oh.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.570
It's kind of a funny toy
with his legs going everywhere.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.970
FRANK FRITZ: That is so cool.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.870
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.570
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.370
Kind of reminds
me of my wife going

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.600
around in circles all the time.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.830
FRANK FRITZ: [laughs] Is this
something you would sell?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.200
Yeah, I would sell--

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.500
$475.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.000
It's in great condition.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
And what the seller is is
when Frances bombed it up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.700
and it did the full circle
right in front of me.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.070
He had me at the first lap.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.630
How about $450?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.530
$450?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.100
- We're so close.
- So close.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.830
I can do it.
- $450?

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.230
- $450.
- All right.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.200
It's not scuffed up.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.500
It's in great condition.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.430
It works.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030
I think it's worth
at least $700.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.170
What about the Buck Rogers one?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.570
Buck Rogers was a pulp
fiction hero from the 1920s

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.930
that traveled through space.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.370
He started out in books.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.130
Then he went to comic strips,
then he went to the radio,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.070
then he went to
television and video.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.930
He's been around
for generations.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.970
So naturally, Marx licensed
the character to make toys.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.370
What I liked about
these is, you know,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.030
they have flints inside of them.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.700
And what would happen is
when you wound them up,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.600
it would have shot
sparks out the back.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.400
Flint would come out
and take your nog off.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.630
Something like that.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.000
Yeah, I don't need the thing
hitting me in the eyes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.170
Kids toys today are digital.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.100
Whatever they're doing,
they're not actually doing

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.770
it, because it's on a screen.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.700
These toys are cool because you
had to have an imagination--

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.900
flying that through
the air, you know,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.070
winding it up, seeing
the sparks shoot out.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.230
That was a big deal back then.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.000
[toys clatter]

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.030
- Ah, hear that?
- I know.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.930
That's good.
I like that.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.300
I like that sound.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.830
FRANCIS TURNER: Very
high quality toys.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.770
They still run,
just like they did

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.100
back then when they made them.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.130
These toys are going to be
running 60, 80 years from now.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.770
FRANK FRITZ: Which one is rarer?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.830
I would think this
would be the earlier one.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.300
FRANK FRITZ: Now, both of them
have some condition problems,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.900
but they're still
very collectible.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.530
One's made in the '30s,
one's made in the early '40s.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.330
Just to see a toy
that's 80 years

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.930
old, that it still exists--

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.100
these are the kind of toys
you just can't find anymore.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.670
What would you have
to have on this one?

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.630
This one's a little--

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.100
it's got a little
damage on it here.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.530
It's been played with
on here, you know.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530
- Yeah. $450.
- $450.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.230
What would you do if
I bought both of them?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.430
$900?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.900
Ooh, that's not two--
that's still another $450.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.570
I mean, if they were
mint in the box--

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.030
yeah, then we'd be
talking $500, $600.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.330
But the way the
condition they are,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.100
I've got to get them
for a cheaper price.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.930
Let's do like $650 or so.
- $650?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.630
Yeah.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.400
No, no.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.170
We couldn't do $650.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.370
How about $700?

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.570
MIKE WOLFE: When
you're very little,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.200
you want to show off your toys.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.630
You bring them over to
your friend's house,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.000
and you guys play with
each other's toys.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.200
And you might even
do some trading.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.770
And that's where
you learn to deal.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.870
$775-- they're yours.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.130
$725.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.230
So when Francis and
Frank are going at it--

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.130
$750.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.470
It just reminded me of that.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.670
- $735.
- OK.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.930
- All right.
- I'll do it.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.200
OK.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.270
It was awesome to see
little Frankie in his element

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.630
with Francis.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.270
Francis, what can you tell
me about the Charlie McCarthy?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.430
This reminds me of
my first girlfriend.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.670
FRANK FRITZ: It's a nice
example of a Marx toy.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.670
How about $100 and a half?

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.600
FRANCIS TURNER: I can do it.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.400
All right, you got it.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.670
What can we do on the car here?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.930
It's in really
great condition.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.170
It works.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.270
When the bumper hits on
the front, the heads pop up.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.530
How about $1,200?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.930
Make it $1,250 and it's yours.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.300
I mean, I don't come
across this stuff.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.800
I think I can get $1,500
to maybe $1,800 out of it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.830
to the right guy.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.070
And now, these toys
you've got here--

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.670
these are the same concept
as Charles McCarthy.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.570
- Yeah.
- It has the same motor.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.070
Probably the same guy cast the
same stamping and everything.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.030
It's just with different
comic characters.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.230
What would you have to have
for these three characters?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.770
You have B.O. Plenty,
which came from Dick Tracy.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.670
FRANCIS TURNER: With a nose like
that, that has to be Pinocchio.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.770
That's no lie.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.870
Then you have Dopey,
one of the seven dwarfs.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.730
Like, I could do
maybe $675, and I

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.530
think that would be the best.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.530
You got a deal.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.530
This place is getting
me junk drunk.
