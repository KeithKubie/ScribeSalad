00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.400
So here's how I started to think about it. So let's say how

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.370
can we represent the idea that we have an uncertain ending. We'll one way

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.560
would be if we had some kind

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.220
of generic probability distributions over the number

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.810
of rounds that the games going to be played. But this seems like an,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.735
the simplest idea that I could think of. So here, here we have our,

00:00:15.735 --> 00:00:18.165
two criminals, and what their going to do is their going to play a

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:21.260
round of prisoner's dilemma. But at the end of that round, they're going to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.220
flip a coin. And with probability one minus gamma, that will be the last

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.480
round, it's all over. But with probability gamma,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.770
they're actually going to play again. And, and they do

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.409
this after each round. And so each round

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.530
is, is basically statistically independent of the other rounds.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.860
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.510
&gt;&gt; So the set up here is, with probability gamma,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410
the game continues. Now, notice that I chose gamma here.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.550
This was a, it's representing a probability here, but in

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.810
the past, we've used this to represent a discount factor.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.063
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:51.000
&gt;&gt; But that actually is the same thing, right?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.040
In, in, in the normal discounting, we say that the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.760
value that you get one step from now, is discounted

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.950
downward by gamma. And that's exactly what you'd take if

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.550
you worked out the expected value of a game where you

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.180
continued making steps with probability gamma. And with probability one

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.460
minus gamma, it ends if you get zero from then

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.250
until the rest of time. So every round here could

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.090
be your last, or not, right? It could be that you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.830
actually get to continue playing. Does that make some sense?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.200
&gt;&gt; That makes perfect sense.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.760
&gt;&gt; Awesome. All right, so, so yeah, this is,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.610
this is exactly that kind of situation where, well,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.390
here, let me, let me ask you a question.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.800
What's the expected number of rounds of this game?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll bet it's finite if gamma's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.080
less than one Yes, I even wrote that down.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm smart. Or at least I can read.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.250
&gt;&gt; Sure, but what's the, but, specifically we could actually write

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.050
it as a, as a, function of gamma.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.150
&gt;&gt; Let's see. If gamma were something like, 99% then

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.510
I would expect it to be about a 100, right?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.070
&gt;&gt; I think that's right.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.540
&gt;&gt; So is that, is that your answer? [LAUGH] My function

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.930
of gamma is if gamma is .99 the answer is 100.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that. It's not a total function but it's a function.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a sample. I mean, you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.280
do machine learning. Why don't you tell me what

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.780
the function would be given that sample.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.880
&gt;&gt; Well, we can make it a quiz or I could just tell you.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.700
&gt;&gt; Why don't you just tell me.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.390
&gt;&gt; Alright. So one over one minus gamma

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.050
is the answer. It works for your example.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.820
&gt;&gt; Um-hm.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.110
&gt;&gt; 1 minus .99 is 100th and we're talking 1 over that so,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.630
you get a 100. And, yea we could go through the argument as to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.111
why that's that's what it is. But this one over one minus gamma

00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:31.306
is what shows up all the time. If gamma is zero, then we're talking

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:34.290
about one over one. The game lasts one round. That's exactly what we'd expect.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.860
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm As gamma gets closer and closer to one

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.190
this pro, this quantities getting closer and closer to infinity. So,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.360
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.730
&gt;&gt; in fact if you know, it becomes unbounded as gamma hits one. So

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.620
yeah. So this is the expected of rounds, and so that means like yeah.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.110
So as you said if gamma is 0.99, it's a 100 rounds. And we

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.740
already, reasoned that at a 100 rounds the whole thing falls apart. Right, huh,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.760
and I noticed the one over one minus gamma, of course, is just like

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.890
the way we did discount factors, when we started doing MVP's in the first place.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.730
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, that, that kind of links them together.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.410
&gt;&gt; Hm, that's actually kind of neat.
