00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.290
&gt;&gt; Courtney Dell: As a
mom of three young kids,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.930
we love Doreen Cronin
and Betsy Lewin's books.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.750
They're a staple in
our house and have been

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.000
since before we actually
had children.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.250
Doreen Cronin is a lawyer turned
full-time children's book author,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.400
and Betsy Lewin got her start in
illustration and greeting cards.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.900
Together, they've collaborated
on a number of projects all

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.330
with witty themes and
beautiful illustrations,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.960
and their most recent collaboration
is "Click, Clack, Surprise"

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.940
and with that, I'll
turn it over to them.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.340
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Good morning.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.100
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Thank you all
for coming out this morning.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.710
Betsy and I are excited to be here.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.890
Betsy and I have been working
together for over 15 years

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.040
so we have been together
for a long, long time.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280
We've done quite a
few books together.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.580
Let me see if they come.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.880
There we go.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.300
So, we like to visit
a lot of schools.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.670
We like to go out on book tour.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.910
We like to come to conventions
and mostly read to the kids.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.410
That's the best part.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.710
Writing is great.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.250
I'm sure illustrating
is great but reading

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.340 position:56%
with kids is the absolute best part.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700
A lot of the books that we
do like "Click Clack Moo"

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.220
"Click Clack Peep"
"Click Clack Boo."

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.450
We like to put a lot
of sounds in there.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.930
There's movement in there.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.050
So, kids, if you're out there
and you want to make sounds,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.110 position:56%
then make some sounds, and if you
want to get up and you want to move,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.020 position:56%
you know, be respectful of your
space but you don't have to be quiet

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.240
and sit perfectly when
you read, okay?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.620
When you read, you can be animated
and join in and say what you need

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.300
to say and move your body
the way you need to move it.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.600
So, if you want to do
that today [inaudible].

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.850
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: If anybody
wants to come up front,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.980
if any of you kids want to come
up front, come right ahead.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.280
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: All right.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.730
Let's see what we've got up here.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.030
Here we go.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.330 position:56%
The "Click Clack Moo" was the first.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.630
Have you guys seen
"Click Clack Moo?"

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.510
You kids know "Click Clack Moo?"

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.290
Okay. Click Clack Moo is older than
almost every child in this room.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.100
Click Clack Moo would be
in high school right now

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.560
if Click Clack Moo was a child.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.890
So, this one -- and Click Clack
Peep, we had a little baby duck.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.190
Come on guys.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.490
Do you want to sit?

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.790
You want to sit on the floor?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.090
Do you all feel comfortable
with that?

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.390
You guys do that then, okay?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.690
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: That's it.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.990
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Now you can see.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.500
So baby duck came along
in Click Clack Peep

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.990
and he kept everybody awake --

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.690
or she kept everybody awake
for a really long time

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.660
like most new babies do
and that's their right;

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.400
and then we flashed forward a
little bit and it's her birthday.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.680
So, let's see how that
turns out for everybody.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.570
There we go.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.590
Some birthday balloons
with some mice hanging out.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.540
All right, you all ready?

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.150
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: All right.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.200
It is a very big day on the farm.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.890
A cake is baking.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.390
Streamers are streaming.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.710
Mice are floating past the window.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.080
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: The
invitations have been delivered.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.680 position:56%
You are invited to Little Duck's
birthday party under the maple tree.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.380
Cake, games, prizes, pin the
tail on the donkey canceled

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.840
by donkey, duck-duck goose.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.110
Canceled by goose.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.960
Steal the bacon.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.510
Canceled by anonymous request.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.980
I wonder who that could be.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.330
&gt;&gt; It's a pig.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.630
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: That's right.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.930
Good. Good.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.230
Good.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.530
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Everybody wants

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.710
to look their best for
Little Duck's party.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.930
Duck takes a long hot bubble
bath to look his best.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.470
He rub-a-dubs, rub-a-dubs,
rub-a-dubs clean and he walks

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.540
on over to the maple tree.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.970
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Little Duck
watches and then he rub-a-dubs too.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.280
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: The sheep
need a trim to look their best.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.590
They snippety clip, snippety
clip, snippety clip clean

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.490
and then they walk on
over to the maple tree.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.200
That's as close as I'll
ever get to singing, okay?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.890
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: [inaudible].

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.670
Little Duck watches and
then snippety-clips too.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.100
Don't do it.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.750
I'm sure half of you
have already done that.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.250
My kids have done that.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.920
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: The cat
wants to look her best.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.830
She slirp-a-lurps,
slirp-a-lurps, slirp-a-lurps clean

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.210
and then she walks on
over to the maple tree.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Little Duck
watches and then slirp-a-slirps too.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.440
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Whoops.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.270
Sorry guys.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:12.640
The chickens take a dust
bath to look their best.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.970
They shimmy shake, shimmy
shake, shimmy shake clean

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.900
and then what do they do?

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.740 position:56%
They walk on over to the maple tree.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:30.450
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Little Duck
watches and then shimmy shakes too.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.750
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: He's
looking good, right?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.100
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: She's
looking good rather.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.200
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: The pigs need
a mud bath to feel their best.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.960
So they squish and squash and
squish and squash and squish

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.820
and squash clean and then they
walk on over to the maple tree.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.510
This is my favorite.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.970
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Little Duck watches
and then squishes and squashes too.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.690
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: The cows

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.570
like themselves exactly
the way that they are.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.670
No rub a dubbing, no snippety
clipping, no slirp a lurping,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.820
no shimmy shaking, and
no squish and squashing.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.920
And then they walk on
over to the maple tree.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.270
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Farmer
Brown frosts the cake.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:39.080
He lights the candles, puts on
his best hat, and then walks

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.960
on over to the maple tree.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.260
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Good.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.400
And then they sing, you guys
can start singing, okay?

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.370
&gt;&gt; Happy birthday to you.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.180
Happy birthday to -- eew.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:06.810
A birthday surprise for
everyone under the maple tree.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.100
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: But still --

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.400
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: [inaudible]
portrait.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.700
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: --
they have a great time

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.000
and it's still a birthday,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.800
and I promise you she is not
the first little kid to show

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.960
up at a birthday party not
looking her best, right?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.260
You guys did a great job.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.510
Thank you very much.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.450
Now Betsy has been
illustrating for a long time.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.750
Am I doing that?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.770
No. So, Betsy would like to do
some drawings for you today.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.220
Now Betsy, is there anything
that you don't want to draw

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.570
that you draw a lot that
maybe you don't want to draw?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.360
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Well, you all
know I can draw farm animals.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.910
So how about giving me an animal

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.280
that you won't find
on the farm to draw?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.580
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Yes.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.880
That's a good idea.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.180
Let's think.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.570
Betsy's going to go to the easel.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.200
You guys think for a minute, raise
your hands if you've got an animal

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.600
that doesn't live on a farm
that Betsy can do for you.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.900
Go ahead sweetheart.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.510
What do you want to see?

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.810
&gt;&gt; A bear.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.110
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: A bear.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.410
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Okay.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.710
What kind of bear?

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.050
Do you want a polar
bear, a brown bear?

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.350
Do you want a polar bear?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.650
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Grizzly bear.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.950
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Polar bear.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.250
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Oh, cool.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.550
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Okay.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.000
One polar bear coming up.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.670
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Now Betsy
does the backhand so fast.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.610
You guys like to draw too?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.910
Raise your hand if you draw.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.210
Do you guys draw?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.510
You guys are artists?

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.810
Beautiful.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.660
A lot of artists in the room.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.540
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Now where
do polar bears live?

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.280
&gt;&gt; In the arctic.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.580
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: They live
up north, don't they?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.880
Okay.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.970
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: They
live at the north pole.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.260
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: So, we're
going to put this polar bear

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.110
on a cake of ice in the water.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.710
Can anybody tell me an
animal that doesn't want

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.110
to be seen by this polar bear?

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.690
A seal? You're absolutely right.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:31.370
He's just going to stay under the
water and stay away from that bear.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.390
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: That's right.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.740
Unless he does jump in the
water and see that seal,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.160
and what is the seal going to do?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.460
&gt;&gt; Swim away.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.760
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Swim away.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.060
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Swim
away as fast as he can.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.360
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Good.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.660
Good thinking.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.960
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Good job.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.260
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Okay,
let's do another animal.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.560
Let's see.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.860
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: One more and
then we'll have some questions.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.160
Yes, pumpkin.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.460
Go ahead.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.760
&gt;&gt; A tiger.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.060
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Oh, a tiger.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.360
All right.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.660
Big tiger.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.960
So, here's our tiger.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.370
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: I think so.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.670
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Okay.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:22.860
Now this tiger is on the prowl.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.340
He is looking for some prey.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.790
Boy, we got a lot of animals
that can eat you going on here.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.960
All right, we got to give
him some stripes, right?

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.800
Tigers have stripes.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.800
Let's give this guy some
stripes and whiskers.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.870
All cats have whiskers.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.370
Okay. Some more stripes.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.180
A strippy tail.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:02.330
Now, if you want to make a
drawing look like it's moving,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.110
you got to give it motion lines.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.620
So, let's give this
tiger a waving tail.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.770
See how it moves all of a sudden?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.200
And what does the tiger say?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.230
Growl. Okay.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.870
Shall we do one more drawing?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.070
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: We're
going to do one more drawing

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.510
and then we're going to see if
you guys have any questions, okay?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.780
So, if you have a question
in your head,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.320
keep it there for just one more
minute and then we're going to see

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.840
if you guys have any questions
for Betsy about drawing,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.700
about illustrating, or for me
about writing, about books.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.000
Okay. Let's see.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.300
Betsy, do you want to pick?

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.600
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: No, you pick.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.900
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: You
want me to pick?

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.200
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: You're the picker.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.500
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Okay.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.800
I did boy, girl, boy,
girl, boy girl.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.100
Yes, honey?

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.400
A lion?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.700
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: A lion?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.000
Okay.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.300
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Excellent.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.600
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Okay.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.570
Now this is going to be a little
drawing lesson for you too.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:07.360
So, first of all, lions have
big furry manes, don't they?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.800
Big fuzzy manes like that.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.600
Now we're going to give this guy --

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.050
first of all, let's
give him some ears.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.780
Then we're going to
give him a big nose

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:28.490 position:56%
and a mouth and a chin and whiskers.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:36.800
Now, here's a little game for
you to play when you get home.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.710
You know, when you look
at a person's face,

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.600 position:56%
you can tell pretty much how they're
feeling by looking at their eyes.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.370
Your eyes are the most
expressive part of your face.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.650
So, I'm going to give you three
possibilities for this lion.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.680
You have to choose.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.850
Now, you know those little --
they're called pupils in the middle

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.000
of the whites of your eyes and
they can be brown or green or blue.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.320
Now, if you want your lion
to look happy you want

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.140
to give him bouncy
eyebrows like that.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.120
If you want him to look sad,
you slant them down this way.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.170
Almost like the roof of a house
that doesn't quite meet at the top.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.290
And if you want him to
look angry, really angry,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.970
then you slant them
down the other way.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.880
Now, it's your lion so you tell
me how you want him to look.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.600
A show of hands, who
wants a happy tiger?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.900
All right.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.700
Who wants a sad tiger?

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.330
Oh, who wants an angry lion?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.980
Lion. Why am I saying tiger?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.720
Tiger [inaudible].

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.380
I think the angry tiger --

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.680
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Angry.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.050
[ Crosstalk ]

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.350
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Angry lion.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.650
All right.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.950
We'll make this guy angry.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.750
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: I think
it makes him look scarier.

[ Background chatter ]

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.870
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Is that right?

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.170
No, oh well.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.470
All right.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.770
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Thank you Betsy.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.570
That was awesome.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.300
[ Applause ]

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.930
Okay. So, we've read together

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.500
and you've seen Betsy do
her work right there for you

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.810
in real time which is awesome.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.150
Now, do you guys have
any questions for us?

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.890
Is there anything you want to
ask an illustrator or an author?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.520
What do you guys want to know?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.350
Yes, honey?

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.050
&gt;&gt; Can you draw a buffalo?

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.050
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: I bet
Betsy can draw a buffalo.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.870
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: I can,
but you know what?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.870
I think it's time -- I know a lot
of you have to have questions.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.090
Don't you have questions
about writing or illustrating?

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.000
So, let's do that for
a little while.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.620
How about this young lady in pink?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:57.080
&gt;&gt; How long does it take
for you to make sketches?

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.380
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Well, when
you're sketching a book,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.680
how long does that take?

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.100
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Two seconds,
but when I'm working on a book,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:07.140
I start like that doing sketches
and then I make them more finished.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.130 position:56%
So, in order for me to really finish
a book it takes me between three

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:16.020 position:56%
and six months depending on how many
characters, how much background,

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.690
how complicated the drawings are.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.990
Three to six months.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.660
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Okay.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.960
Yes, hon?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.910
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take [inaudible]?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.210
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Oh.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.510 position:56%
How long does it take for the color?

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.230 position:56%
So, you sketch the whole book first.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.820
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: I do the whole
book first in black and white.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.020 position:56%
You know, I use a brush and black
paint and then I add the color last.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.420
And the color takes longer.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.770
My drawings go very fast
because you see how fast I draw.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.380
And I draw almost that fast
when I'm doing finishes

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.280
and then the color is
what takes the longest.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.240
So, I hold that until last.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.460
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Do you draw that
fast when you're doing the book?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.770
Do you really?

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.070
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Yes.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.370
Little Duck.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.780
I'm just going to do this
just to show you how it goes.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.460 position:56%
We'll do one little duck and then --

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.760
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: I
did not know that.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.060
I did not know that
when she was sketching

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.490
that out it went that fast.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.880
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: This would
be a finish if I had a brush.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.180
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Okay.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.610
Hi.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.830
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: That
would be my finish.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.640
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Wow.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.300
And so, it's really the color then.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.600
So, the color takes way more time.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.900
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: The
color takes more time.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.200
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: I
always pictured Betsy

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.570
for the last 20 years very
studiously drawing lines

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.870
and planning this out.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.270
I didn't know she was
whipping this thing

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.670
out on her sketchpad that fast.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.690
I think she actually
draws faster than I write.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.390
It takes me a long,
long time to write.

I've been drawing -- the earliest
drawing that my mother has was

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.280
in one of her books, and she said I
was three years old when I drew it.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.820
It's a picture of somebody peeking

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.840
out from behind a tree
which I suppose was me.

got a question for her?

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.220
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Yes, honey?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.520
&gt;&gt; How do you write your words?

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.330
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: How
do we write the words?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.150
A lot of times when I get ideas,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.100
I don't get an idea
about a whole book.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.190
I don't think, "Oh wait.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.070
I have an idea about cows
and I'll find a typewriter

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.450
and then the hens will
get involved."

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.190 position:56%
It just never works that way for me.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.060
I will literally get a snippet --

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.790
like a little tiny piece of
something almost like a seed,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.500
like a piece of a puzzle
because for Click Clack Moo,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.110
the first thing I heard in
a million years would I come

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.060
up with the idea for typing cows.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.100
What I heard in my head
it was Click Clack Moo.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.190
Now, I literally heard that.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.180
These are the kinds of things
that happen in my brain.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.200
It's been happening in my
brain since I was little.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.520
I've always wanted to write,
and I've always made stories,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.310
and I've always kind of picked
out pieces of the day, sounds,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.460
and people or parts of
conversation or something I've seen

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.190
and kind of filed it away.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.020
I don't know where
the sound came from

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.030
but Click Clack Moo was not
a story first or an idea.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.180
It was really just a sound.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.090
And so then I had to
say myself, "Well,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.600
what sounds like Click Clack Moo?

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.890
It's only one thing that
sounds like Click Clack Moo

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.190
and that's the type of cow.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.810
So, it kind of came out of that.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.870
Another day -- when we already
had the characters, for example,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:51.560
I lost the book, Click
Clack Surprise,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.890
it was let's give them
a birthday party.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.370
Let's let them have a birthday
party but what would happen

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.380
with these animals
at a birthday party?

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.160
These animals are not --
they're not spending all day

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.290
in the barn giving milk, and
they're not spending all day

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.020
in the chicken coop
just laying eggs.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.740
They have lives like we do.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.200
They're out and they're doing
things and they're causing trouble

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.480
and they're really having
a good time and hanging

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.400
out with their friends and giving
each other birthday parties.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.160
So, I have to take those
animals then and think

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.750
about what would happen with these
animals had a birthday party?

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.660
And then it just becomes
easy because I know

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.800
that that little duck
is a lot like big duck

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.100
and causes a lot of trouble.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.300
I also have kids and
I know what they look

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.930
like when I don't watch them and if
I don't watch them for a morning,

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.920
I wouldn't be surprised if
they showed up covered in paint

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.480
and they're kind of a mess.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.780
But still -

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.080
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: And with a haircut.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.670
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin -- yes, and my
kids have given each other haircuts

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.970
when I wasn't looking.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.270
That happens too.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.140
I do watch my kids but I do
occasionally not know what they're

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.440
doing 24/7.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.130
So, then that idea just comes
to me that I just have to build

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.430
that out and I like sounds.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.810 position:56%
I like the sound of Click Clack Moo.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.110
I like a shimmy shack.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.410
I like a rub-a-dub.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.730
I like sounds that when you're
reading the book you can remember

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.420 position:56%
them really easily and then when you
read it again the next time you're

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.290
going to fill it in yourself so
then you become part of that book.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.840
That book needs you in order
to really come to life.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.390
That book -- these books,
these animals they want you

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.690
to come in and be at the party.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.210
They want you to watch
them get ready

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.630
so you can do the same
sounds in the same motions.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.200
So, I always try to put
that in there if I can.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.500
Yes, sweetheart?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.350
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.310
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Have
I ever written a novel?

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.830
I just finished Thursday
night at 12:33 a.m.,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.350
I noticed because I've been
working on it for so long,

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.610
the final draft of my first novel.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.010
It happens -- well, don't clap yet.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.420
[ Laughter ]

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.800
You can let me know in a year or
two if actual clapping was deserved

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.870
but every time I write something
new, I started with picture books

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.950
and picture books kind
of came easy to me.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.250
I don't know why.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.550
I understand how to write them.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:01.380
They're concise to say the least,
and there's a rhythm to them

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.270
that if you capture early enough,
it will carry through as you write.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.570
And then I did some chapter books.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.870
I did "The Trouble with Chickens."

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.340
I did "The Chicken Squad,"
and those are also really fun.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.060
They're still just funny and you're
just throwing these little snarky

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.000
chickens together and just
listening to them and just writing

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.700
down what they're saying
and what they're doing

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.210
and the structure is a
little bit different.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.820
And then you get to a novel and
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.120
I just don't.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.420
I don't know how to do this.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.350
And the best way if you're sitting
down to write something new,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.330
to write a new kind of book
or write at all is to read.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.400
So, I've always been [inaudible].

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.700
I love reading.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.610
Since I was a kid it was
my favorite thing to do

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.480
so when I really wanted -- I
got this idea for a novel --

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.520
I got this idea and I knew
it wasn't a picture book,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.560 position:56%
and I knew it wasn't a chapter book.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.270
It's 300 pages which
to me is like 15 books.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.940
That's a lot and if you do a
word count on a picture book

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.250
like this one or Click Clack
Moo, I think it has 130 words.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.380
So, that novel was such a
huge learning process for me.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.720
I've come a long way
from where I've started

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.900
because I have an incredible
editor and she's extremely generous

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.660
and very patient with
me, but I'm learning.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.960
But, I'm learning.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.410
So, I was so happy Thursday at
12:33 a.m. I sent it to my editor

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.080
when I emailed it to her.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.060
So, even if it was
something I learned how to do

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.360
that I couldn't do before.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.400 position:56%
So, you all should know that
feeling when you learn something new

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.820
and you struggle with
it in the beginning

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.520
but then you get it at some point.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.590
So, I'm sure I have
some more revising to do

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.890
but that was a big thing.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.990
That was a big thing for me.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.380
So, we'll see how it goes.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.680
Yes, sweetheart?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.980
Yes, babe?

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.290
&gt;&gt; What made you want
to write about a farm?

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.820
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: What makes
me want to write about a farm?

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.120
That's also a good question.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.770
I grew up on Long Island in
the suburbs near New York City.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.360
I did not grow up on a farm.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.760
Betsy --

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: I grew up in a small
town in Pennsylvania surrounded

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.620
by farms so I'm very familiar

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.300
with farm animals even though
I didn't live on a farm.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.600
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Yes.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.900
I don't know why it was farms.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.200
Again going back to the sounds

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.780
because that sound Click
Clack Moo involved a cow.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.080
That's kind of where that
story took me was to a farm.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.480
And then once I met these
characters and Betsy did them,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.810
I wanted to spend more time there.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.940
They were funny and I liked them
and I liked writing about them

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.890
and I loved seeing what Betsy
was going to do with them.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.870
So, the farm itself, I
don't know why it's there

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.550
but that's where they wound up.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:32.850
And "Chicken Squad" too.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.700
I mean, they're not on a
farm but again it's chickens

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.280
and it's giant backyards
that I didn't have

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.980
and I certainly don't have
now but it's just something

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.990
about them that's really appealing.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.290
Thank you sweetheart.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.270
Do you have a question too?

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.690
&gt;&gt; I'm asking for my daughter.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.990
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Sure.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You answered the question already
about that you were pretty young

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.360
when you started drawing but
she likes to draw and to write.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.120
How old were you when
you started writing?

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.740
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: When
I started writing.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:06.790
When I was young, very young, I
was an extremely introverted child.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.360
I talked at home with my brothers,
my sisters, and my friends

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.140
but you put me in a classroom
and I was extremely quiet.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.590
I was just a very, very quiet kid.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.940
Very shy kid.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.010
But my first grade teacher,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.640
quiet doesn't mean you
have nothing to say.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.310
Quiet doesn't mean you have nothing
to add so she said to me, "Well,

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.430
why don't you start writing
things down because I want

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.950
to hear what you have to say,"
and she gave me extra homework.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.890 position:56%
I was six, and my first grade
teacher was giving me extra homework

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.190
to write.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.740
And so, she saw something in
me that I was more comfortable

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.170
and probably still am to this
day writing than I am talking.

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.110
I'd rather write all day then
talk all day and she saw that.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.290
And so, she just encouraged
me to keep writing and then

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.590
as it happened some of the stuff

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.600
that I was writing,
she felt was good.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.730 position:56%
Was saying that maybe I was a writer
and so she'd give me poems to write

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.710
and give me short stories to
write and all this extra stuff

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.460
that I had to do but I loved it.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.760
I absolutely loved it.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.390
And so, when I was six, I had a
teacher who I adored say to me,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.580
"You are a writer," and
that was all it took.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.240
And from that moment
on, I was just a writer.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.770
You went on and did everything else
and go on to different teachers

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.500
and new grades and
different challenges

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.100
and learning new things
and then college.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.930
I was a journalism major
because I was a writer.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.060
And then I went to law
school a few years later

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.940
because lawyers read
a lot and write a lot.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.700
So, I went to law school.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.020
One of the reasons was
because I was a writer.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.890
It just became part of my
identity and that was it.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.920
And that started --
that was a teacher.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.900
That's one teacher.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.060
I've had incredible
teachers my whole life

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.360
but it was really Misses Cooper,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.470
first grade who said,
"Hey, you could do this.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.700
This is part of who
you are I think."

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.510
Yes, sweetheart.

Talking to other people.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.110
Looking at illustrations
that people do.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.330
A lot of times, I can just open
up one of Betsy's books and look

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.100
at duck or look at the cows
and think, "What would they do?

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.090
What's going on in their minds,"
because they become almost real

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.280
to me and I feel like they want to
tell me a story and I'm just going

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.090
to write it down for them.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.800
Okay, I think we have time
for one more question.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.240
A short one.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.380
[ Laughter ]

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.680
Yes, sweetheart?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.180
&gt;&gt; If you were an author,
how would you [inaudible]?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.770
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: That's
a good question.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.860
That's a good procedural question.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.400
If you're an author and
you've written a book

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.110
but you need an illustrator,
now what do you do?

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.600
Because I don't illustrate.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.150
That's not in my skillset
by any stretch.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.160
So, when you write a story
then you're going to send it

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.660
to a publisher and then the
editor who's kind of the boss

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.080
of your book picks an illustrator.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.740
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: So, what happens
usually is that the editor is very,

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.830
very familiar with a
lot of illustrators work

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.980
and they're very good at matching
an illustrator with the author.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.460
Some illustrators do rather serious
illustrations, very realistic.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.110
The stories aren't funny and
that requires a certain kind

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.790
of illustration and the
editor knows just who to pick

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.110
and team them up with the writer.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.370 position:56%
Now, if the writer wants a
particular illustrator then they can

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:29.370
request that illustrator and
if they're available and want

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.640
to do the book, perfect match.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.940
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: Okay.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.240
All right.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.000
Thank you guys so much for
coming out this morning.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.590
I hope you had a good time.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.890
&gt;&gt; Betsy Lewin: Thank you.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.190
Thank you.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.490
&gt;&gt; Doreen Cronin: And maybe
you learned something you guys

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.030 position:56%
about writing and about illustrating
and then we'll be signing.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.790
So, if you have something for us to
sign and you still have questions,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:55.450
you just come on back
and you find us

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.920
and we'll take care of
it back there, okay?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.320
Enjoy the rest of the day you guys.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.620
Thank you.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.920

of the Library of Congress.
