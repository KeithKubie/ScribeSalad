00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.180
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.320
Thank you guys for coming
to this screening and Q&amp;A

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.890
regarding "Extreme By Design."

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.306
It's a new documentary film
that premiered early December.

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:13.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.687
December 11.

00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:15.520
MALE SPEAKER: December
11, premiered on PBS.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.978
So we're lucky
enough today to have

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:20.235
here Ralph King, the director,
along with two people that

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.370
are with him that are also
part of the Stanford D

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.020
School, the Stanford
Design School.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.430
Which is one of the biggest
design thinking evangelists,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.010
I would say.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.820
I feel like you can't
hear about design thinking

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.970
without hearing about Stamford.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.490
So it's great to
have them with us.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.570
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about them,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.278
and then we'll go
right to the screening.

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.320
And then have a Q&amp;A
afterwards with an open forum

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660
for everyone.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.330
So "Extreme By
Design," at a time

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.150
of unprecedented
global challenges,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.640
the under 30
millennial generation

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.700
has every reason
to be disengaged.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.190
Yet plenty of
millennials are engaged.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.555
Call it the empathy revolution.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.230
That's a big Stanford thing.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.680
"Extreme by Design," an
hour long documentary film,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.280
brings this revolution to life
by following three Stanford

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
University students as they
design and build products

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.940
to meet basic needs
of the world's poor.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.400
And I'll tell you
in just a minute,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.820
expand on that, about a program
that our two other guests

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.220
have designed on PBS
Learning Media that's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.932
an extension of this
experience and this lesson.

00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:21.890
So I'll get to tell you
about that in a minute.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.310
And our director,
Ralph, is a graduate

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.970
of Stanford, an
independent filmmaker,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.370
and founder of
Hawk View Pictures.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.660
Prior to filmmaking,
he spent 25 years

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.480
as a reporter for the
"Wall Street Journal"

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.950
and several national magazines.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.560
And he was twice nominated by
"Wall Street Journal" editors

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.580
for the Pulitzer Prize and
won the National Association

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.610
of Science Writer's
Science in Society award

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.710
and the California
Governor's Media award.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.190
Ralph recently
became a filmmaker.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.440
And said you you've been
working on this one for about

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.150
four years?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.858
RALPH KING: Yeah.

00:01:55.858 --> 00:01:58.150
Right in the first four
years before it all started.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.700
MALE SPEAKER: There you go.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.080
So four years on
this one, I think

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.790
you would say this is
probably your first big one?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.070
RALPH KING: Yeah.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.903
MALE SPEAKER: Right?

00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.600
So now onto our
two other guests.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.070
One is Leticia Cavagnaro.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.090
She comes from the
world of science,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.430
where she acquired
a couple of degrees.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.530
I like how you said that.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.570
"A couple of
degrees," no big deal.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.620
Strong analytical skills,
which she balances

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.690
with creative thinking,
and the ability to learn

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.929
from failed experiments.

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.470
Venturing outside
of the biology lab,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.511
Leticia found that designing
learning experiences

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:31.260
was just as challenging
and even more rewarding.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.540
Leticia is now adjunct faculty
at the School of Engineering's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.660
Stanford Technology
Ventures Program

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.190
and the deputy
director-- there we go,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.640
recently changed-- deputy
director of the National Center

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.500
for Engineering Pathways to
Innovation, known as Epicenter.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.140
And as a co-lecturer on the
Creativity and Innovation

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.629
course, which here you
guys might know as CSI,

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.420
she gets to witness
the journey of students

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.128
as they develop their
creative confidence

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:01.180
and go on accomplishing
amazing things.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.920
Which you guys will definitely
see in this next hour.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.124
And our other guest
is Melissa Pelochino.

00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:09.040
I love that last name.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.580
That's such a good one.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.390
Fellow at the Stanford D
school, her current focus

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.590
is on redesigning the
professional development

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.040
experience for K-12
teachers and administrators.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.100
Which again, you'll see in
this PBS Learning Media.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.200
Melissa is a former
teacher and administrator

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.690
in low-income schools.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.550
And after learning about
design thinking in 2007,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.010
she began her mission to
integrate the design thinking

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.906
process and mindsets into K-12
schools all over the world.

00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:38.530
There's some really
interesting stories

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.380
that follow that as well.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.060
Now to tell you about
the PBS Learning Media.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.290
Would you probably call it
"Extreme by Design Watch

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.380
and Do"?

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.680
Did I get that right?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.680
So the idea of this is it's
an interactive experience

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.530
on PBS Learning Media, which
is a resource for teachers.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.960
And it's designed for fourth
through 12th grade students

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.710
to be completed after watching
the "Extreme by Design"

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.170
documentary.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.300
For example, the first
episode, "Being an Innovator"

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.240
helps students think
and act like innovators

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.860
using the design
thinking approach.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.180
Scenes from this documentary
are used to illustrate concepts,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.115
and a protagonist acts as a
guide who provides instructions

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.470
and explanations
to the students.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.269
And that's narrated
by all three?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.590
Or one of the students
that we see in the film?

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.860
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
One of the students.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.340
MALE SPEAKER: Just one of the
students we see in the film.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.965
He narrates this whole learning
experience, which teachers then

00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:29.900
take to their
classroom to expand

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.310
on this "Extreme
by Design" film.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.976
Which I think is a very cool way
of not only learning something,

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:35.962
but then putting it into action.

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:37.670
So we'll go ahead and
watch the film now,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.280
and then we'll have a
Q&amp;A right afterwards.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.230
AUDIENCE: How do you
come up with the universe

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.720
of potential solutions?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.220
I didn't see anything on that.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.150
What's the winnowing
process that you

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.770
go to take that large universe
down to a small subset

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.300
that you're then
going to proceed

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.689
to invest the time
and effort in.

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:58.980
And how can that be replicable?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.630
Because I think
that's something that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.670
would be useful
to take from this.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.420
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
So I should say,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.800
I do not teach this
specific class.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.330
And there's some variability
amongst the different D School

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.920
classes.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.800
But for sure that the
process is not proprietary,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.080
and it's all shared.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.270
Many of the resources
that we use for teaching

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.360
are shared on the web.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.910
Mostly, in a nutshell, the
design thinking process

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.810
would start with
identifying problems

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.650
from the user perspective.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.290
I think that came
through in the film.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.770
So for coming up
with ideas, there's

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.000
many techniques
that you can use.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.080
But mostly it's a
very simple concept

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.850
of going beyond the
first right answer.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.450
Right?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.910
And I think that when we
teach mostly engineers

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.300
or other technical
students, we give them

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.780
a very, very
well-defined problem.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.370
And we teach them to
come up with a solution.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.600
We should push them to think
of many possible solutions.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.670
So just that simple
concept is the start

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.530
of getting them to think
beyond the first right answer.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.702
Do you want to add?

00:06:21.702 --> 00:06:23.160
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
I would just add

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.030
in terms of criteria for
selection, it ranges.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.480
Sometimes criteria for selection
is given by the instructors,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.380
and sometimes it's not.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.000
I would say most importantly,
it's what's feasible.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.210
If you're having to
actually create something

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.835
that you can make,
either an experience

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:46.480
or a product, and also
what meets the need

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.100
that you identified earlier on
in the process in the best way.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.950
And so students do brainstorm.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.590
There were some short
clips in the movie.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.500
They said "trainstorming"
as sort of a play

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.410
on brainstorming.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.260
And some other short parts
where they were throwing

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.320
Post-its up with a whole
bunch of different ideas.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.230
But as Leticia
said, there's a lot

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.240
of different
strategies for getting

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.220
outside the box of
what's possible,

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.650
and to really weld ideas.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.590
And then criteria for narrowing
that down and selecting it.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.291
And there's several.

00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:18.540
RALPH KING: I guess I would
just add to that, defining

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.900
the problem, as I
guess we all know

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.660
is much more important
than finding the solution.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.120
So the Indonesian group that
was on this quixotic adventure

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.170
that they didn't
realize they were

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.950
looking for the wrong
thing, initially.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.530
The partner in those
countries, NGOs,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.060
will give you an assignment.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.330
But often you end
up way over here

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.280
in the process of figuring
out something you can solve,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.560
or something that's the right
size for a six month course,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.070
or the little blue
sleeping bag, the embrace.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.500
Their initial assignment
was to come up

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.185
with a cheaper,
in-hospital incubator.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.050
And within a matter of
days, when they were out

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.400
in the field, they realized
that 95% of the babies

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.580
are born out in the rural
villages and no electricity.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.410
So they basically walked
away from that partner

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.350
and came up with that design.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.000
So problem definition,
I think, is also

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.520
a long and important process.

00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:19.985
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:08:19.985 --> 00:08:20.950
Thanks again.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.520
I was curious about,
it occurred to me

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.100
that the local people
in Indonesia or wherever

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.720
would be motivated to
help solve these problems.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.250
And maybe they had
no time or resources,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.565
but there must be bright
people there, too.

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:39.179
Is there effort
to, I don't know,

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.539
transition some of the
solutions that way?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.084
Instead of, say, to Walmart
or wherever, and help

00:08:46.084 --> 00:08:47.580
continue the projects?

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.288
RALPH KING: Yeah.

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:50.890
I mean there's no--
this movie is set up

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.780
as a West to East
kind of solution--

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.060
but there's no reason why it
shouldn't be the other way.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.600
Or West to West and East
to East kind of thing.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.480
That the problem
solvers should ideally

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.990
come from the culture
in which they live.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.990
Stanford, for one,
has an organization

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.410
called The Seed Institute.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.170
They got a big gift from a local
couple that is now setting up

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.785
D School like innovation labs
in places like Ghana and Myanmar

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:22.650
and I think eight
other countries,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.920
they plan to create
for local entrepreneurs

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.740
to learn the methodologies and
to incubate their companies.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.270
And then sometimes the
partners in these countries

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.070
will come back to Stanford and
bring their staffs with them.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.860
Like the group, you saw the red
treadle pump there in Myanmar?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.720
Well that organization,
Proximity Design,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.530
sent a big group
back with our teams

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.280
to study the school
and the process.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.704
And then have now
carried that back there.

00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:57.570
So there's an objection
raised that this

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.730
seems a little
neo-colonial and just

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.660
another version of charity.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.520
But there's no
reason why it can't

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.440
be something that
operates locally.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.390
In fact, one of the projects
was, if you saw on the map,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.710
set in Arizona, an
Apache reservation.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.910
So within American
culture, obviously, there's

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.880
lots of room for these
kinds of projects.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.570
And they happen here.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.375
But this particular class
tends to go overseas

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.774
because of the way it's set up.

00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:33.440
MELISSA PELOCHINO:
And in fact this film

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.350
is serving as inspiration
for exactly that to happen.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.280
We're working with a school in
India of fourth and fifth grade

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.440
students who saw the film.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.470
And Ralph was there through
Skype to answer some Q&amp;A.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.710
And then Leticia and I are
going to be leading them

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.140
through their own
design challenge

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.300
later next week, actually.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.910
So the film is
serving as inspiration

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.754
to empower people,
children all over the world

00:10:58.754 --> 00:10:59.920
to solve their own problems.

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:05.820
AUDIENCE: So, Ralph, how did you
decide how to tell this story?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.685
Did you just follow your three
groups around with a camera,

00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:11.010
or did you look at
some other groups,

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.576
and already have an outline
of what you were looking for?

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:15.950
RALPH KING: The
question is why I

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.880
decided to do this
particular story.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.020
I was working at the
Stanford Business School

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.370
when I heard about this class.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.100
And I spent a year auditing the
course, or a six month cycle.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.280
And so I, as part
of that, went out

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.240
with one of the student teams,
I mentioned earlier, to Myanmar.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.530
And filmmakers and journalists
weren't welcome in Myanmar

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.210
at that time, so
I was a "student."

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.080
And it was day four
of the trip, and I

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.160
was feeling very
discouraged because I

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.230
hadn't had any
startling observations

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.420
to contribute to my team.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.505
And so I was kind of
shuffling through the town.

00:11:57.505 --> 00:12:02.590
And I noticed a family sitting
in a pagoda in a meditation

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.670
room.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.425
They had come in for the
bizarre, the county fair, that

00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:09.550
was happening in the town,
and were about to leave.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.420
I sat down and asked if
I could interview them.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.045
They said sure.

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:16.294
I started firing all my
journalistic questions at them

00:12:16.294 --> 00:12:19.310
and madly scribbling
my notebook.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.540
About 15 minutes into this
interview, I looked up.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.740
And there, in addition
to the six people,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.380
35 other people had just glided
in silently and sat down.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.920
And were watching
this whole thing

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.040
going on with this
crazy westerner.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.981
And in that moment, I
just put my book down.

00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:41.730
And I leaned back.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.120
And I just was
filled with ecstasy.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.150
I've really felt
for the first time

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.060
in 25 years as a journalist
that I understood

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.960
the difference between
gathering facts and observing

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.860
with an open heart.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.480
And this sudden
appearance of people

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.890
totally unbeknownst to
me was like, for me,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:08.450
this kind of trumpets
blaring from the heavens,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.800
how much experience
I tend to exclude.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.330
It just was like discovering
a new capacity in myself.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.240
And so for the next two days,
I was like walking on air.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.840
And I thought, well, if even
auditing this class is having

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.540
this kind of effect
on me, imagine

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.570
what it's doing for
these 20 somethings who

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.194
have skin in the game
and actually have

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:35.210
to produce something for
people that they meet.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.660
So I felt like there was
a powerful element to it.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.420
And it was kind of like Pam
said, where the boundaries just

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.970
collapse.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.340
And in that moment, she felt
like she just had to do this.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.640
Well that's kind of the way
I felt about this story.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.330
And so I guess
that's why I did it.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:06.190
And I guess I would also like
to say that now that the film is

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.540
made, it's become
something else.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.990
And that's partly why Melissa
and Leticia are here today.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.460
Because there is a kind
of movement in education

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.440
now to bring design
thinking and these methods

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.280
more into the mainstream,
more into young people's

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.450
lives, in schools, and
also into companies.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.850
I know here at Google,
it's a fairly common

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.300
or fairly well-known thing.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.090
But in other parts of
the country, less so.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.560
But we see little beginnings.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:46.860
So after making the film, I
came to my friends and said,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.760
how do we get this in
front of young people?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.710
Young people don't watch PBS.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.059
Which is where it broadcasted.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.600
So we start talking
about a workshop.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.170
And how could we incorporate
the film in a workshop?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.710
And so we did little clips.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.220
And we had this 90
minute workshop.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.780
And that was great.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.970
But we did it in some schools,
but how do we scale it?

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.180
So then PBS offered
us an opportunity

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.430
to put on their teacher
portal something online.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:17.800
And so Melissa and Leticia,
God bless them, took the film

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.950
and created this wonderful
hour-long exercise,

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.960
like a press play
exercise, that takes

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.880
young people in a classroom
through the basic elements,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.280
the steps, of design thinking.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.570
So it gives them a flavor and
a taste of what it's like.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:41.060
And so what keeps
me up at night now

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.900
is figuring out ways like
this to scale design thinking

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.570
education.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.350
We're at a moment in
our education system

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.920
where the common
core is coming in,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.740
which is much more process
oriented rather than content

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.270
oriented.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:02.130
So it's kind of an inflection
point that is timely.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:09.820
And I actually would welcome
any ideas that you have,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.220
if you've experienced
the scaling

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.320
of a new kind of
concept here at Google.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.730
And how that's done.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:23.666
I'm really looking and searching
for answers to that right now.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:25.790
AUDIENCE: I would love to
know about the challenges

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.240
that you guys had trying to get
something like the CSI process

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.860
onto this online
workshop for students.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.130
Because here it's a few hours
of hands-on, in the classroom,

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.090
stuff that we do.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.250
So how did you guys
get that into scale

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.110
and what were the challenges?

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.710
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: So I should

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:50.250
say that before attempting
to do this module for k-12,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.090
I had approached Ralph,
having seen the movie.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.410
And I did a massive online
course on design thinking.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.500
And I selected some of
the clips to illustrate

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.600
some of the challenges.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.349
So I do believe that
you can translate

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.430
this type of
experiential learning

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.530
into an online experience.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.450
You just have to not be literal.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:13.950
Right?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.960
So when we think about an
online resource, we think, OK.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.260
There's going to be a video
of a lecture, and then a quiz

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.660
that basically quizzes
you on whether you were

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.109
paying attention to the lecture.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:28.700
Right?

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.819
But the way I
defined that course

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:33.860
was completely different.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.330
I thought, how can
I design something

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.720
that is very personal
for each learner?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.350
And use the metaphor of
kind of like a "Choose

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.890
Your Own Adventure" book.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:45.410
Right?

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.750
So you would, according
to what you were seeing

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.160
and what you were answering, and
like no right answer quizzes.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.460
You would be pointed
to different parts

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.060
of the materials that
were meaningful to you.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.840
Right?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.610
So when we approach doing this
module, one of the challenges,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.560
I would say, is that you
want to present the learner

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.380
with a meaningful challenge.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.970
But it's something that they
can see the human aspect of it.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.960
So one of the things that
we struggled really with

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.870
was defining the right to
challenge to give the students.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.840
And not something that was
directly coming from the movie,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.790
so they already saw what the
student's solution had been.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.610
And they would gravitate
towards doing something similar.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.380
Right?

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.860
So we took a challenge of
one of the teams that was not

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.040
portrayed in the movie, was
just mentioned at the beginning,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.780
as one of the main challenges.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.530
Do you want to?

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.656
MELISSA PELOCHINO: Yeah.

00:18:49.656 --> 00:18:52.080
I would say that was
definitely a challenge.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.490
Another challenge we
had is sort of providing

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.220
an experiential learning
opportunity for students.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.650
Being mindful that teachers
need to manage their class

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.280
and that this may not be the
type of learning and teaching

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.050
that a teacher might
feel comfortable with.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.280
So trying to find the right
balance between the giving

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.540
or delivering of
material and content,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.970
and the experience
that the students

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.420
would be having, I think
was definitely challenging.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.110
We're in a time right
now where teachers

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.430
were taught in a way that's
very different than we're now

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.130
asking them to teach.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.310
And so being mindful of
that gap and sort of finding

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.690
the right balance there
was very challenging.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.790
And how we sort of answered
that for ourselves was providing

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.080
a lot of scaffolding
for the students.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.660
So, for example, we ask them
to identify a bunch of needs

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.800
that a particular "character"
that we present might have.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.050
But then we present
an actual need

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.000
that we want the whole group
to solve for all together.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.670
So we gave them the
freedom to sort of generate

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.000
their own ideas.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.690
But then we kept it
sort of whole class

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.500
as they move
through the process.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.300
Which enabled the
teacher, we felt,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.100
to manage a little bit easier.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.970
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: In a way,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.360
the resource needs
to be a learning

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.130
experience for the students,
but also for the teacher.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.750
Right?

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.440
Because we wanted if
this is going to scale,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.490
this is going into the hands
of a teacher who is not

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.260
knowledgeable about
the same thinking.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.070
So they might not be comfortable
with being the facilitator.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.510
So what we did was we
took one of this students,

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.910
Darrell, that
appears in the movie,

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.560
is one of the water
storage team students.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.180
And he was the facilitator.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.490
So this particular module, or
one instance of the module,

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.350
was, just as Ralph said,
just like press play and go.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.450
So you would have the
teacher on the screen saying,

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.010
and now we're going to do this.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.860
And the teacher would be
kind of like the facilitator

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.860
on the side, providing
the materials.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.010
And in a way, giving the
teacher the opportunity to

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.550
observe the students in action.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.800
And seeing the interaction with
this in-screen facilitator.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.300
Right?

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.470
And this is an experiment.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.280
We really don't know, and
we're eager to find out,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.840
how this works in schools.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.050
And hopefully we'll be able
to go into some classrooms

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.001
and see how it works.

00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:32.250
RALPH KING: Leticia is modest.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.060
Her MOOC that she
created at Stanford

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.140
attracted thousands
and thousands

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.120
of students who
actually completed it,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.710
which also with MOOC
is not that common.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.990
And had some really
amazing feedback

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.220
and experiences from it.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:56.090
And so the scaling
of design thinking

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.540
is happening in
a number of ways.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:05.520
And these folks are
among the pioneers of it.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.390
AUDIENCE: So in the
movie, in the class,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.110
I didn't see many
design students

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.940
with the design backgrounds.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.574
So I saw the professors who
are from technology backgrounds

00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:23.520
or from psychology background,
so I wonder how much effort

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.260
made by design
professors or students

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.500
with the design background?

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.415
And how many people
have design backgrounds

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:36.124
get involved into this process?

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.130
RALPH KING: Usually in that
course, there are a quarter,

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.850
or maybe not quite that
many, of the students

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.810
are from the design.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.320
There's a design program,
a joint program in design,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.030
at the graduate
level at Stanford.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.010
But it's part of the Mechanical
Engineering Department,

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.030
I think.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.370
So there's a lot of dialogue
between the design department

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:08.200
and the D School, which is
not a department itself.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.740
It's just where people come
together to intermingle.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.180
And so I'd say anywhere from
10 to 25% of the students

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.740
had a design or were
currently in a design program.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.160
But they had, all around
them, these instructors

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.669
who were very immersed
in the design process.

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:29.210
But as we said at
the very beginning,

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.040
very few had ever made
anything in their lives.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.290
Or designed anything.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:41.000
So I think the idea is
creating this attitude,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.960
that if I see a problem in
the world, I can fix it.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.870
Kind of forget the
whole idea of design.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.380
It's a kind of optimism.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.830
And I can figure
out how to find out,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.280
how to get the answer
to this problem,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.585
if I care enough about it.

00:23:57.585 --> 00:23:59.710
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
I would say that students

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.140
with a design background, for
the purpose of the D School

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.630
are just one more
discipline that

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.160
contributes to a
multidisciplinary team.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.160
But we really think
design thinking

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.300
is a much broader language for
creating a problem definition

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.970
and solving.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.120
And we are all designers
in a way, right?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.230
And getting that
attitude, as Ralph

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:27.100
said, into every discipline.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.020
AUDIENCE: I would totally agree,
design thinking and design are

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.460
basically different things.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.130
But I wonder, for the
students in this class,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.220
this Extreme class, did they
get any design skill training?

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.880
Because during
the whole process,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.140
they need to do the
research, do the interviews,

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.650
so there are a lot of
design skills or research

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.534
skills involved in the process.

00:24:51.534 --> 00:24:53.200
So I wonder, except
the design thinking,

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.470
did they get any other
training or specific skills?

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.620
MELISSA PELOCHINO: Each
class has its own sort

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.340
of ways that they convey
the design thinking

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.720
process and methodology.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.010
So I can't-- I mean, you could
probably speak better than us

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.710
because we don't teach
that particular class--

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.480
but I can say in the class
that we're teaching right now

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:23.500
at the D School, we do teach the
skills required for the design

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.720
thinking process alongside the
mindsets and sort of attitudes

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.660
as well.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.280
In a way that's
very experiential.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.290
And then they go out into the
field and they apply them.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.440
So there definitely is
training along the way,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.780
throughout any design
thinking course.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.330
And I would also add that
the D School is not actually

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.250
a school.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.670
By design, it doesn't
issue degrees on purpose.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.560
They didn't want to have a
space that like the creatives

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.740
are over here and everybody
else is over here.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.730
It's specifically a
place where people

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.870
from all different disciplines
and backgrounds come together.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.510
And sort of one of the
cornerstones of design thinking

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.040
is that interdisciplinary
cross-breeding

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.150
of ideas and perspectives.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.760
That that's what yields the
most creative and innovative

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.560
results.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.643
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
And I would, building on

00:26:13.643 --> 00:26:15.550
that, it's a place
where people come

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:19.060
for different amounts
of time and involvement.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.560
Right?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.380
So it's not like you have
a set amount of classes

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.290
that you have to complete
to be a D School graduate.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.920
You do not get that.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:34.190
But students can come and take
a class and get a sense of that.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.570
And then go back to
their disciplines

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.460
and apply some of that.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:44.520
Or they can become kind of like
D School junkies, I would say,

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.520
and come and take eight,
nine classes, to the point

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.980
that that becomes like a really
great part of what they do.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.760
And what they will
do in the future.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.940
RALPH KING: And these two,
together with Frederick,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.580
are teaching a class in
creativity right now.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.800
And for 40 spots, you
had, what, 150 applicants?

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.300
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: About 100.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.350
We had to actually teach
the class twice this year,

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.100
because last year, we had
200 applicants for 40 spots.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.560
So that's why we are
now teaching it twice.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.470
RALPH KING: So the
demand is just far

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.240
outstripping the supply of
this sort of thing, right now.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.656
LETICIA BRITOS
CAVAGNARO: And it's

00:27:21.656 --> 00:27:24.430
a class that actually
is not required.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.300
And in some cases, it competes
with their requirements.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.760
So some students are
trying to struggling, like,

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.400
oh, I want to take this class.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.260
But I have to take
units for my degree.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.130
And so what do I do?

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.630
Right?

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.940
So it's a great testament of
this revolution of the students

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.050
feel this need to acquire these
sets of skills and mindsets

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.370
to be creative problem solvers.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.370
And we're trying
to find more ways

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.080
to spread that across
Stanford in different ways.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.680
Not just with the
standalone classes, but

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.760
how can we embed
that in every class

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.720
in the fabric of Stanford?

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.990
AUDIENCE: So over the
weekend, I had the fortune

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.509
of being at D School, attending
the Bootleg Boot camp.

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:14.925
And I wanted to
totally appreciate

00:28:14.925 --> 00:28:17.425
the school, and
the great material.

00:28:17.425 --> 00:28:22.770
And not just the material,
but the peer leaders.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.940
I really learned a lot.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.320
And I totally appreciate that.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.272
And just like Ralph said, I
felt like I was walking on air.

00:28:29.272 --> 00:28:31.541
There was just so much
energy, so much creativity.

00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:32.403
So thanks.

00:28:32.403 --> 00:28:33.528
And keep up the great work.

00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:35.486
LETICIA BRITOS CAVAGNARO:
Thank you for coming.

00:28:35.486 --> 00:28:37.710
And you probably met one
of our course assistants

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.600
was one of the D
leaders, Ben Baldwin.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.920
These are students
who are now learning

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.980
to teach design thinking.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.890
So we call an open call for
people to come to D School

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.810
and go through a basic training.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.046
And the students are teaching.

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:56.209
So thank you.

00:28:56.209 --> 00:28:58.500
MALE SPEAKER: I think that
was actually the perfect way

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.000
to finish.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.260
So thank you guys so much.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.010
We really appreciate
you coming out.
