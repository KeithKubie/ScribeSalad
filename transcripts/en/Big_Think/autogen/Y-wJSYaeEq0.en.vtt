the engine of growth in the super bubble

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690
the engine of growth in the super bubble
 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.730
the engine of growth in the super bubble
was the American consumer that consumed

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
was the American consumer that consumed
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.150
was the American consumer that consumed
more than it produced and for various

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
more than it produced and for various
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.670
more than it produced and for various
reasons we were able to build up a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
reasons we were able to build up a
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.609
reasons we were able to build up a
current account deficit that was mounted

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
current account deficit that was mounted
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.859
current account deficit that was mounted
eventually to six and a half or seven

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
eventually to six and a half or seven
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.990
eventually to six and a half or seven
percent of the GNP and also the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000
percent of the GNP and also the
 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.930
percent of the GNP and also the
consumers were householders we'll be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
consumers were householders we'll be
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389
consumers were householders we'll be
drawing from their equity from their

drawing from their equity from their
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.090
drawing from their equity from their
mortgages which was actually about the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
mortgages which was actually about the
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.350
mortgages which was actually about the
same size at the end is slightly larger

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
same size at the end is slightly larger
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.290

about 900 billion dollars annualized

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
about 900 billion dollars annualized
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000

that was the engine of growth for the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
that was the engine of growth for the
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.459
that was the engine of growth for the
world and that engine is now switched

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
world and that engine is now switched
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.369
world and that engine is now switched
off it's been knocked out so you need

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
off it's been knocked out so you need
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.180
off it's been knocked out so you need
another engine and in my opinion in the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
another engine and in my opinion in the
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.299
another engine and in my opinion in the
end it will be the problem connected

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
end it will be the problem connected
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.810
end it will be the problem connected
with their energy global warming which

with their energy global warming which
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.550
with their energy global warming which
is threatening to our civilization and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
is threatening to our civilization and
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.929
is threatening to our civilization and
is not actually addressed needs to be

is not actually addressed needs to be
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120
is not actually addressed needs to be
addressed at the same time we are also

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
addressed at the same time we are also
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.810
addressed at the same time we are also
concerned about the ever rising costs of

oil and and of course energy dependence

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
oil and and of course energy dependence
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.410
oil and and of course energy dependence
and all those three factors required to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
and all those three factors required to
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.940
and all those three factors required to
develop alternate source of energy and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950
develop alternate source of energy and
 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.260
develop alternate source of energy and
invest in energy saving investments and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
invest in energy saving investments and
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.039
invest in energy saving investments and
that ought to be the motor of the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
that ought to be the motor of the
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.340
that ought to be the motor of the
economy that is going to take us out of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
economy that is going to take us out of
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.249
economy that is going to take us out of
the recession where you're going to have

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
the recession where you're going to have
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.399
the recession where you're going to have
unemployed resources and those resources

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
unemployed resources and those resources
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410
unemployed resources and those resources
are better employed rather than paying

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
are better employed rather than paying
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.100

unemployment benefits bettering employed

in put to use in that direction that is
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.969
in put to use in that direction that is
where I see the way out of the global

where I see the way out of the global
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.170
where I see the way out of the global
recession or depression

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.890
