this review so this is very much truth
in advertising uh this is definitely a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
in advertising uh this is definitely a
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.750
in advertising uh this is definitely a
movie about eighth grade or rather the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
movie about eighth grade or rather the
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.250
movie about eighth grade or rather the
last week of eighth grade I should say

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
last week of eighth grade I should say
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.429
last week of eighth grade I should say
but but it's very much that that age of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
but but it's very much that that age of
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.880
but but it's very much that that age of
being around eighth grade and a lot of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
being around eighth grade and a lot of
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.510
being around eighth grade and a lot of
people's enjoyment of this movie is

going to come from how they enjoyed
eighth grade and my guess is there's uh

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
eighth grade and my guess is there's uh
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.460
eighth grade and my guess is there's uh
there's three people they're gonna have

closing one door and opening another and
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.609

holds a deep place in my heart and then
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.580
holds a deep place in my heart and then
there's the third kind

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
there's the third kind
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.860
there's the third kind
which a lot of people have told me they

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
which a lot of people have told me they
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.300
which a lot of people have told me they
don't want to see this movie for this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
don't want to see this movie for this
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.620
don't want to see this movie for this
very same reason which is that they've

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
very same reason which is that they've
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.240
very same reason which is that they've
gone through eighth grade and it wasn't

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
gone through eighth grade and it wasn't
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.440
gone through eighth grade and it wasn't
fun that age is an awkward age and it's

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
fun that age is an awkward age and it's
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.839
fun that age is an awkward age and it's
uncomfortable and it's not something

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849
uncomfortable and it's not something
 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.479
uncomfortable and it's not something
that a lot of people want to relive I'm

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489
that a lot of people want to relive I'm
 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.610
that a lot of people want to relive I'm
kind of one of those people and that's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
kind of one of those people and that's
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.680
kind of one of those people and that's
the reason I kind of wasn't interested

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
the reason I kind of wasn't interested
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.240
the reason I kind of wasn't interested
in seeing this movie because I said I'm

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
in seeing this movie because I said I'm
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.750
in seeing this movie because I said I'm
sure this is done well but I don't look

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
sure this is done well but I don't look
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940

it's specifically that Graem that's like
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.630
it's specifically that Graem that's like
the exact grade I really don't like

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640
the exact grade I really don't like
 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
the exact grade I really don't like
because we moved around a lot when I was

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
because we moved around a lot when I was
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.280
because we moved around a lot when I was
a kid because my dad was in the Navy and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
a kid because my dad was in the Navy and
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.699
a kid because my dad was in the Navy and
so like he kind of it kind depended

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
so like he kind of it kind depended
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.620
so like he kind of it kind depended
where we were if I fit in well or I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
where we were if I fit in well or I
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.970
where we were if I fit in well or I
didn't fit in well if I was popular I

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.580
didn't fit in well if I was popular I
was not popular and 8th grade was just

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590
was not popular and 8th grade was just
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.380
was not popular and 8th grade was just
like just when we moved to a new place

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
like just when we moved to a new place
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.350
like just when we moved to a new place
it from a place that we've loved and we

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360
it from a place that we've loved and we
 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.000
it from a place that we've loved and we
moved to a new place that we did love

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
moved to a new place that we did love
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.180
moved to a new place that we did love
and we just have we were all kind of

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
and we just have we were all kind of
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.059
and we just have we were all kind of
miserable there we just we did not fit

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069
miserable there we just we did not fit
 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.340
miserable there we just we did not fit
in or at least I didn't fit in to the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
in or at least I didn't fit in to the
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.560
in or at least I didn't fit in to the
new school I was given to so given to

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
new school I was given to so given to
 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.229
new school I was given to so given to
but then when high school started and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
but then when high school started and
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.960
but then when high school started and
you know things got better I got to know

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
you know things got better I got to know
 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.460
you know things got better I got to know
people better and stuff like that but

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
people better and stuff like that but
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.800
people better and stuff like that but
eighth grade was not a happy time for me

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
eighth grade was not a happy time for me
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.640
eighth grade was not a happy time for me
and this is a movie that is not it's not

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
and this is a movie that is not it's not
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.979
and this is a movie that is not it's not
like a miserable movie or anything it's

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989
like a miserable movie or anything it's
 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.080
like a miserable movie or anything it's
not like welcome to the dollhouse but it

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
not like welcome to the dollhouse but it
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.860
not like welcome to the dollhouse but it
is a movie that definitely very well

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
is a movie that definitely very well
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.000
is a movie that definitely very well
taps into the insecurities of that age

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
taps into the insecurities of that age
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.080
taps into the insecurities of that age
and if I'm guessing correctly again I'm

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
and if I'm guessing correctly again I'm
 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.789
