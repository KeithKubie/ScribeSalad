LOGAN URY: We're
very lucky to have

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.510
Mandy Len Catron, an expert on
modern romance, here with us

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.680
today.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.890
Mandy is a professor at the
University of British Columbia,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.510
and she writes a
relationship advice

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.360
column for online
magazine "The Rumpus."

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.330
Now, raise your hand if
you've heard of the famous 36

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.660
questions from Mandy's wildly
popular New York Times Modern

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.190
Love essay, "To Fall in
Love with Anyone, Do This."

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.170
And keep your hand
raised if you've actually

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.420
gone through and answered
these 36 questions.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.920
Great.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.586
So we have a few
people in the audience.

00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:41.810
So it seems like many of you
are familiar with this idea.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.170
And for those of you who haven't
heard of it, in the essay,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.500
Mandy describes a date she
went on with an acquaintance.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.770
They tried a
20-year-old psych study

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.350
which was designed to
make people fall in love.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.040
They answered a series of
36 increasingly personal

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.730
questions, such as, when's
the last time you cried.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.220
This was followed by four
minutes of eye contact.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.880
She and her date ultimately
did fall in love,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.440
and yes, they are
still together today.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.870
So, Mandy, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.810
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Thanks for having me.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.643
LOGAN URY: By the way,
I'll leave 15 minutes

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.320
at the end for questions
from the audience.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590
So, Mandy, your
new book of essays

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.530
"How to Fall in
Love with Anyone"

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.320
is about how love stories shape
our ideas about love, sometimes

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.540
in unproductive and
misleading ways.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.440
Let's start there.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.125
What's the problem
with love stories?

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.500
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Well, I mean, I

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.666
think there are a lot of
problems with love stories,

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.220
actually.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.980
I first started
thinking about this--

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.630
when I was 26, my parents
sat my sister and I down

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.530
and they were like, we don't
love each other anymore;

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320
we're getting a divorce.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200
And I was really shocked.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.930
I didn't know that
anything was less

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.050
than perfect in
their marriage, and I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.990
had a really hard
time just, like,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.370
coming to terms with this.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.170
And I started
thinking about why.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.980
And one of the things
that I came up with

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.520
was that divorce felt
like the wrong ending

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.520
to their love
story, And I started

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.540
thinking about all the ways
in which love stories had

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.980
shaped me, like most of my
ideas about romantic love.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.280
And I began to feel
like, you know,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.590
maybe I don't know very
much about love at all.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.740
And so I just started
doing lots of research,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.630
and very quickly I was like this
topic, which is basically just

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.350
like the gap between
how we talk about love

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630
and how we actually
practice it--

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.910
and I mean, everything
from romantic comedies

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.250
to the stories we
tell each other

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.440
about our own relationships
to the stories we

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.080
inherit from our families--

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.820
that this gap was big enough
to become the subject of a book

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.240
basically.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.389
And so that's what I did.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.930
LOGAN URY: And now
we have your book.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.970
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.560
But I guess the short
answer to your question

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.270
is essentially love stories
suggest that there's

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.110
a right way to practice love
and that if you practice it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.270
that way then you'll be happy.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.450
And I think that often--

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
really often-- that's just not
the case, that actually love

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.420
is a lot more
complicated than that.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.280
LOGAN URY: So speaking
of being complicated,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.010
in your book and essays, you
say that the 36 questions are

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.426
compelling because they
create vulnerability

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.300
and the chance for people
to connect and feel

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.070
known, yet many people
have understood them to be

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.340
a guaranteed to produce love.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.410
Ironically, despite
your hesitations

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.560
around love stories,
your life has been viewed

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.540
as the ultimate love story.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.640
How do you reconcile
your intention

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.920
in writing the
36-question piece with how

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.230
people have interpreted it?

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.330
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
it's really strange.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.490
It's been a strange experience.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.600
I think I started writing this
book about five years before I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.540
published the article
in the New York Times.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.990
And so I had been thinking
like really long and hard

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.230
about the role of love
stories in our culture,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.980
and one of the things
that always bothered

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.620
me is that I felt like people
really wanted a simple story

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.350
and they liked sort of a really
clean and tidy narrative.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.860
And it was very strange,
then, to basically watch,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.360
because this article
was published.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.120
And I think within a
month it had gotten, like,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.280
8 million views, which is crazy.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.080
And so I was reading about my
own relationship in the news,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.510
and people would
say things like,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.000
they fell in love by
the end of the evening

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.400
or this is how she
met her husband.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.500
And none of those
things were true.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.660
We did the questions.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.050
We started dating probably
three months later,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.620
and we had only been
dating for, like,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.412
four months when the
article was published.

00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:03.370
LOGAN URY: No pressure.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.390
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.080
So it was really strange.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.690
And the other thing that
was interesting to me

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.520
is that people would say--

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.750
and when I say people, I
mean journalists, but also I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.040
spoke to a couple of
editors about the book--

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.520
and everybody would ask the
same question, which is, are you

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.180
guys still together.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.520
And when I said yes,
they were like, oh,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.240
my God, that's so great.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.570
And it was great,
but I felt like there

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.360
were much more interesting
things to say about it.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.971
But people didn't care.

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:39.220
They didn't want to hear that.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.420
They just want to
know that it worked.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.210
LOGAN URY: But people must come
up to you and say, I tried it,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.480
and we didn't fall in love.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.550
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
they have said that.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.880
And I'm like, that's because
there is no guarantee that

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.820
doing this equals
romantic love, but it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.990
does seem pretty good
at creating closeness.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.170
So I think going into
it with that in mind

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.020
is maybe a better
way to approach it.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.060
But I've realized
that it really doesn't

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.460
matter what I say about this.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.920
The study has taken
on a life of its own

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.636
that is sort of
separate from me.

00:06:13.636 --> 00:06:15.260
LOGAN URY: So in your
book, you discuss

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.150
unconventional
relationships that we

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.520
don't hear about in love
stories like "Cinderella"

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.070
or romantic comedies
like "Notting Hill."

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.521
You live in Vancouver,
we're here in the Bay Area,

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.270
and these are places
where different types

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.581
of relationships
are more accepted.

00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:30.830
In fact, my boyfriend and I
joke that in San Francisco

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.614
we have to come out to
our friends as monogamous.

00:06:33.614 --> 00:06:35.495
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.130
What would be your
advice for people

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.950
who are unfamiliar with
unconventional relationships,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.530
such as open marriages?

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.369
And what would you say for
people watching this online who

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.160
live somewhere where
those partnerships are

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.930
more stigmatized?

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.790
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Yeah, I mean, so one

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.090
of the things that I found when
I was researching this book

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.430
is that many love stories
have the effect of really

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.090
just narrowing our sense of
what love can look like and sort

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.200
of channeling it into this
like dominant practice of love.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.010
And that practice is what I call
the love-marriage-baby carriage

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.830
trajectory.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.770
Because ultimately love is
a biological experience,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.240
but it's also very social.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.720
And what we do with those
biological sorts of impulses

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.750
is very much channeled by
the culture that we live in.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.360
And so most of the stories
we consume I think really,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.870
like I was saying
earlier, suggest

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.980
that this is the way to be
happy and that if you're not

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.150
practicing love this way
then you're sort of failing.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.970
But actually, if you look at
the history of romantic love

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.600
and the history of marriage, one
of the things you'll discover

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.340
is that love and
marriage have only

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.620
been very tightly
interconnected for, like,

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.750
the past 200 or so years.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.150
And so this idea that
we think is normal

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.300
and maybe even universal, which
is that you find one person

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.550
and you want to spend the
rest of your life with them

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.330
and you have this intense
passionate love forever,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.230
is really a fairly new idea
in the history of humanity.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.740
So I think it's interesting
to think about it that way.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.860
And once you start
thinking about it that way,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.530
you realize there are actually
lots of different ways

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.970
to practice love.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.590
And so one of the
things that I found

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.070
is that what I wanted
from a love story changed

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.179
a lot over the course of writing
the book, and by the time

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.799
I got to the end of
the process, what

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.030
I found is that it was much
more interested in stories

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.590
that sort of widened our
sense of what love could be.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.240
And those would be
things like stories

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.540
about non-monogamous
relationships,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.010
queer relationships, even
stories about relationships

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.070
that are short but
meaningful, like something

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.250
that doesn't last your whole
life but still is important.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.670
And so anything where
we sort of approach

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.880
love with a real
complexity and look

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.360
for what makes it meaningful in
our lives instead of thinking

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.670
about how it's supposed to be--

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.220
those kinds of
stories, I think, are

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.580
the kinds of stories that we
should all be seeking out more.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.850
And I think the
advantage of looking

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.700
for those kinds of stories
is that, ultimately, you

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.310
have a broader sense of
possibility of what love might

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.920
look like, and then you
have a better chance

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.730
of creating the kinds of
relationships in your life

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.870
that work for you,
which I think is great.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.370
LOGAN URY: So what
would your advice

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.577
be for somebody who
maybe hasn't had success

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:47.660
with monogamous relationships
or is like, oh, what

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.380
else is out there, I don't
see a lot of examples of that?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.120
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah, and
non-monogamy I sometimes

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.380
feel like is like
the final frontier

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.910
of romantic relationships
in our culture,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.090
because it is so stigmatized.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.600
But I do think that's changing.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.740
A good friend of mine wrote this
great book called "What Love Is

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.360
and What It Could Be."

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.710
And her name is Carrie Jenkins,
and she's a philosopher at UBC.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:24.350
And she really thinks about
the biological science

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.680
of romantic love
and how that sort

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.900
of relates to our
social impulses

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.930
for what love looks like,
and she essentially suggests

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.220
that it is possible to change
our ideas about romantic love

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.320
but that it takes
time and practice

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.550
and opening ourselves
up to new possibilities

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.680
for how it might be practiced.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.395
So I would recommend that
people read her book,

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:50.154
because I think it's great.

00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:51.320
LOGAN URY: It's interesting.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.270
So you mentioned new ways
for love to be practiced.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.070
I really enjoyed your
newest Modern Love

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.360
essay, which was about Mark and
Mandy's relationship contract.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.120
And it includes commitments
for the next 12 months

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.810
of a relationship, such as how
he'll do chores, save money,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.850
and even have sex.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.590
For some people,
there's nothing less

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.740
sexy than signing a contract,
yet you called the experience

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.210
empowering.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.940
Tell us more about why
you created this contract

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.370
and how it's changed
your relationship.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.870
MANDY LEN CATRON:
So basically, one

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.660
of the nice things about
writing about romantic love

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.910
is that people send you things
all the time, like articles

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.290
and books and whatever.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.079
People, once they know
you're interested in it,

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:35.370
they are always sharing ideas
with you, which is great.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.690
So one of the things
that a friend of mine

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.860
sent me was this book called
"The New I Do," and it was just

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.040
ways of re-conceptualizing
marriage.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.270
And in it, she had a chapter
called "The Starter Marriage."

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.540
And basically the idea was
that you would have a two year

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.160
marriage and you
would sign a contract,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.300
and then at the end
of that two years

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.880
you could decide if you really
wanted to be with this person.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.040
And Mark and I were
reading it fairly early

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.920
in our relationship
and we both thought

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.980
it was an interesting idea.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.020
And so then a year
after that, we

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.080
were trying to decide whether
or not to move in together,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.010
and I think we both had a
lot of anxieties about it.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.212
And for me--

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:23.420
I feel like I can only really
speak for myself here--

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.580
but my anxieties were
really to do with the fact

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.256
that I was in a long
relationship from age 20 to 30,

00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:32.130
and then when I got out
of that relationship,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.130
one of the things
that I discovered

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.870
that was so amazing
about being single

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.110
was just being like fully
in charge of my own time.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.230
And I just had no idea
how great that would be.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:47.660
And I was scared that once I
started living with someone

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.180
again that I would give that up.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.040
Because I think I
have this tendency

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.640
to sort of like really deeply
invest in my relationships,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.640
which is not a bad thing.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.320
And so I wanted some way to
feel like there would be space

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.550
for me in my own relationship.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.530
And so Mark actually suggested,
hey, what about that contract

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.000
thing that we read about?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.870
And so we sat down one night
a week before he moved in,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.690
and we just went over
everything, everything

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.720
that we could think of.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.619
And a lot of people
think, oh, my God.

00:13:20.619 --> 00:13:22.160
A lot of the comments
in the New York

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.920
Times in response to
this article was like,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.940
are you guys robots?

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.830
It sounds so cold-hearted
and calculating,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.750
but it's really not at all.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.590
It's really about
the spirit of things.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.160
So the sex part people
were very concerned about.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.380
It's really just like,
this is an important part

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.330
of our relationship.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.980
It's something we
both value, and we

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.770
agree that we're going
to be monogamous for now.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.930
But we want it to be open to
changing that, because we want

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.150
to be open to changing
everything, I guess,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.730
and acknowledging
that people do change

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.990
and that our needs change.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.750
And there's something I
think so nice about that,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.750
because I just
really felt heard.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.330
And I never felt heard in a
relationship quite like that

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.210
before and that
my needs mattered,

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.290
and I think probably that was
great for both of us, which

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.840
is nice.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.690
LOGAN URY: What are some other
things you included that maybe

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.148
would have been
awkward to bring up

00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:18.690
outside of writing a contract?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.690
MANDY LEN CATRON: Well,
one of them is marriage.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.570
So I talked about that.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.330
Because it sort of
came out one night

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:34.700
that he felt a lot of pressure
to decide to get a ring

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.220
and do a proposal, and I
got really upset about this.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.710
And I think that
was because I felt

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.310
like we had been so intentional
about so many things

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.720
in our relationship.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.750
It just seemed to me
weird that this would be

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.240
a decision that he made alone.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.860
And so that was like a month
before we renewed our contract.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.600
So then, when we sat
down to renew it,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.070
we just said, OK, what do
you think about marriage

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.530
and is this something
we want to do?

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.840
And it was really nice just to
have a really open conversation

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.830
about it.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.180
I mean, I should be honest.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.060
It helps that it's my job
to think about these things.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.540
So it's much easier to bring
them up in conversation

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.740
because I'm thinking
about them all the time.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.790
Because we're always trying
to practice, because he's

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.580
really a good sport.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.730
So I'm always was
like, oh, I read this

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.580
about the research of
romantic love today.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.434
Recently, I think John
Gottman said when you got home

00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:40.475
and you greet your partner
at the end of the day,

00:15:40.475 --> 00:15:42.740
you should kiss for six seconds.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.060
So I told him this, and
so he's like, OK, cool,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.519
let's do it, which is great.

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.060
LOGAN URY: Yeah,
along similar lines,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.790
I was listening to the Tim
Ferriss podcast recently,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.590
and Esther Perel was on, the
couple's therapist and author.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.900
And she said, quote,
"Every other system gets

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.440
innovation, new ideas,
curiosity, inventiveness.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.230
Coupledom doesn't benefit from
the same innovative spirit

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.050
that every other company
and entrepreneurial space

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.740
benefits from."

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.820
So I'd certainly say that your
relationship contract is a more

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.890
innovative approach to love.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.110
What are some of the
other original ideas

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.600
or love hacks that
couples may use

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.027
to improve their relationships?

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:26.860
MANDY LEN CATRON: I
love that she said this.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.943
I hadn't heard this quote.

00:16:27.943 --> 00:16:29.240
It's so good.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.730
Yeah, there are lots of
things that you can do.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.830
So one of the things that
we do that I really like

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.805
is that we have a
monthly date night.

00:16:39.805 --> 00:16:41.690
So it's like the first
week of every month,

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.279
and the rule is that we
take turns planning it.

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.570
LOGAN URY: This goes back to
the emotional labor thing.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.486
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yep.

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:51.020
Whoever plans it
also pays for it,

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.840
and the other person doesn't
know anything about what we're

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.580
doing, except the day it is.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.550
And then they just
sort of go along.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.260
So everything is a surprise.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.800
So it's really fun
first of all, but it

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.530
is backed up by research.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.950
So there's this thing
called the misattribution

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.890
of arousal, which is
also by Arthur Aaron, who

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.030
did the 36 questions.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.770
So he did this study
where basically--

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.970
and it just so happens
to be done in Vancouver.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.390
And I think this was also
back in the 90s or maybe early

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.480
2000s.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.900
But there's this huge
suspension bridge.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.620
And so what he did is he had
this like attractive woman who

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.780
is his research assistant stand
at the end of the suspension

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.180
bridge, and when men
cross the bridge--

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.490
and I don't know how
far it is down, just

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.980
like hundreds of feet--

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.517
she would ask them
a few questions,

00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:43.850
just say, oh, I'm doing a study.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.558
And then she would
write her phone number

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:47.630
on the corner of the
paper and tear it off

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.754
and say, if you have
any questions, call me.

00:17:49.754 --> 00:17:51.170
So she did that
there and then she

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.320
also did it at the end of
just a regular walk way.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.090
And what they found
was that people

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.350
who had crossed the bridge were
statistically significantly way

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.270
more likely to call her.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.785
And so what they think is that
this physiological arousal--

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:10.760
so increased heart
rate and sweaty palms,

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.510
which is also what happens
when you fall in love--

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:20.630
happens when you do something
new or scary or interesting.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.980
And so we tend to
attribute those feelings

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.720
to the people that we're with
instead of to what we're doing.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.560
So there's real value,
basically, in novelty.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.120
So our role for date
night is that we

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.790
have to do something we
wouldn't normally do.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.060
And it's fun because
it's just fun,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.440
but there is a suggestion
that doing new things

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.480
together increases
your dopamine levels

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.440
and activates your
reward system and helps

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.290
keep you feeling attracted
to your partner, which

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.010
is interesting.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.510
LOGAN URY: Yeah, I
actually remember

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.850
hearing about that psych
study in intro to psych class.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.205
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
it's a popular one.

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:01.730
LOGAN URY: Then the
professor made a joke like,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.520
that's why you should take
your date to see a scary movie.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.060
MANDY LEN CATRON: Really?

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.720
This is so funny.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.070
LOGAN URY: Your
adrenaline will spike,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.180
and then you'll be
like, I must really

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.620
like the person I'm with.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.110
MANDY LEN CATRON: So this is
funny because a friend of mine

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:18.300
is a psychology professor, and
he used this to meet his wife.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.357
He took her to a scary movie.

00:19:20.357 --> 00:19:21.190
LOGAN URY: It works.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.620
MANDY LEN CATRON: And
now they're married.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.620
And he always tells his
students about this.?

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.329
LOGAN URY: Yeah, we'll
have to chat about this.

00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:29.120
What are some of the
novelties that you do?

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.620
I think all of this
is great fodder.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.703
MANDY LEN CATRON: Oh, man.

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:33.350
We have done all
kinds of things.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.960
We went on a long bike
ride to a part of town

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.880
we've never been to before.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.710
We went to a burlesque show.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.760
We went wine tasting.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.260
Gosh, I'm blinking.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.965
But we've done all kinds
of fun stuff in the city.

00:19:50.965 --> 00:19:53.270
And we went to the opera--

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.330
yeah, and just like things
that I wouldn't make time

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.957
to do during my regular life.

00:19:57.957 --> 00:20:00.290
LOGAN URY: So it sounds like
it's carving out that time,

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.810
taking turns planning, and
then really emphasizing

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.160
that it's novel.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.540
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.130
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.470
So I know from your book,
and you mentioned it now,

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.570
that one of the reasons
you started researching

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.150
the topic of love stories
is because your parents got

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.490
divorced after
decades of marriage.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.530
On the topic of
divorce, Louis C.K.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.630
has said, "Divorce
is always good news.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.300
I know that sounds
weird, but it's true

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.360
because no good marriage
has ever ended in divorce."

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.880
Now that you've spent the
last 10 years debunking

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.890
love stories, how do
you feel when you hear

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.140
a couple is getting divorced?

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.010
MANDY LEN CATRON: I
feel a deep empathy

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.500
because I know it's hard,
but I mean, sometimes

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.320
I do feel excited
for the people.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.400
This sounds horrible.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.506
Like a friend of mine--
so it wasn't a divorce,

00:20:51.506 --> 00:20:52.880
but a friend of
mine had had sort

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.130
of an on-again, off-again
relationship with this woman

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.564
for a long time.

00:20:56.564 --> 00:20:57.980
And he called me
one day, and he's

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.520
like, we finally ended things.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.730
And I was like, congratulations.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.955
And he was like, I'm
feeling really sad.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.809
I felt so bad.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.850
I was like, I'm so sorry.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.250
LOGAN URY: Is that because
you didn't like the person?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.420
MANDY LEN CATRON: No,
it was because I just

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.150
felt like it was the
right thing for him to do

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.900
and it had been hard.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.990
And I just felt like it
was going to open him up

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.460
to a better relationship.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.704
And I think because
I really went

00:21:26.704 --> 00:21:28.120
through a similar
experience where

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.620
I was in a long-term
relationship with someone

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.010
that I like really,
really loved,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.210
but we argued constantly.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.200
And it was a real
struggle to decide

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.330
whether or not to stay in
that relationship, which

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.990
I think also motivated me
to do all this research.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.830
Because there aren't a lot of
stories about people deciding

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.780
to end a pretty good, but not
great relationship, and now

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.060
there is.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:01.720
But I think because
I knew how much that

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.400
was a great experience for
me ultimately in the end.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.310
But yeah, divorces
are hard, and I

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.910
think the thing about divorce,
as opposed to just a breakup,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.920
is that it comes in
a lot more shame.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.500
Because it still has a
lot of social stigma.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.930
I mean, I think we're getting
more accustomed to it,

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.070
but nobody--

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.420
I shouldn't say nobody--

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.120
very few people enter into
this kind of commitment

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.260
expecting it to end.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.960
So you not only have to
deal with like the loss

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.037
of that relationship
and your partner,

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:33.370
and there is research that
shows going through a breakup

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.210
is like going through
cocaine withdrawal,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.520
like neurochemically.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.600
Like, your brain looks the
same to an fMRI machine.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.050
So, like, it sucks,
so I get that.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.707
Yeah.

00:22:46.707 --> 00:22:48.790
LOGAN URY: So do you
actually have a lot of people

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.160
reaching out to you saying,
I'm in a good, but not great

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.750
relationship, what should I do?

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.030
MANDY LEN CATRON: I got an
email about this yesterday.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.910
LOGAN URY: What are
you going to reply?

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.130
MANDY LEN CATRON: I don't know.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.740
It's really tough so often.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.120
And they're like strangers.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.120
They're not like people I know.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.060
And so often I want
to be like, you

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.257
should end the relationship.

00:23:13.257 --> 00:23:14.715
People in the
audience are gasping.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:25.130
Because I do think that there
are 7 and 1/2 billion people

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.940
in the world, and
I think there are

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.120
any number of people
that you could

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.660
have a great relationship with.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:42.940
And so there's this term
by this philosopher named

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.970
Elizabeth Brake called
"amato normativity,"

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.090
and the idea is
that in our culture

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.440
we tend to presume that it is
better to be in a relationship

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.680
and ideally a long-term
committed relationship

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.400
than to not be in
a relationship.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.876
And I love this word, because I
feel like this idea is so true

00:24:02.876 --> 00:24:04.000
but we never talk about it.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.600
And now that we have a word for
it, it's easier to talk about.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.150
But I think the
truth is, it's not

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.520
better to be in a
mediocre relationship

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.104
than it is to be single.

00:24:14.104 --> 00:24:16.270
LOGAN URY: We should put
that on a banner somewhere.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.192
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
put on the Google homepage.

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.150
LOGAN URY: There we go.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.110
Someone here may be
able to help with that.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.960
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
but it's not better.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.630
Being single can be so
great, and I don't think

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.330
we acknowledge that enough.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.590
So I don't know.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.740
I always want to be like, you
should leave that relationship,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.310
but I know that if I had
gotten that advice myself,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.970
I would not have taken it.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.678
LOGAN URY: But it also
feels like they're

00:24:45.678 --> 00:24:48.070
coming to you for it, sort of
like they want you to bless

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.152
leaving the relationship.

00:24:49.152 --> 00:24:50.110
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.860
And you know what?

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.060
I do, though.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.970
I got this email from this
girl and she was really young,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.009
and she was with her
high school boyfriend

00:24:57.009 --> 00:24:58.300
and they had graduated college.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.410
And she wanted to live a
different life than him.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.570
And I said, do you
want me to give you

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.160
permission to break his heart?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.480
Because I will.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.820
You'll both be
better off for it.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.350
And she emailed me
back six months later,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.440
and she was like, that
was the right thing to do,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.730
which is pretty cool.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.590
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.220
That's great.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.120
I think for the
rest of your life,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.800
people will come to
you with these issues.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.216
MANDY LEN CATRON:
I think so, too,

00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:26.110
and I just want to
be clear, sometimes

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.980
I do not know the answer
to these questions.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.510
But this is why I started
the advice column,

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.960
because I felt like
that was a better way

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.890
to sort of deal with this than
responding to personal emails.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.390
Because I don't know.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.330
It feels like a lot
of responsibility.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.830
LOGAN URY: You
should all check out.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.760
It's on therumpus.net, and I
think you've done two so far.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.510
And they're great.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.780
They're very research-backed.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.190
So it's not just
somebody saying, here's

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.023
what happened to me.

00:25:52.023 --> 00:25:54.100
It's saying, well,
researchers who

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.470
are in the space of
philosophy and psychology

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.630
and romantic relationships
have found this.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:59.140
MANDY LEN CATRON:
And this is what

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.840
I like about it, because I feel
like so much advice is just

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.490
someone's intuition.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.990
And I just don't trust
my intuition that much.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.640
So instead I'm like, let me
do some research for you,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.750
and that's fun because I
learn a lot in the process.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.750
LOGAN URY: That's great.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.570
So you're very
passionate about the idea

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.510
that love stories perpetuate
a mystical and unrealistic

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.070
quality to love.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.830
If you could design a
class, either in high school

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.620
or online, that every
person would be required

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.170
to take before entering
into adult relationships,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.890
what would you
include in the course?

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.140
MANDY LEN CATRON: Oh, my
gosh, this is so interesting.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.050
So I sort of teach
a course like this,

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:40.400
and it's not actually
meant to be practical.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.275
Because I teach
first-year composition,

00:26:42.275 --> 00:26:44.650
which is just like, here's
how to write a research paper.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.080
And that can be about anything.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:53.140
So I just use all the research
that I came across in my book,

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.610
and so we read a lot of
articles about romantic love.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.850
And then I have them write
a research paper about love,

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.230
which is really fun.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.950
But often I feel like
I'm just puncturing

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.100
the romantic illusions
of 18- and 19-year-olds,

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.680
and I feel conflicted
about that.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.230
Mostly I feel good about it.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.190
I think what I would
like everyone to do,

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.660
or what everyone
should do, is just

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.410
think long and hard about the
stories that have influenced

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:30.190
your ideas about romantic love
and think about the scripts

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.490
that they contain.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.600
There are these
sociologists who have

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.690
this theory that basically all
human knowledge is contained

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.450
in stories, and so they
talk about these scripts.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.850
And there can be like
a macroscript, which

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.430
is the role of love over the
course of your life, which

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.650
is this love-marriage-baby
carriage thing.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.280
But there are also
these micro scripts,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.220
which is just like, what
to say on a first date.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.012
And these scripts
basically are very useful,

00:27:55.012 --> 00:27:56.470
because they help
us figure out how

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.140
to interact with other people.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.960
But I think so often we
take these scripts to heart,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.990
and it's nice to look at
the scripts that really have

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.220
probably influenced you over the
years and step back from them

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.640
and say, which ones do these
do I actually want to practice

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.030
and which one of these
am I not so sure about

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.400
and do I want to reject?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.364
And that's been a
useful exercise for me.

00:28:23.364 --> 00:28:25.780
LOGAN URY: What are some of
the ones that you've rejected?

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.613
MANDY LEN CATRON: So
one of the biggest ones

00:28:27.613 --> 00:28:31.050
is this idea that love is
equated to deservingness,

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.460
which really bothers me.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:38.520
So this is the idea in pretty
much any Cinderella story.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.560
So I write a lot about
Cinderella stories

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.675
and in particular the
movie "Pretty Woman."

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.330
We had this on VHS at home
when I was growing up,

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.180
and my sister and I would watch
it when we were really little.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.610
I think I was 10
and she was six.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.760
And we watched "101 Dalmatians"
and we watched "Aladdin"

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.470
and we'd watch "Pretty Woman."

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.790
And I think of the ideas that
I absorbed, but really it's

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.060
like there's a
powerful man and then

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.180
there's a woman of
really low social status.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.470
And basically, all Cinderella
stories have this narrative,

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:17.610
and it's like she waits for
someone important to notice

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.530
her and choose her.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.310
And in Cinderella stories,
the woman is always chosen--

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.640
the genders can be reversed,
but typically it's a woman--

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.420
chosen because she's like
fundamentally good somehow.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.670
And in "Pretty Woman,"
the great example of this

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.440
is where she's in the bathroom
of their penthouse suite

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.870
and Richard Gere thinks
she's like doing drugs,

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.480
and he grabs her arm and
tries to kick her out.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.940
And he opens her hand,
and it's dental floss.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.950
So this is like 1990, which is
like the DARE era, where drugs

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.440
are the worst thing
a person can do

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.650
but oral hygiene is so great.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.190
So it's like, oh,
yeah, she's actually

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:05.080
a really good person who just
stumbled into this bad job--

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.310
but so this idea, which is,
like, some people deserve love

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.810
and if you are good then
someone will notice you.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.050
And you don't have to do
anything but just be good,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.040
and they'll choose you.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.210
And then you'll have the life
you've always dreamed of.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.660
And this story is so common,
and it's in "Dirty Dancing"

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.170
and it's in "Pretty
Woman" and it's

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.170
in all the different
versions of "Cinderella."

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.480
It's in "Titanic," even,
with the genders reversed,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.550
but I think it's a real problem.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.560
And it really implies,
especially for women,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.770
that the most important
moment of your life, the most

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.070
validating experience is
being chosen by someone

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.070
important or interesting.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.207
And I hate that idea.

00:30:52.207 --> 00:30:54.540
LOGAN URY: It seems like
there's two problematic issues.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.390
One is it implies that if
you're good, you'll be chosen.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.490
So if you're not chosen,
then you weren't good.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.090
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.673
LOGAN URY: And it
also seems like it's

00:31:01.673 --> 00:31:03.792
a very passive approach
to finding your partner.

00:31:03.792 --> 00:31:05.250
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Yeah, and I think

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.860
it's important to
point out the inverse,

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.680
that if you're not chosen then
you're not good, which I think

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.390
is really related to the stigma
of being single in our society.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.260
Single people have great
lives, and yet the implication

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.210
is like, oh, you
must be miserable

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.300
or, oh, you must be
doing something wrong.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.390
And sometimes that's
just not true.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:29.066
You're just living your life.

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:31.190
LOGAN URY: Well, that's
like the spinster bachelor.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.750
MANDY LEN CATRON: Absolutely.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.262
LOGAN URY: I think we need
a new word for single women.

00:31:34.262 --> 00:31:35.220
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:35.786
I do, too.

00:31:35.786 --> 00:31:37.410
I don't know what it
should be, but I'm

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.040
going to think about this.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.250
I want to get in the lexicon.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.916
LOGAN URY: Good.

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:43.020
I'll be on the lookout for it.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.260
So one of the reasons that
the 36 questions I think

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.120
is so powerful is
because it creates

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.850
space and social permission
for vulnerability.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.000
What are some other ways that
people can foster vulnerability

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.962
in romantic and other
interpersonal relationships?

00:31:56.962 --> 00:31:59.170
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
that's such a great question.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.500
I like that you're asking this.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.410
I mean, you don't have
to sit down and do the 36

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:09.860
questions on a date to
generate a sense of intimacy,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.110
but it is a good way to do it.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.590
And you should try
it if you haven't.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.450
But I do think that we have this
idea, especially when dating,

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.400
that it's our job
to present our best

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.570
selves to the other person.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.670
And in actuality,
people tend to respond

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:31.010
to seeing a little
bit of vulnerability,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.590
like a little bit of weakness.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.080
Or weakness is maybe
not the right word,

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.815
but like imperfection.

00:32:37.815 --> 00:32:38.690
I think that matters.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.870
And if you look at
OK Cupid's advice

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.594
for posting profile
pictures, one

00:32:44.594 --> 00:32:46.010
of the things that
they suggest is

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.280
that you post a picture
that you yourself think

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.810
is not that flattering.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.390
But if you have
a unique feature,

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.140
like say you have
a prominent nose--

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.280
I think this is the
example that they use--

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.440
they're like, you
should have a picture

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.030
that really shows that off.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.880
Because actually, some people
are going to really like that,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.770
and you want to cater
to those people.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.240
And I think the same
is true of everything.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.400
And if you go on a date and
you just acknowledge, like,

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.020
oh, I'm not a morning person
or whatever-- just revealing

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.230
any sort of small
details about yourself

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.750
encourages other
people to do the same.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.850
And that slow exchange of
intimacy or vulnerability

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.822
can happen in a
less structured way.

00:33:31.822 --> 00:33:33.530
LOGAN URY: Do you do
that when you engage

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.090
with people, besides Mark?

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.740
Do you ever find
yourself saying,

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.240
oh, I'm going to
say this thing that

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.840
feels authentic and vulnerable
and see if they reciprocate?

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.700
MANDY LEN CATRON: I
don't know that I do it

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.870
with that level of trying to
get people to reciprocate,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.410
but I do do it.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.710
And one of the things
that I've found--

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.400
so when I started doing all
this research, I started a blog.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.030
And what I found
was that the more

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.000
sort of vulnerable the
writing was on my own blog,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.520
the more people
responded to it, which

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.430
had the effect of making
me feel more comfortable

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.550
being vulnerable publicly.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:16.070
But also, in general, I've just
realized people respond well

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.139
to this authenticity.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:22.670
When you just own who you are,
I think it goes a long way.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.957
So I've become more
comfortable doing it over time.

00:34:25.957 --> 00:34:28.290
LOGAN URY: Yeah, I think it's
great advice for everyone.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.250
Sometimes first dates can
feel like a job interview,

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.210
and there's so much more
fun when they're not.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.668
MANDY LEN CATRON:
When they're not.

00:34:34.668 --> 00:34:37.219
LOGAN URY: So one of my friends
hosted a No Small Talk party.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:38.690
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Oh, this is cool.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.630
LOGAN URY: Maybe we should
have a No Small Talk first date

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:42.139
rule--

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.820
so anyone here who wants
to sign up for that.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.986
MANDY LEN CATRON: I think
that's a great rule, yeah.

00:34:45.986 --> 00:34:47.831
Just be really honest
about something

00:34:47.831 --> 00:34:48.830
that's important to you.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.330
LOGAN URY: If the person
can find it on LinkedIn,

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.727
you don't need to mention it.

00:34:51.727 --> 00:34:53.060
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.185
I think that's a good rule.

00:34:54.185 --> 00:34:56.768
LOGAN URY: So let me ask you one
more question, and then we'll

00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:58.994
have time to open up for
questions from the audience.

00:34:58.994 --> 00:35:00.410
We talked about
this a little bit,

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.110
but this is a question I
like to ask everyone that I

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.020
bring into Google to interview.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.120
We have the google.com
homepage, the white screen

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.030
with the logo where people
search billions of times

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.950
of the day.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.439
You came up with one idea, but--

00:35:13.439 --> 00:35:15.230
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
I have a real idea.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.396
LOGAN URY: --with one thing
to put on the google.com

00:35:17.396 --> 00:35:19.910
homepage related to
dating and relationships,

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.840
what would it be?

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.880
MANDY LEN CATRON: I
think what it would be is

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.370
I think I would
say that love isn't

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.950
something that happens to you.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.540
Love is offering yourself with
generosity to another person.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.180
I think that would
be my message.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.400
LOGAN URY: That's so nice.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.340
Great.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.380
So we have a
volunteer who's going

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.430
to go around with the mic.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.510
So if you have a question,
just raise your hand,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.800
and he'll get to you.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.900
AUDIENCE: One of my
questions for you is I

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.330
feel, especially as a
woman, I'm much more

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.550
emotional and vulnerable
and open to talking

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.400
about my emotions.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.450
And I definitely want
to talk about or go

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.520
through this list of
questions with my boyfriend,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.540
but I'm afraid
he's going to look

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.900
at me like I have six heads.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.670
And he's going to
be like, why do you

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.470
want to talk all
this emotional stuff?

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.016
What's wrong?

00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:06.050
And everything is fine.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.260
I just don't think
he'll dig into it.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.540
Maybe Mark is really
that kind of person

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.430
that's open to talking
about it, but how

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:17.870
do you talk to a 28-year-old
guy about these deep questions?

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.760
MANDY LEN CATRON:
That's a great question.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.450
I mean, I think it's
worth noting that the 36

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:27.590
questions start
out really casually

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.390
and they get more
intimate as you go along.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.290
So the first one is, if you
could have dinner with anyone

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.970
living or dead, who
would it be, which

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.210
I think is just interesting.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.340
And I think maybe if
you just position it

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.790
as like a fun game
and a way to get

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.030
to know each other--
like, a friend of mine

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:51.440
texted me yesterday
and she said my partner

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.930
and I finally did
the 36 questions.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:58.910
And they have been together
for 15 years or something.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.670
And she's like, I learned
new things about him,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.420
and I was so surprised.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.470
So I think the value
of it sometimes

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.160
is just you learn things that
you wouldn't necessarily know.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.430
And it's not like that things
are these necessarily deeply

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.480
revealing things.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.210
Sometimes they're just
interesting facts.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.480
And I think if you position
it that way-- it's not like,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.340
hey, let's sit down and talk
about our feelings, which

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.780
sometimes Mark and I say to
each other ironically as a way

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.460
to actually talk
about our feelings.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.170
Because that feels like a
ridiculous thing to say,

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.950
but I think it's
like, oh, hey, look,

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.080
I think this would
be fun, let's try it.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.857
Because it is fun.

00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:46.190
LOGAN URY: And you can blame us.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.980
You can be like, I went
to this thing at Google.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.680
MANDY LEN CATRON: Totally.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.540
AUDIENCE: You talk about
good relationships,

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:56.060
great relationships,
complicated relationships.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.440
And my question is if you
are in a relationship that

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.464
might be complicated and
it might not be great,

00:38:04.464 --> 00:38:06.380
do you think that there
is a chance for people

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.780
to fall in love again?

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.702
Or do you think once things
are broken, they're broken?

00:38:12.702 --> 00:38:14.160
MANDY LEN CATRON:
You know, I'm not

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.490
very absolute about anything.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.190
I'm sort of wary of
really fixed rules.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.480
So I guess I would say of
course there's a chance.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:30.650
But I do think we tend to create
these patterns of interactions

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:35.880
with other people, and a lot of
research suggests this as well.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.350
And it's really difficult
to break those patterns,

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.820
but I do think it is
possible to change things.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.540
This is like another tip related
to your question earlier.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.680
So John Gottman, famous
relationship psychologist,

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.780
talks about basically having
a relationship bank account,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.180
and you want to always
keep it in the block.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.140
And he suggests that you need
like five positive interactions

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.640
for every one
negative interaction,

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.560
and he has lots of ways
to and incorporate these

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.090
into a relationship.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:17.130
But really, you can practice
positive interactions,

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.670
and you can train yourself
to do more of them.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.530
And getting that
ratio up I think

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.650
goes a long way towards
relationship satisfaction.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.160
And so it's just little things
like touching your partner

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.830
on the shoulder and being
like, hey, how was your day

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.360
or saying, thank you.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.160
Thank you goes a long way--

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.770
and just like thanks
for taking out the trash

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.040
or doing the laundry
or whatever--

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.880
just little, small,
positive interactions.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.992
So I think, yeah,
everything's changeable.

00:39:47.992 --> 00:39:49.700
AUDIENCE: I have two
if that's all right.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.750
One's just a quick one.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:55.056
You mentioned a word, I
think "amato normativity."

00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:56.930
Spellcheck or spelling
on that would be good,

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.220
so I can Google it.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.420
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.410
It's a-m-a-t-o
n-o-r-m-a-t-i-v-i-t-y.

00:40:06.087 --> 00:40:07.670
LOGAN URY: She's an
English professor.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.310
MANDY LEN CATRON: I always get
nervous spelling things aloud,

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.540
because I'm like, the
stakes are high being

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:13.880
an English professor.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.250
LOGAN URY: Google has good--

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.000
it would help you.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.500
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Amato normativity.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.486
It's spelled exactly
like it sounds.

00:40:19.486 --> 00:40:21.730
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.660
That was my guess,
so made me feel good.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.640
And so the main question is that
there is a concept or this idea

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.910
that everyone is our
mirror, and there's a saying

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.980
that if you can
spot it, you got it.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.510
And relationships fail when
we see in others qualities

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:42.020
that we dislike about
ourselves, and similarly,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.390
if you admire someone, it's
because you see something

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.610
in them that you
have yet to own.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.570
So my question is, is that B.S.?

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.580
Do you ascribe to that, or
what are your thoughts on that?

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.500
It's kind of like a how do you
fall in love with yourself type

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.190
question.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.870
MANDY LEN CATRON:
That's interesting.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.470
I'm not sure what I think
about that, to be honest.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:07.580
I mean, I do think being in a
relationship with someone who

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.630
likes you makes you
like yourself more,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.560
and I do think liking your
partner goes a long way.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.960
I mean, I don't think we
talk about liking enough.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.290
We talk about loving a lot, but
we don't talk that much about

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.580
liking.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.490
And there's this thing
that psychologists

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.160
have written about called the
Michelangelo effect, which

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.370
is really if you see
the best in your partner

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:36.230
that they will aspire to become
the person you see in them.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.750
And that goes both ways.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:43.460
So if your partner
sees the best in you,

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.280
then you will aspire to be
the person that they imagined.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.000
So I suspect that
there's a huge benefit

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.450
in noticing the great
things about your partner

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.990
and paying attention to
them and complimenting them.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:03.960
And this is something that I try
to do in my relationship a lot,

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.630
and it's also just nice
to be complimented.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:10.650
So I would say be
in a relationship

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.780
with someone who
notices the good in you,

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.794
and notice the good
in other people.

00:42:16.794 --> 00:42:18.710
LOGAN URY: Is that advice,
though, that you've

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.327
given other people,
where you say,

00:42:20.327 --> 00:42:22.910
you have to love yourself before
you can be in a relationship?

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.680
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah, I
don't know if that's true.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.780
I kind of feel like
that's crappy advice,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.290
because there are
plenty of people

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.780
who don't love
themselves, who probably

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.886
have a lot of self-loathing
who are in relationships.

00:42:36.886 --> 00:42:38.510
Obviously, it's great
to love yourself,

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.210
but I think it is much
easier to love yourself

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.011
when you're with
someone who likes you.

00:42:44.011 --> 00:42:45.760
And I've been in
relationships with people

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.000
I loved who love me that I'm not
sure we liked each other that

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.860
much.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.170
AUDIENCE: Just to follow up
on your previous answers,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.750
you said there are a lot of
people who loathe themselves

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.004
who are in relationships.

00:42:57.004 --> 00:42:59.170
Do you think they're in
healthy, good relationships?

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.420
MANDY LEN CATRON: I don't know.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.097
I don't know.

00:43:02.097 --> 00:43:04.180
I don't know if I'm ready
to answer this question.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.846
Because I think it's
really interesting,

00:43:05.846 --> 00:43:09.570
but my instinct is that the
answer to this should be no.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.990
But I don't really
know if that's true.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:15.190
So I'd have to do a little
research to figure that out.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.160
To what extent does
liking yourself

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.650
make you happy in
your own relationship?

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.030
It probably goes fairly far.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:26.680
I'm sure it makes a difference.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.170
That's an unsatisfying answer.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.940
I just want to get it right.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.245
So I don't know.

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.620
LOGAN URY: Maybe
we'll submit it.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.869
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
submit it to my advice column,

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:41.680
and I'll do some research
and I'll write about this.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.430
Because I would actually
like to know this answer.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.680
AUDIENCE: If you could have
dinner with anyone, living

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.486
or dead, who would it be?

00:43:49.486 --> 00:43:50.860
MANDY LEN CATRON:
You know what's

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:57.415
so funny is I was looking over
the 36 questions recently,

00:43:57.415 --> 00:43:59.540
and it's been, like, three
years since we did them.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.930
And I realized, I don't
remember any of my answers

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:06.200
or Mark's answers,
or I remember a few.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.170
But that one I couldn't
remember the answer,

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.650
so I decided that I needed
to come up with an answer.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.120
And actually, I
decided it would be

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.220
my dad's mother, my grandmother,
who died when I was 13.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.420
Because I was able to interview
my mom's mom, my grandmother,

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.170
about her love story for
this book and write about it.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:29.080
She has a fantastic love story.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.970
She met my grandfather.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.240
So they lived in this
tiny, little coal mining

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.900
camp in rural Appalachia, like
in the hollers of Virginia.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.620
And she met my
grandfather when he

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.930
was on leave from World War II.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.930
And she was 13 and he was 29.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.640
I know.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.660
And they spent two weeks
together just chatting,

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.620
and then he went back to
France and fought in Normandy.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.242
And then he came home and was
like, well, let's get married.

00:45:00.242 --> 00:45:01.450
And that was two years later.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.970
So she was 15 and he was
31 when they got married,

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.590
and then they had
eight children.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.270
And he died when I was four,
and she never remarried.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.780
Anyway, it's such an
interesting story to me,

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.570
and I loved talking
to her about it.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:17.890
So I'd love to be able to
interview my other grandmother

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.977
and find out her love story.

00:45:20.977 --> 00:45:22.810
AUDIENCE: Kind of going
back to the question

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:27.980
about if you don't like yourself
but you're in a relationship--

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.240
I'm more interested
in how would you

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.440
go about-- what's your process
for making a study like that?

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.230
Do you just find
couples in relationships

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:42.370
and ask them, do you hate
yourself but love this--

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.980
I'm curious, actually, how would
you run any of your studies

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.064
that you do for research
and do research for this?

00:45:47.064 --> 00:45:48.854
MANDY LEN CATRON: I
don't do these studies.

00:45:48.854 --> 00:45:51.160
So what I would do is I would
turn to one of my friends

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.980
who's a psychologist
and say, can you

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:58.520
do this study and
I'll write about it?

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:05.780
But I think there are ways
for measuring self-esteem,

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.500
and there are ways for measuring
relationship satisfaction.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.460
Psychologists have
created tools for this,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.830
and I guess you would
just compare those two.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:19.190
But I'm not a psychologist,
so I don't know.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.960
I just read a lot of psychology.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.960
LOGAN URY: Just to give
you an example if you're

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.584
curious around the
background-- so they

00:46:25.584 --> 00:46:27.500
could likely do a
longitudinal study

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.580
where they could track a
series of people over something

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.350
like four years,
and then they would

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.060
say, how much do
you like yourself

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.170
and how happy is
your relationship?

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.753
And they could track
it and they could

00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:40.730
see this person consistently
didn't like themselves

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:42.650
and they consistently
had these relationships.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.733
This person, when they
started to like themselves,

00:46:44.733 --> 00:46:45.709
we saw these changes.

00:46:45.709 --> 00:46:47.750
And then if there was a
statistically significant

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.180
difference, they might be
able to say something like,

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.014
when people like
themselves they start to be

00:46:52.014 --> 00:46:53.138
in healthier relationships.

00:46:53.138 --> 00:46:55.260
MANDY LEN CATRON: See, we
have a psych major here.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.770
She's very handy.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.750
AUDIENCE: My question
would be, what makes

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.610
a great relationship great?

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.070
And what is the difference
with a good relationship?

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.635
Is it all the
emotional connection?

00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:10.010
MANDY LEN CATRON: What makes
a great relationship great--

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.090
so I've thought
about this a lot,

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.640
and I think the short
answer is kindness.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.050
So much of the psychological
research on romantic love

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:26.030
can be summarized as
being kind to someone

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.010
and having them be kind to you.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:34.900
So I think a good rule for
gauging a relationship is, am I

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.050
able to be kind to my partner?

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.270
And are they kind to me?

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.610
And I think if the answer
to either of those questions

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:47.380
is no, then you should
really think about why

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.332
you're in that relationship.

00:47:49.332 --> 00:47:51.290
AUDIENCE: After your
talk, I realized we mainly

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.840
discuss about the relationship
between two people,

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.610
but often in the
actual real world

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.060
it's like, I come from my
family and my girlfriend also

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.400
comes from a family.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.400
And I guess at certain
points, she would ask me,

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.840
hey, maybe it's time
for us to get married.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.220
Maybe it's not herself,
maybe just some pressure

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.430
from her family,
something like that.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.660
I'm not sure in that
situation how should

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.880
I talk with her
about that point.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.050
Because I myself, I
feel like maybe we

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:21.230
should slowly get in that stage
and then maybe get married.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:25.190
But what if her family-- hey,
it's time for us to get a baby

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.112
or for some biological
reason, maybe you

00:48:27.112 --> 00:48:29.570
should get a baby as soon as
possible, something like that?

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.830
I'm not sure how would
you deal with that case

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.800
if your girlfriend is
coming up with that issue.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.460
MANDY LEN CATRON: Yeah,
I mean, I don't know.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.820
But I think what you're asking
a really important question,

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.880
and it's important
to acknowledge what's

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.380
at the heart of
this question, which

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:53.580
is that love is very much not
just a feeling but a practice.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.210
And that practice is
very much controlled

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.270
by our social environments.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.970
And that can be everything
from our immediate family

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:06.020
to a religious belief to
a cultural background,

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:10.610
and all of these things
indicate how people

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.620
think about romantic love.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:17.090
My dad grew up in
the rural South,

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:24.610
and he has really traditional
ideas about love-- traditional

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.140
as in the past 100
years, I guess,

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.340
how it's been
practiced in America.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:35.660
And so he is waiting
for my partner

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.120
to decide that he
wants to marry me,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.270
and I'm like, that's not
how our relationship works.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.320
But it's really difficult
to cross that cultural gap.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.570
AUDIENCE: Actually
what my [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.820
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Yeah, so I don't

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.610
think I have a good answer
for how to deal with this,

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:57.980
but my advice would be to seek
out stories and experiences

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.920
from other people who've
been in this situation.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.070
Because really, if we
think love stories give us

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.590
scripts and scripts tell
us how we can possibly

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.030
behave in a given
number of situations,

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.590
then gathering as many of
those scripts as possible

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.180
will give you more options
for how you might handle it.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.430
AUDIENCE: So more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.710
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Yeah, basically.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.320
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
in relationships today,

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.300
the key metric to
success is longevity,

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.470
and I was wondering if you
subscribe to that metric.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:33.790
And also, so you were talking
about marriages today,

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:35.630
that there's a
modern phenomenon--

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.910
relatively modern
phenomenon-- of marriages

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:40.310
being very passionate
and romantic.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:43.510
And so if longevity
is a good metric,

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.790
do we have to redefine
our idea of what

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.970
marriage should be like?

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.710
MANDY LEN CATRON:
So first I'll say

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:54.980
I don't know that
longevity is a good metric.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.680
I don't think of it
as a good metric.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.480
I guess I feel
complicated about it.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.200
Because like you were saying
this is your anniversary

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.750
and I was like,
congratulations--

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.890
LOGAN URY: Only of having
lunch at Big Table.

00:51:09.105 --> 00:51:10.730
MANDY LEN CATRON:
And so I was thinking

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:15.170
about I have this impulse
to congratulate people,

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.860
and yet longevity
doesn't really tell you

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.196
anything about the quality
of our relationship at all.

00:51:22.196 --> 00:51:23.570
I know people
who've been married

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.060
for a very long time who
don't seem particularly

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.290
happy to be together.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.940
And so I do think
we would benefit

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:40.310
from coming up with better
metrics, kindness being one.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.250
And what was the second
part of your question?

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:47.780
AUDIENCE: Well, based on the
premise of longevity being

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.735
a good metric, do we have to
redefine how we see marriage

00:51:50.735 --> 00:51:52.334
in terms of cash-in?

00:51:52.334 --> 00:51:53.750
MANDY LEN CATRON:
And I will say I

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.290
do think we need to redefine it
regardless, because the fact is

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.520
we live in a culture,
like it or not,

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.110
that values
long-term commitment.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.490
And really, most people aspire
to long-term commitment,

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:12.300
and I don't think that's
going to change anytime soon.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.520
So I do think we would
benefit from changing

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.510
our expectations of marriage for
sure or long-term relationships

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:21.910
in general.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.590
There is this
research that shows--

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.330
it's by this psychologist
named Eli Finkel,

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.510
and he's found that,
essentially, marriage

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.120
has climbed over
the past, I don't

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.770
know, 60, 70 years--
or maybe even

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.404
longer than that-- climbed
Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:39.320
I don't know if you guys
are familiar with us,

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.480
but it's basic needs
like food, shelter.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.600
And then it's like
belonging and love,

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.110
and then it's self-actualization
up at the top.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.980
And what we increasingly want
and expect from our marriages

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.660
is self-actualization.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.120
So we're looking
to this one person

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.660
to give us the best
sex we've ever had

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.500
and be like a perfect
parent and to have

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:09.350
stimulating conversations about
the latest Malcolm Gladwell

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:10.040
book.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.730
And so it's like we want all
these things from this one

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.250
person, and essentially,
what he suggests

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.110
is that's really unrealistic.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.650
And we would benefit
from diversifying

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:23.420
the ways in which
we meet those needs

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.660
for self-actualization so we're
getting them from other people.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:31.310
The other really interesting and
not so good side effect of that

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:34.070
is that the best
marriages are probably

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:38.000
more happy and satisfied
than ever before,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.790
but fewer and fewer
people are achieving

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.770
that sort of pinnacle
of self-actualization

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:43.979
within a marriage.

00:53:43.979 --> 00:53:45.770
And one of the things
that he's pointed out

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.860
is that increasingly
satisfaction in marriage

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.850
is only accessible to
people of upper-middle class

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:57.027
and upper class, because it
requires-- like this date

00:53:57.027 --> 00:53:58.610
night, which I was
saying is so great,

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:00.860
but it requires
financial flexibility

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.000
to be able to do
something like that.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.839
Especially if you
have children, you

00:54:05.839 --> 00:54:07.380
need to be able to
hire a babysitter,

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:11.540
or you need to not be working
65 hours a week or whatever.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.300
So having the time to invest--

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.290
like the more you invest
in your relationship,

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.960
the more you get out of it--

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.110
but having the time and
resources to do that,

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:22.830
not that many people have that.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.930
So on the whole, I think we
need to really rethink marriage,

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.724
but that'll be another book.

00:54:28.724 --> 00:54:29.390
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:32.510
My name is Ricardo, and I
believe you mentioned earlier

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.454
that you've seen
relationships where

00:54:35.454 --> 00:54:36.870
you're in love
with another person

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.494
but maybe you don't
like them right now

00:54:38.494 --> 00:54:39.855
or every or something.

00:54:39.855 --> 00:54:42.320
And I was wondering,
what do you think

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.530
keeps the love alive in
such kinds of relationships

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:48.080
when you just don't
like your partner?

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.300
MANDY LEN CATRON: I don't know.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:51.680
That's a great question.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.180
Why do we stay in
relationships with people

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.205
we don't like that much?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.710
I don't know.

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.010
I mean, I think maybe I
can only speak for myself

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.750
on this particular point.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:08.850
And I definitely stayed in
a relationship with somebody

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.290
who I really, deeply loved.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:13.690
Like, I felt this strong
sense of intimacy,

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:17.730
and there was a lot
of physical attraction

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:20.880
and there was a lot
of shared history.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.060
And the problems is we were
really critical of each other

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.720
all the time, and
criticism has been shown

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.370
to really erode relationships.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.560
So I think it was
really a matter of time,

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.210
but I think part of what kept me
in that relationship, or maybe

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.680
even both of us, was the
sense that we had already

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.350
invested a lot.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:45.060
I don't know if you're familiar
with the economic theory

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.840
of sunk costs.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.500
It's like you've already
paid for these tickets

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.810
to the baseball game, and
even though you have a cold,

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:54.300
you're like, I'm going to go
to this baseball game anyway,

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.230
even though I'd rather stay
home and watch a movie.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.680
So I think it's like I'm going
to stick out this relationship

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.730
because I've been
in it for so long,

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.810
and the work of finding a new
partner is really intimidating

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.020
and the other side
feels like very unknown.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.460
And if not perfect,
it's like it's familiar.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:20.600
And I think that that sort
of inertia is powerful.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.886
It's scary to end
a relationship.

00:56:22.886 --> 00:56:24.260
LOGAN URY: Well,
Mandy, thank you

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.390
so much for being vulnerable
with us and coming.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.530
It was really great
to talk to you.

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.720
MANDY LEN CATRON:
Thanks for having me.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.550
This was so much fun.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:29.216
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:56:29.216 --> 00:56:30.080
Thank you.

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.430
