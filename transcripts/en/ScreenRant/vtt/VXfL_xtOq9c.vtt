00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.150
Fans know to always be on the hunt for easter
eggs or hidden references, especially as shared

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.049
movie universes become more and more popular.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.570
But who says the fun has to stop when the
movie does?

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.930
Whether they change the message, offer a laugh,
or tease something to come, these post-credits

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.000
scenes are a must-watch for movie buffs.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.189
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Movie Scenes
You've Never Seen #2.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.900
Kill Bill
Quentin Tarantino is famous for putting extra

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.730
work into his end credits, like saving the
Bride's actual name until the credits of Kill

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.730
Bill Volume 2.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.310
But fans who stuck it out through the movie's
entire credits were treated to not another

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.410
reveal or inside joke, but a blooper.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.030
Or, as much of a blooper as an eyeball being
ripped out can ever be.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.360
The X-Files: I Want To Believe
Mulder and Scully never managed to be as successful

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.780
on film as they were in the TV show, but the
X-Files stars got a truly happy ending, assuming

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.120
fans were willing to wait for it.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.990
The second X-Files movie didn't wrap up the
mysteries of the show, but the post-credits

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.100
scene revealed Mulder and Scully drifting
towards a tropical island, waving to the camera.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.820
It doesn't make any sense, which makes it
even more incredible.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.611
American Gangster
Sometimes a post-credits scene is used to

00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:10.250
tease a sequel, or show that the ending wasn't
as final as audiences thought.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.570
But American Gangster is a completely different
animal.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.260
Instead of showing more of Denzel Washington's
character's fate, or the lawmen who brought

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.350
him down, they put the audience into the shoes
of his many victims.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
We should all hope our last views are this
badass.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.720
X-Men Origins: Wolverine
Wolverine's first solo movie didn't go as

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.610
fans had hoped, which meant plenty of them
probably left the theatre long before the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.610
credits rolled.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.560
Sadly, some of the best moments of fan service
came at the end: Logan returning to his northern

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.640
bar from the first X-Men, and even heading
to Japan, a major setting for his comic book

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.710
history - not to mention confirming his Canadian
heritage once and for all...

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.020
Wayne's World
As one of the most quotable and self-aware

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.890
movies of the 1990s, it shouldn't come as
a surprise that Wayne and Garth stuck around

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.159
until the movie's final moments.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.409
After the movie's multiple Scooby Doo endings,
seeing the stars unsure of exactly what to

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.510
do next was the kind of weird humor fans couldn't
get enough of.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.560
The Fast &amp; The Furious
Long before movie fans knew to wait through

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.470
the credits for a tease of a sequel, the minds
behind The Fast &amp; The Furious were already

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.290
hoping for a lasting franchise.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.010
They could never have known it would become
a billion-dollar series, but the filmmakers

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.170
made sure to give Dominic Toretto a post-credits
stinger, showing he made it to Mexico after

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.130
all - a plot they picked up in the fourth
movie.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.770
Frozen
Since it was a Disney movie, it was all but

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.060
guaranteed that Frozen would have a happy
ending - and it had one of the happiest that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640
any kids' movie could hope for.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.610
But fans have to watch until the very end
to see that no character was overlooked, as

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.110
Marshmallow, Elsa's giant snow monster apparently
didn't melt with the rest of the kingdom.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.360
In fact, he's wearing the crown of Arendelle,
hopefully giving the Queen a fight for the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.260
throne in a coming sequel.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.840
Ted 2
The movie is filled with celebrity cameos,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.780
but Liam Neeson's is the strangest, trying
to buy a box of Trix cereal.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.010
Since he knows that "Trix are for kids," he
demands Ted's word that he won't be followed,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.670
or be given any trouble.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.550
It's played for a laugh, but to see the joke
paid off, wait after the credits - when a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.930
beaten and bloody Neeson returns the cereal,
staring Ted down for betraying his trust.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.840
Wall-E
Pixar is known for its sense of humor, breaking

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.569
the movie's fiction to give easter eggs or
nods to other movies.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.010
Wall-E didn't stray too far from its own story,
but for the final title card, Pixar's famous

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.300
mascot, Luxo the lamp, has a problem only
Wall-E can solve.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.230
Of course, the little robot makes things worse
just as quickly as he saves the day.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.980
Cars
Pixar's vision of a world where cars replace

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.640
people was filled with puns, gags and references
only parents would understand - but did you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.400
know that Pixar's most famous films also exist
in the Cars universe?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.040
Stick around for the end credits, and you'll
see clips from all of Pixar's biggest hits,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.590
with most of their cast returning to voice
a line or two as a car counterpart to their

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.600
famous characters.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.280
Those are the secret movie scenes and post-credits
stingers we think every fan should keep in

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.720
mind, but which ones did we miss?
