00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.350
If a commodities
trader tells you

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.180
that a market is
in backwardation,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.380
they're essentially
saying that it

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.760
costs more to buy
whatever commodity they're

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.980
talking about now than
it would to buy it later,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.600
to go into a futures
contract to buy whatever

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.520
that commodity might
be-- silver, gold,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.570
or oil-- to buy it later.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.440
So later is cheaper.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.540
So, the question you might
ask yourself, or really,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.450
any trader might ask
themselves, is this bullish

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.670
or is this a bearish?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.250
Is this a bullish situation?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.840
And there's no obvious
rule of thumb here.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.580
But if someone says,
look, to get something now

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.840
costs more than to
get it later, what

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.830
does that tell you about
what's happening in the market?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.500
Well, it tells you that
people are desperate.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.340
Because if they
weren't desperate,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.630
the rational thing to
do would just be wait.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.850
Wait a little while and
get it cheaper for later.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.250
Or, if you don't need
that oil right now,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550
if you don't need
that corn right now,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.340
or if you don't need
that gold right now,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.350
instead of paying
more for it right now,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.450
just say, look, I could
enter into a futures

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.290
contract for delivery of
that gold or oil or corn

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.400
or whatever it is at a later
date for a cheaper price.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.420
And I wouldn't even have to
store it between now and then.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.890
So, if some people were rational
and if they weren't desperate,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.050
this wouldn't happen.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.710
But because they're
willing to do this,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.120
they're willing to pay more
now than for a future delivery

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.780
date, it shows you that there
might be some type of shortage.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.595
In the case of oil,
maybe the oil supply

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:44.960
has been disrupted somehow.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.010
In the case of corn,
for whatever reason,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.760
some crops have been
destroyed, and people

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.440
need to eat, and
all of the rest.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.000
For commodities that
aren't used, so to speak,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.760
like gold, if you see
backwardation there,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.730
I wouldn't say-- I mean, it's
definitely still desperation,

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.960
but it's not out of a core need.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.810
If gold goes in
the backwardation,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.520
it's more because of some
type of irrational desire

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.830
to have their hands
on the gold now

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.130
than have their hands
on the gold later.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.640
Maybe they think society
is going to collapse,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.550
and the future
delivery dates of gold

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.240
aren't going to
actually hold up.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.050
Who knows what they are?

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.100
So in general, when people talk
about backwardation, because

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.210
of this desperation
in the market,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.910
people tend to perceive
it as a bullish signal.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.000
Obviously if people
are desperate,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.230
there's demand for this thing.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.395
My argument is, you can't
just look at one tea leaf out

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.270
of a bunch of tea leaves
and say whether it's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.990
bullish or bearish.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.656
But what you could
say is, look, there's

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.360
something somewhat
abnormal going

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.920
in the market due to
some type of desperation.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.870
It's a little less irrational
it it's due to a storage,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.280
but it could be very irrational
if it's a due to just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.820
wanting your hands on it.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.420
Because frankly, if you
wanted to buy gold just

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.450
for the sake of
investing in gold--

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.670
you're not going to eat it
or use it to fuel your car

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.490
or anything like that-- it
would make complete sense,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.420
or even better, if
you already held gold

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.040
in this type of a market that's
undergoing backwardation.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.480
The rational thing
to do would be

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.910
to sell your gold
now for more money,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.760
and then agree to buy it
back later for cheaper.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.490
And so once this later
date comes about,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.120
you'll still have
your gold, and you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.020
would have made some
risk free profits.
