1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,030
All right.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,060
So we know something about all of these
powerful tools that have been developed,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,860
quantum mechanics around the
turn around 1925 26 actually.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,090
And then all these much more modern things
including scanning probe microscopy,

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,160
which is really quite recent,

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,730
but the most powerful tool in organic
chemistry for everyday practice.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,390
And certainly for anybody who's not a
professional chemist then into the quantum

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,030
mechanics and stuff like that is bonds,

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,390
this amazing invention of bonds and how
people knew what things were like before

10
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,870
any of these tools were dreamt
of. Right? And for that,

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
we go back in time and look at these
guys in the 19th century who invented it

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,330
and we begin with what's called, whoops,
we begin with, sorry, here we go again.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay. We begin with the
chemical revolution, right?

14
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:02,790
That's a name that historians of science
have given this period beginning with

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,970
Lavoie Ca.
So really that's where we'll start.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,290
But he didn't just spring from nowhere.

17
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,380
There was a long tradition of some
kinds of chemistry before that.

18
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,570
And we're going to just
review that very briefly.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,380
There's a background in
ancient art and lore.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,470
Okay. So, for example,

21
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,610
here's a mosaic from
Moriali and Cecily of Noah,

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
right as a making wine and then falling
victim to it and having his shame hidden

23
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:38,880
by his sons. Okay. And
here's his flask, right?

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,120
So Kevin, this is like, you know,
uh, 3000 years ago, the, the,

25
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:49,740
the uh, mosaic is about a thousand years.
Let's 12th century. It's 800, nine, eight,

26
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:51,660
900 years old,
okay.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Here is a Roman glass perfume
bile that's 2000 years old.

28
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:02,790
So they made perfume obviously
and extracted the stuff
from flowers and whatever

29
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:07,050
that would, that would do, do that. Hey,

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,270
there's the chemical research building
when it was five days old. Okay.

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,290
And we already saw Francis Bacon who
said all the philosophy of nature,

32
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,760
which has now received is either the
philosophy of the Grecians or that of the

33
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:24,690
alchemists. So the alchemists
are in a sense, our ancestors,

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,880
he didn't have very high opinion of them.

35
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,750
He said the one is gathered out
of a few vulgar observation.

36
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,220
That's the Greek philosophers.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,150
And the other out of a few
experiments have a furnace, right?

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,650
The one never fail is to multiply words.
And the other ever fail us.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,910
The multiply gold.

40
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,410
So even at this time when science
was beginning to get underway,

41
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:50,610
modern science alchemy
was already in disrepute,

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,370
but it w but it did
contribute some things.

43
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,810
It didn't contribute much to theory
because the theory dependent on,

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,500
on a Greek,

45
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,940
well on the Greek antecedents and the
authority rather than observation.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,070
But they did fiddle around,

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,670
here's a painting of
an alchemist from 1663.

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,810
And Remember Newton did more work
in alchemy than he did in physics,

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,070
right? And he wrote an enormous amount,
but never published anything about it.

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,941
There's a great,

51
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:26,530
there's a great website now from the
University of Indiana of all Newton's out

52
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,400
chemical works and you can look at them.
Uh,

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,790
but this was to be kept a secret.
That was the idea of Alchemy,

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,160
right? That it was a
cult. It was hidden. Okay.

55
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,220
And in fact,
there's a show that's coming up at,

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,310
on Alchemy at the Beinecke Library of
there in January of their holdings in

57
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,050
alchemy. And the title of the show
is the book of secrets, right?

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,970
And that's Harry Potter as well,
right?

59
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,690
So here's one of the things
that's going to be shown.

60
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,000
It's part of a really long scroll,

61
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,910
which is the Vizio Mystica of Arnold,

62
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,280
of Villanova for who was a 13th century,
uh,

63
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,440
uh,
outcomist who was into medicine,

64
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:14,530
was considered the greatest
medical authority of its time.

65
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,890
This particular scroll was
written in England in 1570.

66
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,300
So a lot of it's in English.
It says the Red Sea,

67
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,370
the Red Loon, the red moon,
the red sole, the Red Sun,

68
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,500
right? All sorts of mystical things.
And then you see, here's the here,

69
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,860
here is that the Corpus,
the body, which is earth.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,640
And here's the soul,
which is oil.

71
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,620
And here's this spirit or the
air, the breath, which is water.

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,860
So there was everything was
a symbol for something else.

73
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,880
Or if you look at the four corners
of this on the bottom right,

74
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,350
we have air right air,

75
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:59,200
it says is hot and moist,
right?

76
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,880
Or in the top left is earth,
which is cold and dry.

77
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,510
The opposite of air.
And down here is fire,

78
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,640
which is hot and dry and up.
And there is water,

79
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,460
which is, uh, which is
cold. And Moist, right?

80
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:22,270
So this was supposed to be
something profound and mysterious.

81
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,280
Another thing they're going to show is
this book on the philosopher's stone,

82
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,170
which was written in the 13th century.

83
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:34,060
The particular copy they have is from
1571 but it looks like somebody organic

84
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,900
chemistry text after they've highlighted
it in preparation for the exam,

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,610
every word is underlined,
right?

86
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,100
And all in the margin or these
fingers pointed two important things,

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,250
right? Uh, and if you look there,

88
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:52,600
you'll see great words like alchemy.
There you see Elixir.

89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,800
Uh,
I forget there are a lot of key words,

90
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,500
but fundamentally it's all nonsense,
all the theory.

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,980
The reason people kept it
secret really was I think,

92
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,410
not to keep other people
from finding it out,

93
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,530
but to hide the fact that it was nonsense.

94
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,230
That that's just my own theory. So
maybe that's wrong. Okay. But that,

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,970
but the Paracelsus in the early 15
hundreds was an alchemist that visit

96
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,010
traveling physician and he developed
what had been long before that,

97
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,720
which was the doctrine of sympathies.

98
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,170
And that one aspect of that was in nature,

99
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:35,171
antidotes for poisons are to be
found near the source of the illness,

100
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,830
right? So for example,
you know what that is?

101
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,250
Yeah,

102
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,300
Poison Ivy, right? But near Poison Ivy,

103
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,400
you're likely to find jewel weed,
which is an antidote for poison ivy,

104
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,090
right?
Or that poison ivy is a new world thing.

105
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:00,590
So that didn't interest the alchemist.
But this one certainly did.

106
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,680
Willow Salix is the Latin name for willow,

107
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,570
which is found in malarial swamps. So
you go into a swamp, you get malaria,

108
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,900
but you also find the willow there and
the willow bark extracting from the

109
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,270
willow bark.
You can get salads in a glycoside,

110
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,810
which is a sugar plus
aromatic thing there. Right?

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,320
And if you hydrolyze that to get the
sugar off and oxidize that to make a

112
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,810
carboxylic acid,
you get this.

113
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,180
What's that? Right?
Salycilic acid from sailings.

114
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,970
Right. So it's good for fevers
and so on for your malaria. Okay,

115
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,700
so that's the theory.
This is another thing,

116
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,190
they're going to show a video
and make them come along with me,

117
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:52,191
which is a lab manual that was kept by
cos bar Hartung from Hoff in 1557 in

118
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:57,060
Austria. So you can see as he
draws various app what he's,

119
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,010
he's reading various things,
right?

120
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,380
And writing extracts and
notes to himself about,

121
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:05,580
it's like your prelab
preparation, right? Uh, okay.

122
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,470
And you notice how he's quoting up here,

123
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,370
Arnold, that guy from the 13th century
who did the thing we've showed first,

124
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,670
right? Arnold of a Villanova. Okay.

125
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:21,960
But he shows distillation apparatus.
These things are called Pelicans.

126
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,480
That interesting.
Uh,

127
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,990
and here's a lamp and here is somebody,

128
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:32,730
he's filtering something through some
kind of screen or grid there. Okay.

129
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,450
So they developed tools,
right?

130
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,020
That were great use to
chemistry once chemistry,

131
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,940
chemistry got going. So there was a lot
of, even though the theory was nonsense,

132
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,260
there was a lot of practical background
in preparing various elixirs and so on.

133
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,010
So this was crucial.
Now here is a,

134
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:57,360
is a lab that could easily be
for an owl chemical laboratory,

135
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,400
but in fact it's an early chemical
laboratory. And I'll show it to you here.

136
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,570
It's this book.

137
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,620
It's this picture here from 1777 from a
book about air and fire and it reports

138
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:19,821
the discovery of a new element in
this book and it's by Carl Ville Helm,

139
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:25,250
Shayla in, uh, who is in a, uh,

140
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,830
in Uppsala, whoops, a law in Sweden.

141
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
What do you think,

142
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,140
what do you think you discovered with
light and fire or propriety with,

143
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,810
with air and fire loof to
employer. Uh Huh. We'll see.

144
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,403
Okay.

145
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,810
So that's his laboratory shale is
laboratory or at least some artist's

146
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:52,230
impression of it. And here he is. He's,

147
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,720
he's before the chemical revolution,

148
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,010
but he's an important precedent as
you'll see to the chemical revolution.

149
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,050
He was a, as my practice, a pharmacist,

150
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:04,950
but he spent most of his time doing
what is really chemical research.

151
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,210
Here's a picture of a
stamp, a Swedish stamp, a,

152
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,420
of showing shale, except it's not. Shayla,

153
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,160
turns out the costume is where I wouldn't
have been developed until 40 years

154
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,250
after Shayla died.
Okay.

155
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,310
But he purified organic compounds that
weren't easy to purify in particular

156
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,590
carboxylic acids.

157
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,940
So he got an acid from
that he called lactic acid,

158
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,070
which we now know has that structure.
Where did he get it from? Sour milk.

159
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,320
Okay.
And he got,

160
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,380
so here's the his paper about that on
milk and it's acid right from 1780 so he

161
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:51,120
purified these acids as salts
that he could crystallize.

162
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,950
That was the method of
purifying. So here's, here's
several reports in that paper.

163
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,850
Item seven, bismuth, cobalt,
antimony, tin, mercury,

164
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,350
silver and gold were attacked by
lactic acid either by digestion.

165
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:09,210
That's a just sitting there under it
or by boiling after standing over 10,

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,280
the acid caused the black precipitate
to form in a solution of gold in aqua

167
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:18,630
regia. Right? So this is
not mysterious writing,

168
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,770
right? It's talking in language
that we can understand.

169
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,690
Even though it's translated from German,

170
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,430
iron and zinc were dissolved with
a formation of flammable air.

171
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,990
What do you suppose he reacted?
Acid with zinc and he got flammable air.

172
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,900
What do you suppose that
was? Hydrogen, right?

173
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
The iron solution was brown
and gave no crystallization,

174
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,770
but the zinc solution crystallizes.
Why was that important?

175
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,970
Because he could purify it if it
crystallized, get just that salt. Right?

176
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,140
So that's how he got pure samples
of acids, right? With copper,

177
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:02,950
our solution first took on a blue
color than green. Finally, dark blue,

178
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,110
but did not crystallize,
unfortunately,

179
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,130
and 10 led dissolved after
several days of digestion,

180
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,620
the solution acquired a sweet tart taste,

181
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,550
but did not crystallize,
right?

182
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,040
So what do you do when you
don't have IIR and Nmr, right?

183
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,700
Sure.
So we tasted all these things cyanide to,

184
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,950
okay, so we've got citric
acid. Where did you get that?

185
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,540
From? Lemons. Okay. And he got uric acid.

186
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,190
Obvious.
He got tartaric acid.

187
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,060
That's a little tartaric
acid turned his discovery.

188
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,050
It turns out to be one of the single,
probably the single most important,

189
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:53,010
maybe the second. Now, probably the most
important compound in the 19th century,

190
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,100
as you'll see. Okay?
That comes from Tartar,

191
00:12:56,101 --> 00:13:01,050
which is the deposit or the inside of
wine casks after you fermented wine.

192
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,760
Okay?

193
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Benzoic acid came from gum benzoin
product to the near of the Far East.

194
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,380
Okay. And oxalic acid. Where
do you think that came from?

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,060
It came from rhubarb.
Now why oxalic?

196
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,720
Why oxy?
Oxy means sharp.

197
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,100
So what the sharp have to
do with it with rhubarb.

198
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,250
Yeah. So you know, oxy is
as a root, meaning sharp.

199
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,750
A oxymoron doesn't mean a stupid ox.

200
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,920
What it means is sharp
and Moron means doll.

201
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,320
So it's a sharp dullness is an oxymoron.
It's a self contradictory word,

202
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,933
right?

203
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,950
So what's sharp about rhubarb?
It's taste.

204
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,500
It tastes acidic.
In fact,

205
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:09,501
the word acidic comes from the Latin us
deduce which comes from Acre to be sour,

206
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,190
which comes from the root [inaudible]
which means sharp. So it's the same thing.

207
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,070
Acid and oxy.
Okay,

208
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,370
so look at all these
things they have what?

209
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
The carb oxalate group, which
makes them acidic. Right?

210
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,320
And we know why it makes it a city.
This is review from last time, right?

211
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,530
This function room,
it's not a carbon eel alcohol,

212
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,990
it's a carboxylic acid.
The high homo is stabilized in the acid,

213
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,710
but it's even more
stabilized when it's an anti.

214
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,100
And cause you have a higher homo.
So it changes the acidity,

215
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:48,720
the ease of the Association of h
plus by a factor of 10 to the 11th.

216
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,590
Right. Which depends on the energy
difference between those two.

217
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,380
So if you're more stabilized,
the anti on product,

218
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,840
then you stabilize the starting material,

219
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,460
then you shift the reaction toward
product here by 10 to the 11th big change.

220
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,620
Okay. But actually there's more
to it than just that resonance.

221
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,360
Just that Homo Lumo interaction.

222
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,300
There's a thing called inductive
effects that we'll talk about later on,

223
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,250
but a large part of it is due to that.
Okay.

224
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,800
But you notice there's one exception here.

225
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,440
Uric acid doesn't have a
carboxylic group in it.

226
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,240
So there's what it has and it,
uh,

227
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,810
notice that it has an unshared
pair on nitrogen like an amid.

228
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,280
It's stabilized by a carbon eel. In
fact, it's stabilized by two carbon eels,

229
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,620
two adjacent lumos to stabilize
it. Now, if that were just stable,

230
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:54,610
it wouldn't be a reason to loot to, to
get rid of it. She'll lose a proton.

231
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,470
But the anti and that you get if you lose
the proton from nitrogen has a higher

232
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,590
homo.
So it's even more stabilized.

233
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,080
The same trick is in carboxylic acid,

234
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,380
but even more so as you'll see here that
pka of this compound is 5.8 it's pretty

235
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,300
acidic,
right?

236
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,780
But a normal amine like ammonia losing
of Proton has a pka of 38 right?

237
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,920
So this is 32 powers of 10 helped out
because it has such a high homo on the

238
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,330
nitrogen and two Carbonells
to stabilize it, okay?

239
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,390
So uric acid is in is
indeed in acid light car,

240
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,570
very light carboxylic acids, okay? Now,

241
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:39,700
Shayla not only did these organic acid,

242
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:44,470
he also discovered or co-discovered
seven elements there are listed here

243
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,660
according to what row
of the periodic table.

244
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:50,770
They're in a notice down at the
bottom here you have tungsten,

245
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,520
right? Tungsten comes from
Swedish, he was Swedish.

246
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:57,910
It's tongue Stan heavy
stone being weighed down.

247
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:02,050
It's got lots of protons and neutrons
and is very, very dense, right?

248
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:06,520
So it's heavy. The stone that
comes from our very heavy, right?

249
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,410
But by contrast, these up
here are gases. And in fact,

250
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,160
that's what got the 19th
century chemistry going.

251
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,890
That's what launched
the chemical revolution,

252
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,160
was the ability to work with gases
because they were to be a gas,

253
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:28,660
something has to be a small molecule and
therefore simple or at least relatively

254
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:29,410
simple.

255
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,280
So you had to start with simple things
before you could get to complex ones like

256
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:37,030
salycilic acid in terms of understanding.
Now,

257
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:42,031
Shayla in 1771 had heated silver carbonate
and he found that he got CO2 out.

258
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:49,710
I mean, he didn't know it was co two
that again, the gas came out okay.

259
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,990
And if you heat it that still
more greater than 340 Celsius,

260
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,580
then you get silver and oxygen
comes out from silver oxide.

261
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,750
This gas, this foyer lift, right?

262
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,580
Fire Air. That's what
the book is about. Okay,

263
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,000
so he wrote,
he wrote the book,

264
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,560
but the book starts as I'll show you here.
Uh,

265
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,770
I'm sorry.
There we go.

266
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,420
The book starts with an
introduction, uh, uh, forbearing, uh,

267
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,770
by which is translated
that says from Swedish.

268
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,900
And let's see where it says here.

269
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,350
And it's by Torbert and
Bergman written in 1777 this,

270
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,190
he had this book written for two years
waiting for this preface to come.

271
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,250
Bergman was a busy guy,
right.

272
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,610
And during the time that
this book was Sitting Ready,

273
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,850
the manuscript is ready to be,
was sitting ready to be printed.

274
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,490
Priestly in England discovered oxygen.

275
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,590
So this book came out after priestly,
but there's no doubt that that uh,

276
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,250
that Shayla had discovered it earlier is
lab books from 1771 show it and here in

277
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:08,400
1774 his,
his,

278
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,090
his draft of a letter that he wrote to,

279
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,770
to France and it begins here,

280
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,880
actually begins with a couple of words
on the previous sheet, but it says,

281
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,290
since I have no large burning glass,
I beg you to try with yours,

282
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:26,940
because he had to do this.
He didn't things in an oven,
really high temperature,

283
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,040
which was hard to do.
But if you could,

284
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,070
if you could do it with a focus
light of the sun to heat it,

285
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,310
then it would be much more practical.
And in France,

286
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,280
they had such a big magnifying glass

287
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,620
that would allow us to do it. But
that letter, although it was sent,

288
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,150
was never answered. And you know
who it was sent to? Presumably

289
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,600
Lavoie Zaa the founder of the chemical
revolution and another discover of oxygen.

290
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,470
Okay? Okay. So now we're going to talk
about Lavoie Zia who was re, you know,

291
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:05,070
it wasn't a perfect person, but
he was really very, very good.

292
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,660
Okay?
Now the chemical revolution began.

293
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:13,470
You can say it started in 1789.
That chemical revolution,

294
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,570
and that's not the only revolution
that started in France in 1789. Right?

295
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,021
You know what?

296
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:23,970
This is what it's the
tennis court oath when the,

297
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,220
when the, uh, the legislators,
so to say, gathered to, uh, to,

298
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:33,750
uh, say that they wouldn't disband until
the king granted them certain things.

299
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,060
And you know what that led to in 1789,

300
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,450
the only guy that didn't
degree was this guy here.

301
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,780
He's the only one that didn't
sign it. But at any rate, it's,

302
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,440
uh,
it was radical.

303
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,710
Now there's an Indo European root word
that's the root of many words called were

304
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:57,580
out. And it gives words in all sorts
of languages. Like it means root.

305
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,703
Okay.

306
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,700
And vortal in German means root and
[inaudible] Ward like St John's wort is a

307
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,580
root licorice. Glucose rise, a Greek,

308
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:14,200
the rices is root. Okay,
sweet root. It means, okay.

309
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,320
Race Rot in Italian is,

310
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:21,040
is the root of your, of your being, right?

311
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,330
Rutabaga

312
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,720
radix and in Latin. And you know,
lots of words come from radix,

313
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,860
like radish is a root or eradicate.

314
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,360
What does that mean?
It means to pull it out by the roots.

315
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,690
Okay.
Or radical.

316
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,200
Something that's radical is something
that goes right to the root.

317
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,310
Back to the very origin of something.
And that word used in that way.

318
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,230
If you look in the Oxford
English dictionary,

319
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,940
it was used in math coined in
mathematics in the 16th century.

320
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,120
The root of a number is its origin,
right?

321
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:01,360
If you take the square root of a
number and multiply it by itself,

322
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:05,980
you get the number. So it's the root
of the number, the radical right.

323
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,140
Or in politics that was used
in 18th century in England
and in chemistry in 18th

324
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:15,310
century in France. They idea of radical
is the root of things began to be used,

325
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,490
which we'll see. Okay, so 1787,

326
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,630
a radical was introduced as a political
term according to the Oxford English

327
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:26,770
dictionary by Ajay, Jeb, whoever
he was presumably a politician.

328
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,800
Or in 1787, there was this radical
document. We the people, right?

329
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,670
But that same year, 1787, uh,

330
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,280
radical was introduced as a
chemical term by Louis Bear.

331
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:43,270
Narky toned more Volvo.
And it was in the,

332
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,410
in the context of developing
nomenclature for chemistry.

333
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,280
So he, together with bare metal lay and
[inaudible] developed a new method for

334
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,580
nomenclature in chemistry.
And here's a book.

335
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,310
This is not the original French, but it's
the first English translation, which is,

336
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,000
he comes from the,
uh,

337
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Yale University library
back when it's from a 1788.

338
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:10,931
Okay.

339
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,931
So a method of chemical
nomenclature by Gaytonia Marvo,

340
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,760
Lavoie, Z, a bear to delay in four quad.

341
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,510
So the fourth author
of this new method of,

342
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,910
of chemical nomenclature is Lavoie z.

343
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,460
So there's Lavoie Zia with his
wife. This is part of, uh, of uh,

344
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,930
enormous picture that's
in the metropolitan. Uh,

345
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:39,920
and it was commissioned by Lavoie Zay
and his wife who hired a Jacques Louis

346
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,680
Daveed to paint it and they paid 7,000
pounds to the artists to paint it,

347
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:49,640
which is equivalent of $300,000.
Today. They were quite well to do,

348
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,230
they had an income of the order of
$1 million a year or the equivalent,

349
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,860
it depends on how you, how you translate
numbers. Of course it's hard. Uh,

350
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,890
so here he is at the age of 45 and
1789 and he's working on drafting.

351
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,401
So he,
so you know,

352
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,570
these guys when they had their portraits
painted always put something important

353
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,330
in it. So what did he
choose to have? He chose,

354
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,620
chose to be working on a manuscript
and the manuscript is working on,

355
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,760
is the manuscript of this
book right from 1789.

356
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,920
It's called cut de la Frontera.
Does she meet the uh, the uh,

357
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,430
elementary treatise on
chemistry and the other stuff?

358
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:33,350
He put it in the picture are the,
is the equipment, uh, there is, uh,

359
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,390
is the equipment he used.
So,

360
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,250
so here you see various equipment
from one of the plates and the,

361
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:44,270
at the end of the book, and you can see
these items in the picture. There's that,

362
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,930
that bell jar.
There's that device.

363
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,610
There's that big, uh, 16 pint,

364
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,410
a flask with a brass fitting on it.
Uh,

365
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,440
there's that valve that's on that you
attached to the bottom of the flask and

366
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:07,481
over here as a portfolio and the portfolio
is says down in the corner of Poles.

367
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,240
Love was the AA school seat. That means
this was drawn by polls. Lavoie Zia,

368
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,180
who is his wife,
she was his assistant in the laboratory,

369
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:21,170
kept all the notebooks, read English for
him because he couldn't read English.

370
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:24,500
So we had to do anything with
priestly. She would read it to him. Uh,

371
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,700
but she drew all these things.

372
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:29,840
She studied with Davita drawing
in order to be able to do this.

373
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,530
Uh, okay. She drew this, this, uh,

374
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,510
she painted this portrait of their
family friend. Who's that? Yeah,

375
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,680
Benjamin Franklin. I showed
you that picture earlier,
said we'd refer to it again.

376
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,210
So this is that,

377
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,390
that particular plate in the book and
it relates to weighing a gas know,

378
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,320
turn out that the most important thing
for Lavoie Oza and for the whole 19th

379
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:57,381
century,

380
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:02,360
all this development that led to bonds
and their arrangement weighing was the

381
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:06,770
key thing. But how do you weigh
a gas? So you need gasses.

382
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:10,970
So they're simple enough to deal
with and easy to purify, right?

383
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,310
But you need to weigh them. So
how can you weigh a gas? Well,

384
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,340
you can collect a gas as shown in this
picture by generated it in this a retort

385
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:26,651
g and it comes in at bubbles up
displacing water or mercury off most often

386
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:32,630
mercury from a bell jar. You've done
this kind of thing. Some of you,

387
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,600
but you can see how it would work is
that bubbles up, the mercury comes down.

388
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,700
Okay,
so now you have the gas.

389
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,560
Now we'll shift attention down to the
bottom right here and see how this works.

390
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,420
So we have, uh, this
bell jar on the bottom,

391
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:49,800
which is filled with valves on the top
is filled with mercury and it's in a pool

392
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:50,634
of mercury.

393
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,350
And then this big 16
pint flask is evacuated.

394
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,700
You used one of these pumps,

395
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,910
remember a hundred years before this hook
or a hundred and 130 years before this

396
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,780
hooked,
made a great vacuum pump for Boyle.

397
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,130
Boyle is the only person on the front
of the building older than Lavoie

398
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,540
[inaudible].
Right?

399
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,340
And that was dealing with gases and
Boyle's law out pressure and volume relate

400
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,350
to one another. Okay. So anyhow, uh,
he, he could evacuate that with a pump,

401
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,430
then seal it off,

402
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,110
turn the valves off and he's got mercury
in that thing and now he puts a tip

403
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,120
underneath it and generates gas
and it bubbles up and fills the,

404
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:34,590
uh,

405
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,030
this container with the gas and it's
sitting in a mercury pool so that it's not

406
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,780
communicating with the atmosphere other
than through the pressure through the

407
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,820
mercury pool. Okay. So
now he opens the valves.

408
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,150
So the vacuum starts sucking up the
mercury that is pulling the area up to a

409
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,960
certain point, right? Then the
mercury stops rising. Okay.

410
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,430
And now at this point,

411
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:04,431
you know that the pressure of that gas
is atmospheric pressure less whatever the

412
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:09,480
height of the Mercury column is,
right? That's how a barometer works.

413
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,270
So he knows how much gas,
what volume of gas at uh,

414
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,800
he has in a, he knows the, he,

415
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,750
he filled it with water first and
waited to see what its volume was.

416
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,150
Now he knows the volume,
he knows the pressure.

417
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:28,260
So he knows how much gas there would
be at atmospheric pressure. Right?

418
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,240
And now of course, he just turns
off these things unscrews one,

419
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,720
uh,

420
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,720
the thing on top and ways it and sees how
much heavier it is than it was when it

421
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:44,100
was evacuated. And that's how much the
airways, and he knows how much volume,

422
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,480
how much pressure. So he knows how
much, whatever gas he collected wade,

423
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,090
so he could weigh a
gas. Pretty Clever, Huh?

424
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,510
Okay. Here he is working with
one of these bell jars. Now.

425
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,730
Uh, he, he, these bell jars were filled
with mercury. I don't know if you've,

426
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,190
uh,
would you help me out Wilson,

427
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,780
lift this up and show it to the class,
but don't lift it high.

428
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,800
Hold it above the thing. Did
it surprise you? Yeah, it's a,

429
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,380
he said it surprised him. And you can
come up afterwards if you want to.

430
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:22,140
It'd be surprised yourself
by lifting this up,

431
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,130
but keep it over this because people
are so panicked about mercury nowadays.

432
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,590
I hear on the way over to class,
while I was bringing this,

433
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:29,970
I heard there's a new law in the,

434
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,740
in the European Union that it's going
to be illegal to transport mercury over

435
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,060
international borders. Go figure. Anyhow,

436
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,320
there's Lavoie Z. I do it and experiment
with this big thing of mercury, right?

437
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,650
He must've been a stout person.
Okay.

438
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,210
This is him and his library with Madame
La Boissiere taking his dictation as he

439
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:55,510
does his experiments.
Okay.

440
00:29:55,511 --> 00:30:00,190
So here's the Tata La Montera to
she me and I'll show you the, this,

441
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:04,490
this actually is a facsimile,
not the real thing. Uh,

442
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,350
but here's the title page.
The first volume.

443
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,003
Okay.

444
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,980
So you could look at that if you want to.
And at the end,

445
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:19,270
I'll just note here in the s at the end
of the second volume or all of these

446
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:23,870
pages, which are, uh,

447
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,640
devices like here's this is
the one we just looked at.

448
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,020
Okay. So if you want to look at them, feel
free. Don't handle the other one though.

449
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,540
It's real. Okay. Uh,

450
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,630
so elementary treatise of
chemistry presented in a new order.

451
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,820
This is the revolution according to
modern discoveries with figures as I just

452
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:48,784
showed you.

453
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,410
And 1789 is the date the same
as the French revolution.

454
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:54,923
Okay?

455
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,880
Okay. You notice he's a member
of all different academies,
including Philadelphia.

456
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,190
Why in the world would he have been
a member of the Scientific Academy of

457
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,530
Philadelphia? You never went
there, right? It's Powell. Okay.

458
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:09,520
1789.

459
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,470
So it has the most wonderful
introduction called d score.

460
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,870
[inaudible] and he says,

461
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,140
I hit my only object
when I began this work,

462
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,530
or I had no other object when
I began the following work.

463
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,830
Then to extend and explain
more fully the memoir,

464
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:31,260
which I read at the public meeting, the
Academy of Science in the month of April,

465
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,430
1787 remember when radical
was introduced and so on,

466
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,850
on the necessity of reforming and
completing the nomenclature of chemistry.

467
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,300
So that's all he was trying to do was
get a proper nomenclature that would be

468
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:48,280
useful in contrast all this,
uh, al chemical nonsense. Okay.

469
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,110
While engaged in this
employment, I perceived better
than I had ever done before.

470
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,610
The justice of the
following maxims of the RBA,

471
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:59,860
the cardiac in his system of
logic and some other work.

472
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,450
So this is what [inaudible] said.

473
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,020
We think only through the medium of words,

474
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,130
why languages are true analytical methods,
Algebra,

475
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,090
which is adapted to its purpose in
every species of expression in the most

476
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:17,170
simple, most exact and best manner
possible. Is it the same time,

477
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:20,200
a language and an analytical method?

478
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,540
The Art of reasoning is nothing
more than language well arranged.

479
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,800
So Lavoie Z,
he goes on to say this,

480
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,850
while I thought myself employed
only informing a nomenclature,

481
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,140
and while I proposed to myself nothing
more than to improve the chemical

482
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:38,974
language.

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,290
My work transformed itself by degrees
without my being able to prevent it into a

484
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,970
treatise upon the elements of chemistry.

485
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,090
So in the process of
reforming the language,

486
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,760
he reformed the whole
understanding of the science.

487
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,240
The impossibility of separating
nomenclature of a science from the science

488
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:04,241
itself is owing to this that every branch
of physical science must consist of

489
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:08,810
three things,
the series of facts,

490
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,090
which are the object of the science,

491
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,780
the ideas which represent these facts
and the words by which the ideas are

492
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:22,670
expressed.
Like three impressions of the same seal.

493
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
The word ought to produce the idea and
the idea to be a picture of the fact.

494
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,140
So all of these things have
to be harmonious, right?

495
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,360
Three impressions of the same seal.

496
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:41,120
And as ideas are preserved and
communicated by means of words,

497
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:45,890
it necessarily follows that we cannot
improve the language of any science

498
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:50,330
without at the same time improving
the science itself. Neither can we.

499
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,200
On the other hand,

500
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:55,610
improve a science without improving the
language or nomenclature which belongs

501
00:33:55,611 --> 00:34:00,110
to it. However certain the
facts of any science may be.

502
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,950
However, just the ideas we may
have formed of these facts,

503
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,430
we can only communicate false impressions
to others while we want words by which

504
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:12,650
these may be properly expressed,
right?

505
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:18,070
So clarity as opposed to obscurity was
his goal as opposed to Newton or the

506
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:21,830
alchemists, right? Facts,

507
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,460
ideas and words and they all have to tie
into one another as impressions of the

508
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,830
same seal.
Okay,

509
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,150
so he presented things as he
and advertised in the new order,

510
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:38,330
very different from any book on
chemistry that had been written before.

511
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,570
First was doctrine. That is the
theory, the first part of the book,

512
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,930
which is a two volume books of almost
all of the first of about two thirds I

513
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,560
think, or the first volume or
doctrine and then nomenclature.

514
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:59,450
That's what he had set out to
do. And finally, operations,

515
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:03,770
how you can actually repeat this stuff
for yourself, what devices you need.

516
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,371
Of course,

517
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:08,600
he was very wealthy and could employ
people to manufacture all these equipment,

518
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,910
all the equipment he needed.
Not everybody could do that,

519
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,750
but he showed exactly how
it was done and gave great.

520
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:19,370
It's easy to understand
exactly what he did. Now,

521
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,510
one of the first things he turned his
attention to was elements. He says,

522
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,060
if by the name elements,

523
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,500
we mean to designate the
simple indivisible molecules.

524
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,150
Molecule just means little thing,
right? That make up substances.

525
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,110
It is probable. We do not know what
they are. They're just too small,

526
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,990
right?
But if on the contrary,

527
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,850
we associate with the name of elements
or the principles of substances,

528
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,180
the idea of the furthest stage two,

529
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:56,181
which analysis can reach all substances
that we have so far found no means to

530
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:59,070
decompose our elements for us.

531
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,520
They behave with respect to us like
simple substances. So it's an operational,

532
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,720
not a philosophical definition of element.

533
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:14,340
If you can't break it apart, consider it
an element until you can break it apart.

534
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,110
We have elements here that chemical
elements are they elements according to Po

535
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,850
two Lavoie CA's definition.

536
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,720
Like here we see a Sirium,
Presdo, Demian, neodymium,

537
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:32,060
promethium, Samarium, Europium Gadolinium.
Are they elements according to Lavoie?

538
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,960
CA, why not? You can
break them apart into new,

539
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,700
into nuclei and electrons.

540
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:43,020
The nuclei you could break apart into
protons and neutrons and the break these

541
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:46,650
things apart into corks and so on.
But for Lavoie,

542
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:51,450
Zia or for chemists, those are elements
cause you don't break them apart. Okay?

543
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,970
So here's a table of simple substances
in the first English translation of the,

544
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,930
of the Titanium Ontario does she meet?
So here's a table of the elements.

545
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:03,870
Simple substances belonging
to all the kingdoms of nature,

546
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,630
which may be considered
as the elements of bodies.

547
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,620
So what are the first two elements,
things that you can't break apart?

548
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,110
Light and heat are the first two elements,
which we don't see at men.

549
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,560
Chef's table,
right?

550
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,890
Because they're fundamentally different
from the other elements because they

551
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:26,100
don't have any weight.
You can weigh a gas,

552
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,230
but you can't weigh light and
you can't wait heat. Okay?

553
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,850
So he gives new names to these things.
Light and caloric.

554
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,230
And what the old name was.
Light used to be called light too.

555
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:41,220
But in this new system,

556
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:45,210
he's going to keep the old name or Caluori
he's going to use for what used to be

557
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:50,211
called heat or the principal or element
of heat or fire or igneous fluid or the

558
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:54,090
matter of fire heat.
Those were terms people had used before,

559
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:57,150
but he's going to call them caloric.
Okay?

560
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,930
Now if you have caloric,
you must be able to measure it.

561
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,600
If you can't weigh at what you can do,

562
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,110
you can use a calorimeter to measure it.

563
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,410
And this is the calorimeter manufactured
and used by Lavoie Zaa and also Laplas

564
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,680
a younger man who was his colleague
who became a great mathematician,

565
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,860
as you probably know. So
here's the thing, it's big.

566
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,460
That's a three foot rule,
right?

567
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:28,020
So this thing stood this high off the
table, right? Okay. Now here's what it is.

568
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:32,820
There's a lamp that's going to make fire.
There's oil in the well of the lamp,

569
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,640
and that's you're going to measure how
much heat you get out of burning that oil.

570
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:42,150
So you put it inside this bucket and
you put the bucket in this Mesh Cage and

571
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,144
put the lid on.

572
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,120
Then you put that cage and it's
lit up into this can. Okay.

573
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,260
And now you light the flame in there.

574
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,770
You want to measure how much heat it
gives. How do you measure the heat?

575
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,410
What you do is surrounded by melting ice.

576
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,090
So the heat will melt the ice.
Now there's going to be a problem.

577
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,850
The obviously the more heat,
the more ice you melt.

578
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,790
But that's not the only
place heat's coming from.

579
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,960
Where else will it come from
to melt the ice from outside?

580
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,600
So this is where the thing is clever.
So there's another can outside that can,

581
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,130
and you fill it with ice,

582
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,130
which is an insulator for the inside.
So no heat comes from the eye.

583
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:33,340
Any heat that comes from the outside melts
the outside eyes, not the inside eyes.

584
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,620
Only the flame will melt the inside eyes.
Okay?

585
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:39,490
And notice that the lids also
are covered with ice too.

586
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:43,840
So it's completely surrounded by I
ice and then buy another layer of ice.

587
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,070
So it's the flame burns, Burns,
Burns, Burns, and you feel water.

588
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,160
Water comes up as they
melted both of them.

589
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:56,550
And then you put that thing underneath
and turn the tab to tap and see how much

590
00:39:56,681 --> 00:40:00,280
water was melted only by the flame.
Right.

591
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,770
And that measures how much
heat? Pretty Clever, Huh?

592
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,710
Okay. So that was, that's a fact.
Is measuring how much heat there is.

593
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,610
But analysis in general,
is it, this is from uh,

594
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,380
the Oxford English dictionary,

595
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,610
which Yale has a subscription to so
you can look up words to your heart's

596
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:23,470
content. It's a lot of fun. This,

597
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:27,460
this year is the 80th anniversary
of the Oxford English dictionary.

598
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:32,230
There was a symposium down down the hill
sponsored by the library with including,

599
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:35,030
uh, uh, the guy that wrote
the professor and the madman.

600
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,690
Has Anyone read that book about
the Oxford English dictionary?

601
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:42,380
It's a wonderful short book. And the
madman was a Yale graduate. It's really,

602
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,100
it's interesting story.
And the other guy was one who,

603
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,280
who read the Oxford English dictionary
cover to cover 20 volumes within one

604
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,220
year. He wrote a book about that during
the last year. It was a fun thing.

605
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:57,670
But anyhow, this is, it's fun to look up
things in the Oxford English dictionary.

606
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,410
And here's analysis.

607
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,720
So you see it comes from Ana and uh,

608
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,830
I think it's at least 18,
but I can get some help on that.

609
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,970
Louie, Louie and okay. Anyhow,

610
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,010
but it means to loose according
to the Oxford English there.

611
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,560
So it's to loose back. So it takes to
take things apart as the sense of it.

612
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:25,950
And generally it's the resolution or
breaking up of anything complex into its

613
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,700
various simple elements.

614
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:32,080
So you can analyze a pat
a passage and literature.

615
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,100
Okay. Uh, it's the opposite of synthesis.

616
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,590
Okay. Uh, it,

617
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,320
the exact determination of the elements
or components of anything complex,

618
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,990
specifically in chemistry,

619
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,350
the resolution of a chemical compound
into it's proximate or ultimate elements.

620
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,540
Now, proximate and ultimate,
what does that mean?

621
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:00,890
You can see down in the historical uses
of it what proximate and ultimate mean.

622
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,420
1791 the same time.
1789 remembers of,

623
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,880
tried to Montair said
the quantity of charcoal,

624
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,060
which something yields by analysis.

625
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,830
So you find out how much charcoal isn't
it? That's the word we've now say carbon,

626
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,880
right? So that's elemental
analysis. That's ultimate analysis.

627
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:23,840
Take things all apart to the chemical
elements, see how much of each one.

628
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,870
But there's also this thing
called proximate analysis,

629
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:30,260
which you can see from
this quote in 1831 sugar,

630
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,990
starch and gum are proximate principles.

631
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,600
And these we obtained
by proximate analysis.

632
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,620
So you can take some food stuff
and see what percentage of protein,

633
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:42,530
what percentage of sugar, what percentage
of this, that, and the other thing.

634
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,350
So what you read on a candy
bar or something like that.

635
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,280
That's proximate analysis, not
elemental, not ultimate analysis.

636
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,330
So both kinds are important in
Lovaza is work as we'll see.

637
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,210
Uh, okay, so we looked
at the light and caloric.

638
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,250
Now let's look at a few of these
elements. The ultimate elements here. Uh,

639
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,450
we have the fact,

640
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,860
the theory and the word for these things.

641
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,170
So how about [inaudible],
why is that word?

642
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,530
That's the French name for, uh, French.

643
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,580
Still call nitrogen as a,
and in this English translation,

644
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:26,570
it was called that in 1790 or 91.
Okay.

645
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,370
Where does that word come from?

646
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,240
What does the prefix a mean

647
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,030
without and how about Zo? That's
great. We have somebody taking Greek

648
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,180
without life.
In what sense is that inappropriate name?

649
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,010
A meaningful name for nitrogen.

650
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,190
Alex,
what kind of tests?

651
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,920
Yeah,
if you put a mouse

652
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,330
in an atmosphere of
nitrogen, it's Aza. Alright,

653
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,960
so that's what the name meant. So
he used, it used to be called flow,

654
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:14,500
just dicated air or gas or
Memphis or the base of Memphis.

655
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:15,630
This right?

656
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,660
Aza is the name that Lavasa
decides to use for it or hydro.

657
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:21,534
Jan,

658
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,930
how about it help us out?
Nope.

659
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,560
Pardon me.
Water.

660
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,940
What about water? Hydro
is water. What's Gen?

661
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,060
It makes water, right?
So if you burn hydrogen,

662
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,050
you generate water,
right? So Hydro Jen. Okay.

663
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,350
How about oxygen?

664
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,720
What does it generate?

665
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:56,990
Yeah,

666
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:58,710
acid.
Sourness.

667
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,620
So oxygen is the element that generates
sourness, that generates acid.

668
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,550
And that is the key element in Lavoie.
Ca's theory,

669
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,360
the oxygen theory of combustion.
Okay,

670
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:16,340
so oxygen plus a base or radical,
right?

671
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,160
So these two terms meant the
same thing. The Lavoie, ca,

672
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,480
the fundamental radical, the
root of some substance, right?

673
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,470
And you reacted with oxygen.
And it makes the stuff into an acid.

674
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,910
Can you think of an example of an
element that you react with oxygen?

675
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:36,770
It becomes an acid. Well,
let's just look at his table.

676
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,473
Sulfur.

677
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,190
You burn it and it becomes
sulfuric acid or sulfuric acid,

678
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,210
right? Phosphorus.
Janet's phosphoric acid.

679
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:51,200
Carbon generates carbonic acid.
Muriatic radical,

680
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,510
which we don't know, haven't
discovered the periodic radical yet,

681
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,530
the base of that acid. But if you
burn it and combine it with oxygen,

682
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:05,030
you get muriatic acid.
Does anybody know what Muriatic acid is?

683
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,640
Hydrochloric acid, how much
oxygen is in it? None, right?

684
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,150
But that was the theory, right? That you
take a base, you reacted with oxygen,

685
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,870
you get an acid. So there must
have been a muriatic radical,

686
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,470
okay. Unfortunately, that
part of it was wrong.

687
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,400
The same for Florick at radical,
okay.

688
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,650
But then there were also come pound
radicals, radicals that were not,

689
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,260
that were only proximate,
not ultimate right.

690
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:38,060
Radicals that had several
other elements in them, right?

691
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,750
And here were some of those like, uh, uh,

692
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,440
a list of those radicals with the names
that Lavoie ca decided to use for them.

693
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,670
And many of them,

694
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:50,390
all the ones indicated by an air or
ones that Shayla had already discovered.

695
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,040
Right? Like Tar Tarik, citric
oxalic, Benzoic, lactic.

696
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,130
Lithic acid was another one
that I didn't mention before,

697
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,550
which comes from stones. See,
it's for me, urinary calculus.

698
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,650
Okay. So those were compound
radicals. And that's, uh,

699
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,420
the end of today's lecture.
