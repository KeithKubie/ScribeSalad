Intro
In the world of TV, the key to success is

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.760
delivering your product to as many viewers
as possible.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.639
With that in mind, studios usually try to
play things safe – which means it’s even

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.100
more shocking to come across a little dirty
humor, especially when it’s embedded in

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.520
TV shows made for kids.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.519
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 hidden adult jokes
in children’s cartoons.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.050
The New Batman Adventures

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.949
In an effort to inspire her boyfriend The
Joker to take the night off work, Harley Quinn

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.360
emerges from a giant pie in a 1998 episode
of The New Batman Adventures.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.170
With filling dripping everywhere, she serenades
mister J in her best Marilyn Monroe impression.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.120
If the hidden meaning wasn’t clear enough,
audiences then watch her playfully kick a

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.150
cherry at his face, and make a… strange
suggestion.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.220
This scene is pretty sexy to anyone watching,
but not the Joker.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.690
Unimpressed, he tosses Harley outside, and
a whole pie sits wasted.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.690
Rugrats

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.120
They say it takes a village to raise a child,
and in the case of Nickelodeon’s Rugrats,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.300
sometimes that means leaving your kids with
their grandpa.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380
Like any good babysitter would, he does his
best to keep the kids entertained.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.290
He rents them two movies, and picks up one
for himself too.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.290
The title?

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.820
“Lonely Space Vixens” Featuring a sexy
alien on the cover, Lou mentions how he plans

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.470
to watch this particular title in private,
after the babies go to bed.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080
Probably a good call, Gramps.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080
The Flintstones

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.180
The famous modern Stone Age family has been
charming their way into our hearts since their

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.590
debut in 1960.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.780
Cavemen aren’t renowned for their intellect,
but Barney Rubble is exceptionally slow.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780
Especially when it comes to anatomy.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.570
During a visit to the costume shop Barney
says he wishes he was taller.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.979
When his pal Fred jokes that he’d need another
head, Barney delivers the punchline.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.060
The two chuckle as a laugh track plays, confirming
that it really was a dirty joke.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.040
Yabba-dabba-gross.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Animaniacs

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.909
During an Agatha Christie-inspired episode
of Animaniacs, the three stars are on the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.080
hunt for clues.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.520
After being told to dust for prints, Dot returns
with the singer Prince instead.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.619
Yakko lets her know he meant finger prints
- which his sister once again misunderstands.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.450
The singer seems on board with the idea, but
Dot is still not crazy about it.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.420
It's not even subtle, so how this dirty wordplay
made it to kids is anyone's guess.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.090
Spongebob Squarepants

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.400
The most optimistic resident of Bikini Bottom,
Spongebob Squarepants has a squeaky clean

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.230
reputation to maintain: as a charismatic,
extroverted, burger-loving sea sponge.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.530
The most mature jokes whizz by at break-neck
speed, leaving the grown-ups giggling, and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.000
the youngsters oblivious.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.560
One such “blink and you’ll miss it”
moment comes care of a dancing sea anemone.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.370
In the privacy of his pineapple, Spongebob
watches the creature flop around on T.V.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.160
We don’t really understand just how much
he was enjoying himself until he’s interrupted

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.800
by Gary - proving he was up to some adult
fun.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.300
The Spectacular Spider-Man

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.690
A good hair day is a powerful thing.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.930
Just ask Black Cat from The Spectacular Spider-Man.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.180
While dueling Spidey, she dodges the bursts
of web flying through the air.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.540
The scene is full of action as the two dart
around a laboratory, bantering back and forth.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.470
After being shot at with webs, Black Cat utters
a quick line that many viewers didn’t catch

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.620
the first time around: “You’d better not
get your goop in my hair.”

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.280
It probably doesn't sound like much to a kid,
but parents are sure to notice the quip.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.630
And, depending on experience, will either
laugh or cry.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.160
The Powerpuff Girls

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.379
Made in a laboratory by Professor Utonium,
the trio of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.349
protect their city using special abilities.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.290
They’re great fighters, but they’re still
kids.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.349
So when a new girl named Robin moves in next
door, they introduce themselves.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.930
During a tour of their house, the girls introduce
Robin to the professor and explain how they

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.269
were created by accident in his lab.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.510
With a genuine innocence that only children
possess, Robin replies with a comment that

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.800
a kid probably shouldn't be making.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
Dexter's Laboratory

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.390
This boy genius's life would be perfect if
it weren’t for his psychotic sister Dee

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.970
Dee, who's constantly interfering with his
work.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.740
In an episode called “Dee Dee and the Man”
Dexter fires his sister and hires a replacement

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.650
- an attractive blonde, who the boy starts
getting more and more interested in.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.380
After leaving to take a cold shower, he even
asks her to dance for him.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.300
Her reply makes it clear that she's not used
to a career in lab assistance.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.300
Looney Tunes

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.650
Over its run, The Looney Tunes produced hundreds
of skits.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.850
From romantic skunks to murderous cats, The
Looney Tunes has something for everyone.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.470
When the bloodthirsty, rabbit-hating bandit
Yosemite Sam goes to jail at the hands of

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.229
Bugs Bunny, the animators reveal that he’s
about to enter a new romantic relationship…

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.320
with his cellmate.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.410
And by the looks of it, it might not be a
consensual one.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.300
Pretty dark stuff for a kids' cartoon.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.370
Rocko's Modern Life

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.630
An Australian Wallaby named Rocko moves to
America, and makes some strange new friends,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.781
including a bull named Heffer, who takes up
plenty of odd jobs, even filling in for a

00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:57.781
dairy cow.

00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.370
That job requires Heffer be hooked up to the
Milk-o-Matic milking machine.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.280
Clearly enjoying himself, the scene shows
his eyes rolling, lips quivering, and pupils

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.990
turning to stars before he moans and falls
over.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.590
What was going on behind that fence?

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.610
You be the judge.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.680
Keep in mind, he makes sure to say goodbye
to the Milk-o-Matic before he leaves, too.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.830
What do you think of our list?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.740
