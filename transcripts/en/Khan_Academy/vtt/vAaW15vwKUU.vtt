00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Instructor] So let's
continue with our conversation

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.820
around factors of production for a firm,

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.740
and we're going to focus
on the labor market.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.560
And so we've already drawn
axes like this multiple times,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.290
where our horizontal axis,
this is the quantity,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.260
quantity of labor that's
being employed by a firm.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.260
And then the vertical axis,
this is our wage rate.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.140
And so this is, we're looking
at the economics for a firm.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.770
And we're looking at how much labor

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.920
is it rational for this firm to employ?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.490
And we've talked about the marginal

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.970
revenue product multiple times.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.370
This is a view of how much
incremental revenue can

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.670
the firm get every time it
brings on one more labor unit?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.750
And we've talked about
that we typically see it

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.610
like a downward-sloping line like this

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.880
'cause you have diminishing returns.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.120
Every time you add one more labor unit,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.470
the marginal revenue product

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.370
of that labor goes a little bit down,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.740
and so that's when you
have diminishing returns.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.020
So this is marginal revenue products,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290
and I'll be very particular this time.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.160
This is of labor.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.000
We could do a similar
marginal revenue product

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.440
of other factors like land or capital.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.770
Now, to change things up in this video,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.880
we're not just going to talk about a firm

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.730
that operates in a perfectly
competitive labor market.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.710
If we did, then its marginal factor cost

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.527
would be whatever the
market wage rate would be,

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:24.730
and it would be a
horizontal line like this.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.150
So you would have a marginal
factor cost of labor.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.520
But we're not going to talk about a firm

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.100
that's in a perfectly
competitive labor market.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.820
We're going to talk about a firm

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.990
that is a monopsony
employer, a very fancy word.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.353
So it is a monopsony,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450
not a monopoly, a monopsony.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.930
Now, what does a monopsony mean?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.830
Well, you could almost view it as

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.580
the reverse of what a monopoly is.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.250
A monopoly is you have one seller,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.550
so one seller,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.640
and many buyers,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.090
so many,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.720
many buyers.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.270
So that is a monopoly,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.580
monopoly right over there.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.820
A monopsony is when you have

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.090
one buyer,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.800
so one buyer,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.563
and many sellers.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.113
And so you have many,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.170
many sellers.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.720
So this right over here
is a monopsony firm,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.610
monopsony.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.020
And in the context that
we're talking about,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.520
we're talking about labor markets.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.070
So this one, instead of saying one buyer,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.010
you could say this is one buyer of labor.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.360
So you could say one employer,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.810
one employer.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.120
And the sellers of labors,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.140
well, a seller of labor, well,
these are many potential,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.250
potential workers,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.380
potential workers.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.330
And there is many real-world examples

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.630
that approach monopsony employers.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.240
Let's say we're in a small town,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.710
and there's only one hospital,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.050
so they're going to be
the monopsony employers

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.910
of healthcare workers, of, say, nurses.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.940
And so what's interesting
about a monopsony employer

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.670
is they're not just going to
take whatever the wage rate is,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.800
they have to essentially,
they have a supply curve

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.230
for labor in that market.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.503
And so, for example, in this market,

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:27.550
when wages are low,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.110
there's going to be a low supply of labor.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.740
Not many people are going to
wanna work for that hospital.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.720
And then as wages go up,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.780
more and more and more
people are going to want

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.850
to work for that monopsony employer.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.770
And so this is our labor,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.623
labor supply curve.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.930
Now, I'm gonna ask you a question.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.220
I'm gonna tell you right
now, it is a trick question.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.530
What is going to be the rational quantity

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.180
for this firm to hire?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.010
Now, you might be tempted to say, well,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.490
it's just the same thing.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.850
We would just want to keep hiring

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.470
as long as our marginal
revenue product of labor

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.290
is higher than the cost of labor.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.640
And that would be true if you could afford

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.270
to pay everyone a different rate.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.760
If this first unit of labor,
you can pay someone this much,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.040
and then everyone that you hire,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.280
you have to just pay
them a little bit more.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.120
But that's not the way
that it typically works.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.900
In the real world, you
often think about having to,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.880
whatever the wage is, if we
decide that this is the quantity

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.950
of labor that we wanna bring on,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.720
you wouldn't pay this wage just
to that incremental person,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.940
you would have to pay
that wage to everyone.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.100
And so to think about what is
the rational quantity of labor

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.020
to bring on for this firm,
we would need to think,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.120
we need to calculate or at least visualize

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.340
what the marginal factor
cost of labor here,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.740
which is going to be different
than our labor supply curve.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.850
And to help us visualize that,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.090
let me set up a little table here.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.590
So I'm just gonna make up some numbers.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.210
So look, we're going to think
about the quantity of labor,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.940
so let's just go zero, one,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.970
two, three, four.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.780
And then let's think
about the price of labor.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.980
And so let's say when the
quantity of labor is one,

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.170
the price of labor is three.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.450
And then it goes up as we,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.710
if we wanna hire more people,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.820
well, the price of labor goes up to four,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.420
goes up to five, goes
up to six, keeps going.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.940
And then what would be
the total cost of labor?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.453
So total labor cost,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.960
well, you could figure that out.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.040
If you hire one unit at $3 per unit,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.210
one times three is three.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.980
Two units at $4 per unit,
remember, you're going to have

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.460
to pay everyone the same amount.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.020
So it's not like you can
just pay this first person $3

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.680
and only the second person $4,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.530
in which case, this would be seven.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.470
But if you're going to hire two units,

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.640
you have to pay everyone $4.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.870
So your total cost is
eight here, two times four.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.450
Three time five, your total cost is 15.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.550
Your total cost here is 24.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.960
And so now we could think about

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.410
what is our marginal factor cost of labor?

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.350
So when you bring on that
incremental unit of labor,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.800
how much incremental
cost are you taking on?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.090
Well, when you go from one to two units,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.550
your total cost goes from three to eight,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.810
so your marginal factor cost is five.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.860
This is plus five right over here.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.420
When you go from two to three,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.990
your marginal factor cost,
you went from eight to 15.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.670
So eight to 15, you went up by seven.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.810
And once again, this is because

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.330
when you wanna hire more
people, you're going to have

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.540
to pay more to track
those incremental people,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.800
but then you have to pay
that higher rate to everyone.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.620
And so you see that the
marginal factor cost of labor

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.810
is going up twice as fast

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.270
as our labor supply curve.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.290
Our labor supply curve,

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.950
every incremental unit, we're adding one.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.360
Here, every incremental
unit, we're adding two.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.193
And we could see it again.

00:06:55.193 --> 00:06:57.880
To go from 15 to 24,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.440
you have to add nine,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.800
so our marginal factor
cost of labor is nine.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.770
And so looking at this as an example,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.430
you see that your marginal
factor cost of labor

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.210
is going to go up at twice the slope

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.200
of your labor supply curve.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.570
So your marginal factor cost of labor

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.410
is going to look something like this.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.860
It's going to go up twice as fast,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.260
marginal factor cost of labor.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.850
And now this might be ringing a bell.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.340
This might seem like what
we studied in the past

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.620
when we looked at a monopoly

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.530
or an imperfect competitor firm.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.320
And we talked about the
demand for its goods,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.030
and we also talked about
its marginal revenue.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.890
And the marginal revenue curve

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.530
had twice the negative
slope as the demand curve.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.810
And here, we see everything
just flipped over.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.520
Because we're now not talking
about revenue for the firm

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.720
and marginal revenue for the firm,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.980
we are talking about costs for the firm.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.870
These are inputs for the firm.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.120
But now what would be
the rational wage rate?

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.290
And what's the rational
quantity of labor for this firm?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.060
Well, now that we've done
the marginal analysis,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.780
we would see that it's
rational for the firm

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.850
to keep bringing on more and more people

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.640
as long as the marginal
revenue product of labor

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.700
for each incremental unit is higher

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.170
than the marginal factor cost of labor

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.570
for each incremental unit.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.820
And so we'd keep hiring

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.210
until you get to this
point right over here.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.710
So it would be rational for it to

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.200
bring on this quantity of labor.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.360
And what would be the
wage that it would pay?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.870
Well, you might be tempted
to just go right over here

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.030
and say it would pay this wage,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.420
but remember it doesn't
have to pay this wage.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.840
At this quantity of labor, the
labor supply curve tells us

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.860
that the market wage
would be right over here.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.580
So it would be paying,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.410
it would be paying this wage.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.650
It would be paying this
wage right over here.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.780
So this is something for you

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.000
to maybe ponder on a little bit more.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.440
But the big picture is,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.050
is when we're dealing
with a monopsony firm,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.960
so it is the only person
hiring in the market

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.160
or something that's
approaching a monopsony firm,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.410
it's going to have its
own labor supply curve.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.680
And the way you think about

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.660
what a rational quantity
for it to hire is,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.620
you would think about the
marginal factor cost of labor,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.660
which is going to go
up at twice the slope.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.630
And where that intersects
the marginal revenue product,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.300
well, that tells you the quantity,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.640
and then the labor supply
curve will tell you the wage

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.373
for that quantity.
