(folk music)

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.678 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Another round of
pizza bites, Chadwick.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.881
- And two more martinis,
in the triangle glass.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.884 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And while we're at it,
we'll take two more blow jobs.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.286
(both laugh)

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.456
And that's exactly what
life's gonna be like,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.158
when we start makin' bank.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.459
- Nice.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.527
- [Danny] Lonergan,
thanks for helping us

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.762
sell this bootleg liquor.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.230 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You fuckin' sleep

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.164 align:start size:81% position:19%
- [Lonergan] Yep.
- Alright,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.032
who wants to try the new batch?

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.700
- Ooh, me por favor.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:35.468
- Alright.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.837
- L'chaim.
- Lonergan.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.406
- Blah, blah, blah.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.208
- Oh.
- Oh!

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.643 align:start size:81% position:19%
Geez!
- Oh that is nice.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:44.611
Spicy!

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.879
- Damn!

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.313
- That's goin' put
hair on my boob-ays.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.515
- More hair.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.351
- That tastes like hot poison.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.452
- Alright, what do
we wanna try now?

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start size:84% position:16%
We got the
sausage-infused vodka,

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.290 align:start position:0%
and then we've got this
bathtub Jaeger that temporarily

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.892
blinded us last night.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.560
Yo, Lonergan, you
gotta cool off.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.495
You're about to drive
this car in 30 seconds,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.730
and we can't get caught.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.098
- Oh my God, calm
down you big titty.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.332
Relax.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.534
We're gonna make
a fortune sellin'

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.702 align:start size:84% position:16%
this shit once we
get to the boardwalk,

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.938
and then butler blow
jobs for everyone.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.541
(gargling)

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.775
- [Danny] Come on!

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.243
- [Mark] Alright,
Lonergan, Jesus.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.778
- [Danny] So, do the butlers
actually give us the blow jobs,

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
or do they facilitate
the blow jobs.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.516
- [Mark] Just close your
eyes, and see what happens.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.351 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Lonergan] You
guys wanna get nuts?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.886
Time for a richie rail.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.088
- What's that?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.023 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Every time I
make a right turn,

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.624
I earn a sweet little bump.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.359
- What do you mean, earn a bump?

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.961
Holy shit.
- Oh man!

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.496 align:start size:84% position:16%
Dude, I think she
means how I earn a nap

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.597
after I eat a whole pizza.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.666
It just happens.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.236 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Live fast!
(yells)

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.306
- [Danny] Lonergan,
you psycho bitch!

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:51.111 align:start size:97% position:3%
(car squeaking and rattling)
(car engine pops)

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Mark] I said we should
have stopped for gas.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.346
- [Lonergan] Fuck!

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.180
Fuck!

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.318 align:start size:84% position:16%
You've gotta be
fuckin' kiddin' me!

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.486
What the fuck?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Aw, calm down saggy titty.
- Shit!

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.524
No, you don't fuckin' get it.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.293 align:start size:84% position:16%
If the Yakuza catch
me, I'm busted!

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.996
I can't go back to being
a foot-fetish model, yo!

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You got fuckin'
weird feet, Lonergan!

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.133
- I know man, I know!

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.134
- Okay damn, if we get
caught with this much

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.302
bootleg liquor, we're fucked.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.071 align:start size:75% position:25%
(cries)
- Wait a minute,

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.973
I've got an idea.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.675
Why don't we drink our way out?

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.945
For once, Mark, that
makes total sense.

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.415 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:33.853
(laughs)

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.855
- [Lonergan] You got it!

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.493
- [Mark] Come on,
let's do this man!

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
Let's get fuckin' loose!

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.862

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.532

(laughs)

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.359 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I just told you.
- Shut up.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.862
- Is this s'posed to
be some kind of party?

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.363
- No.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.531
- Well, it's over and you
guys are in big trouble.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.266
- Are you guys cops?

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.235
Cops who like to drink?

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Specifically, weird
homemade liquor?

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.211
(dance music)

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.349
- You win, we go to
jail or wherever.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.817
- We win, we get

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:40.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
those badges.
- Both those badges.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.456
- Want to get nuts? (groans)

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.891
- You son of a bitch.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.194
- [Cop] Hey, hey, hey
