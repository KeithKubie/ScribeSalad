00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.360
A Logic Bomb is, essentially,
a trigger planted in a program.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.670
When the triggering condition is met,
the planted code then execute.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.660
In such a way,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.190
malicious activities can be activated
whenever a condition is right.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.005
For example, a branch of the program
will launch, denounce service attacks to

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:24.930
whitehouse.gov only when the current
time is the specified time and date.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.650
And that's an example of a logic bomb.
