00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Eight to be great: The eight traits successful people have in common.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Number two: work.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When I was interviewing all these successful people,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they kept telling me how hard they worked.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I remember standing there thinking, "Ah, jeez, another comment about work?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why don't they tell me the real secret to their success?"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then finally I realized, hard work is a real secret to their success.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
All successful people work very hard.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Martha Stewart said to me, "I'm a real hard worker.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I work and work and work all the time."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch said, "It's all hard work.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Did he say fun? Yes. Successful people have fun working.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's why I say they're not really workaholics.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They're workafrolics.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Jim Pattison, chairman of the Jim Pattison Group, is a workafrolic.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He says, "Business is my recreation.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'd rather go to our factories and meet with our people

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
than go to the beach, I can tell you that."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Dave Lavery, the NASA whiz who builds those robots for Mars,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
said to me, "We work our fingers to the bone.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But it doesn't seem like work. It's fun.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's what we want to do. We don't want to put things down and go home."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Bill Gates is a workafrolic. Even after he was a multimillionaire,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
he worked most nights until 10 p.m., and only took two weeks off

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in seven years. And he probably spent them on his computer.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Oprah is a workafrolic.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
She says, "I never see daylight. I'd come into work at 5:30 in the morning

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
when it was dark, and leave at 7 or 8 when it was dark."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm a workafrolic.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And over the years, I've gone through many days and even weeks without much sleep,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
just because I was having so much fun.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I gotta admit, at times like that you say to yourself,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Am I the only one working this hard?"

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Because there's a myth it comes easy to some people.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You turn on the TV, nobody's working that hard.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
A guy like Chris Rock stands up on stage,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
tells a few jokes. What's hard about that?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But even Chris says, "I wasn't the funniest guy growing up,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but I was the guy who worked on being funny the hardest."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Trust me. I've interviewed over 500 successful people,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
not one of them said it came easy,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
even though they were doing what they loved.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We tend to underestimate work and overestimate talent.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But in the end, work tops talent.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Arthur Benjamin, America's best math whiz,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
said to me, "I think numbers and I have always gotten along.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But I'm sure my 'talent' is just due to the time and hours and work

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that I've put into it."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Many talented people don't achieve as much success as they could,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
unfortunately, because they sit back on their talent

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and never learn to work hard.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's what happened to Michael Jordan when he first started playing basketball.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He had the talent, but he wasn't putting in the work,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and the coach actually cut him from the high school basketball team.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Boy, that was a wake-up call. He says, "I was very disappointed.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I started working on my game the day after I was cut."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And he soon became the hardest working player in basketball,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
who made fun of the other players who weren't working hard.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And that hard work is what made him the greatest basketball player of all time.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So I'd say the real gift isn't talent,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it's the ability to work hard.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And we tend to underestimate work and overestimate smarts.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But in the end, work wins over smarts.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In fact, many successful people aren't the smartest, they just work the hardest.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Francois Parenteau, who Business Week called the top independent analyst on Wall Street,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
said to me, "I'm certainly not that smart.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I can't even remember my own zip code."

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But he also says, "Work is a big part of my life.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I think about investments pretty much 24 hours a day,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
seven days a week."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Nez Hallett III is CEO of Smart Wireless,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and I thought, that's ironic because he told me he's not that smart.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
He says, "I graduated from high school with a C average,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and college with a C-minus average."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But now the smart PhD's are reporting to him.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
How did he do it?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
He said, "If you're going to be successful at anything,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the key thing is to work hard."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I'm not smart.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
As proof, here's my actual 12th grade report card.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It was the only one my parents ever kept.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Don't ask me why they kept it; it's nothing to brag about.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
As you can see, I was a C student, not an A student.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I don't think I'd even make it into college these days.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So how did I achieve some success and wealth?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I just worked hard, many 60- to 80-hour weeks.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And now I know I'm not alone.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Thomas Stanley studied hundreds of millionaires,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and he discovered most millionaires weren't A students,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
didn't score high on tests and teachers didn't think they'd ever succeed.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But they did succeed, because they worked hard.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So the good news is if you're not the smartest,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
if you're a C student, not an A student,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the really good news is you can still succeed.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Because the word "success" has two C's and no A's.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Laughter)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You can still succeed as long as you work hard.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And what if you are smart?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well, I'm sorry, there's absolutely no hope for you.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Because many smart people don't achieve as much success as they could, unfortunately,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
because they rest on their smarts and never learn to work hard.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Jeong Kim, president of Lucent Technologies, says,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
"People who are the smartest sometimes don't realize their full potential,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
because things get too easy, so they don't push themselves hard."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
After a talk I gave at one of the world's top 10 business schools,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a man came up to me and said,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
"You know, when I got my MBA here a few years ago,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I was one of the smartest people in the class.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I thought I had it made. So after I graduated,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I sat back and I didn't work hard.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And I went downhill.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And now, at this point in my life, I've gone nowhere.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I haven't achieved any success at all."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
He said, "Thanks for the wake-up call. Now I know what I need to do.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I need to work."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So the bottom line is, whether you're smart or not,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
whether you're talented or not, just keep working.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Applause)
