00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.330
There's nothing quite like developing a crush on someone,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.910
It's not exactly the same as falling in love,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.120
but it definitely isn't just a friendly interest in someone either.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.440
For the most part,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.570
crushes are innocent, joyous affairs

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
that really add a little spark to our day.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.300
While people might choose to deal with pressures in different ways,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.840
pretty much everyone has developed a crush at some point in their life.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
Many of us had our first crush at extremely young ages

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.290
before we even knew what romance and dating really was.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.500
Crushes might be fairly common things in life,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.930
but there is definitely not just one type either.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.490
We've compiled a list of seven completely different variations on the common crush

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.430
and it might be interesting for our readers to skim through,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.980
especially those who currently have crushes.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.810
What kind of crush do you have ?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.810
Figuring this out might help you understand whether or not you're innocent crush could develop into something more serious

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.910
One

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.010
Having a crush that helps you get over hard times

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.270
A crush can be one of the few things that reminds you that there is still hope

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.310
no matter how dark life gets.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.710
If you've just gone through something horrible,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.590
having a crush is actually a really good sign.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.130
This means that you're getting over whatever scarred you previously

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.840
and that you are ready to love again.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.990
Opening up your heart to the possibility of romance

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.790
is kind of like a leap of faith.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.430
Even though you might have been hurt in the past again,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760
developing a crush again means that you're willing to risk pain

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.310
in order to feel that wonderful feeling once again.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.620
Two,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.990
That crush that makes you look forward to school or work.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.920
we all have those days when we just can't seem to get out of bed

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.120
and face the day ahead.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.620
whether it's a boring day at school or a tiresome shift at work waiting for you,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.190
many of us find ourselves rack in our minds for some reason.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.300
Anything, to get us out of that door in the morning.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.750
But a crush can really help motivate you to face all of the day's challenges.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Indeed having a crush can actually make you excited

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.500
for even the most dreaded days that await you in the morning.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.720
No matter how boring or hard that day is,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.300
you can bet that if your crush is going to be there,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.200
you'll always have a glowing feeling inside as you set foot outside each day.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.520
Three

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.560
Those childhood crushes

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.490
Another type of crush almost all of us have experienced in the past

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.980
is the good old fashioned childhood crush.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.810
You remember these, don't you ?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.840
Many of us can recall our first ever crush

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.580
and that strange feeling inside.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.700
Most of us weren't really sure what was happening to us

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.200
and it was probably a confusing time for many,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.950
but however you felt about your first childhood crushes,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.940
there's no denying that this experience was completely innocent and beautiful.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.420
And that's a huge reason why these types of crushes are so unique.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.650
Four

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
The crush that could be "the one".

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.800
These types of crushes can be a real mind twister,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
but there's no denying that there's something magical about their sheer intensity.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.890
These are the crushes where we get our hopes up

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.810
and let our imaginations run free:

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.750
wondering what it would be like getting married to that person,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.890
having children with them

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.660
or even growing old with them.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.550
Crushing on someone like this

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.650
isn't quite the same as falling in love with them,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.040
but it's definitely part of the initial phases of falling in love.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.440
When we crush on someone in this manner,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.020
we're just starting to entertain the possibility

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.210
that they just might be ”the one”

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.430
and that's a huge moment in our lives

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.080
Five

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.670
When you know a crush

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.930
is just a crush

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.390
Now let's examine the total opposite.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.100
Knowing when a crush is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000
well, just a crush?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.270
You know that it's not serious,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.710
and that's totally fine with you.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.000
There's nothing wrong with having a slight crush on someone in being okay with the fact

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.300
that you're slightly interested in someone who can also be a pretty interesting experience.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.570
It's not like you're falling in love with them or anything,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.780
you can still keep your wits about you and not get overly emotional.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.700
There's no need to get attached or start worrying too much

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.200
and you can just let things develop as they would naturally.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.800
There's something undeniably fun about  not taking relationships too seriously

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.600
and just enjoying the fact that there's

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.100
a little bit of a spark between you and someone else.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.910
Six

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.969
That crush who reminds you how beautiful life is

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.020
Sometimes we find ourselves trudging through the dull corridors of life

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.009
with our heads down,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.959
not bothering to glance up
even once at the wonders that are unfolding before us.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.159
As we've mentioned earlier,

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.809
it's all about perception

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:26.309
and a simple crush can change

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:27.029
everything.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.149
Let's say you've gotten to a pretty stagnant routine:

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.949
interacting with the same people

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:33.599
visiting the same places

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:35.249
and everything seems like it's

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.869
a record stuck on repeat.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.259
When someone totally new and interesting comes into your life,

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.389
it can be a massive wakeup call,

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.449
reminding us that there was still beauty out there in the world,

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:49.619
beauty that has the ability to truly shock us in the best possible way.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.909
Seven

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:52.829
A crush that's kept secret

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.899
Having

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.059
any type of secret is usually a pretty joyful experience,

00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.909
provided of course that it's a good type of secret.

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.749
You know, things like your secret stash of cookies waiting for you at home

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.139
or your secret obsession with binge watching Harry Potter movies.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.300
Having a good secret that you keep to yourself

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.400
can be the one thing that nobody can ever take away from you.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.419
And it can keep you thinking pretty positive

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.029
even when you've been dealt some pretty terrible cards.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:18.889
Well,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:21.299
one of the best types of secrets you can have

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:23.339
is the fact that you have a crush on someone.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.139
These secret crushes

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.599
sometimes cause our friends to say things like:

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:29.129
”What's gotten into you?”

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.100
or ”Why are you so happy?”

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.900
And at this point, we just smile and say:

00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:34.648
”Nothing.”

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:38.008
It's the type of crush that makes us feel warm inside

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:39.838
and gives us that little bit of joy

00:05:39.868 --> 00:05:42.148
that makes each day a touch more satisfying.

00:05:42.568 --> 00:05:46.468
These crushes usually form during the first stages of our attraction to someone

00:05:46.858 --> 00:05:48.808
and that's why they're so magical and unique.

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:50.900
So, there you have it.

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:52.438
Seven types of crushes

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:53.998
that make us feel amazing.

00:05:54.268 --> 00:05:56.968
Of course, there are probably more types of crushes out there,

00:05:57.328 --> 00:06:00.298
and not all of them are necessarily good types of crushes.

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:01.738
But for the most part,

00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:04.738
crushes are innocent, fun and they fill us with joy.

00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:07.618
Do you know of another type of crush that we missed?

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.418
