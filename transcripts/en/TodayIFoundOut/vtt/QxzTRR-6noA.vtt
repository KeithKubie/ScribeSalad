00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.120
A woman’s menstrual cycle is counted from
the first day she begins menstrual bleeding

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.329
until the first day of the next menstrual
bleeding.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.000
This cycle can vary from 21-35 days, although
the average is 28.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.710
It’s separated into 4 different phases-
the menses, follicular, ovulation, and luteal

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.710
phases.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.140
The menses phase is when the woman is actually
bleeding.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
The average time frame of this bleeding is
3-5 days, though 2-7 is considered normal.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.640
It’s this phase people are paying attention
too when they talk about menstrual cycles

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.680
synching up.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.500
They look at the first day of bleeding as
the start point.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.659
The follicular phase is where the follicles
in the ovaries begin to mature and form an

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.659
egg.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.670
Simultaneously estrogen levels rise causing
the lining of the uterus to thicken.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.189
Ovulation then occurs which releases the egg
due to an increase in a hormone called the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.950
luteinizing hormone.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.979
The final phase is the luteal phase.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.119
The egg is released from the ovary and travels
down the fallopian tubes and in to the uterus.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.580
If the egg is fertilized and attaches to the
uterine wall, pregnancy begins.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.649
If not, estrogen and progesterone levels fall
causing the thickened lining in the uterus

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.170
to shed and menses begins again.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
The entire process from the start of menses
to the beginning of the next menses is mediated

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.749
by hormones.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.740
Because of the hormone mediation, proponents
of the synchronization theory claim that pheromones

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.960
can affect hormone levels and thus, affect
the cycle.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.510
The theory began in 1971 when a psychology
student at Harvard (Martha McClintock) published

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.579
a paper in “Nature” stating that women
who spend a lot of time together will tend

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.470
to have their menstrual cycles synchronize
over time.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.310
She theorized that pheromones affected the
hormones of the women causing the synchronization.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.851
Pheromones affecting people in general is
an extremely controversial scientific topic

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:32.851
in and of itself.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.209
It would take an entire article to do it justice
so I won’t be going into it here.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.110
That being said, in 1998, McClintock published
another paper in “Nature” which found

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.639
that if a woman was exposed to cotton pads
soaked in the sweat of women in their follicular

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.569
and luteal phases, the phases of their cycles
were significantly altered.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.630
The controversy lies in how you interpret
the data from McClintock’s, and others,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.630
studies.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.769
The differing lengths of cycle times combined
with a myriad of other things that affect

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.269
cycles, causes the results to be simply a
matter of chance.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.500
One researcher, H Clyde Wilson, outlined three
serious errors involved in McClintock’s

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.580
research.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.850
When you correct for these errors, the evidence
for synchronization evaporates.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.610
So why is this so complicated?

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.329
Defining what exactly synchronization in cycles
is can be extremely difficult.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.090
While there are averages, most women tend
to have their own unique cycle that can be

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.780
affected by many things.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.890
Suppose you have one woman who has a 28 day
cycle and one that has a 29 day cycle.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.120
If they both start menses at the same time
this month, they will be off by one day on

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.080
the following cycle and then 2 days on the
one after that.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.540
Over time they will, once again, have a cycle
that will coincide with one another.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.939
To take it one step further, let’s say you
have women at both ends of the “normal”

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.209
range for cycles.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.090
The first has a 21 day cycle and the other
has a 35 day cycle.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.410
If the women who has a 35 day cycle starts
on January 1st, and the women with a 21 day

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.330
cycle starts on January 15th, both of their
cycles will start approximately at the same

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.790
time the next month (February 4 and February
5 respectively).

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.560
Those two women could say “Wow, we were
two weeks off last month and this month we

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.959
have been spending a lot of time together
and look, our periods are synchronized!”

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.560
Other things to consider when talking about
cycle periods is that each individual has

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.810
different patterns of normal.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.510
Some have regular patterns, some have variable
patters, and others have regularly irregular

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.510
patterns!

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.880
Those same women can also experience different
cycle lengths and regularities depending on

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.650
several environmental factors such as strenuous
exercise, puberty and menopause, low body

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.750
fat, and extreme weight loss or gain have
all been shown to affect cycle lengths.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.390
Due to the fact that hormones regulate the
entire process, anything affecting hormone

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.520
levels, will in turn, affect menstrual cycles.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.889
Simply interpreting the data and not being
cognizant to our “confirmation bias” (the

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.400
tendency to search for or interpret information
in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions)

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.820
can lead to errors in statistical analysis.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.690
Take for a specific example two subjects involved
in a study that started on July 1st.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.380
Subject A with a 28 day cycle starts her menses
on July 25th and then again on August 22nd.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.069
Subject B, with a 30 day cycle, has her onset
start on July 5th and then again on August

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.069
4th.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.430
If you believed in the “synchronization”
theory and were not aware of your confirmation

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.650
bias, you could look at these numbers and
conclude their cycles were 20 days apart (July

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.000
25th and July 5th) in the beginning and are
now 18 days apart at the second onset (August

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.330
4 and August 22).

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.780
Thus the subjects are probably synchronizing.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.850
The truth is, the opposite is actually true,
they are diverging not converging.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.330
Subject A would have had menses start on June
27th as well.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.040
Not looked at by this study starting on July
1st.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.520
That puts both subjects start as 8 days apart
in the beginning (June 27 and July 5).

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.100
The second cycle being July 25th and August
4th makes them 10 days apart and diverging.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.539
The exact opposite of the original conclusion.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.800
So you can see from this how it would be easy
for a study on this subject, if not performed

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.160
correctly, to provide very wrong conclusions
even without all the noise of things like

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.280
regularly irregular periods and other factors
effecting hormone levels.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.110
The idea that synchronization is simply a
matter of chance has been replicated by several

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.240
other studies since McClintock’s “groundbreaking”
conclusion in 1971.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.509
One of the most famous was done by Zhengwei
Yang, of North Sichuan Medical College in

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.280
China, and Jeffrey Schank, of UC Davis in
2006.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.460
They found women living in groups did not
synchronize their cycles.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.650
They looked at and analyzed previous studies
claiming synchronization occurs.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.200
After correcting for statistical errors, they
showed those results were really at the level

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
of chance.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.280
They went on to show that because of cycle
variability, they produce convergences and

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.699
divergences in menses onsets and this explains
the perception of synchrony.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.130
In the end, Michael Shermer in the book Don’t
believe everything you think, said it best,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.680
“Smart people believe weird things because
they are skilled at defending beliefs they

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.370
arrived at for non-smart reasons.”

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.968
Whether you believe McClintock (the biggest
proponents of synchronization out there, starting

00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:21.520
back from her days as a student) and say that
your menses converging and diverging is a

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.490
result of pheromones affecting your hormones,
or you take a step back and look at the main

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.510
body of research that gives a non-pheromone
mediated reason for why the convergences and

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.020
divergences happen, the result is the same.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.599
Due to the differences in female cycles, and
the environmental factors that can affect

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:42.190
them, there will inevitably be certain times
when the women in your family will all be

00:07:42.190 --> 00:08:01.800
in their menses phase at the same time.
