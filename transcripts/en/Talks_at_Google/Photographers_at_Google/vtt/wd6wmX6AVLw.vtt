00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:04.580
MALE SPEAKER: So, Happy
Earth Day, everyone.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.360
We're very pleased to host
today one of the crusaders

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.840
for conservation,
Dr. Laurie Marker.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.750
She's the founder and
executive director

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.600
of the Cheetah
Conservation Fund.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000
And she brings over
30 years of experience

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to the race to save the cheetah.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.880
Dr. Marker has implemented a
variety of conservation efforts

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.160
in Namibia, ranging from
livestock-guarding dog programs

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.680
to bush block to save the prey.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.780
Dr. Marker is also going to talk
a little bit about her latest

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.439
book which was published
just yesterday,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.340
"A Future for Cheetahs."

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.310
It's a large format book,
chronicling cheetahs

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.070
in the wild and it features
photography by Suzi Eszterhas.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.320
And so, we'll have some
time for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.530
But without further
ado, please join me

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.919
in welcoming Laurie to Google.

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:46.419
Thank you.

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:47.460
LAURIE MARKER: Thank you.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.980
Well, it's great to be here.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.610
And Earth Day, especially.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
This is like the 44th
year of Earth Day.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.150
Anyone remember the first one?

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.850
Yeah, I know.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.770
I do, too.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.940
But that's good.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.530
I was, then, also on a
Google Hangout today,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.310
which was kind of neat,
talking about kind

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.640
of the two polar
opposites-- the polar bears

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.830
and the cheetah,
both iconic species.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.790
And both-- most
people don't realize

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.640
how climate change is affecting
animals like the cheetah.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.960
But we are talking about
climate change as well.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.080
And for cheetahs, it's all about
living in harmony with them

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.020
in Africa.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.360
So we have to figure out
how to live and flourish

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.740
with cheetahs.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.199
Everyone knows that the cheetah
is the fastest land animal.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.698
And we do have a
cheetah that you're

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:43.360
going to meet here
a little bit later.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.280
But just to talk about it.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.260
You'll see it as
it's walking and I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.940
want you to just think a bit
about how special they are.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.520
But they're aerodynamic
and built for speed.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060
Today, the world's about speed.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.370
However, there's nothing
that can equal a cheetah.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.190
And it's on the earth.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.660
There are only about
10,000 of them left.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.310
So they are very special.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.490
But they're the most specialized
of all the 37 species of cats.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.880
So we'll talk more
about the cheetah

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.570
when it comes out
a little bit later.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.010
But we'll talk a little
bit about, you know,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.750
being an icon of speed.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.540
Because they're so beautiful.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.210
And if we lose them,
the pronghorned antelope

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.150
becomes the next
fastest land animal.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.310
Although it's
beautiful as well, it's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.820
got not quite the same iconic
vision as that of the cheetah.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.620
Fast like a pronghorn.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.190
Well, the pronghorn is fast
because the cheetah actually

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.880
used to live in North America.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.770
And predators and prey play a
very key role living together.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.330
And we always talk
about cheetahs

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.670
as being a very important
part of ecosystems.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.870
Ecosystems keep us all alive.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.170
And predators are something
that we think, around the world,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.410
should actually go away.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.000
And most of our predators are
vulnerable to extinction today

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.620
because of the way we view them.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.450
However, when we
have top predators,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.170
we have a healthier ecosystem
with more biodiversities.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.820
And cheetahs play
a very key role

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.260
in this in the
grassland ecosystems.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.890
With only about 10,000 cheetahs
remaining in the world,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.250
what's happened to them?

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.850
We've lost 90% of our cheetahs
in the last 100 years.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.670
The area on this map
here that is darker brown

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.150
is the area where
cheetahs are found today.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.280
So they're living in very
small numbers, fragmented

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.980
through a continent
that is huge.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.670
In the last 50 years, we've
lost about 16 countries

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.800
where cheetahs are living.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.340
The cheetah was found in India
and became extinct in the '50s,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.340
in the Middle East in the '70s.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.140
The last of the Asian
cheetahs is found in Iran

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.972
where there are only
about 60 cheetahs.

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:03.680
Cheetahs are an animal
that don't do well

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.080
in protected game reserves.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.050
So although we think of Africa
as being a very large continent

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.800
with lots of wildlife,
they don't do well

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.940
because lions and hyenas steal
their food, kill their young,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.529
and push them out of
these systems that

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.839
are not very large.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.899
But that's where they are the
kings of the game reserves.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.930
And so, cheetahs get
pushed out, they're

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.897
in conflict with
humans and livestock.

00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:28.980
And throughout Africa,
we've got human populations

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.990
that are growing.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.970
And most people who are
living in sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.950
have lots and lots of livestock.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.090
And the poor, rural
livestock farmers

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.350
often don't take very good
care of their animals.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.080
And if a cheetah
or other predators

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.370
catch one of the livestock,
then they're oftentimes killed.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.790
So that's the issues that
we're actually facing.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.870
So these pictures here show a
bit about what that looks like.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.490
Up in the very top on your
right is actually cubs.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.310
And we've got a very
bad illegal trade

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.000
going on today in Northern
Africa going into the Middle

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.990
East for the pet trade.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.540
I live in Namibia.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.980
Namibia is a democratic country.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.320
It's about 2 and 1/2 times
the size of California.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.940
Very, very arid where we're
very prone to drought cycles.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.380
And with this, it's now the
last large habitat for cheetahs.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.270
We have about 3,000 to 4,000 of
the remaining 10,000 cheetahs.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.110
We've doubled that
population in the 25 years

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.920
that I've set up the
Cheetah Conservation Fund.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.190
And our vision is really to see
a world in which cheetahs live

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.100
in harmony and
flourish in coexistence

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.920
with people and the environment.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.580
And that's, I think,
a big thing today

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.880
is that we have forgotten
how to co-exist.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.840
And the cheetah
doesn't live inside

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.060
of a square box
of a game reserve.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.070
It's made me think for about 40
years about how to save them.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.300
And that's outside square boxes.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.180
And I've had to look at
world-changing things.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.030
And it's interesting,
how does one actually

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.140
go about changing the world?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.460
Google had changed the world.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.770
The cheetah is changing
the world as well.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.540
Now over a 40 year
period of time,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.224
I thought, well, I know
a lot about cheetahs.

00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:23.140
And I've studied them.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.440
I know more about
them then probably

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.810
most anybody knows about
any living species.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.170
And yet, with this,
just knowing about them

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.640
is not going to save them.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.630
So I set out about 25
years ago and moved

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.410
to Namibia, a country
I'd traveled to a lot,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.310
to try to find out why
people were killing cheetahs.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.050
When I got to
Namibia, farmers were

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.300
killing about 1,000
cheetahs a year.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.050
It was indiscriminate.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.900
They saw a cheetah, it
was a perceived threat

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.290
to their livestock, they would
catch them in capture cages,

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.230
and once caught, they
would usually shoot them.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.370
But why?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.010
Was it because they were causing
a problem to their livestock?

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.450
We primarily found that
it was because they

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.910
were perceived as vermin.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.360
And that's the same
thing that we, globally,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.920
think of all of our predators.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.210
So I think this is
probably something

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.220
that it's not just
our African farmers

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.570
but it's farmers worldwide.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.015
That the value of wildlife,
the value of predators,

00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:27.620
is really limited.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.660
Farmers, ranchers, the world
really looks our livestock.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.440
But where do wildlife fit in?

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.960
What is the value
of conservation?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.100
Our research in our
Cheetah Conservation Fund

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.460
really deals with
the cheetah survival.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.740
And we're research-based
conservation program.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.170
So we learn about the
animal, we do conservation,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.490
and we do a lot of education.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.510
The cheetah is an animal
that is very unique.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.240
It lacks genetic diversity.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.690
And genetic diversity
keeps us all healthy.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.310
And the diversity of our
genes is very important.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.190
But the cheetah actually went
through a population bottleneck

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.650
about 10,000 to
12,000 years ago,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.640
leaving them very, very,
very genetically the same.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.920
So there's a whole
aspect of biology

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.630
that we need to
understand, basic biology.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.070
So we studied the
cheetah in that aspect.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.760
We also then look at how to stop
farmers from catching cheetahs.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.140
Stopping the
human/wildlife conflict,

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.350
which has become a model
for predators and people

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.570
living together
around the world.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.010
And then, looking
at livelihoods.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.380
Because if you're a
poor, starving farmer,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.039
you really don't
want to have cheetahs

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.919
or other predators coming in.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.110
And I always like to ask people,
how many people really would

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.320
like to be a poor, starving
farmer in an arid-type area

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.750
in Africa?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.510
Anybody?

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.270
Usually I find nobody.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.590
And I live as a
farmer in Namibia

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.580
because when I moved
there, it was actually

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.570
to find out how to live in
harmony with the people.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.700
We have a very
large research area.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.550
And we do a lot of work using
Google Maps and using GIS.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.650
And we study maps everywhere.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.540
So maps are a very
big part of our life.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.710
This is just a little map
with a bunch of dots on it

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.690
that says the red
dots were where

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.540
we went and rescued cheetahs.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.780
The black dots are when I
went door-to-door and talked

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.460
to farmers to find
out everything

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.890
there was about their ecosystem.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.790
And that area that's in there
is about the size of California.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.440
This area that's pulled off to
the side is our research area.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.482
And all those other
dots that are over there

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.940
are where we use
radio telemetry.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.970
And we now use
satellite collars.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.140
So every little
dot that's there is

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.252
where we know a
cheetah has gone.

00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:52.710
And then we go out
into those areas

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.740
and we understand more
about how it overlaps

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.650
with the farms and the farmers
and where the wildlife is.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.390
And understand why the
cheetah went to those dots.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.260
Our biomedical is world-renowned
for the work that we do.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.380
And I just want to put
this in perspective.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.160
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.300
And we've developed
a research center

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.400
that is about 25 miles
down a dirt road.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.540
And with that, we have
to make our own power,

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.660
our own electricity.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.600
We've got solar panels.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.730
We're trying to go
into biomass power.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.340
We have a generator.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.930
We have to make our
own water, which

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.190
means we have to pump it
from nowhere in the ground

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.030
because we're in
a very arid area.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.000
So our bore hole's
about 200 meters deep.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.320
But with that, we've developed
a very sophisticated research

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.040
center.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.470
I was trained to work out
of the back of my truck

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.844
but I thought,
you know, it would

00:10:47.844 --> 00:10:50.570
be a lot easier if I could
have a few amenities.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.420
And so I developed a
little veterinary clinic.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.180
And we have a genetics lab.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.530
And this is where we
process our samples.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.870
And we study and learn more
about the cheetah and many

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.560
of the other aspects of the
overall health of the cheetah.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.220
Understanding the
cheetah really revolves

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.130
around trying to deal
with large landscapes.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.860
And so as kind of Google
mappers-- as I just

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.770
think of your mapping
program-- what

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.370
does really a large landscape
feel like, look like?

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.910
For a cheetah--
cheetahs cover areas

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.490
of about 800 square miles.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.980
That's a couple male.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.690
A female my cover a larger
area than that with her cubs.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.245
That's huge.

00:11:33.245 --> 00:11:35.040
And they live in
very low density,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.960
over very, very large areas.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.870
So when I talk about what it
looks like to save the cheetah,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.430
I'm not saying a farm.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.240
I'm talking about a continent.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.620
So here's one of the
radio collars that we use.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.920
These are satellite collars.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.110
And they're really cool.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.500
So we program them
and then put them on.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.580
They have a lifetime
of about three years.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.100
But you program them and
then they have a drop off.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.300
And so, as they drop off, you've
collected all this information

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.260
via satellite.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.800
Of course, we map it all out.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.230
We know where the cheetahs are.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.050
We primarily like to get data
about every hour on the animal.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.160
And as we start
learning more about it,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.450
we can change that to go maybe
four or five times a day.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.550
And then it uploads--
in the beginning,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.760
if we're putting
a cat out-- daily.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.320
And then, as we start
learning more about the animal

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.700
and it settles down, we then
start going to like every week.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.250
So our information
is very extensive.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.590
Each one of these
collars is about $5,500.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.120
But they have a
very long lifespan

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.500
and they're very important to
us for the research that we do.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.900
Our ecology is very critical.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.110
Again, kind of a
complicated map here,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.230
but this is what a cheetah's
home range would look like,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.420
over here.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.370
And each one of
these little squares

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.400
right here is
about 10,000 acres.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.620
So again, in looking at
what that looks like,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.220
that's about 20 farms.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.330
And that's a typical
home range for a cheetah.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.700
They live in low densities.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.680
There is overlap and
they have avoidance

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.310
that goes on through
scat and scent marking.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.890
And so we actually
study the scent

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.250
marking by putting
up camera traps.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.450
And these are different areas
where we put these traps.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.980
This is about a 300
square mile area.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.740
And we find about 12 cheetahs
that live in those areas.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.760
And we conduct this
study using camera traps.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.040
And Matti Nghikembua
is our chief ecologist

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.460
up at the top having one
of our camera traps there.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.240
And it's allowed us
to understand more

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.730
about the distribution and
the density of cheetahs.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.780
We see about four
to five cheetahs

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.940
per 1,000 square kilometers.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.440
Again in what their
home range looks like,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.840
male cheetahs live
together their whole life.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.220
Male cheetahs form what
are called coalitions.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.130
They're brothers,
they love each other,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.870
and then they will form a
territory, or a home range,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.790
which is about 400 square
miles as they get smaller.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.201
And then with that, females
cover multiple male home

00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:17.700
ranges.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.630
This is different,
like, then any

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.950
of the other large
carnivores, or cats.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.760
Because usually it's the males
covering multiple females.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.510
Well, cheetahs are a
little bit different.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.420
Cheetahs have what's
called mate choice.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.420
So they'll find which
male groups that they want

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.430
to go mate with.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.680
They also have a
matriarchal society.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.500
So within the
female's home range,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.950
her daughters would stay, she
be in where her sisters are.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.800
In their huge-- and
yet, they do overlap,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.470
but there's a lot
of sociability that

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.620
goes on in these very
large home ranges.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.680
The other thing
that we do is-- when

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.520
we were able to collect
so many cheetahs

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.620
but fortunately we
stopped the farmers

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.190
from catching so many-- we still
want to know more about how

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.790
cheetahs are living out there.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.190
So we've employed scat
dogs-- or detection dogs.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.010
So all four of these people and
dogs up here are ecologists.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.180
Stephanie is one of our handlers
and trainers of the dogs.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.700
And all three of those
dogs are trained to go

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.160
find cheetah scat.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.620
You say, "go find"
and the dog goes off

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.800
with a collar on
it that also maps

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.240
where it's going, that we
can download and figure out

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.960
how far it takes for the
cheetah to go tracking.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.490
And they have quite a
good sense of scent.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.484
And they find the scat, they
sit, and then we come over

00:15:37.484 --> 00:15:38.650
and we can collect the scat.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.310
And then we can take it
into our genetics lab.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.220
And we have a very
lovely genetics lab.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.590
We are one of the few
places in Africa--

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.800
outside of a couple of
the major cities-- that

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.470
actually has a genetics lab.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.120
And our gene sequencer
was donated to us

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.440
by Life Science Technologies,
which is also a San Francisco

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.790
Bay company.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.820
And we're very proud
to have our sequencer.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.760
And these are two
of our geneticists--

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.610
Fabiano just finished his
Ph.D. A few months ago

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.330
and Anne is our chief geneticist
that runs our laboratory.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.480
We bring in a lot of Namibian
and international students,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.360
a lot from throughout
Africa that

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.490
want to come in and
learn about genetics.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.490
But our Namibian
students as well

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.160
are trying to learn much more.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.190
Because we really do need
to train our next generation

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.660
of Africans into being very
good scientists as well.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.350
And that's something
that we haven't

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.210
done a lot with for the years.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.910
But as we take the scat in
and overlap it with our camera

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.990
traps, we can understand
a little bit more

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.200
about those
individual cheetahs--

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.580
understand their
genealogy, their lineages

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.630
through the scat.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:59.040
And this picture here
shows the differences.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.880
So this picture is three.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.410
And there's another
different cheetah up there.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.770
And this is one of the master's
projects-- one of our master's

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.410
students from Namibia
who's actually

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.020
looking at identifying
and comparing

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.589
the different pictures
with that of our scat

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.000
that we're collecting.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.930
And it's a very important
part of understanding

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.430
the overall ranges
of the cheetahs.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.390
We use dogs in another way, too.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.150
So we try to find the best
use of many of our friends.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.870
But since Africa is full
of ranchers or farmers--

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.300
livestock farmers is
what we call them--

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.090
they all have livestock.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.550
And if the livestock
gets caught by predators

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.790
then the predators are killed.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:50.650
So about 15 years ago, we
brought in a breeding group

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.470
of Anatolian Shepherd
and Kangal dogs, which

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.550
is a very large breed of dog.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.400
And we now breed the dogs and
we donate them to the farmers.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.300
The puppies are
actually placed when

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.530
they are about 10 weeks of age.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.490
And we then follow the puppies--
working with the farmers--

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.730
to train the farmers in
how the dogs are working.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.710
The dogs have been us for about
5,000 years through Turkey.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.880
And they're an
amazing breed of dog.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.430
They bark loudly.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.040
They act as a guardian
and not a herder.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.130
And they protect the flocks,
primarily through actually just

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.600
being there.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.346
And the predators
don't want to get hurt.

00:18:30.346 --> 00:18:31.470
They don't want to come in.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.590
And listening to
this large dog bark,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.040
the predators know that
there's something there

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.040
that's actually protecting them.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.850
And it was exciting,
on Sunday, we just

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.010
had a litter of 10 puppies born.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.440
So it was a fun day for
my staff over in Namibia.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.810
It was my favorite dog
so I'm sorry to have

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.600
missed her birthing.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.570
But when I get back
in about a month,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.040
the puppies will be
still another month

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.600
to go before we actually
will be placing them.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.230
So we've placed nearly
500 of the dogs.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.880
And as we place
them, they don't get

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.160
to just get played
with by the kids.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.040
But this often
helps the kids that

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.990
then can go off to schools.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.270
Because throughout
Africa, most of the time,

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.690
the children are
the ones that are

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.430
herding the family's livestock.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.360
And again, this is one
of my next questions,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.860
if you were that age or
your children are that age,

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.190
would you want them out
protecting your livestock?

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.100
And what happens when
the leopard comes?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.350
And most of the kids say,
do you want to be out there?

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.280
And the kids go, no.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.290
Where would you go?

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.150
We'd run back home.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.290
So then, what would
happen to your livestock?

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.940
The leopard would probably
eat it-- or the cheetah.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.070
So by having the dogs
out there, the dogs

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.390
grow up and become guardians,
the kids can go to school,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.004
the livestock's not killed,
and the system then can work.

00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:50.670
So those are the kinds
of things that we

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.930
work on training
in programs that we

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.485
call Future Farmers of Africa.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.990
Africa's also a place where
we all eat lots of meat,

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.160
because meat's about the
only thing there is to eat.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.110
Now when you live in
an arid environment

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.200
and there's not very much water,
and most of the rural people

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.570
carry their water miles on their
donkeys or on their own backs

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.750
to try to get their
water to their villages.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.160
And therefore, you can't
really grow anything.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160
And that's why people
eat so much meat.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.620
And that's why we have
so much goat and cattle.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.930
And that's why our
landscape is overgrazed.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.844
With that, then, we started
looking at the health of people

00:20:31.844 --> 00:20:33.260
and thought, well,
you know, maybe

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.750
if they learned that they
had a couple of their goats,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.546
and maybe with those goats they
could learn how to make cheese,

00:20:38.546 --> 00:20:40.920
and they could figure out how
to go about doing this even

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.890
without electricity, that
perhaps it could help them

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.660
and their children
have a better health.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.730
So we set up the
Dancing Goat Creamery.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.900
And the concept with
the dancing goat

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.600
is the fact that the goats can
dance because they're protected

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.050
by livestock guarding dogs
which are saving cheetahs.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.800
So there is a method to some
of the madness that I have.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.940
These are my staff-- Chapa
helps manage our small stock,

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.490
Sharine in the middle is
our main cheese maker,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.190
Chapa has gone through
University of Namibia

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.940
as an agriculture major.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.460
Sharine is basically illiterate.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.200
And yet is the best cheese maker
I think there is in the world.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.790
Hanlie helps me in all
of our cooking aspects

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.910
and manages the dairy.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.820
She's also a pastry chef.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.070
It's very good.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.030
Big picture.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.400
So I want to talk about
this big landscape

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.530
and what it's going to take to
actually have large landscape.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.420
Our backyard, which is on the
other side of the Waterberg

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.310
National Park-- which
is this big mountain

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.940
up there-- which is a wildlife
park owned by the government.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.230
And our land borders it.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.470
We have about 100,000
acres of land.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.840
We got a very
large piece of land

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.840
that we manage as part of
the Waterberg Conservancy.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.630
And it's a buffer to
the wildlife park.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.700
Around us, then, is an area
called the Greater Waterberg

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.530
Landscape.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.990
We work with are our neighbors
in managing our wildlife

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.260
and natural resources in an
integrated system where we have

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.400
enough grazing
land, good wildlife,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.650
our livestock is protected.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.660
And then with that, predators
can play a role in the system.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.100
We also not only have
cheetahs in this area,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.370
we also have wild dogs, which
are one of the most endangered.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.050
Of all the canids, they're one
of the most endangered predator

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.240
there is in the world.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.640
So two iconic animals
living in this landscape.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.010
Within this whole
community is also

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.590
a group of people which
are called the Herero.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.670
The Herero speaking
people from Namibia--

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.330
we've got about 12
different tribal people--

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.600
but they have a very
interesting culture.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.180
The women wear these
amazing 25-yard dress,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.890
colonially-looking.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.660
And the weather is
about 120 degrees.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.910
So it's very interesting
that they wear them.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.030
But they are very much
a part of their culture.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.470
The culture is that of
the being a cattle farmer.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.410
And yet, there's no wildlife
in this whole big circle here.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.750
So what our task
has been with that

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:23.050
of the Ministry of Environment
and Tourism and the UNDP--

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.340
the United Nations
Development Program--

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.850
is to help change this area
over into a landscape that's

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.130
going to bring in wildlife.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.960
Change, we hope, the
lifestyles and the livelihoods

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.500
from just a strictly
livestock farming community.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.960
And actually have a
mixed wildlife/livestock

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960
going into, for them,
some ecotourism.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.620
And allow an area for animals
like cheetahs and wild dogs.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.560
So a habitat is very,
very important as is prey.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.580
So you cannot have a cheetah or
other predators without having

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.680
prey.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.550
And without having
enough grazing land,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.210
you can't have prey.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.430
And if people are hungry,
they will eat all that prey ,

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.090
keep the grass for their cattle.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.360
And that's why this balance
of this conservancy-type

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.150
initiative, which Namibia is
very famous for, is important.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:27.270
But a lot of our habitat
is very overgrazed.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.960
And what happened
with overgrazing--

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.510
that means the
cattle, and the goats,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.980
and sheep have taken
down all the grasses,

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.120
especially when
we have a drought

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.130
and there's not very much rain.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.120
And then what's happened is
thorn bushes have taken over.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.790
So our wildlife is
actually changed.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.082
We end up seeing it move.

00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:49.040
And it goes into areas
where there's more water

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.080
and where there are grasslands.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.650
We have an area
on our land which

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.380
is called the Little Serengeti.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.310
And we're starting to see huge
numbers of wildlife species

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.420
starting to come back because
of the kind of management

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.600
that we've been dealing
with within our conservancy.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.900
But this habitat has
caused a major problem.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.760
And throughout an area, again,
about the size of California,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.830
right in here, that area
used to be an open grassland.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:23.280
And it's now thickly thorn
bush called bush encroachment.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.870
And our thorns are
horrible and long.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.870
And just imagine
running through this

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.090
or even walking through it.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:34.320
You can hardly penetrate it.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.280
And the bushes have taken over.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.540
They've got very,
very deep roots

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.200
that are drinking, each plant.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.160
About 65 liters
of water per day.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.510
So it's a form of
desertification.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.400
And with that, no grass grows.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.440
So we've taken an
area about now--

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.820
it's roughly about 26
million hectares of very,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.720
very thick thorn bush that
you cannot even get through.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.990
And you can see this cow,
she can't find her calf.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.560
With thickened thorn bush,
farmers kill more cheetahs

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.210
because they can't
kill the bush.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.400
And every other
predator has a problem.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.230
We've found it's affected our
economy by over $100 million

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.680
per year by the farmers
not being able to farm.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.940
And what we found is
that cheetahs, actually,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.360
are scratching their
eyes and going blind.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.970
And those animals that
are the ones, that 3% that

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.890
might be out catching livestock.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.710
So we've actually
took on a big problem

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.470
is to figure out how
to go about dealing

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.700
with this bush
encroachment issue.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.990
So we started a habitat
restoration program,

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.210
now it's been
about 12 years ago.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.400
I think it was
maybe six years ago

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.770
we won the Tech Award
for the environment,

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.440
here, in your area.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.280
And it was quite an honor
to be recognized here

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.870
in this part of the
world for the work

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.890
that we're doing over in Africa.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.380
But we are selectively
harvesting our bush.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.430
We're part of a Forest
Stewardship Council

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.210
certification process.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.970
Can I ask how many of you
might know what FSC is?

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.190
Forest Stewardship
Council certification.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.630
Hands, no hands, I see one hand.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.330
It is the highest form
of forest protection.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.010
And if we all knew
what FSC was, we

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.840
could not only with
every wood product

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.330
that we were dealing
with as consumers,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.780
we could be helping a lot of
different wildlife species.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.620
including animals like
elephants and orangutans.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.480
But for us, we're
thinning the habitat

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.220
so that we can have
more grasslands.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.300
We're putting a lot
of people to work.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.980
And from that, we made
a little fuel log.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.740
And our little fuel
log's coming around.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.250
It's an ecolog, burns
with very hot heat

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.720
with a very low emission.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.890
But out of that, we're now
looking at using biomass.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.820
Again, we've got an area
the size of California.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.820
We get about 10 tons
per hectare harvest

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.330
that we could go into
biomass electricity.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.780
Much of this biomass is being
exasperated as well by the CO2

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.600
emissions that are going on.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.080
Because they are
affecting and allowing

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.650
the trees to actually grow more,
the bushes to grow up more.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.210
So these are what our
fuel logs look like.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.970
And we ask people to think about
eco-partnering and labeling,

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.330
and businesses and
business partnering.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.560
And to look at
products that might

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.930
be well-labeled or certified.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.270
We started a program
called Wildlife Friendly.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.240
And we did this in cooperation
with several other wildlife

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.050
conservation groups that were
working with communities, that

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.290
were putting people
into work that

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.100
were helping save
endangered species.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.160
So our Certified
Wildlife Friendly

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.730
is different than organic
because for animals

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.750
like predators,
organic doesn't mean

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.580
that you can't use strychnine
and kill all the predators

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.700
while you're having
organic lamb.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.080
So those are things
just to think on.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.180
Poaching is a big problem.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.250
And I'd just like to touch
basically on this for a minute.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.370
That the illegal trade is
going from the northern parts

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.000
of Africa.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.150
And they're coming in
areas like Botswana,

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.070
South Africa, Namibia,
taking small cubs.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.480
Primarily, though,
from Somali land,

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.180
which is pretty
lawless up there,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.850
and southeastern
Ethiopia, northern Kenya.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.240
And these cats are going
up into the Middle East.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.740
And for every one cheetah that
might make it there alive,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.910
we probably lose
about five or more.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.900
So the cheetah cubs
are captured and sold

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.840
for a very low amount of
money and then usually die.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.270
So they die usually under
about three months of age

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.670
from diseases or improper diet.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.460
If they make it to two years
of age, they are very lucky.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.650
Most of them don't.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.980
They die at that time and
then the cubs are gone.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.710
They go back into
the illegal trade,

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.310
get more of them from
the wild, and are sold.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.010
so we're spending a lot of
our time up in the Middle East

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:05.390
at this point trying to
work with the Sheikhs.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.370
There are some very,
very good Sheikhs

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:11.350
who are trying to,
actually, help promote

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.090
the betterment of the
care of these animals.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.160
Just a couple months
ago, we were up in UAE.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.230
And actually, a lot
of our work also

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:25.310
deals with banking-- bio-banking
of blood, sperm, tissues--

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.250
and we trained over 35
of the veterinarians

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.550
at several of the different
facilities on how to bank down

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.426
the sperm of their
very rare cheetahs.

00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:36.800
Many of these
animals-- and these

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.220
are at legitimate facilities--
to try to actually help them

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.360
more about the overall
health of the animals

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.740
and train the veterinarians.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.850
Putting cheetahs into
the wild is, for us,

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.310
the most important thing.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.280
And we have put back into
the wild over 600 cheetahs.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.420
We recently are doing a
lot in reintroduction work.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.860
There's places like India
that wants cheetahs again,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.190
Uzbekistan.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.910
And we're working
with those countries

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.310
to try to find ways that the
cheetah could possibly go back

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.260
out into some of
these other ranges.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.350
We're keeping them living free
and in the wild in Namibia

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:15.310
working in cooperation
with other cheetah programs

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.090
throughout the cheetah's ranges.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.160
From Cheetah
Conservation Botswana

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.210
to Cheetah Conservation
in Kenya or ACT.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.620
But getting cheetahs in the
wild and keeping them there

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.000
is all about all these
components that I talked about.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.950
This is a special
friend of mine.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.700
And he has passed away
now a couple years ago.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.370
His name was Chewbacca.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.440
And he was with me for 16 years.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.200
He came in as an orphan.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.400
And his mother had
been, unfortunately--

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.280
well, he'd been
taken from his mom.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.470
And was almost on death's
door when I got him.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.980
He was one of my best
friends and taught me a lot.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.525
But he also taught people
throughout Namibia,

00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:02.570
and throughout Africa,
about what a cheetah is.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.390
And when a farmer
would come and yell

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.830
at me about his
problems with cheetahs

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.240
and Chewbacca would lick
his hand and purr to him

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.430
and look in his eyes,
I won that farmer.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.390
And my job was then
to work with him

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.170
to find ways that he could live
in harmony with the cheetah.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.490
I don't know how come I ended
up being a cheetah voice

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.970
but I've been doing
this for 40 years.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.760
It is the most amazing
animal that I know.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.850
All animals are very special.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.610
And yet, it to me
tells me the job

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.370
that we have to do in
spreading the word.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.590
And I thank all of you
for coming and listening

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.280
to these things that we have
to say about the cheetah.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.240
Because it's all about thinking
outside of square boxes.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.620
We welcome people
to visit us at CCF.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.570
We take interns and volunteers.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.225
Any one of you can come.

00:32:52.225 --> 00:32:55.600
We're always looking for
more capacity in our clinic,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.840
in our genetics lab, working
with us on Google Maps,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.140
in all the different
aspects that we do work on.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.190
And we get people
from around the world

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.930
that do come and work with us.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.500
If you just want
to come and visit,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.800
we've got a very nice guest
house which is three bedroom.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.590
It's called the Babson House
and we welcome guests as well.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.150
But we are an open-to-the-public
research center.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.900
So when you're there
at our Babson House,

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.316
you're right in
the heart and soul

00:33:22.316 --> 00:33:24.830
of the work that
goes on with us.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.630
So I ask everyone to help.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.520
And all of you can
help us as well.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.730
By just spreading
the word and helping

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.330
keep cheetahs
living in the wild.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:35.880
And support the work.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.930
Please spread the word.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.820
Please help buy the
book that's out here.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.290
And share it with others
because it is a special book.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:47.120
It's called "A
Future for Cheetahs"

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.870
because saving
the cheetah really

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.490
means changing the world.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.580
As I mentioned before, you
all have changed the world.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.700
And I know that, today, you
could help me change the world

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.480
to save more cheetahs as well.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.210
Thank you.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:04.220
We're going to bring
in Barb and Rob.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.130
And we've worked together
for 20 years, I bet, huh?

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:18.510
And they have an education
center up in Occidental

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:21.090
where they bring their
cheetahs to schools.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.850
And they have
other cats as well.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:27.690
Barb's been a teacher
for more than 20 years.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.219
And went into helping
us spread the word

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.159
to help save our
wildlife species.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.940
So Themba is going to come in.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.280
And he is four years
old next month.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.480
And he was born in South Africa
at the De Wildt Cheetah Center.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.639
And cheetahs don't breed
very well in captivity.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.659
De Wildt's one of
the only places

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.590
in the world that's
actually done so well.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.489
There's only a handful of
breeding centers in the world.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.639
And he was hand-raised.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:35:01.670
He's fourth generation-- I
think, third generation--

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.050
captive born.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.390
And being hand-raised, he's
been able to be an ambassador

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:10.330
by coming here to
meet all of you today.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.140
And I'll just answer
and so we'll just,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.704
you guys get to meet the
cheetah and ask questions, so--

00:35:15.704 --> 00:35:18.370
AUDIENCE: You mentioned thinking
about reintroducing the cheetah

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.100
to Uzbekistan, I think you said.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.136
What is their natural or
historical northern limit

00:35:24.136 --> 00:35:24.760
or their range?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.635
LAURIE MARKER: They were
found in Uzbekistan.

00:35:26.635 --> 00:35:27.650
They were in China.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:32.050
So they had a very big
range throughout all

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.500
of Asia and Africa.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.820
And so they went extinct
around the Uzbekistan/Russian

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.025
territories in the '80s.

00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:42.400
And so that is one of the
areas that they were living in.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.260
They've got vast grasslands,
also very overgrazed.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.470
They're bringing back
their wildlife population.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.980
And the government's got
quite a commitment to this.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.220
It'll be years to do.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.980
We hope that we can
have enough to put back

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.975
when that time comes.

00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:01.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.150
Thank you for being here today.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.020
Since you're doing
genetic work, the cheetahs

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.220
that have been taken into other
parts of the world as pets,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.700
are you able to identify where
they came from originally,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.690
based on your genetic research?

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.940
That's number one.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.960
And then number two is, I know
that you were saying that there

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.974
was a bottleneck was
it 10,000 years ago?

00:36:23.974 --> 00:36:25.182
LAURIE MARKER: Yes, 10 to 12.

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:25.770
AUDIENCE: 10 to 12, yeah.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.210
And they were down to, like,
2,000 or something cheetahs?

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.220
LAURIE MARKER: Ooh,
we don't even know.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.039
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:32.080
I don't know but I'm heard
that number somewhere.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.840
LAURIE MARKER: Ask
my PhD students.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.700
AUDIENCE: And so,
how genetically

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.810
different are the
ones that are found

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.930
in different parts of the world,
different parts of Africa?

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.200
Are they genetically
somewhat different or are

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.219
they still pretty much the same?

00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:50.260
LAURIE MARKER: They're
very pretty much the same.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.780
So the divergence actually
occurs over like 100,000 years.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.740
And these look like they may be
diverged much less than that.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.250
So there is some
division in what

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.310
they look-- you know,
you can tell one

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.730
from one part of the world
to the other or Africa--

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.200
but they are very, very,
very much the same.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.360
And we are trying to help
collect that genetic material.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.560
That's why we've gone
up into the Middle East.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.270
And we're trying to
collect everything

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.530
that we can from these animals.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.220
So he's going to
walk back and forth.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.120
What Rob has done is he's
putting his meatballs down.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.170
And he's going to look
at where those are.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.230
Now if you notice those
tear marks that run down

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.886
from those eyes,
the cheetah's spots

00:37:33.886 --> 00:37:35.510
are different than
all the other spots.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.180
Most everyone sees spots and
they are leopards usually.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.740
The cheetahs' got polka dots.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.060
All leopards have are what
are called rosettas, which

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.370
is a black circle with
yellow in the middle.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.570
But those tear marks are
what distinguish the cheetah

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.910
from any of the
other spotted cats.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.370
You can hear his
claws on the ground.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:01.210
Cheetahs are the only big
cat that has nonretractable.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.490
Claws-- or they're called
semi-nonretractable.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.990
And their claws are used like
cleats for traction in running.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.980
And that's one of
adaptations that's

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.660
helped them run speeds of
up to 70 miles an hour.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.370
When they run, their shoulder
girdles and hip girdles

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.430
are not connected.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.790
And they allows them to
have an amazing extension.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.620
And then they've got a
very flexible backbone.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.375
And their tail is very long.

00:38:26.375 --> 00:38:29.320
And their tail is used
as a rudder for balance

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.440
to help them not roll
over and spin out

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.280
at that speed of
70 miles an hour.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.890
A lot of people think that
running 70 miles an hour

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:38.810
is just what they do.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.470
But they really are
more very acrobatic.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.620
So when they run, they're
going side-to-side,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.800
backwards-to-forwards.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.980
And so their tail
plays an important role

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.410
as does the body build.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.090
He's purring right
now, I can hear him.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.730
Cheetahs are the only
big cat that does purr.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.560
And they chirp like birds.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.200
They bubble, hiss, spat, growl.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.954
[MAKING CHEETAH NOISES]

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:15.760
Let me see, who else might
have a question out there?

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.970
As I said, he's four.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.270
Cheetahs have a lifespan in
captivity of about 12 to 14.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.840
And in the wild,
it's about 8 to 10.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.410
OK?

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.130
AUDIENCE: You see
them with the handler

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.370
and you see them sitting next to
you, but they are wild animals.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.210
So you're not supposed
to go, "kitty, kitty."

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.600
So how tame are they, really?

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.850
LAURIE MARKER: Well, these
guys have been hand-raised.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.610
So he was hand-raised
on a bottle.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.210
The cheetah that I was
with was hand-raised

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.070
from the time he
was 10 days old.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.990
And they are an animal
that can be tamed.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.760
And that's why
cheetahs are still

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.400
one of the few animals that can
be used in educational purposes

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.360
by legitimate facilities.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.550
Now, they're registered.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:07.100
And so there's only a handful
of facilities in the world that

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.900
have cheetahs , number one.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.120
And we've been trying to get
that under control so that they

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:19.246
are registered facilities by
USDA here in the United States.

00:40:19.246 --> 00:40:21.370
BARBARA DICELY: By
California Fish and Game,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.565
by the US Department
of Fish and Wildlife.

00:40:24.565 --> 00:40:26.249
I have many, many,
many licenses.

00:40:26.249 --> 00:40:27.040
LAURIE MARKER: Yes.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.280
And so, and they're
used for education.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.462
So it stops people from
just having them as a pet.

00:40:32.462 --> 00:40:34.045
BARBARA DICELY: Here
in California, it

00:40:34.045 --> 00:40:37.160
is illegal to own any
wild animal as a pet.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.450
Some of the states,
it is still legal.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.710
The laws are
changing dramatically

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:47.020
just so people don't
have a tiger as a pet.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.090
But in California you can't.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.560
So these are strictly
educational outreach

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.260
ambassadors.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.507
They are not our pets.

00:40:55.507 --> 00:40:57.340
LAURIE MARKER: OK, I've
got three questions.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:57.960
Here is one.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.910
Right here is two.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.520
AUDIENCE: I was wondering with
the limited genetic cheetahs

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.090
have, have you tried
transferring cheetahs

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.820
from one of the isolated
islands of population

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.190
to the others to sort of
increase the diversity?

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.300
LAURIE MARKER: Well, we
have not done that yet

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.000
because there's a lot
of international laws

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.670
that would prohibit that.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.420
Because the
governments, you know,

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.637
like in Iran, their
cheetah is special

00:41:22.637 --> 00:41:24.470
and they don't want to
mix it with anything,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.140
even though it might save
them in the long run.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.330
But we're hoping that
intervention through habitat,

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.460
education, policies,
and politics

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:38.920
will actually help us try
to grow the populations.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.640
The work that we've done
in 25 years in Namibia

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.800
has set a stage and a model
for cheetah conservation

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.550
throughout Africa.

00:41:50.019 --> 00:41:51.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.780
It's very inspiring.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.590
And I wonder how do you plan
to scale up your solution?

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.180
And what are the major
bottlenecks that you see?

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:03.980
Thank you.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.479
LAURIE MARKER: I
love your question.

00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:08.220
Scaling up is what
my life is all about.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.750
When I first said I needed
to go save the world,

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.230
people wondered what
I was talking about.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.670
So our programs around like
Future Farmers of Africa--

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.810
so we're trying to partner
with other organizations that

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.990
are involved, like
places like CARE

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:25.610
and other humanitarian
organizations who are not

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.050
putting wildlife and grazing
lands into the landscape.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.740
Promoting programs
like our conservancies

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.530
are very important.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.550
Organizations like
World Wildlife Fund

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.900
are very committed to those
kinds of big picture thinking.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.130
So as a small organization,
what we're trying to do

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.730
is to get enough funds
to actually scale up.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.880
From our bush
harvesting program,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.850
we actually are looking for
funding to actually scale it up

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.400
into biomass power.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.390
We're trying to get power
on our land to start with.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.810
And then show
Namibia that we can

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.650
power it through
our bush harvest.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.150
And then, other
places in Africa are

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.640
looking at the same
kinds of issues

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.210
in wanting to have something
to do with their habitat.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.780
Habitat restoration
is going to be key.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.760
And then looking at
livelihood development.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.810
Getting people out of
that cycle of being

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.000
poor, starving farmers.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.804
I'd love you to help.

00:43:24.804 --> 00:43:27.220
BARBARA DICELY: You know, the
children as me all the time,

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.420
you know, how can we,
living in America,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.930
really help cheetahs
living in Africa?

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.250
And as with most things,
it boils down to money.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:40.300
And if you have, you know-- any
kind of donation you can make,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.440
Laurie puts to amazing use.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.636
It goes directly to saving
cheetahs in the wild.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.030
AUDIENCE: So I know a
lot from watching TV

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.660
about how and why dogs
fit into human families.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.850
I don't really
understand the social--

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.272
how does a hand-raised cheetah
see the people around it?

00:44:00.272 --> 00:44:01.980
Like what does that
social structure look

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.340
like in the cheetah world?

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.340
Do you know what I mean?

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.080
LAURIE MARKER: Well,
like, right here?

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.288
AUDIENCE: Or just in general.

00:44:07.288 --> 00:44:10.030
What is their social
interaction with other cheetahs

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.440
and how do they translate
that to human [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.065
LAURIE MARKER: Is
this like an orphaned

00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:15.580
cheetah like at our place?

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.464
AUDIENCE: No, cheetahs
in general, right?

00:44:17.464 --> 00:44:19.380
I mean, I think dog
socialize well with people

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.450
because they socialize
well with their kind.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.200
LAURIE MARKER: Cheetahs
are very much more

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.140
social than what we would think.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.560
And that sociability
in the wild is the fact

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.890
that females are covering
large areas with their cubs.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.470
And so they start
with a small area

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.260
and grow out and out and
out, covering a lot of areas.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.260
They go to these marking
trees, these play trees,

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.990
they know the scents and
smells of the other animals.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:45.060
So the female's a
very important teacher

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.520
in how to live out in the wild.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.460
Males will kind of do avoidance
through, again, scat and scent.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.755
They might use the same
play tree or marking area.

00:44:59.164 --> 00:45:00.539
BARBARA DICELY:
He says you never

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:03.180
know where those meatballs
are going to show up.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.340
LAURIE MARKER: Male cheetahs
live, as I said, in coalitions.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.580
And a female's got her cubs
for about nearly two years--

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.460
18 to 22 months.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.600
Then the cubs stay together
until they separate,

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.840
males separate from the females
and the females have litters.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.970
So it's a very
interesting social life.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:26.830
AUDIENCE: So these guys
run 50, 60 miles an hour.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.010
Question, just very practical.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.540
When you want to
take him for a run,

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.080
do you take him on
the 101, the I5?

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:37.920
How does that work?

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.701
BARBARA DICELY: We
have 22 acres of land.

00:45:43.701 --> 00:45:46.820
And what we use is
a lure system that

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.070
was designed for horse
and Greyhound dogs.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.927
So basically, at
least twice a week, we

00:45:52.927 --> 00:45:55.360
do run our cheetahs
to the lure so they

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.900
do get lots of exercise.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.770
Their exercising that big
heart, those lungs, the muscles

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:05.200
that they really
need to be healthy.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.736
LAURIE MARKER: Exercise is
very, very important for them.

00:46:08.736 --> 00:46:09.235
Yes?

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.970
OK.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.420
AUDIENCE: A few
years ago, I went

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.280
with my wife to
Africa, Tanzania,

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.020
actually, just looking
at all the wildlife.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.610
And it was amazing.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.720
I was there mostly for
the cheetahs, actually,

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.980
and I was impressed that
they seemed kind of lazy.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.530
I kept wanting to see
them running after stuff.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.530
Several times we
saw them hunting.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.060
But they'd sort of
gallop-- like trotting--

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.090
and they'd just give up.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.810
Do they not actually do the
full out sprints very often?

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.116
Maybe we just saw them
when they weren't hungry.

00:46:47.116 --> 00:46:47.990
LAURIE MARKER: Maybe.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.270
But they will only
exert themselves

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.020
when they know they
have a good chance.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.320
So if they're trotting
after it, they're

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.020
kind of assessing the situation.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.380
Oftentimes, they
trot, they stalk.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.660
A hunt could take several hours.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.480
So yeah.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.050
And then, when they do,
it's a burst of speed

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.590
that you can hardly
even catch it.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.440
It's like, wow, I
just was looking

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.940
at him laying down here
and look at that dust.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.220
How did I miss that?

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.010
So it is.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.830
It's amazing.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:21.350
But like all cats, they
are energy storers.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:25.750
So they will sleep and
then hunt as they need.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.070
Cheetahs, actually,
will hunt more regularly

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.070
than all the other cats.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.090
They like fresh food so they're
hunting on a regular basis.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:38.080
Female with classes, she's
on the move all the time.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.410
Female cheetahs are the best.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.510
Male cheetahs are the best.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.610
Uh-oh, I think I'm
conflicted here.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.380
AUDIENCE: In your
place, do you have

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.970
problems with the
lions and the hyenas?

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.720
LAURIE MARKER: Where
we are, because we're

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.230
on rural farmland-- and that's
why the cheetah is taken on

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.570
into this area is that farmers
have killed all the lions

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:03.440
and hyenas.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.810
We have leopards.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.750
We have baboons.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:12.320
Both of those are one of the
key problems for the cheetah.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.070
But we've been studying
how the cheetah overlaps

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.140
with the leopard as well.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.870
And we ended up living with
baboons these days, too.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:24.206
So it's rather interesting
how the cycles work.

00:48:24.206 --> 00:48:25.830
AUDIENCE: How much
do the cheetahs eat?

00:48:30.024 --> 00:48:31.440
LAURIE MARKER:
Well, in captivity,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.050
let us say that they might
eat four or five pounds a day,

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.510
an animal this size.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.870
In the wild, then,
it would be they

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.770
would eat as much as they
could as quickly as they could.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.792
So it might be eight to
10 kgs, which is maybe 16,

00:48:46.792 --> 00:48:49.410
20 pounds just fast.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.060
And then they're
gorged and they might

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.830
eat-- if they get to
eat that big of a diet,

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.680
they might not eat
for a couple days.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.180
A female, if she's feeding
her cubs, depending

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.700
on the size of those cubs,
she is hunting and watching.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.010
Her cubs are eating
fast and she's

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:10.030
going to get some morsels in it.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.600
Unlike lions-- lions
will actually eat first

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.660
and the cubs eat last-- a
female cheetah will make a kill

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.630
and make sure her
cubs eat first.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:23.390
So it's a lot of food that they
do consume on a regular basis.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:24.560
Lean meat.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.010
So of course, the antelope
that they're eating

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.990
is also very lean.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.310
AUDIENCE: You just
said that there's

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:33.220
a difference on
how much they eat

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.610
in captivity versus the wild.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:37.170
Does that hurt their
chances of reintroduction

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:40.170
if they're not used
to gorging themselves

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:44.270
when the food is available as
opposed to regular feedings?

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:45.849
LAURIE MARKER: No,
because you have

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.140
to keep them on a regular diet.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:55.120
If you go to a reintroduction,
if they were orphaned animals,

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.890
you would start putting
them on carcasses.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.990
So they start learning
how to eat carcasses.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:05.650
And then they fill
up and go skinny.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.300
It's fun.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.610
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about the Uzbekistan cheetahs.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.630
Where those more genetically
similar to the Iranian cheetahs

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.120
or to the African cheetahs
or what are the issues there?

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.840
LAURIE MARKER: Well, we don't
know because they're extinct.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.430
We are trying to
find out much more

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:25.350
about some of these
extinct populations

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:30.920
by collecting, like,
samples from the museums.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.420
So they are all so
similar that it's

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.880
hard to actually see that much
differentiation with them.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.850
But it would be an animal
that would probably

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:48.381
be much more similar to
that the Iranian cheetah,

00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:49.130
the Asian cheetah.

00:50:51.404 --> 00:50:53.320
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
there are about 10,000

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.420
in the wild right now.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.060
I'm wondering what a healthy and
sustainable population would be

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.440
or if you have a target
number in mind for that?

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:09.120
LAURIE MARKER: I
kind of like 100,000.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.190
That's not that
many, necessarily,

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.620
throughout the continent.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.980
Then if you kind of look
at-- I do a lot of math

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.390
and I do a lot of modeling.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.450
You'd have to then look at, if
you need-- and I know so much.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.410
So I'm always figuring
out how much land

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:25.050
they'd need, how
much prey they'd

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.629
need, how much
grasslands they'd need,

00:51:27.629 --> 00:51:30.170
how many cattle are out there,
how many people are out there.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:34.210
How do we actually switch that
back into these grasslands

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.120
where we've got
wildlife and prey?

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.530
The people are actually
getting a different livelihood

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.540
than being poor,
starving farmers.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.780
And all the sudden, the people
are doing something different.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.270
And yet the wildlife
is still maintaining

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.960
these grassland systems.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.460
Where you then have elephants
and rhinos in the land.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.720
You know, we're looking at
this kind of big support

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.550
system for a big continent.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.610
And the wildlife are
a support system,

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.700
it's part of biodiversity.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.600
I'd be real happy if we
could double the population

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.560
in the next five
years or 10 years.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.980
We've doubled the population
in Namibia in 20 years

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.160
and we're kind of
stabilizing it.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.690
But with that, we now
need to, I guess--

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:20.790
and we are-- working
with the other countries

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.730
throughout the
cheetah's range in order

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.270
to help stabilize those
and grow those populations.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.050
But it's all about people.

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.610
And so I just keep
trying to figure out

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.740
ways of helping people.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.130
And wanting them all
to love the cheetah.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:39.750
I mean, wasn't he beautiful?

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.610
I know it's not--
I bet you haven't

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.070
had a cheetah at Google before.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:46.580
And on Earth Day.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:51.630
It's a celebration of
Earth Day, 44 years.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.635
And think you.

00:52:53.635 --> 00:52:56.520
You all can do an awful
lot to just spread the word

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:00.940
and get more people
involved in many ways.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.120
And I'm always happy to
answer more questions.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.350
And welcome all of you
to come down and visit.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:09.770
Oh, I could, I'd be happy
to sign books as well.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.220
Buy books, buy books.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.720
You can also adopt cheetahs
online, or adopt a dog,

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.780
at our website.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.610
We've got a really nice
website so please go to it.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.940
Cheetah.org.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.180
If you have kids in
school here and you

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.500
want to have the
Dicelys come and bring

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.750
one of their educational
programs, they're just amazing.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.470
And they help support
many of us who

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:36.110
have cat conservation
programs worldwide.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.680
But I live in an area
where-- Namibia's got

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.260
like 2.2 million people.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.140
And that's not very many
in a very large country.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.360
However, that's why-- we got
lots of thorn bushes-- getting

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.940
to know people when I
come over here from Africa

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.830
is really nice.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.610
And I hope that you'll all
become part of our family

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.060
and let us know who
you are and learn ways

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.490
that you can
actually get involved

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:06.287
in making the world different
and better with cheetahs.

00:54:06.287 --> 00:54:08.328
So, thank you.

00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:11.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.250
