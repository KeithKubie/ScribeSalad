00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.060 align:start position:0%
plot was so simple I just adored it the
only<00:01:27.750><c> part</c><00:01:28.200><c> where</c><00:01:28.290><c> got</c><00:01:28.500><c> a</c><00:01:28.530><c> little</c><00:01:28.710><c> weak</c><00:01:28.799><c> to</c><00:01:28.950><c> me</c>

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 align:start position:0%
only part where got a little weak to me
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410 align:start position:0%
only part where got a little weak to me
was<00:01:29.250><c> the</c><00:01:29.430><c> ending</c><00:01:29.790><c> where</c><00:01:29.939><c> it</c><00:01:30.000><c> feels</c><00:01:30.119><c> like</c><00:01:30.299><c> it</c>

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
was the ending where it feels like it
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.819 align:start position:0%
was the ending where it feels like it
should<00:01:30.600><c> have</c><00:01:30.630><c> end</c><00:01:30.840><c> at</c><00:01:30.960><c> one</c><00:01:31.140><c> part</c><00:01:31.409><c> and</c><00:01:31.560><c> then</c><00:01:31.680><c> it</c>

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 align:start position:0%
should have end at one part and then it
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
should have end at one part and then it
just<00:01:32.040><c> kind</c><00:01:32.670><c> of</c><00:01:32.790><c> keeps</c><00:01:32.970><c> going</c><00:01:33.270><c> and</c><00:01:33.360><c> gets</c><00:01:33.540><c> a</c>

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
just kind of keeps going and gets a
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 align:start position:0%
just kind of keeps going and gets a
little<00:01:33.780><c> lost</c><00:01:33.990><c> but</c><00:01:34.770><c> I</c><00:01:34.950><c> used</c><00:01:35.130><c> really</c><00:01:35.400><c> really</c>

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 align:start position:0%
weak cause it kind of felt like I go
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 align:start position:0%
weak cause it kind of felt like I go
where<00:01:47.040><c> we're</c><00:01:47.610><c> doing</c><00:01:47.880><c> this</c><00:01:47.970><c> again</c><00:01:48.180><c> kind</c><00:01:48.869><c> of</c>

where we're doing this again kind of
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.149 align:start position:0%
where we're doing this again kind of

a surprisingly good follow-up even
 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
a surprisingly good follow-up even
though<00:02:15.689><c> the</c><00:02:15.780><c> story</c><00:02:16.049><c> gets</c><00:02:16.230><c> a</c><00:02:16.319><c> lot</c><00:02:16.470><c> more</c>

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 align:start position:0%
though the story gets a lot more
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
though the story gets a lot more
complicated<00:02:17.040><c> and</c><00:02:17.430><c> the</c><00:02:17.519><c> frizzen</c><00:02:17.790><c> was</c><00:02:17.939><c> so</c>

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 align:start position:0%
complicated and the frizzen was so
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
complicated and the frizzen was so
simple<00:02:18.510><c> so</c><00:02:19.200><c> it</c><00:02:19.260><c> was</c><00:02:19.349><c> very</c><00:02:19.620><c> very</c><00:02:19.739><c> smart</c><00:02:20.129><c> about</c>

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 align:start position:0%
simple so it was very very smart about
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.929 align:start position:0%
simple so it was very very smart about
that<00:02:20.519><c> and</c><00:02:20.819><c> now</c><00:02:21.150><c> we</c><00:02:21.209><c> have</c><00:02:21.480><c> the</c><00:02:21.629><c> third</c><00:02:21.870><c> one</c><00:02:22.939><c> where</c>

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
that and now we have the third one where
 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.429 align:start position:0%
that and now we have the third one where
the<00:02:24.060><c> middle</c><00:02:24.420><c> is</c><00:02:24.569><c> where</c><00:02:24.780><c> it</c><00:02:24.870><c> kind</c><00:02:25.019><c> of</c><00:02:25.140><c> gets</c><00:02:25.349><c> lost</c>

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
the middle is where it kind of gets lost
 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.949 align:start position:0%
the middle is where it kind of gets lost
and<00:02:25.829><c> I</c><00:02:25.890><c> think</c><00:02:26.129><c> that's</c><00:02:26.310><c> so</c><00:02:26.519><c> funny</c>

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 align:start position:0%

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.610 align:start position:0%
and I think that's so funny
it<00:02:28.500><c> starts</c><00:02:28.920><c> off</c><00:02:29.659><c> ridiculously</c><00:02:30.659><c> strong</c><00:02:31.019><c> like</c><00:02:31.470><c> I</c>

it starts off ridiculously strong like I
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 align:start position:0%
it starts off ridiculously strong like I

like I said I mean sometimes it gets a
 

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.649 align:start position:0%
like I said I mean sometimes it gets a
little<00:20:24.159><c> too</c><00:20:24.370><c> lost</c><00:20:24.610><c> in</c><00:20:24.820><c> the</c><00:20:24.909><c> middle</c><00:20:25.149><c> I've</c><00:20:25.450><c> said</c>

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:25.659 align:start position:0%
little too lost in the middle I've said
 

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.549 align:start position:0%
little too lost in the middle I've said
that<00:20:25.779><c> million</c><00:20:25.990><c> times</c><00:20:26.169><c> already</c>

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
that million times already
 

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.370 align:start position:0%
that million times already
so<00:20:27.070><c> I</c><00:20:27.490><c> think</c><00:20:28.120><c> most</c><00:20:28.450><c> people</c><00:20:28.809><c> are</c><00:20:28.899><c> gonna</c><00:20:29.049><c> like</c>

so I think most people are gonna like
 

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I think most people are gonna like
this<00:20:29.679><c> I</c><00:20:29.950><c> think</c><00:20:30.190><c> for</c><00:20:30.460><c> some</c><00:20:30.820><c> it</c><00:20:30.970><c> might</c><00:20:31.090><c> go</c><00:20:31.269><c> too</c>

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.330 align:start position:0%
this I think for some it might go too
 

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.629 align:start position:0%
this I think for some it might go too

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
silly and I get it but I feel like it
 

00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:35.789 align:start position:0%
silly and I get it but I feel like it
really<00:20:33.940><c> does</c><00:20:34.149><c> kind</c><00:20:34.360><c> of</c><00:20:34.630><c> it</c><00:20:35.200><c> has</c><00:20:35.350><c> a</c><00:20:35.380><c> strong</c>

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
