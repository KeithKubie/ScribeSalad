00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.480
I think that the world that matters is

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490
I think that the world that matters is
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.879
I think that the world that matters is
the world that we perceive not the world

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889
the world that we perceive not the world
 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.089
the world that we perceive not the world
that is out there so in many experiments

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099
that is out there so in many experiments
 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.370
that is out there so in many experiments
we show that our expectations about how

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380
we show that our expectations about how
 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.710
we show that our expectations about how
the world should function influences the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720
the world should function influences the
 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.200
the world should function influences the
way we actually experience the world so

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210
way we actually experience the world so
 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.810
way we actually experience the world so
if you go ahead and you buy a cold

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
if you go ahead and you buy a cold
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.510
if you go ahead and you buy a cold
medication on discount you expect it to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520
medication on discount you expect it to
 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.030
medication on discount you expect it to
be worse as a consequence your

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040
be worse as a consequence your
 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.520
be worse as a consequence your
physiology doesn't take it that doesn't

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530
physiology doesn't take it that doesn't
 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.860
physiology doesn't take it that doesn't
kick in as much and you are not helped

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870
kick in as much and you are not helped
 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.350
kick in as much and you are not helped
as much by this cold medication now you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360
as much by this cold medication now you
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.990
as much by this cold medication now you
can say which one is the reality that

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
can say which one is the reality that
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.160
can say which one is the reality that
the cold medication is the same

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170
the cold medication is the same
 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.500
the cold medication is the same
regardless of the price or the reality

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
regardless of the price or the reality
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.209
regardless of the price or the reality
that actually changes your physiology

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219
that actually changes your physiology
 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.860
that actually changes your physiology
and I think it's the one that changes

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870
and I think it's the one that changes
 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.250
and I think it's the one that changes
our physiology maybe the best examples

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
our physiology maybe the best examples
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.739
our physiology maybe the best examples
for this is to think about placebo so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749
for this is to think about placebo so
 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.049
for this is to think about placebo so
placebo is real many people think of it

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059
placebo is real many people think of it
 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.639
placebo is real many people think of it
as just psychology but there's nothing

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649
as just psychology but there's nothing
 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.950
as just psychology but there's nothing
just about it it turns out the data

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960
just about it it turns out the data
 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.750
just about it it turns out the data
physician comes to you and injects you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760
physician comes to you and injects you
 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.160
physician comes to you and injects you
with whatever saline water your body

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
with whatever saline water your body
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.110
with whatever saline water your body
expects pain relief and your body

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120
expects pain relief and your body
 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.090
expects pain relief and your body
secretes substances that are very much

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100
secretes substances that are very much
 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.730
secretes substances that are very much
like morphine so it doesn't matter what

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740
like morphine so it doesn't matter what
 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.950
like morphine so it doesn't matter what
you get from the injection you actually

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960
you get from the injection you actually
 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.130
you get from the injection you actually
get pain relief from your own body as a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140
get pain relief from your own body as a
 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.289
get pain relief from your own body as a
reaction to that now you can't just

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299
reaction to that now you can't just
 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.670
reaction to that now you can't just
close your eyes and say please can I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680
close your eyes and say please can I
 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.920
close your eyes and say please can I
have some painkillers this doesn't work

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930
have some painkillers this doesn't work
 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.539
have some painkillers this doesn't work
but when the physician injects you with

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549
but when the physician injects you with
 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.450
but when the physician injects you with
anything even saline water you get the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460
anything even saline water you get the
 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.219
anything even saline water you get the
pain relief that is actually a substance

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229
pain relief that is actually a substance
 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.690
pain relief that is actually a substance
you can't buy over-the-counter it's like

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700
you can't buy over-the-counter it's like
 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.770
you can't buy over-the-counter it's like
morphine now

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780
morphine now
 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.620
morphine now
what is the reality there is the reality

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630
what is the reality there is the reality
 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.499
what is the reality there is the reality
is the physician injected you with water

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
is the physician injected you with water
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.789
is the physician injected you with water
saline water or is the reality that the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799
saline water or is the reality that the
 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.340
saline water or is the reality that the
physician actually gave you pain relief

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
physician actually gave you pain relief
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.139
physician actually gave you pain relief
from my perspective the important

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149
from my perspective the important
 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.230
from my perspective the important
reality is the reality people experience

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
reality is the reality people experience
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.120
reality is the reality people experience
because that's what we come in contact

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
because that's what we come in contact
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.069
because that's what we come in contact
with that's what we know and that's the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079
with that's what we know and that's the
 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.060
with that's what we know and that's the
reality we make decisions based on
