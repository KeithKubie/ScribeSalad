00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.990
We are told that the
cosine of 58 degrees

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.037
is roughly equal to 0.53.

00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:08.870
And that's roughly equal
to, because it just

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.140
keeps going on and on.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.250
I just rounded it to
the nearest hundredth.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.466
And then we're asked, what
is the sine of 32 degrees?

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.090
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.260
and try it on your own.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.670
And a hint is to look
at this right triangle.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.356
One of the angles is
already labeled 32 degrees.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.730
Figure out what
all of the angles

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.410
are, and then use the
fundamental definitions,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890
your sohcahtoa definitions,
to see if you can figure out

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.930
what sine of 32 degrees is.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.840
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630
Let's work it through now.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.350
So we know that the sum of
the angles of a triangle

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.780
add up to 180.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.000
Now in a right angle, one
of the angles is 90 degrees.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.650
So that means that the
other two must add up to 90.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.450
These two add up to
90 plus another 90

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.130
is going to be 180 degrees.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.460
Or another way to think
about is that the other two

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.920
non-right angles are
going to be complementary.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.724
So what plus 32 is equal to 90?

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:06.490
Well, 90 minus 32 is 58.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.800
So this right over here
is going to be 58 degrees.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.050
Well, why is that interesting?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.870
Well, we already know what
the cosine of 58 degrees

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.966
is equal to.

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.340
But let's think
about it in terms

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.280
of ratios of the lengths of
sides of this right triangle.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.680
Let's just write down sohcahtoa.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.860
Soh, sine, is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.750
Cah, cosine, is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.940
Toa, tangent, is
opposite over adjacent.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.790
So we could write
down the cosine

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.080
of 58 degrees, which
we already know.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.730
If we think about it in terms
of these fundamental ratios,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.930
cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.830
This is a 58 degree angle.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.600
The side that is adjacent
to it is-- let me do it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.177
in this color-- is side
BC right over here.

00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:50.010
It's one of the sides
of the angle, the side

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.676
of the angle that is
not the hypotenuse.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:54.002
The other side, this over
here, is a hypotenuse.

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:55.960
So this is going to be
the adjacent, the length

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.440
of the adjacent side, BC, over
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.139
The length of the
hypotenuse, well, that is AB.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.830
Now let's think about what the
sine of 32 degrees would be.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.740
Well, sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.710
So now we're looking at
this 32 degree angle.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.420
What side is opposite it?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.245
Well, it opens up onto BC.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.220
And what's the length
of the hypotenuse?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.970
It's AB.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.970
Notice, the sine of 32
degrees is BC over AB.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.750
The cosine of 58
degrees is BC over AB.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.740
Or another way of thinking
about it, the sine of this angle

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.050
is the same thing as the
cosine of this angle.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.470
So we could literally
write the sine--

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.310
I want to do that in that pink
color-- the sine of 32 degrees

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.660
is equal to the cosine
of 58 degrees, which

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.810
is roughly equal to 0.53.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.350
And this is a really,
really useful property.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.550
The sine of an angle is equal
to the cosine of its complement.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.080
So we could write
this in general terms.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.120
We could write that
the sine of some angle

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.670
is equal to the cosine
of its complement,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.690
is equal to the cosine
of 90 minus theta.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330
Think about it.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.670
I could change this
entire problem.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.110
Instead of making this
the sine of 32 degrees,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.300
I could make this the
sine of 25 degrees.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.130
And if someone gave you the
cosine of-- what's 90 minus

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.080
25?-- if someone gave you
the cosine of 65 degrees,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.630
then you could think
about this as 25.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.090
The complement is going
to be right over here.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.410
This would be 65 degrees.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.080
And then you could use
the exact same idea.
