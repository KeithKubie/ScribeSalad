00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.659
Mark: My name's Mark Polliger, and I'm glad
to be hosting Professor Robert Mnookin today.

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:04.530
Professor Mnookin is the current Williston
professor of law at Harvard.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.140
I think I got that right.
As well as the chair of a program on negotiation

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.140
there.
Which is dedicated to the study of the theory

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.140
of and the advancement of the practice of
negotiation.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.140
Professor Mnookins latest studies and book
focus on negotiating under the challenging

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.370
condition when you see who you're negotiating
with as an adversary, or even as evil.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.750
To do so requires specific techniques to arrive
at the best outcome while avoiding common

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.750
pitfalls that can sabotage you and the eventual
results.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.151
The book is so new, published two days ago,
that we're among the first to hear about it

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:21.770
right from the source.
And after the talk, we will have some folks

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:33.240
we will have some folks from Books Inc. if
you want to order a copy of it with Google

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:47.100
subsidy and then you'll be able to pick it
up later and tell us more.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.380
Please welcome Professor Robert Mnookin.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.030
[Applause]

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.210
Robert: Thank you very much.
It's exciting to return to Silicon Valley

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.420
and be at Google.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
[Pause]

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.350
And I have the good fortune of being in your
cafeteria.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.790
I did that once before a couple years ago
with the general counsel of your company.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.580
And some other googlers, and it's quite an
experience to look around for the checkout

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.299
counter where you pay,

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.299
[Laughter]

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.100
Robert: and find none.
I'm here to talk about my new book.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.260
And the question I address in the book is,
should I bargain with the Devil?

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:47.700
By bargain, I mean try to resolve a conflict
through negotiation rather than resisting

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.130
or fighting.
And by Devil, I mean an adversary you don't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.409
trust.
A person or organization who you think its

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.590
interests are opposed to your own, who may
be out to harm you.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.660
An adversary you may even think is evil.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.930
[Pause]

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.201
Robert: Now,

00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:28.201
[Pause]

00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:37.120
Robert: You can read in a newspaper everyday
about how relevant this question is.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:46.319
For example right now, our national leaders
are really trying to figure out, should we

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.650
negotiate with the Taliban?
Or should we not?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:02.410
It turns out that in 2001 after 9/11 President
Bush gave Mullah Omar an ultimatum.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:12.950
Turn over Bin Laden and his compatriots and
shut down the training camps, or we're gonna

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.080
invade.
In fact, although this isn't very well known,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.769
Mullah Omar's response at the time was let's
negotiate.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.940
What's your evidence that Bin Laden was responsible
etc.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.700
And President Bush said, "I'm not inviting
an negotiation, I mean this is an ultimatum."

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.870
And he went in.
Today, there's a new question.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.769
Today should we be negotiating with Mullah
Omar who's in Pakistan or not?

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:58.120
Similarly with respect to Iran and North Korea.
There's been lots of discussion on what should

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.610
be the role of engagement and negotiation.
Google itself of course, with respect to the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.920
issues your company faces in China.
Which in some respects in my view, in some

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.479
respects is an evil regime.
Poses analogous questions.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:27.339
Now apart from these issues of high politics,
in business, there are now analogous issues

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:33.650
people often face.
For example, I've mediated a number of failed

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:44.099
joint ventures where a -- there's been a terrible
falling out between joint venture partners.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:50.080
The question is, should you negotiate with
a joint venture partner who betrayed you?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:00.339
If the competitor you believe is stealing
your intellectual property, should you fight,

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:06.680
or should you negotiate?
Indeed, one reason I was interested in writing

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.599
this books is I think there are analogous
problems that arise in families.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:19.759
I've claimed that almost every family at least
if you're willing to go back a couple generations

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:27.529
and perhaps out to cousins.
Every family has a story of a family fight

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.639
over family property.
Sometimes the property is Grandma's engagement

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.490
ring.
Sometime it's a photographic album.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.610
Sometimes it's a family business that has
to be divided up.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.749
But there are any number of families that
 -- curious out of -- raised -- hands raised.

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:50.430
How many of you know a family story where
family members aren't speaking to each other

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.420
anymore because of a fight over family property.
Well it looks like at least 30%, it's very

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:07.469
common.
Well, you have probably heard two arguments,

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.949
two extreme or categorical answers to the
question.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.029
Should you bargain with the devil.
Now in my field, I share the program on negotiation

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.429
at Harvard, and I'm the head of what's called
the Harvard negotiation research project.

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:26.429
In my field, you've heard the categorical
answer.

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:30.449
And that is you should always negotiate.
You should always be prepared to sit down

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.059
in a problem solving way, see if you can work
out some arrangement that's better for you

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:44.009
and for the other side than litigation, much
less war.

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:48.629
It's an appealing argument, and you hear it
all the time.

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:58.629
You also hear the opposite kind of argument.
Less commonly in my zip code 02138 in Cambridge.

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:04.979
But that argument is really based on the fallacy
of legend.

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:11.449
And that is, you should never negotiate with
the devil, the devil's not to be trusted.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:20.429
He may be smarter than you.
He's gonna certainly try to trick you, and

00:07:20.429 --> 00:07:27.439
to negotiate risks soiling your soul, and
selling out principles that you should hold

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:34.469
dear.
It was not so long ago when after 9/11, Vice

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:40.909
President Dick Cheney declared, and I'm quoting,
"I have been charged by the president with

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:46.969
making sure that none of the tyrannies of
the world are negotiated with. We don't negotiate

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:53.459
with evil, we defeat it."
Well there's the two categorical answers.

00:07:53.459 --> 00:08:01.590
Now I have to confess, I'm allergic to categorical
answers.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.409
Because usually you can find a counter example
to embarrass a categorical claim.

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:17.409
And what I want you to think about for a moment,
who are your two greatest political heroes

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:20.249
of the 20th century.
Think about it to yourself.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.249
[Pause]

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:22.800
Robert: 20th century.
I'm an old guy.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800
[Laughter]

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:35.250
This is a new century.
Here are my two greatest heroes, alright.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:45.051
Winston Churchill is my hero because in May
of 1940 in Britain's darkest hour when France

00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:49.340
was on the verge of collapse.
When the United States was uninvolved in the

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:57.110
war, and had not even begun Lend-Lease.
When the soviets had signed a pact with Germany

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:05.370
and were not in the war.
Churchill and his war cabinet faced the question

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:13.600
of whether they should accept an invitation
to have Mussolini mediate a negotiated resolution

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:25.000
of the war between Germany and Great Britain.
There were five days of secret discussions

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.230
in the war cabinet.
The minutes of those meetings are now available.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.471
In his monumental post war -- after the war
history, Churchill wrote a multi-volume history

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.759
about World War II, he doesn't mention this
fact.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:42.920
But in fact they struggled with the question
of whether to negotiate or not.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:49.670
And Churchill, in my view appropriately decided
not to negotiate.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:56.149
Although it turns out it's a very hard question,
and I have a chapter of the book about that.

00:09:56.149 --> 00:10:02.959
My other hero, perhaps my greatest negotiation
hero is Nelson Mandela.

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:11.699
Mandela after being convicted and given a
life sentence for treason in 1985 having been

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:21.600
jailed already for more than 20 years secretly
initiated negotiations with the national party.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.790
The Afrikaner party that had imposed the evil
apartheid regime.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:36.290
I have a chapter about this episode to.
Mandela, although the most famous member of

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:44.519
the ANC was not in fact the head of the ANC.
That was Oliver Tombo who is in exile.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:51.050
Moreover, the ANC in many ways ran on quite
collaborative principles.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:59.649
And Mandela had a number of long time compatriots
jailed with him in the same prison.

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:09.329
In his memoir, Mandela struggled with the
question should I initiate negotiations given

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:16.139
the ANC's policy was against any form of negotiation
with the hated enemy.

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:24.290
And should I do so without consulting first
the ANC leadership or at least my compatriots

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.279
here.
He was able to smuggle information --things

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:30.819
in and out to Tombo, but it sometimes took
weeks.

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:38.470
And he candidly writes, "I decided it was
time to initiate negotiations, and I did so

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:46.370
without asking anyone. Why didn't I ask? Because
I knew what their answer would be. That is

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:51.550
I shouldn't negotiate."
So here you have my two great heroes.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:58.450
One a hero because he refused to negotiate,
another a hero because he secretly initiated

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:05.540
negotiations.
And I ended up having thought about it, deciding

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.580
that the challenge of course is how do you
make wise decisions about whether to negotiate

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.630
or not if there aren't categorical answers
one way or the other.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.350
And, the challenge I think is to make wise
decisions.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:27.920
And what my book tries to do is offer a framework
for how to think through contextually in a

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.610
particular set of circumstances what a wise
decision would be.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.410
And I do this though stories, eight real life
stories.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:42.080
Two of them I've already mentioned, I'll briefly
mention some of the others a tad later in

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.850
my talk.
Because I think there's much to be learned

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:55.129
by assessing what others have done.
And trying to -- I asked myself if I applied

00:12:55.129 --> 00:13:06.930
my framework, would I agree or disagree with
the particular decision?

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.610
[Pause]

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:23.730
Robert: Let me describe briefly one case that
is similar to a case I discuss in the book.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:33.800
And that is, assume you are the C.E.O and
founder of a high-tech start up that's been

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.080
venture financed.
You're a research and development firm, you

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.630
don't manufacture devices yourself, you in
fact license it out.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:51.600
Assume that you made a -- have a partner which
is the, I've changed the names needless to

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:59.639
say, the giant Bikouda Corporation.
A very large Japanese company that has licensed

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:09.149
your technology and know-how and has the right
to manufacture and distribute your medical

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:12.769
device.
But it promises that it won't distribute any

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:18.790
competing devices.
And you've given them a license for major

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:26.560
segments of the world, but not China.
You excluded China specifically.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:34.319
You just discovered three years into a five
year joint venture agreement that secretly

00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:39.449
the Bikouda Corporation has manufactured a
knock-off.

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:44.410
Slightly different, but not significantly
in your eyes at all.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:51.130
A knock off of your product which it's selling
in China.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:15:00.749
You confronted the head of the Bikouda Corporation
with your discovery, and he says -- he denies

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:04.800
that the product is violating any of your
rights.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.850
And he says, besides you don't really understand
the Chinese market.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:16.129
And by the way, your 15% royalty rate for
the rest of the world is too high, let's negotiate.

00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:22.820
Maybe we'll negotiate a new agreement, maybe
we'll include China, but it's gotta be everything

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.860
at a much lower royalty rate.
What do you do?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.720
Now in the kinds of conflicts I'm describing,
whether international or family or business,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:40.399
emotions run high.
You are furious.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.990
You feel treated -- you feel cheated rather.
You feel betrayed.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:49.230
You're probably a little angry for yourself
for being so trusting.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:57.689
The notion of negotiating turns your stomach.
You wanna fight.

00:15:57.689 --> 00:16:01.820
How do you decide?
How do you make a wise decision?

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:09.149
Well luckily, there's someone who can help
you.

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:17.800
He's a Vulcan, his name is Mr.Spock.
Mr.Spock is logical, he's very analytical

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:25.369
and he has complete emotional detachment.
Indeed your spouse says he's a cold fish.

00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:36.740
But he's prepared to advice you.
And in fact, in my book Mr.Spock suggests

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:46.279
some questions that you should ask yourself.
First he says you've gotta think hard about

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:50.889
what your underlying interests are, and what
the other side's interests are.

00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:59.050
Second, very importantly, if you don't negotiate,
what are your alternatives away from the table?

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.119
Here perhaps you could sue.
Where are you gonna sue?

00:17:02.119 --> 00:17:12.429
What is the probability of success?
Third, are there potential negotiated outcomes

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:19.130
that can better serve your interests than
your best alternative away from the table?

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.689
And also better serve the interests of your
adversary.

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:29.070
Because if you can't imagine any negotiated
outcomes that better serve the interests of

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.279
both sides, there's no reason to expect that
there's a very high probability you're gonna

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:43.289
be able to achieve a negotiated agreement.
Next, if you reach an agreement, assuming

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:47.380
you can imagine such an agreement, can it
be implemented?

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.909
Will it be enforceable?
Obviously the devil is someone you don't particularly

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:58.140
trust.
And finally, what are the costs of negotiation?

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.590
Negotiation itself isn't costless.
It may set a precedent, it may have reputational

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.240
consequences.
You've got to think about all these things.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:15.260
Now, in this particular case, it turns out
you're legal alternative is not very good.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.309
Suing in China would be impossible.
Suing in Japan, which is a possibility, is

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:26.120
very time consuming and slow.
And it's almost inconceivable that a Japanese

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:33.010
court would enjoin a Japanese company from
doing business in China.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:38.440
The problem Spock points out, and your lawyer
has told you as much is it's not clear you

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:44.070
can get jurisdiction over the Bikouda Corporation
in California because they've never really

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.870
operated here very well.
You might, but you might not.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.760
Spock thinks there's a 20% chance.
So what does Spock advise?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:19:01.190
Spock advises you should contact your adversary,
you should indicate a willingness to negotiate.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:08.160
But you should also indicate that if negotiations
don't work, or if -- you are gonna sue in

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.490
California.
And you should indicate to Bikouda Corporation

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:18.071
that its reputation in Silicon Valley -- because
you've heard via the grapevine that they are

00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:23.250
interested in other joint ventures in the
United States.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.640
Their reputation would plainly be damaged
by the mere fact of the lawsuit, and that's

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:37.050
something they'd want to take into account.
Now, what I talk about in the book are a series

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:44.630
of psychological traps that make it difficult
to think rationally about whether to negotiate

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:49.870
or to fight.
And let me just very briefly list some of

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:56.539
them and say a word about each.
One is demonization.

00:19:56.539 --> 00:20:01.840
These traps are often present when people
are in intense conflict.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.770
Demonization really is the notion the other
side's evil.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.600
They're a bad person.
You're making judgments about their overall

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.870
character.
A second trap is tribalism.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:20.880
It's our team against their team.
We're the insiders, they're the outsiders.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.039
You don't usually trust the other side very
much.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:31.820
Dehumanization, in the worst kinds of conflicts,
people don't even see their adversary as human.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:38.529
Moralism, goodness and right is entirely on
my side.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:44.049
I'm right, they're wrong, no grey.
The zero-sum fallacy is something that I talk

00:20:44.049 --> 00:20:48.940
about all the time in negotiation.
Zero-sum fallacy is when I'm in conflict with

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:54.460
you, what I think is anything you win, I lose,
anything I win you lose.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:00.610
You talk about zero-sum poc --mentality, the
zero-sum gremlin shrieking in people ears.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:06.220
Look at what's going on in the United States
congress today between the Democrats and the

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.419
Republicans.
It's, it's it's as if anything that could

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:13.880
possibly benefit one party has to be bad for
the other party.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.570
It's zero-sum.
The fight-flight fallacy, you know what that

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.500
is.
The call to battle is when the leader says

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.620
follow me, we're gonna charge ahead.
Now all of these things in my mind can really

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.250
get in the way of thinking clearly.
Apart from these traps though, I also want

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.570
to acknowledge what makes these kinds of cases
very difficult.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.710
And that is there are considerations of legitimacy,
morality, identity and self respect.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:54.429
It's quite possible that the C.E.O once he
calms down and really understood the opportunities

00:21:54.429 --> 00:22:01.559
and risks of refusing to negotiate rather
than following Spock's strategy.

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:10.440
It's possible that the C.E.O could say, "Spock,
I understand what you're saying, but to negotiate

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.669
with this company after what they've done.
I'm not worried about my reputation with other

00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:21.070
people, it's my reputation with myself.
It's inconsistent with the kind of person

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:26.340
I wanna be."
And often in terms of these issues, bargaining

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:34.610
with the devil, there is this problem.
And that is it really goes to a deep philosophical

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.840
question.
Are you prepared to be utilitarian and a consequencialist

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.309
that's gonna decide what to do by comparing
outcomes?

00:22:41.309 --> 00:22:48.890
Or are there some values that you feel are
so important that you're willing to pay the

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:54.360
cost and take the risks?
Let me just say a word about the -- some of

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.679
the other chapters in the book, and then I'd
like to take some questions.

00:22:56.679 --> 00:23:06.600
Rudolf Kastner was someone who decided to
negotiate with Adolf Eichmann in 1944.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.760
Talk about bargaining with the devil.
Kastner wanted to do so in order to try to

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.750
save some Hungarian Jews.
He in fact succeeded through bribery in saving

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.799
1700 who were put on a train and ended up
going to Switzerland.

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:30.940
Tragically after the way he ended up going
to Israel, he was accused of collaboration.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:37.970
There was a libel trial in which a trial court
judge wrote an awful opinion condemning him

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.820
for having sold his soul to the devil.
For having negotiated with Eichmann.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.860
And having his own family members were among
the 1700 that made it on the train.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:57.539
That decision was ultimately reversed by the
Israeli Supreme Court, but not before a right-wing

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:02.289
Israeli extremist assassinated him.
Very tragic story.

00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:07.039
Another chapter is about someone else who
confronted an evil regime.

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:11.740
Natan Sharansky, he was a Refusenik in the
Soviet Union.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:17.130
He refused to cooperate at all with the KGB.
The KGB signaled to him while he was in prison,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:25.350
look, if you will denounce your cause, we'll
let you go, we'll let you emigrate to Israel

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.720
to join your wife.
And we know very well, I mean they were winking,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.110
we know that once you get there, you'll say
that we coerced you, we understand that.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:39.970
But what we want you to do is just sign here,
renouncing you cause.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:44.880
He wouldn't do it.
And indeed when he was released finally in

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:51.690
a -- United States swapped a Soviet spy for
Sharansky some years after he'd been in jail

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:57.470
about 12 years.
The soviet agent that took him to East Berlin

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:03.410
where he was gonna be freed.
When they landed in Berlin said to him, "There's

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:09.659
a car waiting for you over there, you must
walk in a straight line between the plane

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:14.860
and the car."
And Sharansky said to this guy, "For 12 years,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.830
I haven't done anything you've asked my to
do, why do you think I'll start now?"

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.660
And he walked in a crooked line.
[Laughter]

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:28.289
Robert: And, and, and got in the car.
I was the neutral in a huge dispute in the

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:33.799
late 80's between IBM and Fujitsu.
A chapter of the book is about that.

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:40.190
IBM believed that Fujitsu had stolen its operating
system.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:48.620
And at the time, with its operating system,
Fujitsu had displaced within Japan IBM as

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:55.860
the top mainframe -- computer manufacturer.
This was in the age of the mainframe.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:02.010
I had an extraordinarily interesting experience.
There was -- I assure you, much demonization

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.510
on both sides.
And I tell the story of this case.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.500
I also did some work with the San Francisco
Symphony about a decade ago.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.100
They had a catastrophic strike.
And someone from the Hewlett foundation called

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.071
me when I was on vacation, said, "Mnookin,
you gotta come here -- out here and teach

00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:23.330
these people how to negotiate."
And there's nothing like being interviewed

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.790
for a job you don't think you want, but I
ended up doing it.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.880
It was an extraordinarily interesting experience.
In fact I'm talking at the Commonwealth Club

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:36.330
on Friday, and some musicians and the people
I've worked with, some of them are gonna be

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.480
there.
It's a story with a reasonably happy ending.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:47.510
I tell a story which doesn't have a very happy
ending about a terrible divorce where there

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:53.470
wasn't any negotiation.
And great damage to a child, to two children

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:59.169
caught in the middle.
And finally I tell a story -- another case

00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:07.240
I was actually involved in involving a fight
over a beautiful Cape Cod waterfront property

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.610
that had been in the family for fifty or sixty
years.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:15.130
It was inherited as tenants-in-common by three
siblings.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:22.190
One of whom lived in the Bay area and wasn't
interested in -- just wanted to sell.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.190
Another of the siblings thought this house
was their family, and was sort of profoundly

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:32.440
offended that she might try to force a sale.
Let me close by simply repeating my question,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.200
should you bargain with the devil?
My answer is, not always.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.630
But more often than you feel like.
More often than you feel like, and for two

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.779
different sorts of reasons.
First, because of these emotional and psychological

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:52.010
traps that can make it very painful.
And second, because in bargaining with the

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:59.779
devil, you often need to reach an agreement
that benefits the devil also.

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:06.409
And, which may involve in your mind the sacrifice
of principle on the altar of pragmatism.

00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:13.470
That never feels too good.
Thank you very much, I'd be glad to take some

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.470
questions.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.470
[Applause]

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.789
Mark: So thank you very much, very very good
talk.

00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:22.809
There's a microphone over here.
People do have questions.

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:27.419
We are gonna be putting this up on YouTube.
So please use the mic and if you have questions

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:29.700
that we make sure that we get it recorded.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.139
[Pause]

00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:42.210
&lt;&lt; Hi, thanks for the talk.
There seems -- you've got a -- what seems

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:48.080
to be a dichotomy between either negotiation
vs. fight as you framed it.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.799
Can you speak at all to tactics which are
used to build political power first as preludes,

00:28:54.799 --> 00:29:00.210
potentially, preludes lasting years to build
up sufficient power to actually get to the

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.720
negotiating table.
I mean many of the great stories of non-violent

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.509
resistance are about that.
Where you don't start with negotiation, you

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:09.200
start with things that look like non-violent
fighting.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.460
But then ten, twenty years later it becomes
a negotiation where you get what you want.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.950
Robert: I think that's a terrific point, and
I agree with you entirely.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:26.529
Although the subtitle of the book suggests
a dichotomy, in fact, the most famous article

00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:30.940
I've ever written is called bargaining in
the shadow of the law.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:36.940
Most legal conflicts are resolved through
negotiation.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.539
But it's in the shadow of what people think
a court might do.

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:53.000
And often, often what you want to do is persuade
the person on the other side that you are

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.240
prepared to pursue alternatives that may be
coercive as part of a negotiation strategy.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.220
And, so I entirely agree.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.419
&gt;&gt;What do you think about the case for Libya?
There was a period of time where there was

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:14.450
no negotiation, and there was a period of
time there was negotiation.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.590
Do you think that eventually negotiation was
the right thing to do with Libya?

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:32.821
Robert: Absolutely, in fact Libya is quite
an extraordinary example of the use of coercive

00:30:32.821 --> 00:30:43.480
diplomacy in terms of trying to isolate Libya,
in terms of putting economic pressure on Gaddafi.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:53.029
Ultimately, led to the opportunity to negotiate
with Libya.

00:30:53.029 --> 00:31:00.870
A deal where they gave up all their aspirations
to having nuclear weapons.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:09.610
And I think it was a great triumph of diplomacy.
And it illustrates the point that came up

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:17.059
before.
Often what you wanna do is employ a strategy

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:24.090
which is by some measures coercive, but also
being willing to engage.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:30.850
I mean that is in fact I think what President
Obama is trying to do with Iran now in terms

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:38.480
of having more onerous economic sanctions
if in fact they aren't prepared to negotiate.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:45.019
I must confess, I'm not terribly optimistic,
but it's certainly a mixed strategy that seems

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:52.059
appropriate given -- given the absence in
that case of a very good military alternative.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:32:00.240
&gt;&gt;Yeah, could you speak a little bit to the
use of negotiation basically to achieve two

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.610
ends?
One is a delaying tactic in order to wait

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.649
for something else you were doing to sort
of insulate you against your opponent.

00:32:04.649 --> 00:32:17.530
And the other is, as a tactic to divide your
opponent, if it's a group or a corporation

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.130
where by simply offering the alternative to
negotiate, you, you can split them into two

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:25.450
camps and prevent them from being successful
really at either one.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:30.470
It seems to be a lot of time negotiations
some of these very tense situations falls

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:37.290
into that realm of strategy sometimes.
And if you could just speak on that a little

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.290
bit.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:43.779
Robert: That's a great point, and I think
often two things.

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:53.470
First, parties sometimes use negotiation not
with the purpose of trying to reach a deal

00:32:53.470 --> 00:33:01.220
at all, but as a way to play for time.
I think when the history of our negotiations

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:09.141
with, with Iran is written, they have brilliantly
resisted negotiations, and then when things

00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:14.649
get a little tighter, offer a little something
more and the Europeans get very tempted and

00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:18.120
wanna do it.
You know, in terms of trying to divide our

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:22.440
coalition right, and yet nothing much comes
of it.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.200
And in the meantime, if ones cynical, you
could say they're playing for time.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.420
They're really not interested in negotiating
an arrangement where they're gonna give up

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.269
the possibility of nuclear weapons.
Your other point is a very important point,

00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:39.100
and it relates to a couple of the chapters
in the book.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:48.809
And that is some of the most intense conflicts
are not across the table, but behind the table

00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:55.039
within an organization, within a government.
People who were involved in arms control negotiations

00:33:55.039 --> 00:34:02.590
during the Soviet era said negotiating with
the Soviets was patty-cake compared to the

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.010
negotiations between the Defense Department,
that State Department, the CIA, the National

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:14.580
Defense Agency, the various government groups
that were trying to establish what the American

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:20.640
negotiation posture should be.
And you're quite right that often a shrewd

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:27.940
negotiator can try to make offers that will
divide the adversary.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.650
Let me give an example, it's one that --
Richard Bernstein today in the International

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.800
Herald Tribune, it's on the New York Times
website wrote an article that I was thrilled

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.490
with about my book.
Where he talks about negotiating with the

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:45.670
Taliban.
And he interviewed me.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:50.820
And, I differentiate between three different
sorts of Taliban.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.860
The Taliban are not an undifferentiated mass
where it's a tightly controlled group.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:02.330
They're no longer in control of the government.
Some are what I call the ten dollar Taliban.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:07.670
The ten dollar Taliban are those that if we
were to offer them twelve dollars might be

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.450
prepared to switch sides and lay down their
arms.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:15.350
By all means we should try to do that if we
can, in my view.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:21.910
Another group are regional leaders who may
not be ideologically committed to a fundamentalist

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:30.490
 -- the imposition of an extreme form of Islam,
but who were very distressed by the corruption

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.590
in the current national government and want
various local reforms.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.300
By all means I think we should negotiate with
these sorts as well.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:44.630
But I don't think for example that it makes
a lot of sense to attempt to negotiate with

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:51.860
Mullah Omar and the top Taliban leadership.
Because I can imagine a deal, but I think

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:58.780
that deal would involve a form of power sharing
where there -- they may well regain complete

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.160
national control.
And in all events, in certain regions, it

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.790
is my belief they'd wanna shut down schools
for girls.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:11.120
And make life -- and I assure you, there wouldn't
be many Google searches going on.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.900
I mean the cosmopolitans in that segment of
Afghanistan would have a very hard time.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.030
I don't think that's worthy of us to do at
least.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.290
It's one thing if ultimately the Afghan government
wants to do it.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:33.450
So, I offer that as you know -- I think that
when you -- looking at the other side often

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:38.360
there are divisions that you really want to
take into account in terms of figuring out

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.820
a reasonable strategy.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:48.100
&gt;&gt;So, one of the things that is frequently
used rhetorically when discussing whether

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.690
or not to negotiate is the phrase madman.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.050
Robert: Yeah

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:59.510
&gt;&gt; And it comes up in personal negotiations
as well, which is that at some point you have

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:04.810
to make the call that the person who you're
negotiating with, or the group you're negotiating

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:13.900
with is not even capable in, of acting in
what you would consider to be their self interest.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:22.770
Either they're some sort of religious extremist
who's willing to blow themselves up, or they're

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:29.170
committed to something that makes it impossible
to negotiate with them.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:39.840
How do you judge whether or not you should
negotiate or not negotiate based on whether

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.100
the person is crazy?

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:48.960
Robert: Two observations.
First, in the book, I end up concluding that

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:56.090
there should a presumption in favor of negotiation.
What negotiation involves is trying to persuade

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:04.050
someone else to make a deal that serves your
interests you hope very well.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:10.080
And it will serve their interests better than
their alternative.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:18.400
If you haven't tried to persuade, it's hard
to know whether they are susceptible to persuasion.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:24.700
Okay.
And so I don't want to claim that any of us

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:32.360
all the time are Mr.Spock-like.And that intuition
and emotion make no difference, they do.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:39.600
Indeed there are all these traps.
But on the other hand, I think people often

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.880
can be persuaded.
And can be, through a process -- think more

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.160
deeply about what's in their own long-run
interests.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:56.210
And I think that opportunity should often,
as I say, should you bargain with the devil?

00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:00.870
Not always, but more often than you feel like
it, because I think often in fact people can

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.330
be persuaded.
Where you might just assume they're crazy,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.250
and they won't be.
That's the first point.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:10.250
Second point.
Obviously there are some people who really

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:14.170
are a little crazy.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:18.000
And whatever that might mean in different
context.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.150
Third, and this is sort of a Thomas Schelling
game theoretical point.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:30.090
As you know in terms of bargaining, to appear
to be crazy is often quite rational.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:35.620
Because it may persuade you that they really
will blow themselves up and everybody else

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:46.700
up if I don't give them six dollars more.
Then if this deal isn't 68/32 rather than

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.930
60/40.
What do you think, someone would have to be

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:56.010
crazy to blow the deal up over that difference.
But in fact, if someone can persuade you that

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.190
they're crazy enough to do that through some
kind of commitment strategy prepare to do

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:04.210
it, that can in fact be rational.
That's what makes negotiation very interesting

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:08.280
in a way.
Right I mean you never quite know.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.310
And in many negotiations with respect to distributive
aspects of bargaining, you know people end

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.150
up playing some kind of game of chicken which
is a very dangerous game to play.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:24.200
Because like the old movie "Rebel Without
A Cause" sometime there's gonna be a crack-up.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:29.130
You know, and somebody's gonna die, maybe
both sides will.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:39.270
In teaching negotiation, I don't encourage
people to play chicken.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:56.570
&gt;&gt;What do you think of the Nixon-Kissinger
strategy of negotiation?

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.570
Robert: You've gotta be more concrete.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.570
&gt;&gt; Well you were speaking of bad men things
and press the button way of negotiation.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.570
[Pause]

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.570
Robert: I, you may know something I don't
know.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.180
But I'm not aware of when Kissinger threatened
to

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.110
&gt;&gt;For example the Christmas bombing over North
Vietnam.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.030
The bombing of the harbor near

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:12.030
Robert: Yes

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.630
&gt;&gt;Near Hanoi right as negotiations were taking
place.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.260
Robert: Right
Now look, I -- tactically I think there probably

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:28.890
were lots of mistakes made, but-- what--
Often what parties are doing is taking coercive

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.180
actions at the same time.
What they want to encourage is some kind of

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.740
negotiated agreement.
I think that probably was an example.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.720
It often doesn't work, in fact it sometimes
just stiffens the resistance of the other

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.150
side and makes them less willing to talk.
But, that's what's going on.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:53.070
And in fact, you see companies doing similar
things where they take very aggressive legal

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:58.010
action.
But at the same time signal the they're willing

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.190
to talk.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:07.040
&gt;&gt;So you covered negotiations that span nearly
a century today with specific cases.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:13.240
Human nature really hasn't changed that much
yet you're making your life study of negotiation.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.550
Things have changed speed of information is
much faster than it was.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.950
But I mean what really is changing in sort
of the field.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.440
I know it's a little bit more open question.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:30.610
Robert: Well, I, I think that's a great question.
You know, on the one hand, the flow of information,

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:36.450
in part because of what all of you are doing
is fantastic.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:45.620
I mean, at dinner parties, I can use -- ask
Google what year Italy was unified when someone

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.460
was claiming it was 1880 and I thought it
was a little earlier.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.230
And get the answer boom right away.
It's unbelievable, it's fantastic.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:02.140
And you would think that that ought to -- I
think it does make the world better.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.580
On the other hand, I think human conflict
is inevitable.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:12.040
And the challenge is not to eliminate conflict,
because conflict can in fact be constructive.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.300
It's to eliminate the most destructive forms
of conflict to the extent you can.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:24.120
And in that regard, what I love about this
field is it's very interdisciplinary.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:31.570
And human beings are very complicated creatures.
And we all have real capacity for being rational

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:38.320
and analytic on the one hand.
On the other hand, we all are also in terms

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:46.260
of decision making often driven by emotions
in ways that sometimes can lead us astray

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.470
pretty badly.
And I think in these most intense kinds of

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:54.460
conflicts, that's the case.
I don't think that's gonna change.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:44:04.310
I think that we're in fact hard-wired I believe
to have one part of a brain that is very good

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:12.030
at rational analysis but is slow and ponderous.
But we have another part of our brain that's

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:18.820
very quick, very intuitive.
It will invoke early experiences, stories

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:23.370
we've been told, all kinds of stuff that we
may not even be conscious of.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:31.870
And I think that too, can affect behavior.
So that's what makes this an interesting field.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.380
[Pause]

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:41.200
&gt;&gt;Do you think by being willing to negotiate
and openly saying that you're willing to negotiate

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.190
you lose your ability to actually negotiate?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.680
Robert: You lose the ability to negotiate?

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.100
&gt;&gt;Do you, you become weaker in your position?

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:57.420
Robert: you know, I, I, I guess one message
of the book is everything is contextual.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.610
And what you have to do is think through these
series of questions.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:10.190
And what their implications are in a particular
context.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:14.510
For example, there are certainly situations
where I think a company would be foolish to

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.741
negotiate.
I mean for exa -- I'll give you an example

00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:22.340
that comes up.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.690
Someone illegally takes your property, you
know you can win the lawsuit.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:34.260
You sue them, but it's gonna cost you $100,000
to pursue the litigation.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.540
And they say, "Let's negotiate."
You know, the lawyer says, "Give me ten grand

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:47.400
and I'll resolve it."
Now, in the short run, settling for ten thousand

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.260
seems a lot better than spending a hundred
thousand and winning the lawsuit.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.580
But on the other hand, if in fact your feeling
is there are hundreds of other people that

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:03.840
if they figure they can get a quick ten thousand
dollars by doing this will do it.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.320
And the precedent may matter to you, and having
a reputation that you won't tolerate it can

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.050
make perfectly good sense.
So that's an example where you might be a

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:18.880
little tempted, but the problem is you may
be setting a precedent that in fact in the

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.170
long run isn't good for you.
And in that instance, if I were asked to advise

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:32.350
the company, I would say, "You shouldn't settle.
You should fight."

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.970
Well, thank you very much, it's been a great
pleasure to be here.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:35.180
[Applause]
