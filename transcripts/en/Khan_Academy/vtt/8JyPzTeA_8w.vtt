00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.290
Write 7/4 as a mixed number.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.210
So right now it's an
improper fraction.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.580
7 is larger than 4.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.160
Let's write it is
a mixed number.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.110
So first I'm just going
to show you a fairly

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.510
straightforward way of doing
it and then we're going to

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.830
think a little bit about
what it actually means.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.210
So to figure out what 7/4
represents as a mixed number,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.560
let me write it in
different colors.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.045
So this is going to be equal
to-- the easiest way I do it

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.540
is you say, well, you
divide 4 it 7.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.910
If we're dealing with fourths,
4 goes into 7 a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.240
total of one time.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.620
Let me do this in
another color.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.220
1 times 4 is 4.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.600
And then what is
our remainder?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.160
7 minus 4 is 3.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.680
So if we wanted to write this
in plain-- well, let me just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.150
do the problem, and then
we'll think about what

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.460
it means in a second.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.019
So you see that 4 goes into 7
one time, so you have one

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.200
whole here, and then how much
do you have left over?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.810
Well, you have 3 left
over, and that comes

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.700
from right over there.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.630
That is the remainder when
you divide 4 into 7.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.000
3 left over, but it's 3 of
your 4, or 3/4 left over.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.880
So that's the way we just
converted it from an improper

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.200
fraction to a mixed number.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.650
Now, it might seem
a little bit like

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.190
voodoo what I just did.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.780
I divided 4 into 7, it goes
one time, and then the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.530
remainder is 3, so
I got 1 and 3/4.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.480
But why does that make sense?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.480
Why does that actually
makes sense?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.230
So let's draw fourths.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:53.540
Let's draw literally 7 fourths
and maybe it'll become clear.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.460
So let's do a little
square as a fourth.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.750
So let's say I have a square
like that, and that is 1/4.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.170
Now, let's think about what
seven of those mean, so let me

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.410
copy and paste that.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.500
Copy and then paste it.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.510
So here I have 2 one-fourths,
or you could see I have 2/4.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.740
Now I have 3 one-fourths.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.950
Now, I have 4 one-fourths.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.430
Now this is a whole, right?

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.800
I have 4 one-fourths.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.310
This is a whole.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.910
So let me start on
another whole.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.500
So now I have 5.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.890
Now I have 6 one-fourths, and
now I have 7 one-fourths.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410
Now, what does this look like?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.490
So all I did is I rewrote
7/4, or 7 one-fourths.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.630
I just kind of drew
it for you.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.350
Now, what does this represent?

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.110
Well, I have 4 fourths
here, so this is 4/4.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.750
This right here is 3/4.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.980
Notice, 7/4 is 4/4 with
3/4 left over.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.110
So let me write it this way.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.330
7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.580
Now what is 4/4?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.320
4/4 is one whole.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.970
So you have one whole with
3/4 left over, so you end

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.400
up with 1 and 3/4.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.470
So that is the 3/4 part and
that is your one whole.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.590
Hopefully that makes sense and
hopefully you understand why

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.440
it connects.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.760
Because you say, well, how
many wholes do you have?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.100
When you're dividing the 4 into
the 7 and getting the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.550
one, you're essentially saying
how many wholes?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.070
So the number of wholes, or you
can imagine, the number of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.190
whole pies.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.680
And then how many pieces
do we have left over?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.770
Well, we have 3 pieces and each
piece is 1/4, so we have

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.430
3/4 left over.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.080
So we have one whole pie and
three pieces, which are each a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.200
fourth left over.
