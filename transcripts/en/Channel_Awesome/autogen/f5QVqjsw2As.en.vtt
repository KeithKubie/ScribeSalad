01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:47.290
Jedi most of the changes are good too
but there's still a couple of things

01:48:47.290 --> 01:48:47.300
but there's still a couple of things
 

01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:49.120

goes from this muddy dark dirty plays to
this big musical number and there's a

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:56.090
this big musical number and there's a
 

01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:58.840
this big musical number and there's a
lot of moving and dancing and it's just

01:48:58.840 --> 01:48:58.850
lot of moving and dancing and it's just
 

01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:01.000
lot of moving and dancing and it's just
a little too childish for me on top of

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:01.010
a little too childish for me on top of
 

01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:02.680
a little too childish for me on top of
the fact that again the CG monsters

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:02.690
the fact that again the CG monsters
 

01:49:02.690 --> 01:49:04.300
the fact that again the CG monsters
never really look like they're there but

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:04.310
never really look like they're there but
 

01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:06.310
never really look like they're there but
whatever again it's neat to kind of see

01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320
whatever again it's neat to kind of see
 

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.110
whatever again it's neat to kind of see
a new point of view we also see a plan

01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:08.120
a new point of view we also see a plan
 

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.850
a new point of view we also see a plan
at the end that we never saw in any of

01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:09.860
at the end that we never saw in any of
 

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.350
at the end that we never saw in any of
the other versions but would later be in

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360
the other versions but would later be in
 

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.090

that's entirely a city you see it here

01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:15.260
that's entirely a city you see it here
 

01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.900
that's entirely a city you see it here
and on top of that if you look closely

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:16.910
and on top of that if you look closely
 

01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:18.730
and on top of that if you look closely
you see a statue of the Emperor falling

01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:18.740
you see a statue of the Emperor falling
 

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:20.080
you see a statue of the Emperor falling
over that's actually a nice little

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:20.090
over that's actually a nice little
 

01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:21.940
over that's actually a nice little
detail so when they first came out I

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:21.950
detail so when they first came out I
 

01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:23.680
detail so when they first came out I
didn't mind the special editions and I

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:23.690
didn't mind the special editions and I
 

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:25.810
didn't mind the special editions and I
still don't it's neat to see a brand new

01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:25.820
still don't it's neat to see a brand new
 

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.730
still don't it's neat to see a brand new
angle on a lot of this and it's cool

01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:27.740
angle on a lot of this and it's cool

then artists gets to go back revisit his

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:29.870
then artists gets to go back revisit his
 

01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:31.120
then artists gets to go back revisit his
work and touch it up a bit

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:31.130
work and touch it up a bit
 

01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:33.220
work and touch it up a bit
honestly I'm not even against the idea

01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:33.230
honestly I'm not even against the idea
 

01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:35.080
honestly I'm not even against the idea
of constantly going back and changing

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:35.090
of constantly going back and changing
 

01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:37.090
of constantly going back and changing
things up yeah it's a little weird you

01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:37.100
things up yeah it's a little weird you
 

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.590
things up yeah it's a little weird you
should probably leave good enough alone

01:49:38.590 --> 01:49:38.600
should probably leave good enough alone
 

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:41.350
should probably leave good enough alone
but at the same time effects do keep

01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360
but at the same time effects do keep
 

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.390
but at the same time effects do keep
changing and they do keep updating I

01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400
changing and they do keep updating I
 

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.830
changing and they do keep updating I
can't like the idea of comparing

01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840
can't like the idea of comparing
 

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.510
can't like the idea of comparing
different special editions and seeing

01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:46.520

which effects hold up better how far

01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:48.500
which effects hold up better how far
 

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.350
which effects hold up better how far
we're coming or how backwards weren't

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360
we're coming or how backwards weren't
 

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.240
we're coming or how backwards weren't
going some of these CG effects look so

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:52.250
going some of these CG effects look so
 

01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:53.590
going some of these CG effects look so
much better but then some of the

01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:53.600
much better but then some of the
 

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.360
much better but then some of the
practical effects looked a lot better I

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:55.370
practical effects looked a lot better I
 

01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:56.620
practical effects looked a lot better I

kind of like comparing and contrasting
 

01:49:56.630 --> 01:49:59.050
kind of like comparing and contrasting
so the idea of constantly going in and

01:49:59.050 --> 01:49:59.060
so the idea of constantly going in and
 

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.630
so the idea of constantly going in and
updating it I don't mind what I do mind

01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:01.640
updating it I don't mind what I do mind
 

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.240
updating it I don't mind what I do mind
is that we can't see the original that's

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:04.250
is that we can't see the original that's
 

01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:05.560
is that we can't see the original that's
where I think people can get

legitimately upset we should be allowed
 

01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:09.850
legitimately upset we should be allowed
to compare and contrast why are we just

01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:09.860
to compare and contrast why are we just
 

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:12.400

with the first one that's to say I don't

02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:29.570
with the first one that's to say I don't
 

02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:31.450

the only thing I can gather is that the

02:00:37.479 --> 02:00:37.489
the only thing I can gather is that the
 

02:00:37.489 --> 02:00:38.979
the only thing I can gather is that the
first film while it did have more

02:00:38.979 --> 02:00:38.989
first film while it did have more
 

02:00:38.989 --> 02:00:41.860
first film while it did have more
problems took more risks the emotional

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:41.870
problems took more risks the emotional
 

02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:43.479
problems took more risks the emotional
moments in the first one could have very

02:00:43.479 --> 02:00:43.489
moments in the first one could have very
 

02:00:43.489 --> 02:00:46.479
moments in the first one could have very
easily bombed or been awkward or just

02:00:46.479 --> 02:00:46.489
easily bombed or been awkward or just
 

02:00:46.489 --> 02:00:48.220
easily bombed or been awkward or just
didn't pay off which would have caused

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:48.230
didn't pay off which would have caused
 

02:00:48.230 --> 02:00:50.350
didn't pay off which would have caused
people to not only dislike it but really

02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360
people to not only dislike it but really
 

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.630
people to not only dislike it but really
dislike it but because they took that

02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:52.640
dislike it but because they took that
 

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.700
dislike it but because they took that
risk and it worked a lot of people got a

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:54.710
risk and it worked a lot of people got a
 

02:00:54.710 --> 02:00:56.110
risk and it worked a lot of people got a
lot more emotional to it and they

02:00:56.110 --> 02:00:56.120
lot more emotional to it and they
 

02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:57.790
lot more emotional to it and they
connect it as something much bigger than

02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800
connect it as something much bigger than
 

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.370
connect it as something much bigger than
the other Muppet movies this one is a

02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:00.380
