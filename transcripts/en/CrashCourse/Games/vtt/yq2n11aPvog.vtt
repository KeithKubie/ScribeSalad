00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.260
As you’ll remember from last time, by the mid-90s, Nintendo and Sega were in the midst of a war for console dominance,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.140
and their struggle to outdo each other were driving improvements in hardware, games, and all around user experience.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.980
The video game industry was worth around
$19 billion in 1993,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.720
and that kind of money is likely to attract the attention of an even bigger company than Sega and Nintendo.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.540
Enter Sony, a pretty well-known Japanese electronics company that had like $36 billion in total revenue in 1993.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.780
Sony was about to enter the console market
with the Playstation.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
And that unassuming gray box was about to
disrupt pretty much everything in home consoles.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:47.360
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.740
So, the second round of the console war between Nintendo and SEGA was still in full swing in 1994, and we’ll get to Sony’s role in a bit,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.180
but I just want to point out that there were some other consoles that tried to take part in the console war but just didn’t get in there.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.619
Sorry Turbografx-16.
And remember Atari? They tried too.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.210
They made their last stand in the console
market in 1993 with the Jaguar,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.030
an attempt to take a technological leap past
their competition.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.030
The Atari Jaguar was technically a 32 bit
system, but it had two significant problems.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.780
It was really difficult for programmers to
write games for it,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.820
and it had this totally bizarre controller
design with a numeric keypad.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.700
You can almost hear the Intellivision and Colecovision controllers looking at it and going "really?"

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.180
Very few developers made games for the Jaguar, and few people wanted to play the games that did get made.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.660
Which wasn’t great for sales.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.590
Now, processing power wasn’t the only technology
game companies were pushing forward.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.300
Most of the industry was looking toward the relatively new data storage format, compact discs.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.220
They might seem quaint now, in the age of streaming and the death of physical media and all,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.640
but in the 1990s, CDs were AMAZING.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.240
And these plastic compact discs could hold a lot more data than a game cartridge. I mean, A LOT more.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.220
For example, the standard Sega cartridge held
somewhere between 4 and 5 megabytes of data.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.429
A CD-ROM could hold over 700 megabytes.
And they had LASERS!

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.560
Sega was first to market with a 1992 North American release of their SegaCD add-on for the Genesis,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.580
and their rush to get it released showed.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.709
It was criticized for its high price, its
lack of quality games,

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.620
and the fact that the new massive storage capacity was mostly just used to add grainy video sequences, rather than improving gameplay.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.540
But don’t blame Sonic CD for that, OK?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.540
Sonic CD was cool.
Gave us Metal Sonic.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.450
Despite the problems with the SegaCD, the
company tried again to make a technological

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.980
leap without introducing a new console in
1994, when they launched the 32x add-on.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.180
It was an attempt to be the first to market
with 32 bit processing,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.650
but the 32x faced a lot of the same criticisms
the SegaCD had.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.280
Poor games, a high price, and a sense that
the peripheral really didn’t add much to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.430
the experience made the 32x a commercial failure.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.650
The SegaCD and the 32x foreshadowed Sega’s
hardware struggles in the industry.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.870
But Sega had a pretty good reason to rush
these products to market.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.640
As we mentioned earlier, the consumer electronics giant, Sony, was about to enter the video game market,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.380
and Sega was correctly worried that this would
weaken their sales.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.200
Sony had been in the background of the game
industry for a few years,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.140
and had tentatively partnered with Nintendo in 1998 to help develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the SNES.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.700
That drive was never released,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.019
and the two companies had a big fight about
Nintendo flirting with Sony’s competition Philips,

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.359
and they had a terrible breakup, and Sony
said,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.960
“Fine. We’ll go make our own CD based
video game console,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.599
and it’ll be better than any console you
ever made, NINTENDO!”

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.639
And that’s just what they did.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.799
In 1994, Sony debuted their 32-bit PlayStation.

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.849
Prior to launch, Sony developed strong relationships
with third-party developers like Namco and

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.489
Konami to ensure the console would have great
games.

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.820
Their design featured technological innovations which were miles ahead of Sega and Nintendo’s consoles.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.719
The CD-ROM drive was essential to the console’s
success.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.879
The CD-ROMS weren’t quite as fast as the
flash memory-based cartridges,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.040
but their massively increased storage capacity gave developers the space to combine detailed pre-rendered backgrounds

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.760
with polygon-based foreground graphics to create immersive experiences unlike anything gamers had seen on a console.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.740
But the downside of the move to CD storage
was in transfer speeds.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.319
These early CD drives were considerably slower
than cartridge-based games,

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.199
and it could take a long time for a large
level of a game to load into the system memory.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.440
This was the birth of the...load screen.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.120
The Playstation also emphasized the then-new
technology of polygon-based 3D graphics.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.660
These powerful graphics processors allowed
developers to create worlds with depth,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.760
and at their best gave players the opportunity to look around and see a sort of fully realized world.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.960
These blocky characters made of thousands of triangles might look clunky and primitive to us now,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.360
but at the time,
they were revolutionary.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.380
Watching the perspective of the game change
as the in-game camera spun around your character

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.580
was an unusual and exciting experience for
players in the 90s.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.740
A smaller innovation, both in terms of size and impact on the industry, was the memory card.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.370
The Playstation didn’t have internal storage
to save games.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.990
Instead it used a small memory card, which
allowed players to save their progress,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.230
but also made those saved games portable.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.300
Want to show your friend how far you’ve
gotten in Tomb Raider?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.090
You could take your saved game with you when
you went to your friend’s house.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.260
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.060
These technical advantages allowed the Playstation to quickly take the lead in a market full of outdated consoles,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.880
but Sega and Nintendo didn’t stand still.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.860
Sega released it’s 32-bit Saturn console
in 1995.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.180
It’s beautiful isn’t it.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.120
But it didn’t manage to recapture much market
share from Sony.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.910
The console mainly suffered from a lack of
compelling games.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.950
Sega rushed a product to market again, and
they failed again.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.110
Third-party game developers were reluctant
to make games for the system.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.000
Sega wasn’t even able to launch a game with its most popular character, Sonic, on the console.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The Saturn failed to catch on with the gaming
public, and was discontinued by 1998.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.300
Nintendo’s answer to the Playstation and
the Saturn was to step back, take a breath,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.300
skip the whole 32-bit thing, and get a head start on the next generation of consoles.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.650
The Nintendo 64 was launched in 1996, and
was an immediate hit.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.380
As you might have guessed from the name, the
console came loaded with a 64-bit processor.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.920
The system was also widely praised for its controller design which included a control stick.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.820
Now, although it was technically digital and
not an analog stick,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.630
it had varying levels of movement and nearly
360-degree control.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.220
You still had the d-pad like most game controllers,
but you were limited to those 8 directions.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.760
Whereas with the control stick you allowed
for much more nuanced movement.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.730
Which was ideal for 3D rendered worlds that
were everywhere in the 90s.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.200
And the N64 capitalized on these great controllers

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.770
by also being the first mass-market console
with four built in controller ports.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.500
This not only differentiated the console from
the other options,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.310
it foreshadowed a focus on multiplayer, social
games that would be some of its bestsellers.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.740
The N64 was also the last major console to
deliver games on cartridges.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.840
While cartridges allowed for blazing fast data transfers, and avoided those load screens no one likes,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.840
they did introduce limitations for developers.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.820
Those storage capacities we talked about before became an increasing concern for these larger and larger games.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.000
Also, cartridges were also much more expensive
to manufacture,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.600
meaning a game that didn’t sell was a much bigger loss for a company if that game was on a cartridge vs a CD-ROM.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.540
But these consoles weren’t successful just
because they had the latest technology.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.900
Sega Saturn and Atari Jaguar had that as well.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.760
Advanced hardware can only do so much to help sell a console, but great games can do the trick.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.940
The Playstation and the N64 dominated the
market in the late 1990s

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.490
because they used these technological advances
to deliver great gaming experiences.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.990
Nintendo understood how to harness the potential
of 3D immediately.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.700
Super Mario 64 featured a huge world that
was entirely polygon based.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.280
The game featured a flying camera system that
followed the player around the world,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.660
but also allowed players to take control and explore scenes by swiveling the camera around.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.040
Another huge Nintendo 64 hit was GoldenEye 007, a first person shooter based in the James Bond universe.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.960
And unlike the movie it was based on, the game was met with pretty universal acclaim from critics and from players.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.720
It would go on to sell 8 million copies.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.520
GoldenEye 007 was praised for well-crafted single player missions, as well as its local multiplayer deathmatch mode.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.760
The game leveraged the n64’s four controller
ports to host four player combat,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.860
and as it turned out, players really liked
shooting each other in video games.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:50.100
The four N64 controller ports allowed Nintendo to focus on making video games that you could play in groups,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.340
such as four player races in Mario Kart 64
and Diddy Kong Racing,

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.420
4 player minigames in the Mario Party series,
or 4-player fights in Super Smash Brothers.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.240
But even all this couldn’t keep up with
the Playstation’s success.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.980
Sony’s close relationships with developers led to many excellent and innovative games appearing on its system.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.520
Games like Tomb Raider.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.360
Tomb Raider was released on Playstation in 1996 and became one of the most iconic games of the era.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.940
The game was met with praise for its huge,
richly detailed world,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.520
and its innovative level designs that pushed
the boundaries of adventure platform games.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.880
The game’s lead character Lara Croft was
an instant celebrity,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.660
and Tomb Raider even had success outside of
video games.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.520
The franchise spread out into movies,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.460
and Lara appeared on the covers of magazines
that were normally about real people.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.409
She even made an appearance on U2’s PopMart
Tour.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.909
But Tomb Raider has also met with a lot of
criticism,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.800
much of it centered around Lara Crofts unrealistic body proportions, and the sexualization of her character.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.440
Although, some of the concerns about Lara and unrealistic body images have been addressed in later versions of the game.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:51.100
All of this points to the unprecedented level of immersion and connection that 1990s games introduced to the market.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.960
These more-realistic-than-ever characters
and following them in their game worlds,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.589
as well as in real life, allowed players to
connect with them like never before.

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:04.509
In addition to characters, the advances in the industry also increased the ways players connected with games through improved storytelling.

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:10.000
And there was no better example of the massive narratives that could unfold on the new consoles than Final Fantasy 7.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.579
This role playing game was so huge, it was
delivered on three discs.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:16.980
The world of Final Fantasy 7 was open-ended
and players could choose their path.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.040
While the game has a linear story, there were also many optional side quests for the players to take.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.400
The Materia system allowed players to adjust
and alter their abilities.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.460
And the massive storage capacity of CDs meant developers could include lots of full motion video cut scenes,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.700
and include a lot of story to go with all
that gameplay.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.260
And there was a lot of gameplay.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.400
Players could literally spend hundreds of
hours in the game,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.340
trying to complete the many quests and collect
all the items and spells.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.760
Final Fantasy 7 was also successfully ported
to personal computers,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.520
and oh man, we haven’t even talked about
PC gaming yet!

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.280
Home computers were also becoming more powerful,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.699
and the games that were available for them
were improving as well.

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:53.139
There were ports of console games like Tomb
Raider and Final Fantasy VII,

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:56.659
but there were several games and genres that
were at their best in their PC versions.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.140
First person shooters flourished in the PC
space.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.420
Games like Quake and Duke Nukem capitalized
on the success of Doom,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.279
and delivered ever more harrowing experiences
to PC players.

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.779
But, even the FPS scene able to add compelling
storytelling.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.720
There were franchises like Half-Life that were successful at integrating gripping stories into FPS action.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.740
And as we got to the end of the 1990s, Sega
tried one more entry into the console market.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.820
On 9/9/1999, Sega released the dreamcast, which was powerful, innovative, and launched with great games.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.680
In addition to raw processing power, the Dreamcast
featured a modem for online multiplayer games,

00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:32.509
played on this new thing called the Internets.

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:35.709
And it also had a cool controller that had
an optional display.

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:40.540
And it had lots of really good games, and
lots of really weird games. Like Seaman.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.149
But even with its Sonic Adventures, its Jet
Set Radios, and its Marvels vs Capcoms,

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:49.509
the Dreamcast didn’t take off and ended
up being Sega’s final home console.

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:52.980
The company changed its business model to
become a game development company only,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.720
and Nintendo and Sony were the only two consoles
left standing.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.100
But, the market wouldn’t stay uncrowded
for long.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:04.180
Next time, we’re going to discuss the arrival a new home console from a company that rivals even the megacorp that is Sony.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.360
A company that pushed the technological and
storytelling aspects of the medium even further.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.360
That’s right, we’re talking about a little company called Microsoft. We’ll see you next time.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.940
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianpolis, Indiana.

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:19.509
And it's made with the help of all of these
nice people.

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:23.999
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone, forever, you can support the series at Patreon,
