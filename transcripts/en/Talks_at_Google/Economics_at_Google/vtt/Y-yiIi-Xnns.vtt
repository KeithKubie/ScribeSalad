00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.892
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.750
EVA: Welcome everybody at Talks
at Google in the Cambridge

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.040
office.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.430
My name is Eva [? Atur ?] and
I'm a Site Program Manager

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.010
for the Munich site,
woo, all of those

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.140
that will be
looking and watching

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.620
that video later on from Munich.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.740
So I have the great
pleasure to welcome today

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.200
at Talks at Google Professor
Jan Rivkin from the Harvard

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.110
Business School.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.630
Since 2011, he co-chairs the
project on US competitiveness

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.470
with professor Michael Porter.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.620
And he will talk
about that today.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.840
And this project
unleashed a number

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440
of discussions around
the business leaders

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.000
on how to make US health
and economic growth grow.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.820
And when I was talking
about the Talks at Google

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.450
with Professor Rivkin,
we laughed a little bit

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.720
around the cases that
we discussed at Harvard

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.070
around 2000, 2002
about Yahoo and Lycos,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
where some of the students were
arguing heavily and intensely

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.570
that search and internet
portals would become commodity,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.616
and there is no money
to be made there.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:33.250
Well, this turned out to be
a lot of different story.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.470
So without further
ado, I just want

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.564
to welcome Professor
Jan Rivkin on stage.

00:01:40.564 --> 00:01:41.480
JAN RIVKIN: Wonderful.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.855
EVA: Thank you.

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:43.980
JAN RIVKIN: Thank you, Eva.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.480
Thank you for the
kind introduction.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.220
You mentioned the old Yahoo
and Lycos cases that I wrote.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.300
The story is actually
even worse than that.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.730
It turns out I also
wrote a case years

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.050
ago on Microsoft's efforts
in search, what became Bing.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.830
So you may think that I
am some kind of, you know,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.615
bad luck charm, bringing harm
to every search company I visit.

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:06.240
You might want to
escort me to the door

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.384
before I cause any
damage to Google.

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:10.050
I do want to reassure
you I have written

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.690
some cases on some successful
organizations as well.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.040
So it actually is remarkable.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.380
20 years ago you could write
a case in the online space

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.980
and never mention Google.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.480
And yet here we are.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.270
And the company is one most
influential organizations

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.434
on the planet.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:29.850
So it's a pleasure
and a privilege

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.516
to share with you
some of the work we've

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:33.360
done on US competitiveness.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.450
This work has been done as
a project team, about two

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.932
dozen faculty involved to date.

00:02:38.932 --> 00:02:40.390
I will, of course,
speak to myself.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.370
But I just want to acknowledge
the debt I owe to my colleagues

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.000
in that regard,
truly joint work.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910
Now, when I got
the nice invitation

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.670
to come speak with you today,
I of course did my homework.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.560
I looked at some prior talks.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.820
I noticed some of the talks were
deeply analytical, just what I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.600
would expect from Google.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.940
Some of them included
a call to action.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.310
And I'm going to try
to do both today.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.180
The analytical part
will delve into the lack

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.950
of shared prosperity we see
in the American economy.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.400
Once upon a time in America,
the prosperity we generated

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.470
was shared pretty broadly
so that rich Americans,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.690
middle class Americans,
poor Americans

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.030
we either thrived together,
or we struggle together.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.880
And since all boats either
rose or fell with the tide,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.770
the challenge was
fairly straightforward.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.186
How do we keep the
tide coming in?

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:31.320
All right?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.980
But that is not what we see
in the American economy today.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.500
Instead, what I think we see is
an economy doing half its job

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.850
where big companies and the
people who work for them

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.900
and invest in them
are doing pretty well.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.770
But working class,
middle class Americans

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.870
are struggling, as are
many small businesses.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.050
And I've become convinced
this is the number one

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.690
economic, social, and
increasingly political problem

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.490
in our country.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.810
That many of the things that
might concern many of us--

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.170
the rise of populism, even the
financial crisis of the last

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.820
decade--

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.860
are as much causes of
that lack of shared

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.410
prosperity as independent
events in and of themselves.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.340
And I want to share with you
some fairly sobering symptoms,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.890
as well as offer a
diagnosis before I

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.190
move to the prescription.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.430
Now, with the prescription,
that brings me

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.740
to the call to action.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.190
And the call to
action is embodied

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.770
in the title of the
talk, "Will We Restore

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.510
Shared Prosperity in America?"

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.190
I chose the title
very deliberately.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.630
It's not can we.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.190
Sometimes, you read
stuff out there

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.280
that makes it feel like
the economic outcomes will

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.560
be dictated by inexorable
forces of global change

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.030
or technological change.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.770
I actually believe those forces
are extraordinarily important.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.270
But I also believe
what we have here

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.530
is essentially a social choice.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.510
We get to decide.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.174
And I want to take
the talk personally.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:55.590
I believe that
people with Google,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.380
individually and
collectively, can actually

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.620
help to shape and make
that social decision.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.810
It will require, I believe, an
approach, an approach that's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.550
not discussed as
much as it should be,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.820
an approach that I'll try
to highlight and illustrate

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.340
when I move to the
prescription, an approach

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.950
that I actually see
already implicit in some

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.230
of the social and philanthropic
efforts of the company,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.920
but an approach that I think
is actually made more powerful

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.600
if we make it explicit.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.310
So that's where I'm heading.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.970
I want to start with the
symptoms and just some facts

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.910
about prosperity
in America today.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.340
I'm going to start
with the good news.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.980
I will warn you the good news
is not going to last very long.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.140
And this could be a bit
of a roller coaster ride.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.850
I promise everyone you
cannot leave without an equal

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.230
and opposite offsetting
dose of optimism by the end.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.990
OK?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.420
But bear with me through
some of the sobering stuff.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.760
The good news first, though.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.100
Total prosperity in
America-- turns out

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.400
we're generating lots of
prosperity in the country.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.800
One indicator of this is
gross domestic product.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.210
Here we've got
real GDP in America

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.650
over time indexed back to 1995
shown versus Europe and Japan.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.140
And the good news is that,
in fact, the American economy

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.890
powered into and powered out
of the great recession stronger

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.870
than the other advanced
economies of the world.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.536
Now, it turns out the
growth rates here,

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:21.380
they are lower than
we saw in the years

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.970
immediately after World War II.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.200
They're relatively low.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.190
But the total pie, the total
pie is growing pretty well.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.580
Now, part of that pie shows
up as corporate profit.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.967
This looks like good news too.

00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:35.300
So it turns up, when you only
looks at corporate profit,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.650
either as a portion of GDP,
in red and on the right,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.120
or in total real dollars,
in blue and on the left.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.940
Corporate profits are close
to all-time record highs.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.040
OK, so the corporate part of
the pie is just doing fine.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.530
Now, I want to turn
what's happening outside

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.850
of the corporate sector.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.270
And I'm going to start by
focusing on income, right,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.430
a key indicator of prosperity,
and income distribution

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.085
and actually look at income
from like four different angles.

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:03.710
So you can see
different aspects of it.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.889
You can get it totaled up.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.680
And I'll also look at
two things that drive

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.400
it-- job growth and startups.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.500
With income, I want to
start with, I think,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.590
a tremendously interesting
and sobering analysis

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.660
that some colleagues at
Berkeley and in France

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.670
did very recently.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.630
They took the
income distribution.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.060
They looked at individuals
in each percentile.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.800
OK?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.850
And they asked, over the
first half and the second half

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.520
of the post-war
period, how did income

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.340
grow for individuals in each
percentile of the income

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.610
distribution.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.210
So this is the first half
of the post-war period,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.230
1946 through 1980.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.229
And this is different points
in the income distribution.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.020
And first of all, the
good news is the line

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.310
as a whole is pretty high.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.420
That's terrific.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.670
And in fact, the
poorest Americans

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.360
saw the greatest percentage
gains in real income.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.660
And the richest Americans saw
modest gains, but still gains,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.190
but lower gains.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.930
Now, we move forward
to the second half

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.910
of the post-war period,
1980 through 2014.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.960
And the line rotates
dramatically.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.655
OK?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.972
All right, I mean your gasp is
exactly my reaction as well.

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:12.930
So what do we see here?

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.430
We see the poorest Americans,
basically, barely keeping up.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.970
We see the very, very,
very wealthiest Americans

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.580
seeing unprecedented
gains in income over time.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.810
All right?

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.040
So there you get the
whole distribution.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.250
Let's now zero in on
one particular point.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.890
Let's zero in on the median and
look at the median over time.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.265
Because if we had
a world-- if we

00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:34.370
had a country of
shared prosperity,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.890
we'd expect to see median
household income in real terms,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.799
in inflation-adjusted
terms, going up over time.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.520
All right?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.440
We might see ups and
downs around recessions,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.210
but, generally, an upward trend.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.360
If you look back far enough
at median household income,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.210
that's actually what we saw,
all right, from 1975 here

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.859
to around the year 2000.

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:53.900
Yeah, there's ups and
downs around the recession,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.990
but basically an upward trend.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.870
But then things peak in 1999.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.150
We see stagnation, decline.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.010
We do see some gains
in recent years.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.700
And in fact, the data that
were released two weeks ago

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.260
showed that real
median household

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.990
income exceeded the 1999
peak for the first time.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.710
People celebrated, and
we should celebrate.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.440
We should also keep in mind
exactly what we're celebrating.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.150
We're celebrating
that we are back

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.600
to where we were 17 years ago.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.930
OK?

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.942
This is not just
true at the median.

00:09:25.942 --> 00:09:28.400
It's true all the way down to
the very bottom of the income

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.941
distribution.

00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:33.170
And it goes up to around
the 95th or above percentile

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.770
that since 1999 we've seen
essentially stagnation, decline

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.870
and then recovery.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.465
So that's deeply sobering.

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:45.920
Another thing is just looking
at how it spread geographically.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.260
So let's now zero in on 15
years from 1999 to 2014.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.900
and look at the change in
real median household income.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.110
But now, let's do it
by county in the US.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.270
And what you see
here is declines

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.420
in real median household income
in the reds, the oranges,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.700
the shades of
yellow and increases

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.680
in the blues and the whites.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.790
And you can see deep declines
in the Midwest, deep declines

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.020
in the South, the Northeast and
the Rockies not quite as bad.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.390
You actually see gains in
a big chunk of the country

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.900
where there are very few people.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.650
And you can almost
make-- you can actually

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.270
make out the oil shale fields
in North Dakota and west Texas.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.930
Right?

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.080
If you squint very hard,
you squint very hard,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.860
you can see some highly
populous but prosperous pockets

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.775
on the coasts.

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:37.440
So you can see Boston.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.570
You can see the Bay Area.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.630
You can see Washington DC.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.960
You can see LA.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.690
But both in terms of the gains
across the income distribution

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.630
and also gains across the
country, really uneven outcomes

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.370
on median household income.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.780
All right?

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.460
The last angle on income
I want to give you

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.930
is something that
colleagues in the Econ

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.140
Department at Harvard and
Stanford have shown recently.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.760
They did a very clever analysis.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.590
They basically ask first
what is the American dream.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.350
And they realized that at
least one key component of it

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.320
is my kids are
better off than I am,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.630
and I'm better off
than my parents.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.090
So they took tax records,
looked at income,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.390
and linked together
parents and kids.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.920
And they can look at people
in different birth cohorts

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.260
and ask, for instance,
for someone born in 1940,

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.160
when they were age 30 in
1970, are they better off

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.170
than their parents were
when their parents were

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.595
30 years old.

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:43.530
It turns out for someone born in
1940, the answer was about 90%

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.820
of them were better off than
their parents at age 30.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.650
OK?

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.780
But you can see, you know,
the decline in this figure.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.820
All the way to, you
know, those born in 1984,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.465
who turned 30 in 2014 when the
data set ends, it turns out

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.590
only half of them are better
off than their parents

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.780
were at age 30.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.760
So it's gone from being a
kind of 90%, almost a sure

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.310
bet, to being a coin toss.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.720
Now, I promised sobering data.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.220
Right?

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.480
So are we sobered so far?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.620
I'm afraid you are.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.160
I want to look at two
underlying drivers of income

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.530
and prosperity and
shared prosperity.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.540
One is job creation.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.370
Another is startups.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.430
So in job creation, I
want to take a quick look

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.180
at the great American
job machine, right,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.710
which clearly is a driver
of shared prosperity.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.590
And here's one
way to look at it.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.570
It's the rolling 10-year
compounded annual growth

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.320
rate and the number
of private-sector jobs

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.680
in the country.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.700
So the number for 1985 was 2.7%.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.310
That means in the
decade before 1985,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.120
the economy produced new jobs at
an average annual clip of 2.7%.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.170
All right?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.430
And you can see that,
for a long period,

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.460
the great American
job machine could

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.770
be counted upon in
any given decade

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.269
to produce new jobs at
about 2% clip per year.

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:57.060
There'd be ups and
downs within the decade.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.170
But give me a decade.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.360
I can give you 2% annual growth.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.200
And then somewhere around
2000, something happens.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.195
The job machine
starts to sputter.

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:07.050
All right?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.120
And we drop to historically
low rates of job growth,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.600
which for working and
middle class Americans

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.099
is a deeply distressing outcome.

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.140
I also want to turn,
particularly for this crowd,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.700
I thought turn to startups.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.489
All right?

00:13:20.489 --> 00:13:22.530
I think most of us have
the impression, certainly

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.960
on campus where I live,
it seems like it's

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.310
the golden age of startups.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.710
Like if you're at HBS as
an MBA, and you're not

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.094
involved in two startups,
people will wonder what

00:13:31.094 --> 00:13:32.260
you're doing with your time.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.810
Right?

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.240
And I think-- when you think
about it, barriers to entry

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.050
have fallen.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.840
We can now outsource production.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.700
We can market via Google.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.137
We can deliver via UPS.

00:13:43.137 --> 00:13:44.970
Seems like barriers to
entry have come down.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.620
It turns out that impression
is true inside a particularly

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.810
small bubble.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.400
And if you actually
look at the startups

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.350
as a portion of all US firms,
it's been in steady decline

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.697
since the late 1970s.

00:14:00.697 --> 00:14:02.280
On Tuesday of this
week, they actually

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.990
released the 2015 data.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.780
It's up a tiny little
bit, a tenth of a point.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.660
Now, just to remind
you, again, it's

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.550
not that we're not
producing prosperity.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.550
It's that we're not
producing shared prosperity.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.930
And just to reinforce
that, here's

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.660
a chart where we
look at two things--

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.330
blue and on the left,
the average income

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.480
in real dollars among
those in the bottom 99%

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.580
of the population over a
very long period of time,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.070
going back basically to
when we started doing income

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.050
taxes in America in 1913, and
then, in red and on the right,

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.000
what happens for
those in the top 1%.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.920
So you can see very clearly,
from about the end of World War

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.600
II through the mid-1970s,
this is essentially

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.010
the golden age of the
American middle class

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.650
and then, from the mid-1980s
until very recently,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.060
maybe even today, the
golden age of the 1%.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.010
So we've got a
situation where we

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.100
see a true, deep lack of shared
prosperity in the country.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.510
And I'm sorry to show you the
baby from different angles.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.620
But the baby is ugly from
each direction, I'm afraid.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.940
What's going on?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.700
We need to move from just the
symptoms to the diagnosis.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.620
I want to offer a basic
narrative that I think captures

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.019
a lot of what's going on.

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:15.560
It's not going to
capture everything.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.190
All right?

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.200
But I think it'll
capture the basics.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.515
It starts with an idea.

00:15:20.515 --> 00:15:23.992
And it's an idea that my
colleagues Gary Pisano

00:15:23.992 --> 00:15:26.450
and Willy Shih have really made
central in my own thinking.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.670
It's the idea of the commons--

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.450
that there are certain shared
resources that every citizen,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.360
every community, every
company relies upon

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.030
in order to be productive
and prosperous.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.330
Every community needs
a educated populace,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.380
needs a skilled workforce,
needs a strong infrastructure,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.080
some basic R&amp;D. All Right

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.930
And the truly amazing thing
about the United States,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.670
historically, is that
locally invested companies

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.240
and a functioning government at
the federal and the local level

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.450
managed to invest
deeply and build

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.240
the most productive commons
the world had ever seen.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.500
In fact, we not only built
a productive commons.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.624
We were innovators in this.

00:16:07.624 --> 00:16:09.500
From the
transcontinental railroad

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.060
to the interstate highway system
from universal public education

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.540
in the 1840s to the GI
Bill after World War II,

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.090
we innovated it and
built the commons.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.320
Now, I do want to
be very, very clear.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.810
This was not good for everyone.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.265
Like the good old days was not--

00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:28.940
they just weren't so good across
big portions of population.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.770
The interstate
highway system cut

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.040
through the heart of many
African-American neighborhoods.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.240
The GI Bill was not shared
equally across the population,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.500
either racially--

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.530
very few women benefited from
the GI Bill, for instance.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.810
But for a big chunk
of the population,

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.090
we built a strong commons.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.710
Then what happens?

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.130
We hit around 1980,
and we see changes

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.380
in geopolitics,
changes in technology,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.720
changes in governance.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.520
Suddenly, we create
automation and globalization.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.160
It becomes possible
to do business

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.870
from anywhere to anywhere.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.400
And we start to get
new technologies

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.375
for automating jobs.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.619
All right?

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.957
And this had tremendous
benefits for the US economy.

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:09.790
Let's be very clear.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.300
This was beneficial.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.270
But it also tended to weaken the
connections between companies

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.250
and their communities,
the connections that

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.480
had made companies eager to
invest in the local commons.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.160
If I am born in a
small city, and I

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.010
know that I'm going to be
starting my business, growing

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.397
my business, and, you
know, living in a community

00:17:29.397 --> 00:17:31.980
where I've got to rely upon the
local public education system,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.855
I've got really strong
incentive to make sure

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:35.900
that school system
operates well.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.080
So but we've got now a situation
where there's globalization

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.260
and additional automation.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.910
So maybe I can replace
individuals with machinery.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.700
So the incentives to invest in
the commons among businesses

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.410
deteriorates.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.600
This, of course,
puts intense pressure

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.430
on the middle class
in our society.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.120
Right?

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.520
Middle class, working
class, finds itself

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.570
in intense competition for
jobs with hundreds of millions

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.470
of ambitious, skilled
workers around the world,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.400
and also, implicitly, competing
for jobs against technology

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.700
that's improving at the
rate of Moore's law.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.700
On the other hand, on the other
end of the skills distribution,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.280
if you happen to have unique
skills that you can market

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.740
globally and can be
leveraged by technology,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.060
this is a great moment.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.870
Right?

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:26.090
So income inequality starts
to rise at this point.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.360
Then the next question becomes
how did we, as a society,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.100
respond to pressure
in the middle class.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.800
We could have doubled
down, I think,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.160
on making the middle
class so, you know,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.260
so educated, so
skilled, so supported

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.080
by strong infrastructure and
other parts of the commons

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.840
that it can compete with anyone,
anywhere around the world.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.190
All right?

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.380
Instead, what we honestly did--

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.630
and let me be clear.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.210
I don't want to pin this on
one political party or another.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.540
I think there's enough blame
here to go around, actually.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.310
I think what we
did, as a society,

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.070
is we made a series of
unsustainable promises

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.350
to maintain the illusion
of shared prosperity,

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.070
even as things started
to deteriorate.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.600
They're promises like
please, middle class,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.910
don't worry about your
stagnant household income.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.260
We will extend
additional credit to you.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.100
Please go out and
buy more stuff.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.260
Particularly, buy houses.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:21.920
Right?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.930
So after the dot.com
bubble bursts,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.640
we keep interest rates low,
encouraging house buying.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.010
And we build a
bubble, which we come

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.383
to live with during
the financial crisis.

00:19:33.383 --> 00:19:37.670
Promises like the
government will directly

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.640
cover your health care
costs during your retirement

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.960
and promises like we'll do
all of this while lowering

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.150
tax rates in every tax bracket.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.090
Right?

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.740
You take those promises.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.900
You couple them with two
wars and a nasty recession.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.340
And you wind up
with a government,

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.280
which is both financially
hobbled and politically

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.420
divided.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.130
And where do the cuts come?

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.920
Basically, they come in
investments in the comments.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.640
Right?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.000
So you wind up with footloose
firms and a hobbled government.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.620
And who's making the
investments in infrastructure,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.560
to individuals and
innovation, and so forth?

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.560
Unfortunately, not
enough anywhere.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.360
Right?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.750
Now, one particular
look at this issue

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.420
comes from surveys we've done,
as part of the Competitiveness

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.680
Project, of our alumni.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.110
So we're fortunate to
have tens of thousands

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.130
of alums around the
world who will generously

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.050
share their perspective
from the front lines

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.580
of global capitalism.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.010
Among the things that
we've asked them,

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.100
we've asked them to look
at a bunch of elements

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.471
of the business
environment in America,

00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:44.970
which prior research
has shown to be

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.970
drivers of competitiveness and
drivers of shared prosperity.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.860
And for about each of these, we
asked them two basic questions.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.704
The first question was
how's the US doing compared

00:20:53.704 --> 00:20:54.870
to other advanced economies.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.209
That will become
my horizontal axis.

00:20:57.209 --> 00:20:59.250
And then we've asked what's
America's trajectory.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.999
Are we getting better
or staying the same,

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.920
getting worse in
each one of these?

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.870
And that will be
the vertical axis.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.977
Now, the great news
about the US is,

00:21:06.977 --> 00:21:08.810
in fact, we've got some
great strengths that

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:09.870
are getting even better.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.660
We've got a great
context for innovation.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.110
We've got vibrant
capital markets.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.050
We've got high-quality
firm management.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.142
We've got great
research universities.

00:21:18.142 --> 00:21:20.100
The problem is those
strengths are weighed down

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.380
by other strengths that
are getting worse--

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.290
our pools of skilled labor,
our macroeconomic policy,

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.290
for instance, our
regulatory system--

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.240
and by weaknesses
that are getting worse

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.980
in the eyes of our alums--

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.250
a convoluted tax code, a
paralyzed political system

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.080
at the national level, a
costly healthcare system,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.650
a very patchy, uneven K
through 12 education system,

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.210
and logistics and infrastructure
with significant weaknesses.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.040
Now, if you stare
at that chart, you

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.460
can essentially see, with
a little bit of squinting,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.410
the underlying drivers
of the lack of shared

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.520
prosperity in the country.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.478
Because think about it.

00:21:54.478 --> 00:21:57.330
If you're a large corporation,
running a large corporation,

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.670
what do you need to do well?

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.590
You need access to innovation.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.390
You need great
research universities.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.010
You need great capital markets.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.230
You need great firm management.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.230
And frankly, if you don't
like the national environment,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.680
you are one--

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.280
you're like one tax
code, one inversion,

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.000
away from getting away from the
convoluted tax code in the US.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.100
You can source talent
from around the world.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.609
So the K through 12 system is
not a barrier to your progress.

00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:28.650
On the other hand, if you
are a working or middle

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.750
class American, you bring
to work your education,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.510
your workforce skills.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.200
And you can't escape
the consequences

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.760
of the national
political system.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.490
You can't escape the
consequences of the healthcare

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.090
system.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.810
So essentially, what
you've got is large firms

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.880
that can tap the
strengths of the economy

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.870
and can escape the weaknesses
and many, many citizens

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.520
who are reliant
upon the weaknesses

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.640
and can't escape
from those weaknesses

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.270
as well and very rarely
actually tap into the strengths.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.030
So that diagnosis,
it acknowledges

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.890
things that are kind
of inexorable forces

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.320
like globalization and
technological change.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.880
But it also says look.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.250
We have here a
self-inflicted wound.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.420
The self-inflicted wound is
systematic under-investment

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.660
in the commons on which
many, many Americans depend.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.840
And the question becomes how
might we fix that problem.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.490
And this leads to
the prescription

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.100
and, ultimately, to
the call to action.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.140
On the prescription
side, let me lay out,

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.460
with a little bit caricature,
what I hear as the major ways

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.910
people talk about restoring
shared prosperity in America.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.670
There are folks who
will basically--

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.970
and I will confess I think
there are largely politicians--

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.590
who will essentially say
my plan is to reverse time.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.260
OK?

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.730
I'm going to stop globalization
by putting up barriers.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.380
And we're going
to tax the robots.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.890
And we're going to basically--
don't worry about automation.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.690
You could probably
hold back the tide

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.490
a little bit there
for a little bit.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.320
But I think if America
resists the future,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.260
while the rest of the
world embraces it,

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.689
the country will not wind up in
a good place in the long run.

00:24:10.689 --> 00:24:12.480
Second you hear lots
of talks about efforts

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.220
to redistribute
income, to redistribute

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.450
the gains very directly
and more progressive tax

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:23.880
code, higher minimum wages, at
the extreme, universal basic

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.750
income.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.212
Right?

00:24:26.212 --> 00:24:27.670
Once you start
talking about these,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.700
one's politics quickly
come out to the front.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:31.890
I'll confess mine.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.306
I think we need to talk about
these things very seriously.

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:38.400
All right, I also live
enough in the real world

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.160
to realize that, legislatively,
these things are not

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.429
likely to happen.

00:24:42.429 --> 00:24:44.220
All right, so we have
to find other things.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.130
If we're serious about
restoring shared prosperity,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.800
we, individually, in our
own wish, may work on those,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.390
but we have to work on
other things as well.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.180
The third category
I'd say is efforts

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.962
to boost overall growth rates.

00:24:55.962 --> 00:24:58.170
There are people who say,
look, what we really need--

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.270
let's just boost overall growth.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.340
And then the boats will
rise with the tide.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.790
If you really believe that
prosperity in aggregate

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.744
will automatically bring shared
prosperity in the country,

00:25:08.744 --> 00:25:10.410
you've kind of not
been paying attention

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.510
for the past couple of decades.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.570
And then, finally, and where
I find the greatest hope is

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.010
efforts to restore the commons.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.140
And these are region
by region efforts.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.760
They are local efforts.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.290
And they are cross-sector.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.880
They involve business.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.480
Almost all the time, they
never involve only business.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.870
And they are highly innovative.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.390
And I'll just lay
out a few examples

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.010
to give you a taste,
a concrete taste,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.970
of what I'm talking about.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.120
So one of my favorite
ones involves

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.320
a company called Southwire.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.401
South is a multibillion dollar
maker of cable and wire.

00:25:41.401 --> 00:25:43.650
There's a one in five chance
their product is actually

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.470
in your wall at home or my
wall, but we don't know it.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.110
Right?

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.650
The Chief Executive of Southwire
realized he had a problem.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.430
He committed to hire only
high school Graduates

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.560
And in rural Carroll
County, Georgia,

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.230
where the company
is based, there just

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.780
weren't enough people
graduating from high school.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.310
So he and his team partnered
with the local school district

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.680
and said to the
school district bring

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.445
us the most at-risk
students in your system,

00:26:14.445 --> 00:26:16.530
OK, like the people
you are confident

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.210
are going to drop out.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.840
And we will build a dedicated
factory, staffed entirely

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.980
by at-risk high school
students, managed by teachers

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.290
and by Southwire managers.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.220
And the students, if they
go to school in the morning,

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.440
can then work a
four-hour shift for pay

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.380
at Southwire in this dedicated
factory in the afternoon.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.947
So it turns out this
leads the graduation

00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:43.530
rate for these at-risk students
to go flying through the roof.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.020
It's above the system average.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.660
The graduation rate
among at-risk students

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.740
who are in the county, but
not in this program, even that

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.990
goes up because of peer effects.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.580
The managers at
Southwire who are

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.290
doing this adore doing this.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.360
It gives extra
meaning to their work.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.100
The school system is delighted.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.060
And then here's
the kicker for me.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.320
It turns out that a
well-managed, well-trained high

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.440
school student is about 35%
more productive than a grownup.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.410
So the factory, the
factory that they

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.120
hoped might one day
break even, actually

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.870
starts to print money in month
three, money they then reinvest

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.180
in growing the program.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.670
So that's just one example.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.090
You can see cross-sector.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.170
It involves business.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.260
It involves educators.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.990
It involves the local
government to some extent.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.090
And it makes a difference
to building the commons

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.710
in that community.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.890
Siemens, you know,
global multinational,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.910
they're energy
equipment business

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.595
is based in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

00:27:40.595 --> 00:27:41.970
They realized they
had a problem.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.130
Their problem was
they could not find

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.300
enough advanced manufacturing
workers in the local workforce.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.090
So you know, Siemens
can go anywhere.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.250
But instead, they say
they're going to double down

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.070
in North Carolina.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.790
They partner with Central
Piedmont Community College,

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.100
essentially, to train
the workers they

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.780
would love to hire.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.270
All right, so this means
a deep partnership.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:09.220
It means helping to reform the
curriculum in the community

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.720
college.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.970
It means donating equipment.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.880
It means donating software.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.880
It means a change for the
community college too.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.270
They've got to take
their instructors,

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.810
change the curriculum, send
them to Germany to understand

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.030
the apprenticeship in
Germany, the apprenticeship

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.500
system in Germany.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.680
But the consequence is a
highly skilled workforce,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.590
which is useful not only
for Siemens, but also

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.610
for other advanced
manufacturers in the community.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.809
So once again, multi-sector,
local in its character

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:39.600
and, also, in this case
and in other cases,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.610
involving young leaders.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.861
I may come back to the Itasca
Project if we have time.

00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:45.485
But the Young American
Leaders Project,

00:28:45.485 --> 00:28:46.830
this is my personal favorite.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.710
I've been deeply
involved in this one.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.390
One thing we realized at
Harvard Business School, as we

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.690
collected scores upon
scores of examples

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.672
like this of local cross-sector
collaborations that

00:28:57.672 --> 00:28:59.130
were rebuilding
the commons, making

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.490
a difference in the individual
communities, what we realized

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.840
is the ideas weren't spreading.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.860
They were bottled up
in local communities.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.310
We'd go to Nashville
and talk about what

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.620
we'd seen in Chattanooga,
three hours down the road,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.350
and they hadn't heard of it.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.270
So we launched the
following effort.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:20.370
We chose nine cities and went to
senior leaders in those cities

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.210
and said look, identify
for us 10 young leaders

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.640
who you believe will
help lead the city

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.990
in the next generation.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.570
And they should come from
business and government

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.790
and nonprofits and
educational institutions

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.730
and faith-based organizations,
from anywhere in the community.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.470
All right, just
bring them to us.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.960
And nine cities times
10 people, now, we've

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.910
got a classroom full.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.990
All right, so we
bring them to campus

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.750
for essentially a
week-long boot camp

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.822
in cross-sector collaboration
for shared prosperity.

00:29:48.822 --> 00:29:50.280
And I want to tell
you, if you want

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.700
to feel optimistic
about America,

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.690
turn off CNN, turn off Fox
News, put down the newspaper,

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.750
and spend a week in a classroom
with these young leaders.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.570
It's They're truly inspiring,
truly extraordinary the things

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.800
they're doing.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.900
So this brings me, in
fact, to my kind of call

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.240
to action for you.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.240
Yeah, I've had the privilege
of having a lot of my students

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.020
either come from Google
or go to Google afterwards

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.530
or to other highly
influential organizations.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.790
And I think one of the great
pleasures of working at a place

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.910
like Google is you get
to ask yourself every day

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.770
am I changing the world.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.290
All right, but I want to
add a question to your list.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.500
And the question is am
I changing my community.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.380
All right, am I changing my
community in collaboration

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.460
with cross-sector leaders in
other parts of the community?

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.110
Am I working well
to build the commons

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.490
in my community with
leaders in local government,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.010
leaders in nonprofits, leaders
in educational institutions?

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:54.000
Because I think, ultimately,
that kind of collaboration,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.910
involving businessmen,
involving many others,

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.430
and working at the local
level to build the commons

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.110
and bring back
shared prosperity,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.360
that is the best bet
we have right now.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.400
So thanks for hearing
me out on this.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.780
Let me open it up for questions,
thoughts, reflections.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.640
I'd love to hear what
you think about this.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.660
AUDIENCE: Yes, so your call
to action is very well taken.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.090
You know, we certainly
all have a responsibility.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.190
But in studies of
income inequality

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.720
that I've read,
another huge factor,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.040
there's a strong correlation
between the overweening

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.690
strength of the
financial sector--

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.710
that excess and anomalous
returns to the financial world,

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.400
lower regulations, seems to
be very strongly correlated

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.650
with income inequality,
hedge fund billionaires

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.600
being taxed less at carried
interest rates, and so on.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.650
And a lot of those
people are HBS grads.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.636
So to what extent can I
turn the tables and ask

00:31:49.636 --> 00:31:51.760
is there institutional
responsibility on that side?

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.080
JAN RIVKIN: It's a
very fair question.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.650
The easy answer to is there
institutional responsibility

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.250
is yes.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.330
All right?

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.030
And just to drive
home your point,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:03.570
when you look back
at this chart,

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.037
you ask who are these
individuals up here,

00:32:06.037 --> 00:32:08.370
and they are disproportionately
in the financial sector.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:12.750
All right, so boy,
it's a great question.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.140
I am certain the question
is better than the answer

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.023
I will give it.

00:32:19.023 --> 00:32:22.450
So yes, there is an
institutional responsibility,

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.320
I think, to encourage
our students

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.670
to think broadly about
how they create value

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.660
before capturing value.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.670
All right, and in
fact, it goes back

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.760
to the very early history
of Harvard Business School.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.360
The first dean, his
statement to the mission

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.290
was to educate people to make
a decent profit decently.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.150
Right?

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.280
I think that there
are, in fact, steps

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.580
that we and our peer
institutions have made.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.546
You know, we have
a first-year course

00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:53.920
that looks entirely
at leadership

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.860
and corporate
accountability that

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.380
asks what are you
responsibilities to all

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.160
your stakeholders.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:07.020
We've got colleagues, Rebecca
Henderson and George Serafeim,

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.720
teaching a course called
Reimagining Capitalism, which

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:15.480
asks the question can capitalism
be a source of solutions

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.430
to the world's
thorniest problems.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:22.824
They focus on climate change,
inequality, and corruption.

00:33:22.824 --> 00:33:24.990
You know, I think we often
think of businesses being

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.560
a cause of those problems.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.947
And they ask can
business, in fact,

00:33:30.947 --> 00:33:32.280
be a solution to those problems.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.411
And it's a having
oversubscribed course.

00:33:35.411 --> 00:33:35.910
So

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.840
And I've got literally
dozens of colleagues

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.780
who look at the future
of market capitalism

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:48.690
and conclude that we've got
to have changes in that.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.060
Lynn Paine and Joe Bower, in
a recent "Harvard Business

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:56.220
Review" article, basically
came to a creek very similar

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.960
to yours, asking if the focus
on devotion to shareholder value

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.760
alone leads to outcomes in our
society that are unsustainable.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.690
So I think we've got many
folks who are looking

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.400
into how we address these.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.330
I personally would like to
see changes in how we treat,

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.360
for instance, carried interest.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:24.630
I also am fairly sober about
the legislative changes there

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.000
that would be required
to pull that off.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.520
Perhaps, you're more optimistic
than I am about that route.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.630
I don't know.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.960
Would you say you are?

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.493
Or--

00:34:32.493 --> 00:34:33.659
AUDIENCE: It's tough to say.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:33.870
Right?

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.828
I mean the current plan
doesn't seem conducive.

00:34:35.828 --> 00:34:39.389
But, you know, we have had
more equitable situations

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.980
in the past.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.287
And so maybe the silver
lining in today's situation,

00:34:43.287 --> 00:34:45.120
if things are perceived
to be broken enough,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.750
that will create
momentum for change.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.208
JAN RIVKIN: Yeah,
and the last time

00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:51.989
we saw inequality at this level
was right before the Great

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:52.860
Depression.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.230
All right, and that
induced, you know,

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.340
in a horribly traumatic
way for our society,

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.470
many of the changes
that I suspect you

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.260
would be very supportive of.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.440
My hope is that do it
this time without a Great

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.710
Depression and a World War.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.510
But I'm also--

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.110
I feel very sober about that.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.964
And I would look at how
financial regulation,

00:35:15.964 --> 00:35:17.630
regulations affect
the financial sector,

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.360
has gone since the
financial crisis.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.100
And I worry that we've
made very little progress.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.130
It is why I place my personal
bets at the local level

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.000
where I see, particularly
local politicians,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.070
it turns out, you know,
that there's just a greater

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.710
degree of accountability
because their trash has

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.590
got to be picked up, and the
snow has got to be cleared.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.050
And otherwise, there
are consequences

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:46.370
that re very real
and almost immediate.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.085
I'd love to see changes
at different levels.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.689
But I try to work where I
think I can make a difference.

00:35:55.689 --> 00:35:57.605
And I encourage others
to work at both levels.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.344
Please, other
thoughts, reflections.

00:36:03.344 --> 00:36:04.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.210
This is amazing.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.543
I probably have 1,000 questions.

00:36:06.543 --> 00:36:08.390
But the one that comes
to my mind-- and I'm

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.680
just interested in
your perspective--

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.929
is, when we talk about
barriers to reaching the shared

00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:14.420
prosperity, one of the
places that at least I place

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.100
a lot of blame is the media.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.720
And I think they don't have a--

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.861
they aren't driven by this.

00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:20.360
Right?

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.740
Like a shared prosperity
doesn't really rise their tide.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.260
It's almost like
the divisiveness

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.130
and getting people--

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.310
bad news is what sells.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.890
Like how do we
overcome as a society

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.810
when we have an us-versus-them,
a CNN versus Fox News?

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.800
And people are driven
down by wherever they are.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.879
And it's sort of like--

00:36:34.879 --> 00:36:36.920
how do we-- if you have
an entire industry that's

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.480
not built around
shared prosperity,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.010
how do we ever achieve it?

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:43.022
JAN RIVKIN: Wow, OK, so
that's a huge, deep question.

00:36:43.022 --> 00:36:44.730
And I'm going to say
the very same thing.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.355
My answer probably won't be so--
the first thing I'd reflect on

00:36:47.355 --> 00:36:49.430
is there's reason the
media is plural, actually.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.040
All right, I think there are
many, many media out there.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.149
And I see some that
do cover the good news

00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:56.690
and really are
focused on this, and I

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.040
see some that seem
to benefit by feeding

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.380
the divisions in our society.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.400
And actually, I
worry, if anything,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.900
the media is being beaten down.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.300
And it plays an important
role in our body politic.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.160
And it's being de-legitimized.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.510
So while I will criticize
parts of the media,

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.890
I also want to come to
their defense at this time.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:27.500
You know, I do think, well, at
least one piece of good news

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.000
here is that these innovative,
cross-sector collaborations

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.340
actually do attract a fair
amount of media attention.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.940
And they, you know, just
choosing some local examples,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.670
so Jon Feinman started
InnerCity Weightlifting.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.170
I don't know if
Google is actually--

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.660
Microsoft here in Kendall
Square is involved.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.770
This is an effort to get
businesses and others engaged

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:55.610
in keeping individuals with
records of incarceration

00:37:55.610 --> 00:38:00.530
employed, positive, and not
going back to jail, basically.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:06.800
It turns out rates of recidivism
are just insanely high

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.150
and partly because there's
just no opportunity.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.990
Because you come out of jail,
and the first thing someone

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.330
asks you is have you
been incarcerated.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:14.930
Yes, you have.

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:15.890
Thank you for applying.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.098
But no thank you for the job.

00:38:17.098 --> 00:38:18.920
Right

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.110
So InnerCity
Weightlifting is an effort

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.030
to train the
individuals coming out

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.420
of jail to be personal
trainers and, particularly,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.496
personal trainers for, in
part, people of real means

00:38:31.496 --> 00:38:32.870
who can then create
opportunities

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:35.400
for these individuals.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.840
ICW, InnerCity Weightlifting,
has got a lot of publicity

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.760
in the local area.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.314
It could use even more.

00:38:41.314 --> 00:38:42.230
But it's gotten a lot.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.999
So I do think there's
a possibility.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.540
Can I turn-- so I've
got to tell you.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.748
I'm a case method instructor.

00:38:47.748 --> 00:38:50.961
So my natural inclination is
to turn the question back.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:51.710
What do you think?

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.390
AUDIENCE: Like I said,
I couldn't agree more

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.800
about the role that the
media is going to have

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.049
to play to get us out of this.

00:38:59.049 --> 00:39:03.170
I just think there are,
like I said I think,

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.050
if you look at the worst of
it, they're driven by division.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.929
Because the more
division, the more people

00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:10.220
are going to tune into their
news and the breaking news

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.053
and everything else.

00:39:11.053 --> 00:39:13.504
I think it's also somewhat
scary that what drives

00:39:13.504 --> 00:39:15.920
people, when you look at it
from the emotional standpoint,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.300
is risk and fear.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.030
And so it's like, when you
look at individual gains,

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.929
be it from media
companies or individuals

00:39:21.929 --> 00:39:23.720
in the political world,
it's like if you're

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.910
tapping into that
emotion, it's what's

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.450
going to get you to continue
to tune in, continue to click.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:29.870
So I just I don't know.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.910
I'm fearful of how do
we break that cycle.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.861
JAN RIVKIN: So for some reason,
division sells for the media.

00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:35.360
Right?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.752
They're not choosing
to publicize division

00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:39.710
because they just like
division, I don't think.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.470
I think that actually there
are strong incentives.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:49.840
So how could we recreate a
media where unity sold instead?

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.390
I mean I'm going to
make it very concrete.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.800
Can you imagine doing
things within Google

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.200
so that the other
kinds of stories,

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.350
actually, were highly
attractive to individuals?

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.020
Or maybe it's deep
in the customer base

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.120
where we just like division,
and we love bad news.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.279
But I don't know
that's the case.

00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:10.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no, I
think there is a lot.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.460
And I think these companies are
doing a ton, including Google.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.330
I just I fear that other
sides of the equation

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:19.430
will just talk
about these bubbles

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.890
that these companies live in.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:23.098
Or and I mean, obviously,
Google was just in the news

00:40:23.098 --> 00:40:25.820
recently for someone
coming out and saying

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.039
that we're all living
in a bubble and kind

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:29.330
of the repercussions from that.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.790
So I that's the hard part.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:36.170
It's like the us-versus-them
has been solidified,

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:38.000
wherever the blame goes.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.850
And it's sort of like how do
you break out of that mentality.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.460
JAN RIVKIN: So
here's my question.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.560
I like to imagine
a world in which

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.720
the creativity of
companies like Google

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.180
and the innovativeness,
a portion

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.760
got focused on these issues.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.570
I know to some degree
they already are.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.140
Right But if you really like
you turned the battleship

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.660
and aimed it straight
at this kind of problem,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.070
imagine what kind of
technological innovations

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.170
you'd have that would
make a difference.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.120
I'll just mention one very small
one, which a student at HBS

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.600
did almost overnight
right after the election.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.080
And I don't know
if any of you saw

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.160
"Hello from the Other Side."

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.330
So it was a website
that, basically,

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.610
if you were on one side of
the election or the other,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.260
would pair you up with
someone from the other side.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.680
So you could have a civil
conversation, all right,

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.180
kind of break down the bubble.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.690
And it's not high-tech.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.190
Right?

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.320
It's not a huge thing.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.111
I'm just wondering what
kind of innovations

00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:37.490
are out there that we've
not even thought about.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.590
Because I do think--

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.660
and this is a broader point
and a speculative point.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.540
You know, part of
the underlying issue

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.200
is the mechanisms for collective
action in our society.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.180
And to some degree,
the mechanisms

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.850
for collective action have
been undermined in recent years

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:56.940
by various forces.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:02.240
So imagine, for instance, global
mobility, global mobility--

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.270
when you were in a little
town, you actually really

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.735
had incentives.

00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:07.860
And you were not going to--

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.710
you were never going to live
outside that little town.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.240
Your incentives to work
with your neighbors

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.240
and make sure the
school systems were good

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.267
and the parts were good
and the art museum was good

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:16.850
were enormous.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.960
Right?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.520
Global mobility comes
in, and collective action

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.100
become harder.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.360
On the other hand, I see
in technological change

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.210
incredible examples
of collective action

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.650
that would be mind boggling.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.460
If I had told you
two decades ago

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.300
that every day you
and I would rely

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.420
upon a crowdsourced
encyclopedia--

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.230
right?

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:40.790
First of all, you wouldn't
know what crowdsourced meant.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.260
Right?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.676
But when someone
explained it, you

00:42:42.676 --> 00:42:44.210
would have said that's crazy.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.630
And you'd be right.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.280
And yet there's Wikipedia.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.580
So there are these
emerging mechanisms

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.170
for collective action.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.470
The question is
can we harness them

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.210
toward building the
commons that we need faster

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.070
than the old mechanisms decay.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.850
So I don't know if it
makes sense to you.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.460
But I think there is a
positive outcome here

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.360
and a positive outlook.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.820
So I saw some other questions.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.565
Let me field them, if I may.

00:43:10.565 --> 00:43:12.440
AUDIENCE: How does
automation play into this?

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.481
You mentioned it earlier.

00:43:13.481 --> 00:43:16.340
But with respect to middle
class and specifically the jobs

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.840
that will be there
for the middle class,

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.410
what role does automation play?

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.197
And it's probably changing
year over year over year

00:43:23.197 --> 00:43:24.630
pretty rapidly.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.110
JAN RIVKIN: So that
question has kept

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.510
a generation of economists
happy or as close

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.510
as they can attain that state.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:36.320
So you know, I think
actually the best

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.870
answer I see to that is actually
talk by David Autor of MIT,

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.790
which you can Google
it, and you can find it.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.850
I think it's called "Why Are
There Still So Many Jobs?"

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:47.720
Right?

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.340
Because we've gone
through many phases

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.340
where people say the
machines are taking our jobs.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.120
Right?

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.695
When we went from agriculture
to mass manufacturing,

00:43:56.695 --> 00:43:58.820
we were sure there weren't
going to be enough jobs.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.540
Right?

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.530
And what happened?

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.720
It turns out that
we human beings

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.900
can consume more
things insatiably.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.400
Right?

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.000
And there's always either
things or services,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.600
and so there are jobs.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.320
And so I think the
answer to the question

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.740
will there be jobs
in the future.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.480
Yes, absolutely.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.880
Will you have a job?

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.340
For the folks in this room, yes.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.080
More broadly, yes,
you'll have a job.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.510
But I think the question
is what job will it be.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.740
Will be a good job?

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.080
And for sure, it will
be a different job.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:34.190
And that brings with it, I
think, a deeply challenging

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:40.400
time period where there will
be shifts in jobs and shifts

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.860
in the skills needed
by individuals.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.290
And you know, I think
the folks in this room,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.920
by and large, are on the
positive side of that, right,

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.660
both because you've
got the skills that

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.450
are needed in the future
and because you've

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:58.892
got the ability to attain
skills you don't have today.

00:44:58.892 --> 00:45:00.350
Unfortunately, our
education system

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.350
has not equipped a lot
of people in the country,

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:06.090
or it has failed to equip many
people in the country for that.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:14.430
And so the question becomes
how do we change that system.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.750
And this is where, I think,
technologically inclined

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.350
individuals and their companies
can make a massive difference.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.702
Right now, the race
I see is sobering.

00:45:23.702 --> 00:45:25.160
The first thing
you should know is,

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.210
when you see people point
to globalization automation,

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.960
they should say
globalization in a whisper

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.240
and automation in a loud voice.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.040
As far as I can
tell from the data,

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.420
the job losses that
you see are about 86%

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:42.021
automation, about
14% globalization.

00:45:42.021 --> 00:45:43.520
You'd never know
that from listening

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.920
to the political discourse.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.790
All right, it's all about
globalization and outshoring.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.240
And I think the
reason, honestly,

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.510
is it's much easier
to say the problem is

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.936
someone in China has your job.

00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:57.560
Someone preferably,
someone who doesn't

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.700
look like you has your job.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.410
And I'm going to fix that.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:01.000
Right?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.620
And not to say it's
automation, and your skills

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.420
aren't advancing fast enough.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.120
So that's the first thing--
so automation, huge thing.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.967
And then in turn, what I find
the most sobering about this--

00:46:10.967 --> 00:46:13.050
and I've talked to a number
of venture capitalists

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.560
about this-- you talk
to VCs, and they'll

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.350
work through their portfolio.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:21.770
And a lot of the
portfolio involves things

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.149
they know will displace jobs.

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.190
They'll also create jobs.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.120
But they'll displace jobs.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.280
And then, occasionally,
an enlightened one

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.254
will say I'm also looking for
an investment in retraining

00:46:36.254 --> 00:46:37.670
because I know
there's going to be

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.250
some huge need for retraining.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.290
And yet, I can't find
the organizations

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:46.950
that are doing retraining in
an innovative, massive way.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.390
And so I think the main
social challenge we've got

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.130
is how do we make
the transition.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.790
And particularly, can we
bring some of the tools

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:58.820
that technology
brings to enable that?

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.990
And I haven't seen anyone
with a great answer to that.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.640
What worries me the most is I
see the private sector creating

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.270
the automation.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.830
And I see the retraining
largely in the public sector.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.150
And I kind of know how
that race is likely to end.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.620
Right?

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:16.340
And it's deeply,
deeply worrying.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.460
Other thoughts or questions?

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.480
Yes, please.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.570
AUDIENCE: So one
of the arguments

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.520
I've heard from
people who tend to be

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.180
on the extreme conservative or
liberal side of the spectrum,

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.860
when confronted with
this type of data,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.060
is that yes, but people
in the lower income

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.114
percentile actually don't
have it as bad as they did

00:47:39.114 --> 00:47:40.280
during the Great Depression.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.670
So it's not really so
bad because of technology

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.130
and that that will continue
to make people's lives better

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.970
across the board.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.790
And I just wanted to get
your perspective on it.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.665
JAN RIVKIN: Yeah, no.

00:47:49.665 --> 00:47:52.167
I think it's a great question.

00:47:52.167 --> 00:47:53.750
I think there's some
real truth in it.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:59.030
And there's also evidence
that points against it.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:02.660
The real truth in it is we
have a hard time putting

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:07.520
into economic terms adjustments
for how better off am I

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.480
because I've got access
to my smartphone.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.190
Right?

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:17.330
And the economic technology
for accounting for that

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.555
is not very good.

00:48:19.555 --> 00:48:20.930
The other evidence
I see, though,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.870
is if things are so good at that
end of the income distribution,

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.020
why are people so mad.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.880
Right?

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.870
I don't see--

00:48:32.614 --> 00:48:34.530
I don't have a great
answer for that question.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.410
Right?

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.680
So for sure, we should
get better at measuring.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.260
But I think we also have
to look in the eye--

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.330
the monster that's out there.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.740
And so, you know,
there's another, I think,

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:50.610
deeply interesting question.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.730
Some of my colleagues
work on it.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:53.450
I don't.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.950
And that is what are the
determinants of happiness.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.070
Right Is it actually
absolute or relative wealth?

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.650
And if it's relative
wealth, then, yes, I'm

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.420
better off in absolute
terms than people

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.586
during the Great Depression.

00:49:06.586 --> 00:49:09.140
But I'm actually no happier.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.090
So you know, I think it's a deep
question, not one to which I

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.984
have a great answer.

00:49:15.984 --> 00:49:17.150
Other thoughts or questions?

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.404
Eva.

00:49:19.404 --> 00:49:22.390
EVA: Coming from Germany,
I was living in Germany l

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.800
those days, are there
any lessons learned

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.540
from different countries, from
different economies that we

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.470
[INAUDIBLE] here in the US?

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.430
JAN RIVKIN: Yeah, no, I
think there are great lessons

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.120
in both directions.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.900
The first thing I'd
say is our focus here--

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.850
and I worried about
it for an audience

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:40.410
as international as Google.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.880
Right?

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.700
The focus here is on the US.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.830
You know, at HBS, we
teach by the case method.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.690
I view the US as, essentially,
the world's largest case study.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.190
Right?

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.810
And I think many
of the issues we

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.050
see here, in different variants,
apply to advanced economies

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.570
around the world.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.290
I think there are indicators
that the same kinds of problems

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:02.700
are arising around the world--

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.950
Brexit, actually, the in
Germany just recently.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:06.450
Right?

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.590
I mean I think we can
see that showing up

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.640
in the rise of the far right.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.920
Are there lessons from
the rest of the world

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.690
that the US can learn?

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:20.100
Absolutely, and I think probably
the apprenticeship system

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:25.140
and the educational
system in northern Europe

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.010
may be the best example.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.270
The US, for very good reasons,
very well-intended reasons,

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:38.225
got on a kick toward college
for all, right, and, somehow

00:50:38.225 --> 00:50:40.725
or the other, got the impression
out there among individuals

00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:42.630
that a college degree,
a bachelor's degree,

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:46.770
no matter what it was in,
right, was the path to success.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:50.760
And other kinds of
blue collar jobs

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.380
just they weren't
knowledge work.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.351
They weren't worthy.

00:50:53.351 --> 00:50:53.850
Right?

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.320
You couldn't
convince your parents

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.690
this is where you should go.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.910
I think that's proven just
to be absolutely wrong.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:03.300
And in fact, manufacturing
is knowledge work these days.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.065
And there are great jobs
out there that are unfilled.

00:51:06.065 --> 00:51:07.890
All right?

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:11.640
And I think Europe has been
much better, much, much better,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.700
at making sure the
idea of the education

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.370
was to get people toward
fulfilling and prosperous

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:21.090
lives, not necessarily
toward a college degree.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:27.870
That said, I understand
deeply, I hope,

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.760
why people are so
focused on this.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.130
I was speaking with an
African-American colleague

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.730
about this.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:35.010
And I asked him, why this
college for all thing?

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.500
And he said, basically, look.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.950
When you say something not
college for all, what you hear

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.270
is not college for all.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:44.400
What I hear is
college for people

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.630
who look a certain way and
not college for other people.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.750
So how we create multiple
paths to prosperity,

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.990
as some colleagues at the
Ed School have put it,

00:51:54.990 --> 00:52:00.050
while also creating opportunity
that's fairly broadly spread,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.550
I think it's something that's
a uniquely American challenge.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:06.090
And we've got to take things
like the apprenticeship system

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.890
from Europe and figure out
how we do it in a way that's

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.086
tailored to this country.

00:52:13.086 --> 00:52:14.460
I'll just end with
one last word.

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.590
I genuinely think--

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.290
I genuinely think we are at
a crossroads in the country.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:20.790
But the good news is there
actually are two paths.

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.081
We're actually at a crossroads.

00:52:22.081 --> 00:52:22.650
Right?

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.380
There's one path, which is
a kind of path toward unity,

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.510
where, for instance,
business leaders understand

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:30.450
the enlightened
self-interest they have,

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.280
that they invest in the commons.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.230
They work with the
local government.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:35.980
And we actually build
the commons back up.

00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.479
There's another
path, unfortunately,

00:52:37.479 --> 00:52:38.970
which is the path
toward division,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:43.500
and so a path where politicians
realize that, given the media

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.110
we've got, dividing
us against one

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:47.790
another is the path
towards success.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:51.060
And business interests pursue
their narrow self-interest.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.210
And we don't address the
issues in the financial sector

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.010
other sectors of our economy.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:59.187
And we let the
commons deteriorate.

00:52:59.187 --> 00:53:01.020
But I think they're are
generally two paths.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.280
And the cool part about it
is we actually get to decide.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.670
There are forces
of globalization

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.650
or technological change, which
make one path a little rockier

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:11.730
than the other.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.740
But individually
and collectively,

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.970
we can choose the path.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.310
And I hope we all
choose the right one.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.190
Thank you very much for your
thoughts and your questions

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.280
and for your time today.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:21.780
Thanks.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.230
