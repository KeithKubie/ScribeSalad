00:00:00.500 --> 00:01:27.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940
ROB EASTAWAY: Now, you'd
probably think that something

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.750
as repetitive as this
is going to be some

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.050
really obvious pattern.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.260
But that is not the case.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.710
If I pull it out, it goes peak,
peak, valley, valley,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.150
peak, valley, valley.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.190
So what's the pattern here?

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.940
And indeed, can you predict
what's going to happen?
