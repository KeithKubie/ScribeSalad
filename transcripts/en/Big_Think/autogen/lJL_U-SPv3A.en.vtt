willpower to make a decision you've
already made that decision you're just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
already made that decision you're just
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799
already made that decision you're just
moving forward and so it happens easily

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
moving forward and so it happens easily
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.119

you're just on cruise control and then

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
you're just on cruise control and then
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330
you're just on cruise control and then
you can do what you want to get done how

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
you can do what you want to get done how
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520

that is like the invisible architecture

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
that is like the invisible architecture
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.799
that is like the invisible architecture
of everyday life research shows that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
of everyday life research shows that
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380
of everyday life research shows that
something like 40% of what we do every

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
something like 40% of what we do every
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000
something like 40% of what we do every
day we do in pretty much the same way

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
day we do in pretty much the same way
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220
day we do in pretty much the same way
and in the same context so it's easy to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
and in the same context so it's easy to
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720
and in the same context so it's easy to
see that if you have habits that work

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
see that if you have habits that work
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549
see that if you have habits that work
for you you're much more likely to be

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
for you you're much more likely to be
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650
for you you're much more likely to be
happier healthy and more productive if

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
happier healthy and more productive if
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360
happier healthy and more productive if
you have habits that don't work for you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
you have habits that don't work for you
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619
you have habits that don't work for you

it's really going to drag you down
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840
it's really going to drag you down
because it's a big part of our days is

because it's a big part of our days is
taken up by habits one of the mysteries

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
taken up by habits one of the mysteries
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990
taken up by habits one of the mysteries
of habits is why do we persist in having

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
of habits is why do we persist in having
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.609
of habits is why do we persist in having
bad habits when we know they're not good

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
bad habits when we know they're not good
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350
bad habits when we know they're not good
for us when they know they don't make us

decision making you can just decide one

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
decision making you can just decide one

time what you're going to do and then
you don't revisit that decision because

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
you don't revisit that decision because
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249
you don't revisit that decision because
every time we make a decision we have

the opportunity to decide wrong
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.850
the opportunity to decide wrong
and even if we decide correctly we still
