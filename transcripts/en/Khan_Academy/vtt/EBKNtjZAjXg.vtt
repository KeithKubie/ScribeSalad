00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.370
Sort the expressions
according to their values.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.640
You can put any number
of cards in a category

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.717
or leave a category empty.

00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:09.550
And so we have this
diagram right over here,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.310
then we have these cards
that have these expressions.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.416
And we're supposed to sort
these into different buckets.

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:16.790
So we're trying
to say, well what

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.000
is the length of segment AC
over the length of segment

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.030
BC equal to?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.130
Which of these expressions
is it equal to?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.109
And then we should drag it
into the appropriate buckets.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.650
So to figure these
out, I've actually

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.750
already redrawn this
problem on my little

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.050
I guess you call it scratch
pad or blackboard, whatever

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.220
you want to call it.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.960
This right over here
is that same diagram

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.110
blown up a little bit.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.799
Here are the expressions that
we need to drag into things.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.340
And here are the
buckets that we need

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.506
to see which of these
expressions are equal to which

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:46.930
of these expressions.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.510
So let's first look at this.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
The length of segment AC over
the length of segment BC.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.089
So let's think about what AC is.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.130
The length of segment AC.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.460
AC is this right here.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.480
So it's this length right
over here in purple over

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.280
the length of segment BC, over
this length right over here.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.040
So it's the ratio of
the lengths of two

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.560
sides of a right triangle.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.525
This is clearly a right
triangle, triangle ABC.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:18.900
And I could color
that in just so

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.608
you know what triangle
I'm talking about.

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:24.730
Triangle ABC is
this entire triangle

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.112
that we could focus on.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:27.820
So you could imagine
that it's reasonable

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.820
that the ratio of two
sides of a right triangle

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.440
are going to be the sine
of one of its angles.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.040
And they give us one of
the angles right over here.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.684
They give us this
angle right over here.

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:40.600
You say, well all they
did is mark that angle.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.360
But notice, one arc is
here, one arc is here.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.880
So anywhere we see only one arc,
that's going to be 30 degrees.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.900
So this is 30 degrees as well.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.052
You have two arcs here,
that's 41 degrees.

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:53.260
Two arcs here, this is going
to be congruent to that.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.070
This over here is
going to be 41 degrees.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.940
This is three arcs.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.360
They don't tell us how
many degrees that is,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.160
but this angle
with the three arcs

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.380
is congruent to this
angle with the three arcs

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.290
right over there.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.990
So anyway, this yellow
triangle, triangle ABC,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.620
we know the measure of
this angle is 30 degrees.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.590
And then they give
us these two sides.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.860
So how do these sides relate
to this 30 degree angle?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.610
Well, side AC is adjacent to it.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.270
It's literally, it's one of the
sides of the angle that is not

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.190
the hypotenuse, so let
me write that down.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.606
This is adjacent.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.510
And what is BC?

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.510
Well, BC is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.030
It's the side opposite
the 90 degrees.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.860
So this is the hypotenuse.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.050
So what trig function,
when applied to 30 degrees,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.220
is equal to the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790
Let's write down sohcahtoa
just to remind ourselves.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.700
So soh cah toa.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.840
Sine of an angle is
opposite over hypotenuse,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.700
cosine of an angle is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.950
So cosine, let's write this
down, cosine of 30 degrees

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.580
is going to be equal to the
length of the adjacent side.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.080
So that is AC, over the length
of the hypotenuse, which

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.840
is equal to BC.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.120
So this right over
here is the same thing

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.300
as the cosine of 30 degrees.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.690
So let's drag it in there.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.070
This is equal to the
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.700
Now let's look at the next one.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.976
Cosine of angle DEC.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.780
Where is DEC?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.680
So DEC-- D, E, C. So that's
this angle right over here.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.040
I'll put four arcs here so
we don't get it confused.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.790
So this is angle DEC.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.640
So what is the cosine of DEC?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.300
Well once again, cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.740
So cosine of angle DEC,
the adjacent side to this,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.986
well that's this
right over here.

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:04.860
You might say, well
isn't this side adjacent?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.527
Well that side, side DE, that
is the actual hypotenuse.

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:09.360
So that's not going to
be the adjacent side.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.060
So the adjacent side
is, I could call it EC.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.190
It's the length of segment EC.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.800
And then the hypotenuse
is this right over here.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.770
The length of the hypotenuse--
the hypotenuse is side DE,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.050
or ED, however you
want to call it.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.650
And so the length of it is,
we could just write it as DE.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.132
Now what is this also equal to?

00:04:33.132 --> 00:04:34.590
We don't see this
choice over here.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.970
We don't have the ratio EC
over DE as one of these choices

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.170
here.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.050
But what we do have is one of--
we do get one of the angles

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.550
here.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.880
They give us this 41 degrees.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.670
And the ratio of this green
side over-- the length

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.380
of this green side over this
orange side, what would that

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.010
be in terms of, if
we wanted to apply

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.110
a trig function to this angle?

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.840
Well, relative to this
angle, the green side

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.240
is the opposite side,
and the orange side

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.800
is still the hypotenuse.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.120
So relative to 41
degrees-- so let's

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.190
write this down--
relative to 41 degrees,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.310
this ratio is the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.470
It's the cosine of
this angle, but it's

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.260
the sine of this
angle right over here.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.930
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.700
So this is equal to the sine
of this angle right over here.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.200
It's equal to the
sine of 41 degrees.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.790
So that is this one
right over here.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.430
The sine of 41 degrees.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.000
So let's drag that in to
the appropriate bucket.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.280
Sine of 41 degrees
is the same thing

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.830
as the cosine of angle DEC.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.780
Only have two left.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.060
So now we have to figure out
what the sine of angle CDA is.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.890
So let's see, where is CDA?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.380
CDA is this entire angle.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.987
It's this entire
angle right over here.

00:05:59.987 --> 00:06:02.070
So I could put a bunch of
arcs here if I want just

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.510
to show that it's different
than all the other ones.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.090
So that's that angle
right over there.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.950
So now we're really dealing
with this larger right triangle.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.850
Let me highlight it
in this pink color.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.340
So we're now dealing with
this larger right triangle

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.289
right over here.

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.080
We care about the sine
of this whole thing.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.003
Remember, sine is
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:35.800
So the opposite side
is going to be side CA.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.700
So this is going to be
equal to the length of CA

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.840
over the hypotenuse,
which is AD.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.080
So that is going to be over AD.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.520
And once again, we don't
see that as a choice here.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.260
But maybe we can express
this ratio-- maybe

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.370
this ratio is a trig
function applied

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.562
to one of the other angles.

00:07:02.562 --> 00:07:04.020
And they give us
one of the angles.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.686
They give us this
angle right over here.

00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:08.080
I guess we could
call this angle DAC.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.990
This is 30 degrees.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.145
So relative to this
angle, what two sides

00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:13.270
are we taking the ratio of?

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.780
We're taking, now, the ratio
of, relative to this angle,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.850
the adjacent side
over the hypotenuse.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.440
So this is the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.260
What deals with adjacent
over hypotenuse?

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.840
Well, cosine.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.670
So this is equal to the
cosine of this angle.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.960
So this is equal to
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.770
Sine of CDA is
equal to the cosine

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.180
of this angle right over here.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.490
So this one is equal to
this right over here.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.730
So let me drag that in.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.182
So this one is equal to--
so you can see that I just

00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:53.510
dragged it in-- equal to that.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.320
Now we have one left.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.180
We have one left.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.740
Home stretch, we should
be getting excited.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.770
AE over EB.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.150
AE, let me use this color.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.450
Length of segment AE.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.820
That's this length
right over here.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.540
Let me make that stand out more.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.501
Let me do it in this red.

00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:16.240
This color right over here,
that's length of segment AE,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.734
over length of segment EB.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.180
This is EB right over here.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.320
This is EB.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.590
So now we are focused on this
right triangle right over here.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.890
Well, we know the measure
of this angle over here.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:42.270
We have double arcs
right over here,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.500
and they say this is 41 degrees.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.320
So we have double
marks over here,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.960
and this is also going
to be 41 degrees.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.620
So relative to this
angle, what ratio is this?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.860
This is the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.900
Opposite over the hypotenuse,
this right over here

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.090
is going to be sine of that
angle, sine of 41 degrees.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.460
So it's equal to this
first one right over there.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.950
So let's drag it.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.190
So this is going to be
equal to sine of 41 degrees.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.890
So none of the ones
actually ended up

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.960
