00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.360
So before we were dragging fields onto the page.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.700
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.440
&gt;&gt; But now what were trying to drag on, is a list of related records.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I should click Related List over here.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.270
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, good. Set times, and I'll drag it down and that's lovely.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.610
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Click Save. Don't forget that guy.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you. You've added or moved Related Lists

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.420
to this page layout. Yeah, I always want to overwrite.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.330
&gt;&gt; We want everyone to see the set times.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Set times are important.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.320
Cool, set times. But that's totally lame, I don't care about ST 0001.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.220
&gt;&gt; Can I get more information than it?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180
&gt;&gt; So the auto-number isn't too useful. But we

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.090
can also from the page layout modify what shows up

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060
in this related list. So let's actually go back

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.690
into the layout, or page layout editor and fix that.
