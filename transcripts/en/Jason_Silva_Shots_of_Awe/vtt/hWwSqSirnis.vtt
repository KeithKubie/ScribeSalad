00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.510
SUBJECT: So I'm interested
in the kinds of ideas

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.820
that dissolve boundaries, that
remind us of what is possible,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.350
that encourage us to
think differently,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.950
to probe at the
adjacent possible.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.830
There's great line that says,
once a mind is stretched

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.530
by a new idea, it
will never return

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.625
to its original position.

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:39.230
The kind of things that
make us question everything.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.160
And Tom Robbins has
a great description.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.310
He says a cyclone
of unorthodox ideas

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.170
that will raise every every,
any mind out of its cognitive

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.310
Kansas.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.470
In other words, we
are like Dorothy,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.690
and we crave the
kind of whirlwind

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.880
of ideas that will transport us,
transfigurate us, and land us

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.440
in Oz, a place where there is
room for mystery, a place where

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.380
there's room for
juxtaposition and surrealism,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.940
a reenchanted world, again,
where everything is possible.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.920
That's what powerful ideas do.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.330
They are inceptions.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.620
They are planted in there
and transform us from within.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.870
And now all of us are
broadcasters, right?

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.790
Programmers.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.800
We don't just passively take in.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.680
We produce and publish.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.720
And so it's up to us to
get the kind of ideas

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080
out of into the world that
will spread mimetically

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.120
and that will collectively
upgrade mankind.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.740
It's our responsibility, as the
co-authors of the memespace,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.480
to tell great stories, to
enliven the imagination,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.800
to stretch our brains
beyond the cognitive Kansas.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.610
This should be our anthem.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.780
This is our responsibility.
