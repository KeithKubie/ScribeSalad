00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.550
New research from Drexel University uncovered
that a branch of army ants who lived underground

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.509
for 60 million years moved to the surface
18 million years ago and regrew the vision-related

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.980
parts and increased the size of their brains.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.680
And researchers from Massachusetts General
Hospital are working on regenerating functional

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480
heart muscle - the first steps in creating
bioengineered human hearts.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480
Vsauce!

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
Kevin here.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.280
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.219
Metaskin can make things invisible to radar.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.249
The stretchable material, developed at Iowa
State University, manipulates electromagnetic

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.679
waves using electric rings filled with liquid
metal.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.219
The rings absorb radar frequency waves, so
an object covered in this material would essentially

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.570
be impossible to detect using radar.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.979
In the 70 years since PET plastics have been
in existence, a bacterium has already evolved

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:58.339
to eat it.

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.889
Researchers in Japan discovered the species
attaching to PET with tendril-like threads

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:08.729
and using two enzymes to break it down into
its original substances which aren’t environmentally

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.729
harmful.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.810
The goal now is to speed up the process which
currently takes about six weeks to eat a thumbnail-sized

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.140
piece.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.229
Computer vision is being used to find the
exact image you’re looking for.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.140
Taking a huge leap forward in 2012, computer
vision is now used in Facebook’s facial

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.329
recognition, which was featured in Mind Blow
#80, as well as Google’s image CAPTCHA.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.369
Image searches are typically hampered by keywords,
which works okay if you want to find any old

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.680
picture of a blue bike but not great if you
need a very specific blue bike.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.760
Shutterstock’s new computer vision model
uses an image's raw pixel data to understand

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.460
what is contained within the image, enabling
it to break the image down into its dominant

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.259
features that can be used to find visually
similar images, as well as perform a reverse

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.079
image search of 70 million images.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.360
All of this occurring in double-digit milliseconds.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.189
Advances in computer vision will aid automated
vehicles and robot sight.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.119
Researchers have proven a technique that allows
kidneys to be donated to anyone.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.519
Traditionally, a compatible donor would not
only need the right blood type, but also the

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.340
correct combination of 6 antigens.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.590
The chances of which are 1 in 100,000.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.670
Sadly, around 4,500 people in the U.S. alone,
die annually waiting for that match.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.489
But with their Desensitization technique,
new antigens are regenerated that are less

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.340
likely to attack a newly transplanted organ,
lessening the chance for rejection and increasing

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.510
the chance of survival.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.650
A potential game changer for kidney transplants.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.489
Nima is a portable gluten sensor.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.209
By putting a sample of the food in a disposable
capsule, the sensors in the device tell you

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.900
if there’s 20 parts per million or more
of gluten and then display the results on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.459
the front - with an accuracy of 99.5%.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.970
And they’re currently developing tests to
launch a similar device for peanuts and dairy.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.190
A new bionic fingertip allows amputees to
feel with their phantom hand.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.460
Researchers at EPFL surgically implanted electrodes
into the nerve system of the amputee which

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.879
receive electrical signals from the artificial
fingertip.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.400
A person with an intact hand can also feel
the same sensation - which helps accelerate

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.890
the research toward developing prosthetics
that can feel surfaces.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.549
Mind Blow #84 featured bio bots, 3D printed
scaffolds connected by engineered skeletal

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.140
muscle tissue controlled with electrical or
optical signals.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.370
Well they’re now hoping to make biobots
with neurons that could sense specific chemicals

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.350
and tell the muscle to move.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.819
With potential applications like environmental
cleanup and clot-busting bots to treat cardiovascular

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.829
disease.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.569
Mind Blow #62 uncovered a real world touchscreen
developed by Fujitsu Laboratories that used

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.950
a projector and a webcam to allow you to digitally
manipulate objects on a table.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.439
Recently Sony’s Future Lab unveiled it’s
own touch-sensitive tabletop prototype.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.680
Their proof of concept identifies a book including
text and illustrations which become animated

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.689
when you touch them.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.890
It also allows you to highlight text, making
reading and learning an interactive experience.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.840
Finally, Johns Hopkins Physics Laboratory
has developed an unmanned aerial vehicle that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.110
can launch from underwater.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.530
CRACUNS can remain at and launch from a depth
of several hundred feet without needing structural

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.310
metal parts or machine surfaces.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.910
I’m gonna leave you with a hexapod walking
on unstructured terrain - and as always thanks

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.340
for watching.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:52.190
And here it is.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.880
The greatest advance in television since color
television itself.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.150
Take the remote unit from its handy storage
space and you’re set for hours of pure pleasure.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.229
See all regular programs in crisp, clear,
black and white.

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.370
This selector button changes changes clockwise
while this front-window channel indicator

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.050
lets you know at a glance what channel you’re
viewing.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.300
Yes, here is the ultimate in television.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.030
A supreme achievement in television engineering.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:36.230
Armchair convenience, luxurious styling, a
set where the pride of ownership is truly

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:50.370
second only 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.460
to the pleasure.
