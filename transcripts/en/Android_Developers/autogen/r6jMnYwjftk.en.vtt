hello and welcome once again to Android
design in action I'm your host Roman

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
design in action I'm your host Roman
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.839
design in action I'm your host Roman
Nurik and hi my name is Nick butcher and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
Nurik and hi my name is Nick butcher and
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.250
Nurik and hi my name is Nick butcher and
today we're gonna be talking about

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
today we're gonna be talking about
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.890
today we're gonna be talking about
designing collections collections

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
designing collections collections
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720
designing collections collections
specifically I guess while talking about

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
specifically I guess while talking about
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700
specifically I guess while talking about
what we mean by collections in a second

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
what we mean by collections in a second
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519
what we mean by collections in a second
but you know collections are all about

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
but you know collections are all about
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650
but you know collections are all about
lists presenting lists of objects and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
lists presenting lists of objects and
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570
lists presenting lists of objects and
you know collections of things groups of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
you know collections of things groups of
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.740
you know collections of things groups of
objects anyway let's just jump in so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
objects anyway let's just jump in so
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630
objects anyway let's just jump in so
like you said collections are really

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
like you said collections are really
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.770
like you said collections are really
just groups of objects I guess things

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
just groups of objects I guess things
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170
just groups of objects I guess things
like you know a list of of items and a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
like you know a list of of items and a
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.140
like you know a list of of items and a
shopping card or a list of books things

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150
shopping card or a list of books things
 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.180
shopping card or a list of books things
like that so today we're going to be

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
like that so today we're going to be
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.730
like that so today we're going to be
talking about a couple of things I guess

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740
talking about a couple of things I guess
 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.550
talking about a couple of things I guess
we're gonna be talking about consumption

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560
we're gonna be talking about consumption
 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.130
we're gonna be talking about consumption
of collections as well as mutation of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
of collections as well as mutation of
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900
of collections as well as mutation of
collections by consumption of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
collections by consumption of
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.500
collections by consumption of
collections really mean things like you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
collections really mean things like you
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000
collections really mean things like you
know being able to view a collection

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
know being able to view a collection
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.980
know being able to view a collection
obviously being able to search through

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990
obviously being able to search through
 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.649
obviously being able to search through
it filter through it things like that as

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
it filter through it things like that as
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469
it filter through it things like that as
well as things like responsive design

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
well as things like responsive design
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450
well as things like responsive design
for collections and Nick will do a bit

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
for collections and Nick will do a bit
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.480
for collections and Nick will do a bit
about that and then also we're going to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
about that and then also we're going to
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370
about that and then also we're going to
talk about mutations of collections

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
talk about mutations of collections
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.919
talk about mutations of collections
specifically ways in which you can allow

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929
specifically ways in which you can allow
 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.349
specifically ways in which you can allow
users to add items remove items from a

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359
users to add items remove items from a
 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.450
users to add items remove items from a
collection reorder them as well as take

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
collection reorder them as well as take
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.440
collection reorder them as well as take
action on certain items in a collection

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450
action on certain items in a collection
 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.459
action on certain items in a collection
all right so I know there was a super

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469
all right so I know there was a super
 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.999
all right so I know there was a super
fast intro before we jump into all these

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
fast intro before we jump into all these
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.510
fast intro before we jump into all these
specific details we just want to look at

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
specific details we just want to look at
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.730
specific details we just want to look at
one thing first is the basic

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
one thing first is the basic
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370
one thing first is the basic
presentation so throughout the rest of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
presentation so throughout the rest of
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.319
presentation so throughout the rest of
this these slides that throughout the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
this these slides that throughout the
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.779
this these slides that throughout the
rest of today's episode we're going to

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789
rest of today's episode we're going to
 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.849
rest of today's episode we're going to
be looking at very specific details but

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859
be looking at very specific details but
 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.410
be looking at very specific details but
from a very high level this is stuff

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
from a very high level this is stuff
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760
from a very high level this is stuff
that we were obviously already talked

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
that we were obviously already talked
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830
that we were obviously already talked
about in the past we're going to be

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
about in the past we're going to be
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.419
about in the past we're going to be
looking at collections from the number

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429
looking at collections from the number
 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.550
looking at collections from the number
of different viewpoints obviously you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
of different viewpoints obviously you
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.429
of different viewpoints obviously you
know you can use a list to present a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
know you can use a list to present a
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499
know you can use a list to present a
collection of objects a grid presented

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
collection of objects a grid presented
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.849
collection of objects a grid presented
list of objects or a collection of

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859
list of objects or a collection of
 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.989
list of objects or a collection of
objects as well as as well as something

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999
objects as well as as well as something
 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.809
objects as well as as well as something
like a viewpager X wiped between

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819
like a viewpager X wiped between
 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.130
like a viewpager X wiped between
different items within a collection

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
different items within a collection
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.510
different items within a collection
we're going to be focusing on the first

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
we're going to be focusing on the first
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.770
we're going to be focusing on the first
two here we're not going to spend too

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
two here we're not going to spend too
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260
two here we're not going to spend too
much time on the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270
much time on the
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.270
much time on the
on the the viewpager the swiping between

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
on the the viewpager the swiping between
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.960
on the the viewpager the swiping between
items so yeah just kind of you know bear

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
items so yeah just kind of you know bear
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.760
items so yeah just kind of you know bear
that keep that in mind they guess before

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
that keep that in mind they guess before
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.290
that keep that in mind they guess before
we jump in and make you want to add

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
we jump in and make you want to add
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.400
we jump in and make you want to add
anything to that super fast intro no no

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
anything to that super fast intro no no
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.600
anything to that super fast intro no no
as you said we're not going to talk

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
as you said we're not going to talk
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.860
as you said we're not going to talk
about you know what a list is what a

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
about you know what a list is what a
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.260
about you know what a list is what a
crit is we're going to more kind of go

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
crit is we're going to more kind of go
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.720
crit is we're going to more kind of go
through the options you have on Android

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730
through the options you have on Android
 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.980
through the options you have on Android
for working with these collections do

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
for working with these collections do
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.670
for working with these collections do
any things to them cool all right so

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
any things to them cool all right so
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.570
any things to them cool all right so
let's jump in to collection consumption

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580
let's jump in to collection consumption
 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.170
let's jump in to collection consumption
Nick do you want to talk about

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
Nick do you want to talk about
 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.210
Nick do you want to talk about
collection consumption you know

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
collection consumption you know
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.210
collection consumption you know
absolutely so here we've we've kind of

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
absolutely so here we've we've kind of
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820
absolutely so here we've we've kind of
called this section distillation so this

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
called this section distillation so this
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.800
called this section distillation so this
is when you're acting upon items and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
is when you're acting upon items and
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.760
is when you're acting upon items and
we're in the collection kind of

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
we're in the collection kind of
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.700
we're in the collection kind of
refinement and so forth so we pulled up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
refinement and so forth so we pulled up
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.800
refinement and so forth so we pulled up
three examples here on this slide the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
three examples here on this slide the
 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.870
three examples here on this slide the
first of which is a quick way to kind of

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880
first of which is a quick way to kind of
 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.030
first of which is a quick way to kind of
section and navigate around content

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
section and navigate around content
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.710
section and navigate around content
within the collection and so some

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
within the collection and so some
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.910
within the collection and so some
standard ways of doing that on Android

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
standard ways of doing that on Android
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.500
standard ways of doing that on Android
we've pulled out working from left to

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
we've pulled out working from left to
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.290
we've pulled out working from left to
right first off we have this combination

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300
right first off we have this combination
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.290
right first off we have this combination
of headers and with an index fast scroll

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300
of headers and with an index fast scroll
 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.810
of headers and with an index fast scroll
thumb so in this example here we're

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
thumb so in this example here we're
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.520
thumb so in this example here we're
using the people app for your list of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
using the people app for your list of
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.960
using the people app for your list of
your kind of people and contacts and so

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
your kind of people and contacts and so
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.360
your kind of people and contacts and so
forth so you can see that each of the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
forth so you can see that each of the
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.950
forth so you can see that each of the
kind of letters of the alphabet has a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960
kind of letters of the alphabet has a
 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.870
kind of letters of the alphabet has a
section and in this instance it's using

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880
section and in this instance it's using
 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.090
section and in this instance it's using
a person of course sticky headers so you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
a person of course sticky headers so you
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.610
a person of course sticky headers so you
can see here that E has stuck to the top

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620
can see here that E has stuck to the top
 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.200
can see here that E has stuck to the top
and will stay in place until it's called

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210
and will stay in place until it's called
 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.720
and will stay in place until it's called
our view by the next section here there

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
our view by the next section here there
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030
our view by the next section here there

of the action bar which allows you to

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030
of the action bar which allows you to
 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.880
of the action bar which allows you to
kind of flick the the representation of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890
kind of flick the the representation of
 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190
kind of flick the the representation of

view your collection of photos is either
 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.430
view your collection of photos is either
a grid of photos or you can get this

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
a grid of photos or you can get this
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.140

talk about is sorting so in this example

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270
talk about is sorting so in this example
 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.269

here on the right from a former episode
of Atia we're using a action bar button

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:47.749
of Atia we're using a action bar button
 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.409
of Atia we're using a action bar button
in order to reveal a submenu to do some

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419
in order to reveal a submenu to do some
 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.239
in order to reveal a submenu to do some
sort so if you see either kind of the

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:52.249
sort so if you see either kind of the
 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:53.859
sort so if you see either kind of the
free lines action button this is the

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:53.869
free lines action button this is the
 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:56.529
free lines action button this is the
standard iconography on Android for

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539
standard iconography on Android for
 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.279
standard iconography on Android for
sorting pressing that reveals a submenu

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289
sorting pressing that reveals a submenu
 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.929
sorting pressing that reveals a submenu
which lets you pick how you want eat and

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939
which lets you pick how you want eat and
 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.480
which lets you pick how you want eat and
data sorted so pretty simple stuff these

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490
data sorted so pretty simple stuff these
 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.070
data sorted so pretty simple stuff these
are the common ways on Android which you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080
are the common ways on Android which you
 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.899
are the common ways on Android which you
can do these kind of and distillation

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909
can do these kind of and distillation
 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.929
can do these kind of and distillation
type behaviors yeah one more thing I

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939
type behaviors yeah one more thing I
 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.339
type behaviors yeah one more thing I
wanted to mention is that another way to

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349
wanted to mention is that another way to
 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.799
wanted to mention is that another way to
do the the view change is to have an

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:14.809
do the the view change is to have an
 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.409
do the the view change is to have an
action bar button that lets you toggle

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419
action bar button that lets you toggle
 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.119
action bar button that lets you toggle
the view but actually find that what

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129
the view but actually find that what
 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.040
the view but actually find that what
what gallery does here is actually kind

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050
what gallery does here is actually kind
 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.409
what gallery does here is actually kind
of neat it kind of expresses both the

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419
of neat it kind of expresses both the
 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.209
of neat it kind of expresses both the
the title of the current screen as well

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219
the title of the current screen as well
 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.989
the title of the current screen as well
as the the type of view all in the in

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999
as the the type of view all in the in
 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.759
as the the type of view all in the in
the top-left kind of view details area

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:30.769
the top-left kind of view details area
 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:32.169
the top-left kind of view details area
which is it's kind of a neat way to

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:32.179
which is it's kind of a neat way to
 

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.869
which is it's kind of a neat way to
expose that and then anytime you you

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879
expose that and then anytime you you
 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.920
expose that and then anytime you you
know you press the spinner and make a

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
know you press the spinner and make a
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:36.399
know you press the spinner and make a
change

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409
change
 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.769
change
only the subtitle I guess changes the

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779
only the subtitle I guess changes the
 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.989
only the subtitle I guess changes the
the top title camera doesn't change

00:05:40.989 --> 00:05:40.999
the top title camera doesn't change
 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.230
the top title camera doesn't change
which is pretty cool definitely alright

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240
which is pretty cool definitely alright
 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.670
which is pretty cool definitely alright
moving on okay so some more types of

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680
moving on okay so some more types of
 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.189
moving on okay so some more types of
distillation we have here is in these

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199
distillation we have here is in these
 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.749
distillation we have here is in these
are kind of slightly different to the

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759
are kind of slightly different to the
 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.670
are kind of slightly different to the
previous types in that these

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680
previous types in that these
 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.139
previous types in that these
distillation actions were actually act

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.149
distillation actions were actually act
 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.869
distillation actions were actually act
upon the item so you'll refine or show

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879
upon the item so you'll refine or show
 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.119
upon the item so you'll refine or show
less items rather than just flipping to

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129
less items rather than just flipping to
 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.399
less items rather than just flipping to
another representation really so it's

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409
another representation really so it's
 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.100
another representation really so it's
more kind of like filtering it behavior

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110
more kind of like filtering it behavior
 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.959
more kind of like filtering it behavior
so the first off common one is to use

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969
so the first off common one is to use
 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.540
so the first off common one is to use
the standard search view behavior in

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550
the standard search view behavior in
 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.769
the standard search view behavior in
order to just filter through the items

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779
order to just filter through the items
 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.969
order to just filter through the items
already shown on screen so in our

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979
already shown on screen so in our
 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.589
already shown on screen so in our
example we're going back to the people

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599
example we're going back to the people
 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.509
example we're going back to the people
application again where you can start

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:19.519
application again where you can start
 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.519
application again where you can start
searching for a contact so this works

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529
searching for a contact so this works
 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.009
searching for a contact so this works
really well for you know large data sets

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.019
really well for you know large data sets
 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.319
really well for you know large data sets
where you know if you had to pick from a

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:26.329
where you know if you had to pick from a
 

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:27.759
where you know if you had to pick from a
list of kind of filter options it might

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:27.769
list of kind of filter options it might
 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.059
list of kind of filter options it might
be too large or too kind of nonspecific

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069
be too large or too kind of nonspecific
 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.359
be too large or too kind of nonspecific
so search can work quite well there the

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:34.369
so search can work quite well there the
 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.399
so search can work quite well there the
next up is a simple going to filter

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409
next up is a simple going to filter
 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.129
next up is a simple going to filter
switch where you're changing what that

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139
switch where you're changing what that
 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.899
switch where you're changing what that
kind of on discreet filterable

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909
kind of on discreet filterable
 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:41.950
kind of on discreet filterable
things

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960
things
 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.020
things
in our example here we're using pocket

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030
in our example here we're using pocket
 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.640
in our example here we're using pocket
but it should actually store different

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650
but it should actually store different
 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.920
but it should actually store different
kinds of media for later consumption and

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
kinds of media for later consumption and
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.870
kinds of media for later consumption and
they use this kind of corpus which

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880
they use this kind of corpus which
 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.480
they use this kind of corpus which
filter to kind of filter down just to

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490
filter to kind of filter down just to
 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.760
filter to kind of filter down just to
kind of articles videos images on the

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770
kind of articles videos images on the
 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.680
kind of articles videos images on the
kind of media type so that's a pretty

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690
kind of media type so that's a pretty
 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.920
kind of media type so that's a pretty
common one and again that's implemented

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930
common one and again that's implemented
 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.629
common one and again that's implemented
as an action from the action bar so

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639
as an action from the action bar so
 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.270

anchored list as well so it's a very

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400
anchored list as well so it's a very
 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.189

similar presentation so it's quite often

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199
similar presentation so it's quite often
 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:46.210

quite some depth about this topic but

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:05.570
quite some depth about this topic but
 

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.180
quite some depth about this topic but
I'm a big fan of this because it has a

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:07.190
I'm a big fan of this because it has a
 

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.870
I'm a big fan of this because it has a
lot of the benefits of the draw

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:09.880
lot of the benefits of the draw
 

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.469
lot of the benefits of the draw
left-hand drawer would have the

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479
left-hand drawer would have the
 

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:13.480
left-hand drawer would have the
navigation as it can for actions on the

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:13.490
navigation as it can for actions on the
 

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.000
navigation as it can for actions on the
right-hand side so some of those

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.010
right-hand side so some of those
 

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.860
right-hand side so some of those
benefits are there it kind of appears at

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:17.870
benefits are there it kind of appears at

the content in a way which is great for
 

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.480
the content in a way which is great for
filtering in my opinion because you can

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.490
filtering in my opinion because you can
 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.760
filtering in my opinion because you can
see it acting at a level above the

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:24.770
see it acting at a level above the
 

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.930
see it acting at a level above the

supports it you can imagine changing

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:30.260
supports it you can imagine changing

supports it you can imagine changing
these filtering settings and seeing the

these filtering settings and seeing the

these filtering settings and seeing the
kind of content behind it update live

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.250
kind of content behind it update live
 

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.000
kind of content behind it update live
like the number of results was displayed

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010

that kind of instant response is kind of

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.570
that kind of instant response is kind of
 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.110
that kind of instant response is kind of
a great thing to provide and so in this

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120
a great thing to provide and so in this
 

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.750
a great thing to provide and so in this
instance we as as with the navigation

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760
instance we as as with the navigation
 

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.860
instance we as as with the navigation
drawer you have an affordance in the

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:47.870
drawer you have an affordance in the
 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.360
drawer you have an affordance in the
action bar so here we have a filter icon

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:49.370
action bar so here we have a filter icon
 

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.370
action bar so here we have a filter icon
but this would also be accessible by a

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:51.380
but this would also be accessible by a
 

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.990

so one quick note actually two quick

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560
so one quick note actually two quick
 

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.989

we also covered brain consistency in

we also covered brain consistency in
that in that episode but this is from

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:13.430
that in that episode but this is from
 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.160
that in that episode but this is from
that episode and the second thing was a

that episode and the second thing was a
 

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.590
that episode and the second thing was a
live example of the actual interaction

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600
live example of the actual interaction
 

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.210
live example of the actual interaction
can be found in the Google+ app the way

in which they do notifications they do

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:21.769
in which they do notifications they do
 

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.850
in which they do notifications they do
notification use this type of

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:23.860
notification use this type of
 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.920
notification use this type of
interaction for notifications but it's

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:26.930
interaction for notifications but it's
 

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.780
interaction for notifications but it's
perfectly suitable for other types of

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:28.790
perfectly suitable for other types of
 

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.360
perfectly suitable for other types of
things for example filtering generally

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.370
things for example filtering generally
 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.790
things for example filtering generally
not great for for navigation for core

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800
not great for for navigation for core
 

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.230
not great for for navigation for core
navigation that's really more for the

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240
navigation that's really more for the
 

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.749
navigation that's really more for the
navigation drawer and the left side of

00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:37.759
navigation drawer and the left side of
 

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:40.869
navigation drawer and the left side of
the screen I guess but for filtering for

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:40.879
the screen I guess but for filtering for
 

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:43.119
the screen I guess but for filtering for

distillation of content in a collection
 

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:47.069
distillation of content in a collection
is a great option all right absolutely

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079
is a great option all right absolutely
 

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:50.499
is a great option all right absolutely
let's move on to responsive layout yeah

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:50.509
let's move on to responsive layout yeah
 

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:52.989
let's move on to responsive layout yeah
so when we're talking about collections

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:52.999
so when we're talking about collections
 

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:54.879
so when we're talking about collections
we have to kind of have this extra

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:54.889
we have to kind of have this extra
 

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:56.980
we have to kind of have this extra
dimension in our head of the fact that

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:56.990
dimension in our head of the fact that
 

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.660
dimension in our head of the fact that
they're going to be displayed on all

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.670
they're going to be displayed on all
 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.780
they're going to be displayed on all
sorts of all sizes and shaped devices so

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:01.790
sorts of all sizes and shaped devices so
 

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.699
sorts of all sizes and shaped devices so
something like a ListView for example

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:03.709
something like a ListView for example
 

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.829
something like a ListView for example
might work great on a small device but

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839
might work great on a small device but
 

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:07.689
might work great on a small device but
it's not going to kind of scale up

00:10:07.689 --> 00:10:07.699
it's not going to kind of scale up
 

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:09.360
it's not going to kind of scale up
terribly well to a larger device

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:09.370
terribly well to a larger device
 

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.230
terribly well to a larger device
especially when you think about a

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240
especially when you think about a
 

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.449
especially when you think about a

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:13.459
10-inch tablet in landscape orientation
 

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:15.340
10-inch tablet in landscape orientation
list can be a pretty bad way of

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:15.350
list can be a pretty bad way of
 

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.720
list can be a pretty bad way of
displaying information because you end

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.730
displaying information because you end
 

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.299

up with these excessively large wide

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:18.309
up with these excessively large wide

list items with lots of white space and
 

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:26.079
list items with lots of white space and
say so and the first pretty simple thing

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:26.089
say so and the first pretty simple thing
 

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:28.449
say so and the first pretty simple thing
you can do is switching up from say

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:28.459
you can do is switching up from say
 

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:31.299
you can do is switching up from say
using a list in a smaller device up to

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:31.309
using a list in a smaller device up to
 

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:32.980
using a list in a smaller device up to
something like a grid view in a larger

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:32.990
something like a grid view in a larger
 

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.470
something like a grid view in a larger
device so programmatically this is very

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480
device so programmatically this is very
 

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.480
device so programmatically this is very
simple to do on Android both both of

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:37.490
simple to do on Android both both of
 

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.040
simple to do on Android both both of
these lists and grid components kind of

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.050
these lists and grid components kind of
 

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.840
these lists and grid components kind of
have a common base so it's very easy to

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:40.850
have a common base so it's very easy to
 

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.400
have a common base so it's very easy to
do you just provide a different layout

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.410
do you just provide a different layout
 

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.100
do you just provide a different layout
so you know whenever this size width use

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.110
so you know whenever this size width use
 

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.949
so you know whenever this size width use
this representation of my item rather

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959
this representation of my item rather
 

00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:49.509
this representation of my item rather
than you know this list type one use

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519
than you know this list type one use
 

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.579
than you know this list type one use
this grid type one and this can work

00:10:51.579 --> 00:10:51.589
this grid type one and this can work
 

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:54.309
this grid type one and this can work
with you especially well and if you have

00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:54.319
with you especially well and if you have
 

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:57.519
with you especially well and if you have
very kind of visual like large images or

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:57.529
very kind of visual like large images or
 

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:59.410
very kind of visual like large images or
thumbnails which which you can use to

00:10:59.410 --> 00:10:59.420
thumbnails which which you can use to
 

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.900
thumbnails which which you can use to
form these kind of like grid items so

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:01.910
form these kind of like grid items so
 

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.699
form these kind of like grid items so
this is one simple way in which you can

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:03.709
this is one simple way in which you can
 

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:05.679
this is one simple way in which you can
use the space better to present your

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:05.689
use the space better to present your
 

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:08.420
use the space better to present your
collection

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:08.430
 

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.800
I'm going to details about this pattern

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:09.810
I'm going to details about this pattern
 

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.620
I'm going to details about this pattern
as well at last Google i/o Roman and I

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:12.630
as well at last Google i/o Roman and I
 

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.120
as well at last Google i/o Roman and I
gave a talk where we documented some

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.130
gave a talk where we documented some
 

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.070
gave a talk where we documented some
code on how you might go about

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.080
code on how you might go about
 

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.180
code on how you might go about
implementing this the next thing you

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.190
implementing this the next thing you
 

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.680
implementing this the next thing you
might consider doing is breaking out

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:21.690
might consider doing is breaking out
 

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.400
might consider doing is breaking out
into this kind of like staggered

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.410
into this kind of like staggered
 

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.090
into this kind of like staggered
representation so this is kind of like

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.100
representation so this is kind of like
 

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.160
representation so this is kind of like
the step up from going from a list of

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.170
the step up from going from a list of
 

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.220
the step up from going from a list of
grits and this allows you to create a

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.230
grits and this allows you to create a
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.850
grits and this allows you to create a
more kind of dynamic more appealing

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
more kind of dynamic more appealing
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.810
more kind of dynamic more appealing
representation of your collection it

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820
representation of your collection it
 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.510
representation of your collection it
allows you to kind of recognize that not

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:38.520
allows you to kind of recognize that not
 

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.519
allows you to kind of recognize that not
every item in your group might be

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:40.529
every item in your group might be
 

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:42.590
every item in your group might be
similar weight so in this example here

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600
similar weight so in this example here
 

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.470
similar weight so in this example here
is showing some kind of news story if a

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480
is showing some kind of news story if a
 

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.699
is showing some kind of news story if a
story is particularly relevant

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:46.709
story is particularly relevant
 

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:48.260
story is particularly relevant
particularly pertinent to the user you

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.270
particularly pertinent to the user you
 

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.510
particularly pertinent to the user you
might take this opportunity to you know

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:50.520
might take this opportunity to you know
 

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.340
might take this opportunity to you know
break out of the standard rhythm and

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.350
break out of the standard rhythm and
 

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.960
break out of the standard rhythm and
take up there couple of cells or so

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:53.970
take up there couple of cells or so
 

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.730
take up there couple of cells or so
forth and it's another way of just

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740
forth and it's another way of just
 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.460
forth and it's another way of just
really kind of utilizing the space

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.470
really kind of utilizing the space
 

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.600
really kind of utilizing the space
that's available to you when you as you

00:11:59.600 --> 00:11:59.610
that's available to you when you as you
 

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.990
that's available to you when you as you
go on to larger devices

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000
 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.019
moving on you can use a combination of

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:09.029
moving on you can use a combination of
 

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:09.769
moving on you can use a combination of
these strategies

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779
these strategies
 

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.160
these strategies
all together and as you kind of get more

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.170
all together and as you kind of get more
 

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.280
all together and as you kind of get more
available space to you to play with and

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.290
available space to you to play with and
 

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.900
available space to you to play with and
one great example of this is the

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:17.910
one great example of this is the
 

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.220
one great example of this is the
third-party app pocket which i think

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.230
third-party app pocket which i think
 

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.140
third-party app pocket which i think
we've mentioned on the show before which

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.150
we've mentioned on the show before which
 

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.180
we've mentioned on the show before which
is a really great job of you know

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.190
is a really great job of you know
 

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.680
is a really great job of you know
adapting to the amount of space

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:24.690
adapting to the amount of space
 

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.840
adapting to the amount of space
available to it so starting on the left

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:26.850
available to it so starting on the left
 

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.370
available to it so starting on the left
on a small device they use a standard

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380
on a small device they use a standard
 

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.320
on a small device they use a standard
list driven navigation to kind of show a

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.330
list driven navigation to kind of show a
 

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.210
list driven navigation to kind of show a
collection of items but as I get more

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220
collection of items but as I get more
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.310
collection of items but as I get more
room they kind of break it out into

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320
room they kind of break it out into
 

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.199
room they kind of break it out into
showing a grid view and then on even

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:36.209
showing a grid view and then on even
 

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:37.820
showing a grid view and then on even
larger devices they switch up to a

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:37.830
larger devices they switch up to a
 

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.440
larger devices they switch up to a
staggered grid view so as you can see

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.450
staggered grid view so as you can see
 

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.150
staggered grid view so as you can see
here this avoids those problems of

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160
here this avoids those problems of
 

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.880
here this avoids those problems of
having you know these awkwardly wide

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:43.890
having you know these awkwardly wide
 

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.590
having you know these awkwardly wide
cells you can imagine if that list view

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600
cells you can imagine if that list view
 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.030
cells you can imagine if that list view
was just stretched all the way across

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040
was just stretched all the way across
 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.340
was just stretched all the way across
that table it would look pretty

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.350
that table it would look pretty
 

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.449
that table it would look pretty
uninspiring and instead they see it as

00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459
uninspiring and instead they see it as
 

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:52.100
uninspiring and instead they see it as
an opportunity to make the content cut

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.110
an opportunity to make the content cut
 

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.930
an opportunity to make the content cut
stand out and use it to highlight

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940
stand out and use it to highlight
 

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.490
stand out and use it to highlight
stories which might be particularly

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500
stories which might be particularly
 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.530
stories which might be particularly
interesting to the user so it's kind of

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540
interesting to the user so it's kind of
 

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.650
interesting to the user so it's kind of
great use of the opportunity yep yeah

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660
great use of the opportunity yep yeah
 

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.870
great use of the opportunity yep yeah
this is just a great example of really

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880
this is just a great example of really
 

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.240
this is just a great example of really
kind of having the content kind of

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.250
kind of having the content kind of
 

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.310
kind of having the content kind of
having I guess constraints on your

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320
having I guess constraints on your
 

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.100
having I guess constraints on your
content making sure that you know images

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.110
content making sure that you know images
 

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.040
content making sure that you know images
are certain are a certain aspect ratio

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.050
are certain are a certain aspect ratio
 

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.630
are certain are a certain aspect ratio
making sure that the content never or

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:14.640
making sure that the content never or
 

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.910
making sure that the content never or
the body text never exceeds you know a

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920
the body text never exceeds you know a
 

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.230
the body text never exceeds you know a
certain number of characters per line

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240
certain number of characters per line
 

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.150
certain number of characters per line
and kind of starting with those

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160
and kind of starting with those
 

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.509
and kind of starting with those
constraints and does

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519
constraints and does
 

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:25.470
constraints and does
outward from there yes as you were

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480
outward from there yes as you were
 

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.819
outward from there yes as you were
touching on here it would just go slide

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:26.829
touching on here it would just go slide
 

00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:29.400
touching on here it would just go slide
just to show that when you're thinking

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:29.410
just to show that when you're thinking
 

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.869
just to show that when you're thinking
about displaying your collections on

00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:30.879
about displaying your collections on
 

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:32.790
about displaying your collections on
this kind of variety devices you kind of

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800
this kind of variety devices you kind of
 

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.379
this kind of variety devices you kind of
have to let go of a little bit of the

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:34.389
have to let go of a little bit of the
 

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:36.299
have to let go of a little bit of the
kind of strict control over the layout

00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:36.309
kind of strict control over the layout
 

00:13:36.309 --> 00:13:38.309
kind of strict control over the layout
and one technique that works really well

00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:38.319
and one technique that works really well
 

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.799
and one technique that works really well
on kind of next slide is to use this

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:40.809
on kind of next slide is to use this
 

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:43.559
on kind of next slide is to use this
kind of center cropping technique so

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:43.569
kind of center cropping technique so
 

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:46.139
kind of center cropping technique so
this is a technique which will help you

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:46.149
this is a technique which will help you
 

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:48.569
this is a technique which will help you
with your images to make them scale from

00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:48.579
with your images to make them scale from
 

00:13:48.579 --> 00:13:52.290
with your images to make them scale from
you know wider to smaller devices and

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:52.300
you know wider to smaller devices and
 

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.139
you know wider to smaller devices and
sacrificing some kind of complete

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:54.149
sacrificing some kind of complete
 

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:56.519
sacrificing some kind of complete
control over the pixel dimensions but

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:56.529
control over the pixel dimensions but
 

00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:57.989
control over the pixel dimensions but
it's just saying maintain this correct

00:13:57.989 --> 00:13:57.999
it's just saying maintain this correct
 

00:13:57.999 --> 00:13:59.910
it's just saying maintain this correct
aspect ratio and then pick the right

00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920
aspect ratio and then pick the right
 

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.980
aspect ratio and then pick the right
kind of segment of the image in order to

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:01.990
kind of segment of the image in order to
 

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.809
kind of segment of the image in order to
display the amount of space available to

00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:03.819
display the amount of space available to
 

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:06.059
display the amount of space available to
the kind of cell item here so using the

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:06.069
the kind of cell item here so using the
 

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:07.379
the kind of cell item here so using the
center Cockington you can really help

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:07.389
center Cockington you can really help
 

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.480
center Cockington you can really help
you to build these you know to cell

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:09.490
you to build these you know to cell
 

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.639
you to build these you know to cell
contents of the individual items in the

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:11.649
contents of the individual items in the
 

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:14.100
contents of the individual items in the
group yeah this this works really well

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.110
group yeah this this works really well
 

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.499
group yeah this this works really well
for like landscape photography or or

00:14:16.499 --> 00:14:16.509
for like landscape photography or or
 

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:18.419
for like landscape photography or or
images like these strips of bacon here

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:18.429
images like these strips of bacon here
 

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:20.189
images like these strips of bacon here
doesn't work so well when you have you

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199
doesn't work so well when you have you
 

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:22.350
doesn't work so well when you have you
know people's faces or or other things

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360
know people's faces or or other things
 

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.210
know people's faces or or other things
that you know that have important or

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.220
that you know that have important or
 

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.980
that you know that have important or
other photos that have important content

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:25.990
other photos that have important content
 

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.419
other photos that have important content
around the fringes I think we may have

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:27.429
around the fringes I think we may have
 

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:29.160
around the fringes I think we may have
touched on this in the in past episodes

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.170
touched on this in the in past episodes
 

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.139
touched on this in the in past episodes
but it's definitely a very very

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:31.149
but it's definitely a very very
 

00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:32.850
but it's definitely a very very
important technique to use of course

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:32.860
important technique to use of course
 

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.960
important technique to use of course
they're still ways to do that with that

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:33.970
they're still ways to do that with that
 

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.129
they're still ways to do that with that
kind of imagery right you might just

00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:35.139
kind of imagery right you might just
 

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:37.379
kind of imagery right you might just
have to do a part of it first and store

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:37.389
have to do a part of it first and store
 

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:39.150
have to do a part of it first and store
some data about where the center is

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160
some data about where the center is
 

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.829
some data about where the center is
rather than you know being the physical

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839
rather than you know being the physical
 

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:44.039
rather than you know being the physical
center of the of the image it might be

00:14:44.039 --> 00:14:44.049
center of the of the image it might be
 

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.169
center of the of the image it might be
you know you detect where faces are on

00:14:46.169 --> 00:14:46.179
you know you detect where faces are on
 

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:47.609
you know you detect where faces are on
your server or something that and when

00:14:47.609 --> 00:14:47.619
your server or something that and when
 

00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:48.869
your server or something that and when
you deliver the image down and you pass

00:14:48.869 --> 00:14:48.879
you deliver the image down and you pass
 

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:51.090
you deliver the image down and you pass
in some information so that it let's see

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.100
in some information so that it let's see
 

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.439
in some information so that it let's see
you do this Center crop technique but

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:52.449
you do this Center crop technique but
 

00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:54.119
you do this Center crop technique but
without using the actual center using a

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:54.129
without using the actual center using a
 

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:55.799
without using the actual center using a
focal point instead yeah absolutely

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:55.809
focal point instead yeah absolutely
 

00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:57.449
focal point instead yeah absolutely
or using face detection right yeah it's

00:14:57.449 --> 00:14:57.459
or using face detection right yeah it's
 

00:14:57.459 --> 00:14:59.069
or using face detection right yeah it's
definitely a definitely good technique a

00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079
definitely a definitely good technique a
 

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:00.989
definitely a definitely good technique a
little harder a little more difficult to

00:15:00.989 --> 00:15:00.999
little harder a little more difficult to
 

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:02.639
little harder a little more difficult to
implement for developers since there's

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:02.649
implement for developers since there's
 

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:04.710
implement for developers since there's
no kind of like random or arbitrary

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720
no kind of like random or arbitrary
 

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.259
no kind of like random or arbitrary
Center crop it's just like kind of the

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:07.269
Center crop it's just like kind of the
 

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:09.989
Center crop it's just like kind of the
the center of the photo or it kind of

00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:09.999
the center of the photo or it kind of
 

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:12.329
the center of the photo or it kind of
centers around the photo but definitely

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:12.339
centers around the photo but definitely
 

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:13.499
centers around the photo but definitely
something that can be done it's not

00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:13.509
something that can be done it's not
 

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:17.299
something that can be done it's not
incredibly difficult but can be done

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:17.309
incredibly difficult but can be done
 

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:19.949
incredibly difficult but can be done
cool and so one of the techniques that

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959
cool and so one of the techniques that
 

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:21.840
cool and so one of the techniques that
kind of Google's been moving towards is

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:21.850
kind of Google's been moving towards is
 

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.400
kind of Google's been moving towards is
what we like to call this kind of

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.410
what we like to call this kind of
 

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.910
what we like to call this kind of
inside-out design so it's a it's a kind

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920
inside-out design so it's a it's a kind
 

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.679
inside-out design so it's a it's a kind
of more of a changing mindset than

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:28.689
of more of a changing mindset than
 

00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:31.379
of more of a changing mindset than
anything else it's thinking about your

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:31.389
anything else it's thinking about your
 

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.150
anything else it's thinking about your
content first thinking about what the

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160
content first thinking about what the
 

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.130
content first thinking about what the
information

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.140
information
 

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.750
information
display what your boolean box are and

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760
display what your boolean box are and
 

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.240
display what your boolean box are and
building outwards from there rather than

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.250
building outwards from there rather than
 

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.070
building outwards from there rather than
starting with a grid starting with a you

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.080
starting with a grid starting with a you
 

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.470
starting with a grid starting with a you
know Photoshop for the canvas of a

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480
know Photoshop for the canvas of a
 

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.120
know Photoshop for the canvas of a
certain size and then trying to sort the

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.130
certain size and then trying to sort the
 

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.100
certain size and then trying to sort the
information in into it it's kind of

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.110
information in into it it's kind of
 

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.970
information in into it it's kind of
going the other way around

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980
going the other way around
 

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.280
going the other way around
so in a lot of Google design language

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:49.290
so in a lot of Google design language
 

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.680
so in a lot of Google design language
we're moving towards these cards or

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:51.690
we're moving towards these cards or
 

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.260
we're moving towards these cards or
these ear you know these blocks of

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:54.270
these ear you know these blocks of
 

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.240
these ear you know these blocks of
content these kind of individual blocks

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:56.250
content these kind of individual blocks
 

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.310
content these kind of individual blocks
of content and then building from there

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320
of content and then building from there
 

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.590
of content and then building from there
outwards so we think about the content

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600
outwards so we think about the content
 

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.400
outwards so we think about the content
and we think it could have different

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.410
and we think it could have different
 

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.250
and we think it could have different
representations so it might have you

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260
representations so it might have you
 

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.530
representations so it might have you
know a big card heads one certain size

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540
know a big card heads one certain size
 

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.180
know a big card heads one certain size
it might be it might have different

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.190
it might be it might have different
 

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.310
it might be it might have different
sizes it can be in like maybe small or

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320
sizes it can be in like maybe small or
 

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.740
sizes it can be in like maybe small or
tiny cards it might have different

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:12.750
tiny cards it might have different
 

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.500
tiny cards it might have different
landscapes it can be in but all of these

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:15.510
landscapes it can be in but all of these
 

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.270
landscapes it can be in but all of these
are just thinking about this is my piece

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:17.280
are just thinking about this is my piece
 

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.950
are just thinking about this is my piece
of content and here are some ways in

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:18.960
of content and here are some ways in
 

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.350
of content and here are some ways in
which he can you know express itself it

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360
which he can you know express itself it
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.180
which he can you know express itself it
can draw itself it can represent itself

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.190
can draw itself it can represent itself
 

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.550
can draw itself it can represent itself
and then once you have those building

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560
and then once you have those building
 

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.410
and then once you have those building
blocks you can then build outwards and

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420
blocks you can then build outwards and
 

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.200
blocks you can then build outwards and
then see how they slot together so

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.210
then see how they slot together so
 

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.460
then see how they slot together so
starting from it from the individual

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:31.470
starting from it from the individual
 

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.070
starting from it from the individual
when you can place it into a canvas on

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:34.080
when you can place it into a canvas on
 

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.240
when you can place it into a canvas on
the screen and then by using just simple

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:38.250
the screen and then by using just simple
 

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.740
the screen and then by using just simple
proximity rather than kind of any

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:39.750
proximity rather than kind of any
 

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.560
proximity rather than kind of any
bounding boxes or kind of supporting

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:42.570
bounding boxes or kind of supporting
 

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.360
bounding boxes or kind of supporting
chrome you can just build them up into

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.370
chrome you can just build them up into
 

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.220
chrome you can just build them up into
these clusters of items so you can build

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.230
these clusters of items so you can build
 

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.900
these clusters of items so you can build
up your group in your clustering of

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:47.910
up your group in your clustering of
 

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.240
up your group in your clustering of
items just by placing them next to each

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.250
items just by placing them next to each
 

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.760
items just by placing them next to each
other and then you can introduce this

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:52.770
other and then you can introduce this
 

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.710
other and then you can introduce this
variety of the different representations

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720
variety of the different representations
 

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.450
variety of the different representations
so you might use different orientations

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:56.460
so you might use different orientations
 

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.910
so you might use different orientations
different size cards to denote something

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920
different size cards to denote something
 

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.770

stuff and build up this cluster of

00:18:37.399 --> 00:18:37.409
stuff and build up this cluster of
 

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:39.710

couple of different ways to mutate
 

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.039
couple of different ways to mutate
collections what we mean by mutating is

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:18.049
collections what we mean by mutating is
 

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:20.210
collections what we mean by mutating is

of hinting that to create a new item you

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559
of hinting that to create a new item you
 

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:46.840
of hinting that to create a new item you
know here's where you start entering

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:46.850
know here's where you start entering
 

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.060

your information so this is a very kind

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.070
your information so this is a very kind
 

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.340

of good technique for for allowing users

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:51.350
of good technique for for allowing users
 

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.680
of good technique for for allowing users
to add content in line with the rest of

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:53.690
to add content in line with the rest of
 

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.560
to add content in line with the rest of
the items in the collection another very

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:56.570
the items in the collection another very
 

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.299
the items in the collection another very
good technique for this is to use the

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:58.309
good technique for this is to use the
 

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:00.009
good technique for this is to use the
empty state so the empty state is

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:00.019
empty state so the empty state is
 

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.840
empty state so the empty state is
something we talked about in last week's

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:01.850
something we talked about in last week's
 

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.320
something we talked about in last week's
episode on Aarn boarding but basically

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.330
episode on Aarn boarding but basically
 

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.759
episode on Aarn boarding but basically
the empty state is when you have no

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:06.769
the empty state is when you have no
 

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:09.369
the empty state is when you have no
content in a collection and we find that

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:09.379
content in a collection and we find that
 

00:21:09.379 --> 00:21:10.180
content in a collection and we find that
you know this is one of the biggest

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.190
you know this is one of the biggest
 

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.759
you know this is one of the biggest
missed opportunities across you know

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:12.769
missed opportunities across you know
 

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:15.609
missed opportunities across you know
apps on Google Play is that when there's

00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:15.619
apps on Google Play is that when there's
 

00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:17.799
apps on Google Play is that when there's
no content you know the app either says

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:17.809
no content you know the app either says
 

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:20.529
no content you know the app either says
there's no content or sorry there's no

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:20.539
there's no content or sorry there's no
 

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:22.119
there's no content or sorry there's no

content or just a loading spinner or
 

00:21:22.129 --> 00:21:24.460
content or just a loading spinner or
something that's a great opportunity to

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:24.470
something that's a great opportunity to
 

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.649
something that's a great opportunity to
actually let the user fix that problem

00:21:26.649 --> 00:21:26.659
actually let the user fix that problem
 

00:21:26.659 --> 00:21:28.330
actually let the user fix that problem
right actually let them populate that

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:28.340
right actually let them populate that
 

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.119
right actually let them populate that
that collection let them you know fix

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:31.129
that collection let them you know fix
 

00:21:31.129 --> 00:21:32.889
that collection let them you know fix
the problem of the empty state so in

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:32.899
the problem of the empty state so in
 

00:21:32.899 --> 00:21:34.720
the problem of the empty state so in
here and Google keep if you have no

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:34.730
here and Google keep if you have no
 

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.389
here and Google keep if you have no
reminders the center of the screen

00:21:37.389 --> 00:21:37.399
reminders the center of the screen
 

00:21:37.399 --> 00:21:39.129
reminders the center of the screen
actually has this nice big affordance

00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:39.139
actually has this nice big affordance
 

00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:40.989
actually has this nice big affordance
it's a nice big touch target to create a

00:21:40.989 --> 00:21:40.999
it's a nice big touch target to create a
 

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:42.639
it's a nice big touch target to create a
new reminder touching that actually

00:21:42.639 --> 00:21:42.649
new reminder touching that actually
 

00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:44.849
new reminder touching that actually
takes you into the creator reminder flow

00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:44.859
takes you into the creator reminder flow
 

00:21:44.859 --> 00:21:47.619
takes you into the creator reminder flow
so those are some basic ways to add

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:47.629
so those are some basic ways to add
 

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:49.930
so those are some basic ways to add
items to collection and I think quite

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:49.940
items to collection and I think quite
 

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.399
items to collection and I think quite
often people won't think about adding

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:51.409
often people won't think about adding
 

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:54.220
often people won't think about adding
items they think that's an action adding

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:54.230
items they think that's an action adding
 

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.349
items they think that's an action adding
is an action therefore hey I know where

00:21:56.349 --> 00:21:56.359
is an action therefore hey I know where
 

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:58.060
is an action therefore hey I know where
actions go in the action bar and I think

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:58.070
actions go in the action bar and I think
 

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.499
actions go in the action bar and I think
that can often be kind of a missed

00:21:59.499 --> 00:21:59.509
that can often be kind of a missed
 

00:21:59.509 --> 00:22:01.570
that can often be kind of a missed
opportunity I think these inline options

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:01.580
opportunity I think these inline options
 

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.669
opportunity I think these inline options
can offer in convey a little context

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679
can offer in convey a little context
 

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.580
can offer in convey a little context
with them I mean this Google keep one in

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:06.590
with them I mean this Google keep one in
 

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.779
with them I mean this Google keep one in
particular you know you instantly know

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:07.789
particular you know you instantly know
 

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:09.460
particular you know you instantly know
exactly what it's going to add there

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:09.470
exactly what it's going to add there
 

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.690
exactly what it's going to add there
what's going to happen there kind of

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:10.700
what's going to happen there kind of
 

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.060
what's going to happen there kind of
conveys a lot more information

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.070
conveys a lot more information
 

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.830
conveys a lot more information
than just having a simple button in the

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840
than just having a simple button in the
 

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.090
than just having a simple button in the
action bar I can do a lot more exactly

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100
action bar I can do a lot more exactly
 

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.560
action bar I can do a lot more exactly
and the key there is context right in

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.570
and the key there is context right in
 

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.870
and the key there is context right in
direct manipulation it's it really kind

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880
direct manipulation it's it really kind
 

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.760
direct manipulation it's it really kind
of helps satisfy that that design

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:23.770
of helps satisfy that that design
 

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.880
of helps satisfy that that design
principle all right all right so sorry

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:26.890
principle all right all right so sorry
 

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.200
principle all right all right so sorry
folks I think we're having some

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.210
folks I think we're having some
 

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.750
folks I think we're having some
technical difficulties but uh now let's

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760
technical difficulties but uh now let's
 

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.300
technical difficulties but uh now let's
jump back into it so one thing I wanted

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.310
jump back into it so one thing I wanted
 

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.430
jump back into it so one thing I wanted
to mention when talking about adding

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440
to mention when talking about adding
 

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.830
to mention when talking about adding
items specifically exposing in action in

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840
items specifically exposing in action in
 

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.520
items specifically exposing in action in
the action bar for that is you should be

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:41.530
the action bar for that is you should be
 

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.730
the action bar for that is you should be
you should try to when possible show the

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:44.740
you should try to when possible show the
 

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.070
you should try to when possible show the
actual icon representing the object type

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080
actual icon representing the object type
 

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.670
actual icon representing the object type
as well as a plus overlay or plus suffix

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:50.680
as well as a plus overlay or plus suffix
 

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.770
as well as a plus overlay or plus suffix
as it's labeled here and this is really

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:52.780
as it's labeled here and this is really
 

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.240
as it's labeled here and this is really
kind of a platform convention it helps

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.250
kind of a platform convention it helps
 

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.100
kind of a platform convention it helps
establish context for what exactly

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.110
establish context for what exactly
 

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.860
establish context for what exactly
you're adding you know in cases where

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:58.870
you're adding you know in cases where
 

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.690
you're adding you know in cases where
you don't really have a great iconic

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:00.700
you don't really have a great iconic
 

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.790
you don't really have a great iconic
representation of the content you can

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:02.800
representation of the content you can
 

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.160
representation of the content you can
just show a plus but for sure it's it's

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.170
just show a plus but for sure it's it's
 

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.260
just show a plus but for sure it's it's
preferred to to show the pluses of

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.270
preferred to to show the pluses of
 

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.920
preferred to to show the pluses of
suffix again to establish context

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:09.930
suffix again to establish context
 

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.780
suffix again to establish context
alright so let's move on to removing

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:12.790
alright so let's move on to removing
 

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.640
alright so let's move on to removing
items so there are a number of different

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:14.650
items so there are a number of different
 

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.980
items so there are a number of different
ways to allow users to remove or delete

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:16.990
ways to allow users to remove or delete
 

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.110
ways to allow users to remove or delete
items from a collection the first is

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120
items from a collection the first is
 

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.050
items from a collection the first is
using this kind of this kind of

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.060
using this kind of this kind of
 

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.840
using this kind of this kind of
contextual action overflow that you

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:24.850
contextual action overflow that you
 

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.270
contextual action overflow that you
would anchor they would place inside of

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280
would anchor they would place inside of
 

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.670
would anchor they would place inside of
your object and what happens is you know

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:29.680
your object and what happens is you know
 

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.010
your object and what happens is you know
when the user presses this these three

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.020
when the user presses this these three
 

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.590
when the user presses this these three
little vertical dots and actually the

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600
little vertical dots and actually the
 

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.180
little vertical dots and actually the
touch region should probably be expanded

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:36.190
touch region should probably be expanded
 

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.300
touch region should probably be expanded
to be about 48 dip before the bottom

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.310
to be about 48 dip before the bottom
 

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.940
to be about 48 dip before the bottom
right 48 dip of the screen if they touch

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:41.950
right 48 dip of the screen if they touch
 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.610
right 48 dip of the screen if they touch
that overflow they'll get an anchored

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:44.620
that overflow they'll get an anchored
 

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.850
that overflow they'll get an anchored
pop-up menu of things that they can of

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:47.860
pop-up menu of things that they can of
 

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.290
pop-up menu of things that they can of
actions they could take on that object

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:49.300
actions they could take on that object
 

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.180
actions they could take on that object
so in this case you know I'm looking at

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:51.190
so in this case you know I'm looking at
 

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.080
so in this case you know I'm looking at
a at a station on Google Play Music and

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.090
a at a station on Google Play Music and
 

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.970
a at a station on Google Play Music and
if I press these three vertical dots I

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:56.980
if I press these three vertical dots I
 

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.760
if I press these three vertical dots I
get this delete action so that's that's

00:23:59.760 --> 00:23:59.770
get this delete action so that's that's
 

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.280
get this delete action so that's that's
one way to delete something another way

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.290
one way to delete something another way
 

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.590
one way to delete something another way
is to is to trigger the contextual

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600
is to is to trigger the contextual
 

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.590
is to is to trigger the contextual
action bar so here this is gallery if

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600
action bar so here this is gallery if
 

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.290
action bar so here this is gallery if
you long press one of these photos and

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:10.300
you long press one of these photos and
 

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.170
you long press one of these photos and
then you you can also press other items

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:13.180
then you you can also press other items
 

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.330
then you you can also press other items
that are adjacent to select those as

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:15.340
that are adjacent to select those as
 

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.100
that are adjacent to select those as
well you'll actually see the contextual

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.110
well you'll actually see the contextual
 

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.450
well you'll actually see the contextual
action bar appear at the top of the

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.460
action bar appear at the top of the
 

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.970
action bar appear at the top of the
screen and then you can choose to delete

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:20.980
screen and then you can choose to delete
 

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.630
screen and then you can choose to delete
those objects there's so these these two

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640
those objects there's so these these two
 

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.629
those objects there's so these these two
things these are the

00:24:25.629 --> 00:24:25.639
things these are the
 

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:27.639
things these are the
contextual action bar and these this

00:24:27.639 --> 00:24:27.649
contextual action bar and these this
 

00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:30.819
contextual action bar and these this
contextual action overflow I guess these

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:30.829
contextual action overflow I guess these
 

00:24:30.829 --> 00:24:34.239
contextual action overflow I guess these
are also useful for for other things but

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:34.249
are also useful for for other things but
 

00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:36.249
are also useful for for other things but
deletion or removing an item from a

00:24:36.249 --> 00:24:36.259
deletion or removing an item from a
 

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:37.839
deletion or removing an item from a
collection is one very common way to do

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:37.849
collection is one very common way to do
 

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:43.659
collection is one very common way to do
that now a another another way to remove

00:24:43.659 --> 00:24:43.669
that now a another another way to remove
 

00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:45.310
that now a another another way to remove
items is to use something called swipe

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320
items is to use something called swipe
 

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.919
items is to use something called swipe
to dismiss or swipe to remove and this

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:47.929
to dismiss or swipe to remove and this
 

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:50.889
to dismiss or swipe to remove and this
works best in kind of a vertical list or

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:50.899
works best in kind of a vertical list or
 

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:54.129
works best in kind of a vertical list or
a horizontal list of objects where you

00:24:54.129 --> 00:24:54.139
a horizontal list of objects where you
 

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:56.259
a horizontal list of objects where you
know if the user starts swiping left or

00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:56.269
know if the user starts swiping left or
 

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:58.299
know if the user starts swiping left or
right in a vertical lists or up or down

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:58.309
right in a vertical lists or up or down
 

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:01.119
right in a vertical lists or up or down
and horizontal list the object kind of

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:01.129
and horizontal list the object kind of
 

00:25:01.129 --> 00:25:03.699
and horizontal list the object kind of
is is removed from the collection the

00:25:03.699 --> 00:25:03.709
is is removed from the collection the
 

00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:05.949
is is removed from the collection the
nice thing here is that as part of the

00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:05.959
nice thing here is that as part of the
 

00:25:05.959 --> 00:25:08.739
nice thing here is that as part of the
as part of this I guess interaction as

00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:08.749
as part of this I guess interaction as
 

00:25:08.749 --> 00:25:11.769
as part of this I guess interaction as
part of this gesture you can also kind

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:11.779
part of this gesture you can also kind
 

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:15.249
part of this gesture you can also kind
of have the the adjacent items slide in

00:25:15.249 --> 00:25:15.259
of have the the adjacent items slide in
 

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:17.560
of have the the adjacent items slide in
or animated to fill up the gap that was

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:17.570
or animated to fill up the gap that was
 

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.629
or animated to fill up the gap that was
left by the item that was removed to

00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:19.639
left by the item that was removed to
 

00:25:19.639 --> 00:25:21.369
left by the item that was removed to
help kind of convey the concept that

00:25:21.369 --> 00:25:21.379
help kind of convey the concept that
 

00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:23.769
help kind of convey the concept that
this this thing has been kind of removed

00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:23.779
this this thing has been kind of removed
 

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:26.440
this this thing has been kind of removed
from this set of sort of objects I'm a

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.450
from this set of sort of objects I'm a
 

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.119
from this set of sort of objects I'm a
big fan of this swipe remove pattern

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:28.129
big fan of this swipe remove pattern
 

00:25:28.129 --> 00:25:30.669
big fan of this swipe remove pattern
this is a very visceral direct

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679
this is a very visceral direct
 

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:32.469
this is a very visceral direct
manipulation pattern so rather than

00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:32.479
manipulation pattern so rather than
 

00:25:32.479 --> 00:25:34.239
manipulation pattern so rather than
operating machinery like pressing a

00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:34.249
operating machinery like pressing a
 

00:25:34.249 --> 00:25:35.440
operating machinery like pressing a
button to remove something I'm actually

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.450
button to remove something I'm actually
 

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.440
button to remove something I'm actually
like grabbing the IceMen and getting rid

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:38.450
like grabbing the IceMen and getting rid
 

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.499
like grabbing the IceMen and getting rid
of it and it's kind of really satisfying

00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:41.509
of it and it's kind of really satisfying
 

00:25:41.509 --> 00:25:43.479
of it and it's kind of really satisfying
yep exactly it's also quite prevalent

00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:43.489
yep exactly it's also quite prevalent
 

00:25:43.489 --> 00:25:44.709
yep exactly it's also quite prevalent
throughout the Android system as well

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:44.719
throughout the Android system as well
 

00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:46.539
throughout the Android system as well
right say like notifications the recent

00:25:46.539 --> 00:25:46.549
right say like notifications the recent
 

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:48.399
right say like notifications the recent
stack use it a bunch of places it's used

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:48.409
stack use it a bunch of places it's used
 

00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:50.229
stack use it a bunch of places it's used
for our androids it's a pretty well

00:25:50.229 --> 00:25:50.239
for our androids it's a pretty well
 

00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:53.139
for our androids it's a pretty well
understood gesture as well yeah alright

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:53.149
understood gesture as well yeah alright
 

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:55.359
understood gesture as well yeah alright
so let's move on there's a bit more to

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:55.369
so let's move on there's a bit more to
 

00:25:55.369 --> 00:25:57.009
so let's move on there's a bit more to
say on the contextual action bar but

00:25:57.009 --> 00:25:57.019
say on the contextual action bar but
 

00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:59.739
say on the contextual action bar but
we'll talk about it in a bit

00:25:59.739 --> 00:25:59.749
we'll talk about it in a bit
 

00:25:59.749 --> 00:26:02.919
we'll talk about it in a bit
so beyond just simply allowing users to

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:02.929
so beyond just simply allowing users to
 

00:26:02.929 --> 00:26:05.289
so beyond just simply allowing users to
add or remove items to or from a

add or remove items to or from a
 

00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:07.089
add or remove items to or from a
collection you know one of the things

00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:07.099
collection you know one of the things
 

00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:08.619
collection you know one of the things
you may want to do is allow them to

00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:08.629
you may want to do is allow them to
 

00:26:08.629 --> 00:26:12.249
you may want to do is allow them to
reorder things reorder objects an

00:26:12.249 --> 00:26:12.259
reorder things reorder objects an
 

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:14.109
reorder things reorder objects an
example of this could be personalizing

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:14.119
example of this could be personalizing
 

00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:16.479
example of this could be personalizing
kind of the order of of navigation

00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:16.489
kind of the order of of navigation
 

00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:18.959
kind of the order of of navigation
sections that you care about or

00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:18.969
sections that you care about or
 

00:26:18.969 --> 00:26:20.739
sections that you care about or
something as simple as you know

00:26:20.739 --> 00:26:20.749
something as simple as you know
 

00:26:20.749 --> 00:26:23.440
something as simple as you know
reordering a set of tasks in a task list

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.450
reordering a set of tasks in a task list
 

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.029
reordering a set of tasks in a task list
so let's talk about some of the ways in

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039
so let's talk about some of the ways in
 

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:27.039
so let's talk about some of the ways in
which you can allow users to do that the

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:27.049
which you can allow users to do that the
 

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:29.349
which you can allow users to do that the
first is to use something called like a

00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:29.359
first is to use something called like a
 

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.339
first is to use something called like a
drag grip

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:30.349
drag grip
 

00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:32.169
drag grip
so you'll notice end these first two

00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:32.179
so you'll notice end these first two
 

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:34.299
so you'll notice end these first two
examples on the Left II of Google Play

00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:34.309
examples on the Left II of Google Play
 

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:36.190
examples on the Left II of Google Play
or Google keep on the right you have

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200
or Google keep on the right you have
 

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.360

Google Play Music

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.370
Google Play Music
 

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.490
Google Play Music
there's these these three horizontal

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500
there's these these three horizontal
 

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.550
there's these these three horizontal
little lines and you know it's it's kind

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:43.560
little lines and you know it's it's kind
 

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.490
little lines and you know it's it's kind
of a smaller version of the burger menu

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:45.500
of a smaller version of the burger menu
 

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.290
of a smaller version of the burger menu
icon or the navigation drawer icon so we

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:48.300
icon or the navigation drawer icon so we
 

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.960
icon or the navigation drawer icon so we
kind of like to call it a slider if you

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:50.970
kind of like to call it a slider if you
 

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.110
kind of like to call it a slider if you
get the joke so this there's a drag grip

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120
get the joke so this there's a drag grip
 

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.170
get the joke so this there's a drag grip
is basically this these three horizontal

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:57.180
is basically this these three horizontal
 

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.550
is basically this these three horizontal
lines that are vertically centered

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:58.560
lines that are vertically centered
 

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.130
lines that are vertically centered
within the object that you're showing

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140
within the object that you're showing
 

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.440
within the object that you're showing
and it's on the left-hand side so if the

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:03.450
and it's on the left-hand side so if the
 

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.830
and it's on the left-hand side so if the
user presses or touches in that area the

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840
user presses or touches in that area the
 

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.750
user presses or touches in that area the
the object kind of is picked up

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760
the object kind of is picked up
 

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.640
the object kind of is picked up
momentarily and the user can kind of

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.650
momentarily and the user can kind of
 

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.950
momentarily and the user can kind of
drag up and down to reorder it so on the

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960
drag up and down to reorder it so on the
 

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.630
drag up and down to reorder it so on the
left you would reorder a set of tasks

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640
left you would reorder a set of tasks
 

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.610
left you would reorder a set of tasks
and the right here you would potentially

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620
and the right here you would potentially
 

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.580
and the right here you would potentially
reorder items within a play queue for

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:19.590
reorder items within a play queue for
 

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.030
reorder items within a play queue for
example and uh Nick brought up this

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:23.040
example and uh Nick brought up this
 

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.160
example and uh Nick brought up this
earlier a kind of important point around

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.170
earlier a kind of important point around
 

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.110
earlier a kind of important point around
how this works with the navigation

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120
how this works with the navigation
 

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.870
how this works with the navigation
drawer one of the one of the features of

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880
drawer one of the one of the features of
 

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.790
drawer one of the one of the features of
navigation drawer is that if you touch

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:31.800
navigation drawer is that if you touch
 

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.500
navigation drawer is that if you touch
anywhere you know if you're if you're on

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:33.510
anywhere you know if you're if you're on
 

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.300
anywhere you know if you're if you're on
a screen with a navigation drawer if you

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:35.310
a screen with a navigation drawer if you
 

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.530
a screen with a navigation drawer if you
touch on the left side of the screen

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:36.540
touch on the left side of the screen
 

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.750
touch on the left side of the screen
within the left 16 dip or so of the

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760
within the left 16 dip or so of the
 

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.730
within the left 16 dip or so of the
screen the navigation drawer kind of

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740
screen the navigation drawer kind of
 

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.640
screen the navigation drawer kind of
peeks in to indicate that it's there and

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:43.650
peeks in to indicate that it's there and
 

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.520
peeks in to indicate that it's there and
you'll notice actually that that with

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:46.530
you'll notice actually that that with
 

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.650
you'll notice actually that that with
these drag grips they're also on the

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:48.660
these drag grips they're also on the
 

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.150
these drag grips they're also on the
left side of the screen so those are

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:50.160
left side of the screen so those are
 

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.520
left side of the screen so those are
kind of two overlapping touch regions so

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:52.530
kind of two overlapping touch regions so
 

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.110
kind of two overlapping touch regions so
generally if you have a navigation

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120
generally if you have a navigation
 

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.610
generally if you have a navigation
drawer and also want to expose

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620
drawer and also want to expose
 

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.580
drawer and also want to expose
reordering with this kind of drag grip

00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:58.590
reordering with this kind of drag grip
 

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.010
reordering with this kind of drag grip
approach you'll probably either want to

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020
approach you'll probably either want to
 

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.720
approach you'll probably either want to
you know rethink you know what's most

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:02.730
you know rethink you know what's most
 

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.700
you know rethink you know what's most
important is offering the drawer they're

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:04.710
important is offering the drawer they're
 

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.400
important is offering the drawer they're
most important or the drag grip or just

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.410
most important or the drag grip or just
 

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.680
most important or the drag grip or just
place the drag grip on the right side or

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:09.690
place the drag grip on the right side or
 

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.380
place the drag grip on the right side or
somewhere else within the item so that

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:12.390
somewhere else within the item so that
 

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.820
somewhere else within the item so that
that's a very important point another

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:13.830
that's a very important point another
 

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.010
that's a very important point another
thing to note is that this touch region

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020
thing to note is that this touch region
 

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.650
thing to note is that this touch region
is actually very small and since this is

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:18.660
is actually very small and since this is
 

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.350
is actually very small and since this is
a fairly important kind of gesture for

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360
a fairly important kind of gesture for
 

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.750
a fairly important kind of gesture for
the important action you may want to

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760
the important action you may want to
 

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.270
the important action you may want to
actually virtually extend the touch

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:26.280
actually virtually extend the touch
 

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.090
actually virtually extend the touch
region to be about 48 dips so while it

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100
region to be about 48 dips so while it
 

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.380
region to be about 48 dips so while it
looks like it's about 16 or 20 dips wide

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:32.390
looks like it's about 16 or 20 dips wide
 

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.700
looks like it's about 16 or 20 dips wide
you may want to use something called a

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:34.710
you may want to use something called a
 

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.350
you may want to use something called a
touch delegate to allow these oars to

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360
touch delegate to allow these oars to
 

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.750
touch delegate to allow these oars to
touch anywhere within the left 48 dips

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760
touch anywhere within the left 48 dips
 

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.820
touch anywhere within the left 48 dips
of the screen to allow reordering or

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:40.830
of the screen to allow reordering or
 

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.550
of the screen to allow reordering or
dragging

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:43.560
 

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.710
so that's the drag grip and we'll talk

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720
so that's the drag grip and we'll talk
 

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.270
so that's the drag grip and we'll talk
about presentation of drag up in a

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:47.280
about presentation of drag up in a
 

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.840
about presentation of drag up in a
second but another way to do this in

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:50.850
second but another way to do this in
 

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.980
second but another way to do this in
next year this is another example from

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:51.990
next year this is another example from
 

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.260
next year this is another example from
Google keep another way to allow users

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:54.270
Google keep another way to allow users
 

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.660
Google keep another way to allow users
to reorder is to allow them to touch and

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:56.670
to reorder is to allow them to touch and
 

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.400
to reorder is to allow them to touch and
hold to kind of pick up the object very

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:58.410
hold to kind of pick up the object very
 

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.500
hold to kind of pick up the object very
similar to how you would trigger the

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:00.510
similar to how you would trigger the
 

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.540
similar to how you would trigger the
contextual action bar but then once you

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:02.550
contextual action bar but then once you
 

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.340
contextual action bar but then once you
touch and hold and start moving moving

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.350
touch and hold and start moving moving
 

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.980
touch and hold and start moving moving
your finger around the object starts

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:06.990
your finger around the object starts
 

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.510
your finger around the object starts
dragging around so you see the ghost

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520
dragging around so you see the ghost
 

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.980
dragging around so you see the ghost
image of the object underneath the

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:09.990
image of the object underneath the
 

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.480
image of the object underneath the
finger and then you see kind of a

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:11.490
finger and then you see kind of a
 

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.240
finger and then you see kind of a
destination rectangle kind of move

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.250
destination rectangle kind of move
 

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.400
destination rectangle kind of move
around to indicate where the object will

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:16.410
around to indicate where the object will
 

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.430
around to indicate where the object will
land when you let go so this is again

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440
land when you let go so this is again
 

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.360
land when you let go so this is again
slightly more direct manipulation like

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.370
slightly more direct manipulation like
 

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.160
slightly more direct manipulation like
it kind of fits that principle quite a

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:25.170
it kind of fits that principle quite a
 

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.860
it kind of fits that principle quite a
bit more but it's it's slightly less

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:27.870
bit more but it's it's slightly less
 

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.270
bit more but it's it's slightly less
discoverable since it doesn't have an

onscreen affordance another thing just
said before we move on it's important to

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.210
said before we move on it's important to
 

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.330
said before we move on it's important to

well so initially the examples once you

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260
well so initially the examples once you
 

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.620
well so initially the examples once you
start the drag action so when you touch

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:39.630
start the drag action so when you touch
 

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.360
start the drag action so when you touch
on the kind of slider menu or what do

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.370
on the kind of slider menu or what do
 

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.100
on the kind of slider menu or what do
you long press on the item key they

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.110
you long press on the item key they
 

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.290
you long press on the item key they
visually react to this so in keep you

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:45.300
visually react to this so in keep you
 

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.120
visually react to this so in keep you
see it kind of goes semi-transparent and

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.130
see it kind of goes semi-transparent and
 

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.890
see it kind of goes semi-transparent and
actually kind of moves I think about you

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:48.900
actually kind of moves I think about you
 

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.050
actually kind of moves I think about you
know 16 dips up and right or up and left

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:51.060
know 16 dips up and right or up and left
 

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.910
know 16 dips up and right or up and left
it's like so you've picked it up it's

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:52.920
it's like so you've picked it up it's
 

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.110
it's like so you've picked it up it's
physically like you've picked it up

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120
physically like you've picked it up
 

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.090
physically like you've picked it up
almost just to indicate that this is

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100
almost just to indicate that this is
 

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.890
almost just to indicate that this is
what you're acting upon so it's good to

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:57.900
what you're acting upon so it's good to
 

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.810
what you're acting upon so it's good to
react you know straight to it yeah

00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820
react you know straight to it yeah
 

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.480

absolutely
okay one thing we want to point out here

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:05.430
okay one thing we want to point out here
 

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.740
okay one thing we want to point out here
is that there's actually two visual

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:06.750
is that there's actually two visual
 

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.380
is that there's actually two visual
presentations for the drag grip the

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.390
presentations for the drag grip the
 

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.990
presentations for the drag grip the
first is this kind of the slider that we

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000
first is this kind of the slider that we
 

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.440
first is this kind of the slider that we
called the little three horizontal lines

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.450
called the little three horizontal lines
 

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.470
called the little three horizontal lines
a more a more slightly more common yet

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480
a more a more slightly more common yet
 

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.460
a more a more slightly more common yet
older style is this kind of a tire track

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:22.470
older style is this kind of a tire track
 

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.620
older style is this kind of a tire track
we're basically you have these these

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:24.630
we're basically you have these these
 

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.930
we're basically you have these these
little kind of boxes two columns of

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940
little kind of boxes two columns of
 

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.050
little kind of boxes two columns of
boxes or squares aligned to the left of

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:30.060
boxes or squares aligned to the left of
 

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.550
boxes or squares aligned to the left of
the screen and the interaction is just

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:31.560
the screen and the interaction is just
 

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.280
the screen and the interaction is just
the exact same thing you basically kind

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:34.290
the exact same thing you basically kind
 

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.630
the exact same thing you basically kind
of touch to pick up and start dragging

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640
of touch to pick up and start dragging
 

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.760
of touch to pick up and start dragging
up and down but the visual presentation

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:37.770
up and down but the visual presentation
 

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.410
up and down but the visual presentation
is slightly different so this is a

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.420
is slightly different so this is a
 

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.360
is slightly different so this is a
slightly older style this is a slightly

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.370
slightly older style this is a slightly
 

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.390
slightly older style this is a slightly
newer style you know both are certainly

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:44.400
newer style you know both are certainly
 

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.340
newer style you know both are certainly
valid approaches all right so let's move

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:49.350
valid approaches all right so let's move
 

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.880
valid approaches all right so let's move
on to acting on items so this is kind of

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:52.890
on to acting on items so this is kind of
 

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.560
on to acting on items so this is kind of
the big one here this is actually kind

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:54.570
the big one here this is actually kind
 

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.139
the big one here this is actually kind
of a

00:30:55.139 --> 00:30:55.149
of a
 

00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:57.899
of a
a summary of a couple of these things so

00:30:57.899 --> 00:30:57.909
a summary of a couple of these things so
 

00:30:57.909 --> 00:31:00.149
a summary of a couple of these things so
acting on items what we mean here is you

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159
acting on items what we mean here is you
 

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.769
acting on items what we mean here is you
know generally an object in a collection

00:31:01.769 --> 00:31:01.779
know generally an object in a collection
 

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:05.190
know generally an object in a collection
has a single main touch target you know

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200
has a single main touch target you know
 

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.219
has a single main touch target you know
itself when you touch on it you show the

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:08.229
itself when you touch on it you show the
 

00:31:08.229 --> 00:31:10.139
itself when you touch on it you show the
details for that object or you know kind

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:10.149
details for that object or you know kind
 

00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:12.419
details for that object or you know kind
of take the primary action now what if

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:12.429
of take the primary action now what if
 

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:14.249
of take the primary action now what if
you have secondary actions other things

00:31:14.249 --> 00:31:14.259
you have secondary actions other things
 

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:17.039
you have secondary actions other things
you can do to that object so the first

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:17.049
you can do to that object so the first
 

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:18.239
you can do to that object so the first
and we touched on a couple years already

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:18.249
and we touched on a couple years already
 

00:31:18.249 --> 00:31:20.369
and we touched on a couple years already
but the first is to offer an action

00:31:20.369 --> 00:31:20.379
but the first is to offer an action
 

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:22.019
but the first is to offer an action
overflow or a contextual action overflow

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:22.029
overflow or a contextual action overflow
 

00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:24.149
overflow or a contextual action overflow
I guess so

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159
I guess so
 

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.799
I guess so
you would have these three vertical dots

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:25.809
you would have these three vertical dots
 

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:28.200
you would have these three vertical dots
you know like we said before you touch

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.210
you know like we said before you touch
 

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.570
you know like we said before you touch
the overflow affordance and then you see

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:30.580
the overflow affordance and then you see
 

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.399
the overflow affordance and then you see
a pop up menu so this works well with

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:32.409
a pop up menu so this works well with
 

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:34.649
a pop up menu so this works well with
with things secondary actions like

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:34.659
with things secondary actions like
 

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.529
with things secondary actions like
delete also things like you know if

00:31:37.529 --> 00:31:37.539
delete also things like you know if
 

00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:38.909
delete also things like you know if
you're in Google Play and you're looking

00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919
you're in Google Play and you're looking
 

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:41.070
you're in Google Play and you're looking
at an app you can press the three

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080
at an app you can press the three
 

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.479
at an app you can press the three
vertical dots to immediately start

00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:42.489
vertical dots to immediately start
 

00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:45.149
vertical dots to immediately start
installing that app also things like

00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159
installing that app also things like
 

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:48.329
installing that app also things like
edit or you know or whatever you want

00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:48.339
edit or you know or whatever you want
 

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:52.139

any other things where share as well the
 

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:53.759
any other things where share as well the
contextual action bar is certainly kind

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:53.769
contextual action bar is certainly kind
 

00:31:53.769 --> 00:31:57.239
contextual action bar is certainly kind
of the the more standard more common

00:31:57.239 --> 00:31:57.249
of the the more standard more common
 

00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:00.029
of the the more standard more common
approach to doing this so what you do

00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039
approach to doing this so what you do
 

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:01.560
approach to doing this so what you do
here is you would you know select an

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:01.570
here is you would you know select an
 

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.599
here is you would you know select an
object by long-pressing it and then the

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:03.609
object by long-pressing it and then the
 

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.519
object by long-pressing it and then the
the context of the screen changes right

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:05.529
the context of the screen changes right
 

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:07.649
the context of the screen changes right
so your action bar changes into this

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:07.659
so your action bar changes into this
 

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:10.079
so your action bar changes into this
contextual mode and then you can take

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:10.089
contextual mode and then you can take
 

00:32:10.089 --> 00:32:11.999
contextual mode and then you can take
action from there for example here you

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:12.009
action from there for example here you
 

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:15.269
action from there for example here you
can long press to pick up a note and

00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279
can long press to pick up a note and
 

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:16.799
can long press to pick up a note and
Google keep and then change its color

00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:16.809
Google keep and then change its color
 

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:19.049
Google keep and then change its color
set a reminder or archive it you'll

00:32:19.049 --> 00:32:19.059
set a reminder or archive it you'll
 

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:21.029
set a reminder or archive it you'll
notice that here in Google keep you can

00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039
notice that here in Google keep you can
 

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.919
notice that here in Google keep you can
long press like I said before long press

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:22.929
long press like I said before long press
 

00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:24.299
long press like I said before long press
to pick it up if you don't move your

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:24.309
to pick it up if you don't move your
 

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.609
to pick it up if you don't move your
finger around it just selects it and

00:32:26.609 --> 00:32:26.619
finger around it just selects it and
 

00:32:26.619 --> 00:32:28.320
finger around it just selects it and
lets you take action if you start moving

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:28.330
lets you take action if you start moving
 

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.489
lets you take action if you start moving
your finger it will actually start

00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:29.499
your finger it will actually start
 

00:32:29.499 --> 00:32:33.149
your finger it will actually start
dragging it so these two are very very I

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159
dragging it so these two are very very I
 

00:32:33.159 --> 00:32:36.379
dragging it so these two are very very I
guess they work in in tandem if possible

00:32:36.379 --> 00:32:36.389
guess they work in in tandem if possible
 

00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:38.369
guess they work in in tandem if possible
and one of my favorite things about the

00:32:38.369 --> 00:32:38.379
and one of my favorite things about the
 

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:39.959
and one of my favorite things about the
contextual action bar is it's a very

00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:39.969
contextual action bar is it's a very
 

00:32:39.969 --> 00:32:42.869
contextual action bar is it's a very
easy way to act on multiple items at

00:32:42.869 --> 00:32:42.879
easy way to act on multiple items at
 

00:32:42.879 --> 00:32:46.379

about the contextual action bar here is
 

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.739
about the contextual action bar here is
actually you can offer things like

00:33:41.739 --> 00:33:41.749
actually you can offer things like
 

00:33:41.749 --> 00:33:44.710
actually you can offer things like
select all really easily so you know

once you long press to select you can
 

00:33:47.179 --> 00:33:49.359
once you long press to select you can
offer like a spinner in the in the
