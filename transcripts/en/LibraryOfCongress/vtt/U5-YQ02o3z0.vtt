00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:16.000
[Pause]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.300
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hello everyone.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.750
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.240
I'm the Director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.700
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.580
And on behalf of
the staff and I want

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.370
to welcome you all here
today to the latest

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.340
in our ongoing Benjamin
Botkin lecture series.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.930
A word about the Botkin series,
it's an opportunity to allow AFC

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.550
to highlight the latest and best
scholarship by leading scholars

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.560
in the disciplines of folklore,
oral history, ethnomusicology

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.120
and cultural heritage while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.870
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.050
For the center and the library
the Botkin lectures are an

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.470
important facet of our
acquisition activities.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.570
Each lecture is video
tapped and becomes part

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.460
of the permanent collections.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.080
In addition the lectures will
be later posted as webcasts

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260
on the library's website.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.200
So with that said if I could ask
you if you have a cell phone on

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.440
or any other electronic
device please turn it off

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.830
at this point.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.360
One of the giant's in
the field of folklore

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.950
and especially British
American folk music is Francis

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.440
James Child.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.220
A legendary 19th century
Bostonian scholar whose research

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.550
and classification of 305
British Isle ballads was

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.050
so seminole to the field
that folklorists still refer

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.530
to the narrative
songs he included

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.280
in his magnum opus the English
and Scottish popular ballads

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940
as simply as Child ballads.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.140
If you have even the
remotest interest

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.240
in folk music I have a
feeling you've probably heard

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960
about the Child ballads
numerous times.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.740
His contributions as
a public intellectual

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.510
and scholar were deeply
influential in the establishment

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
and development of literature
and folklore departments

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.740
at universities throughout
the United States.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.910
And also intertwined with the
broader history and development

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.100
of American intellectual
history.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.070
He remains however kind of a
remote figure which is a chain

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.090
because his personal story
is as complex and compelling

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.710
as the plotlines of
any of the ballads.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.580
So today's speaker,
Michael J. Bell,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.770
will be discussing
his recent research

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.640
on Child's correspondence

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.080
and other previously unexplored
Child related materials

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.770
that has allowed him to
reconstruct Child's life,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.750
his personal and professional
networks and his contributions

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.670
to America's 19th century
intellectual landscape.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.260
Michael Bell and I, I just
as a parenthetical aside,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.980
there are few Michael Bell's
in the field of folklore.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.240
And he is Michael J. Bell.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.520
Michael is a folklorist
who received his doctorate

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.850
in folklore and folklife from
the University of Pennsylvania.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.770
He began his academic
career as a professor

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.300
at Detroit's Wayne State
University and later moved

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.830
to Grinnell College in Iowa.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.560
His early work includes
the classic study,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.530
the World from Brown's
Lounge, An Ethnology

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.220
of Black Middle Class Play which
was published by University

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.330
of Illinois press in 1982.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.080
Bell's career took him down
more administrative pathways.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.000
He recently retired as
Vice President and Dean

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.300
of the University

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.490
at Transylvania University
in Lexington.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.170
But we're delighted that he
is returned back to the fold

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.860
of folklore in history and the
development of our discipline.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.170
So please join me
in welcoming him

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.280
for a Botkin lecture entitled
My Secret Autobiography,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.400
Letters of Ballad Scholar
Francis James Child

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.180
to William Ellery Sedgwick.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.980
Dr. Michael J. Bell.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.330
[ Applause ]

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Bell: I've recently
had cataract surgery so I have

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.420
to now learn after 65
years to put glasses

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.530
on before I begin to read.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.550
I'll try not to make this too
much of a paper presentation

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.810
but I am going to be reading
excerpts from letters.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.540
And since they were written
they have to be read aloud

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.980
and I'll be looking down
more than I would like.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.800
Thanks to the Library
of Congress

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.370
and especially the American
Folklife Center and especially,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.760
especially to Nancy Gross
for this opportunity.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.570
I can get very excited
about Child.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.070
I will try to stay mild
mannered as long as I can.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.450
I will be and thank you
Betsy for the introduction.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.360
I can skip a couple of
features that I already,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.720
that I thought I had to put in.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.820
You all now know
who Francis Child is

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.160
and I can move on
to the letters.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.780
Just a quick word however
about William Ellery Sedgwick.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.790
He is, as you will hear
in the paper, but I wanted

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.510
to say he was Child's
college roommate at Harvard.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.100
He is a member the, the Sedgwick
family including Kyra Sedgwick,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.510
Edie Sedgwick, Theodore
Sedgwick and a large passel

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.220
of other Sedgwicks across
the 19th and 20th century.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.060
They were for the longest
time and probably still are,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.450
though we don't know
it, one of the,

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.720
if not the wealthiest family
as family in the United States.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.300
And they've, he himself
in later life turns

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.150
into an Edith Wharton novel.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.680
You will all actually have read
it but maybe not recognized it.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.690
His, that is Ellery Sedgwick's
wife Charlotte left him,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.530
ran away with her lover to
Europe and lived there in sin

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.760
and then in marriage
for many years.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.530
And then returned
to the United States

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.250
with the following
condition put on her, by her,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.300
to the Sedgwick family.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.630
I will be received by all

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.910
of my daughter's friends
otherwise we will not return

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.190
to the United States.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.080
That is an Edith Wharton novel.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.700
It's also a section of
Princess Casimir by Henry James.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.020
So I won't be talking
directly about Elliot.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.730
You are still connected to
sort of the world we're going

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.130
to be entering in a second.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.910
My Secret Autobiography,
The Early Letters

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.680
of Francis James Child to
William Ellery Sedgwick.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.500
If in your wanderings in
the library shelves you were

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.200
to come upon this series, The
British Poets from Chaucer

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.640
to Wordsworth, published
by Little, Brown and edited

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.650
by Francis James Child.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.910
And if you were to take
down from that collection,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.520
the first of its eight volumes
of English and Scottish ballads,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.630
selected and edited by
that selfsame Child.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.930
And if you were to turn

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.080
to its dedication page you
would read the following:

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.830
to William Ellery
Sedgwick of New York,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.610
this collection is
affectionately dedicated.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.950
If you were a general reader
you might idle for a moment,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.600
wonder who this Sedgwick
person was and then page on.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.220
If you were a folklorist
or a ballad scholar

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.980
or an English professor

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.350
or perhaps an interested
anthropologist you might pause

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.160
for a minute longer
and wonder not only

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.620
who was this Sedgwick
person but why he

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.310
of all people was the
object of Child's affection.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.450
Was he somehow connected
to Child's lifelong study

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.950
of the ballad, perhaps an
unknown ballad scholar,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.500
a hither to unrecognized
intimate

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.480
with whom Child exchanged
his early opinions

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.880
and ideas on balladry?

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.020
In part you would
wonder because for all

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.550
of his fame Child is
scholarly mystery.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.330
Despite the fact that he
is one of the founders

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.990
of the discipline of English
studies and one of the founders

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.940
of American folklore studies

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.530
that he remains the longest
serving Harvard English

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.120
professor, 45 years, and
that his later magnum opus,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.050
The English and Scottish
Popular Ballads,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.940
is debatably the greatest
work ever published

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.300
by any American folklorist.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.360
We simply do not know enough
about Child to allow us either

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.540
to take the measure
of the scholar

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.750
or the measure of the man.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.460
Child never wrote an
introduction to his English

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.380
and Scottish Popular Ballads.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.340
And that absence meant that
his work remains unfinished

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.140
and we its readers cannot
parse either his intentions

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.240
or its full meaning.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.150
Our knowledge of Child the
man offers us no substitute

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.180
for our ignorance of
Child the scholar,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.770
feel personal anecdote
exist and most of his known

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.540
or published correspondence
does not contain much in the way

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.380
of personal history
or private sentiment.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.580
The first problem
cannot be solved.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.660
Child will not write
his introduction.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.260
And we cannot write it for him.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.570
We can guess at what
he would have written.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.820
We can argue over the
arguments he might have made.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.590
We might even assert that his
work was a failure deserving

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.790
neither attention
nor our praise.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.170
But no matter our approach
we are left fighting

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.630
against a silence that
cannot be overcome.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.040
However solving the
second problem offers,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.300
holds greater hope.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.800
Recent discoveries of
personal letters such as those

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.800
of his wife, Elizabeth
Ellery Sedgwick Child,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.680
held at the Clements Library
of the University of Michigan,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.390
the Child family papers held by
the Cambridge Historical Society

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.610
and most importantly the Frances
James Child William Ellery

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.800
Sedgwick correspondence held

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.920
at the Massachusetts Historical
Society give us an opportunity

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.110
to meet the young man who
would eventually become the

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.740
great collector.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.990
Consider this presentation
then as an beginning exercise

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.810
in psychological deduction.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.710
My goal today is
to try to allow you

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.390
to meet Francis James Child
before he became Francis James

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.500
Child, before in a sense he
became the name of a kind

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.190
of traditional ballad.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.880
The full collection of letters
is a truly revealing catalogue

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.990
of Child's private sentiments
written from 1846 to,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:32.640
from 1846 to 1863 and consisting
of over 400 letters from Child

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.960
to his closest friend,
college roommate

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.370
and eventual brother-in-law,
William Ellery Sedgwick.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.380
The letters as Child
described them chapters

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.750
from his secret autobiography
constitute a powerful epistolary

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.150
narration of Child's passage
from recent college graduate

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.320
to beginning Harvard professor.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.110
Because there is not
enough time today

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.880
to explicate the
entire correspondence,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.380
I will concentrate on several of
the 127 letters written by him

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.870
from his graduation in 1846 to
his first fulltime appointment

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:13.300
at Harvard as the Boylston
Professor of Rhetoric in 1851.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.700
Unfortunately the story
will be a monologue.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.130
Inexplicably for the age none
of Ellery Sedgwick's responses

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.040
to Child were preserved
by Child or his family.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.840
Not surprisingly the letters

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.740
from these years
express iconic themes

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.180
for a young single recent
college graduate moving

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.170
from age 21 to age 27.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.000
Like many of us at that
age Child is concerned

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.730
with all the ordinary
traumas that arise

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.940
from college graduation,
his renewed relations

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.830
with his family,
his college loans,

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.830
his need to find a job and love.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.430
Eventually all four
concerns will converge

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.330
in a wrenching series of
letters written from early 1848

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.720
to just months before his
return from Europe in 1851.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.250
But more on that later.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:14.770
First let me introduce Child as
he sets the rules in late 1846

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.750
for his epistolary monologue.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.970
Dear Ell [Phonetic], he
writes, may I fearlessly confess

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.130
that I often want to speak out
feelings that would be snubbed

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.180
as unbecoming or
rejected as pretentious.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.950
How seldom have I been able

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.870
to unfold myself completely
even half an hour of myself,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.180
a few minutes, and how false

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.170
and oppressive have I
experienced those equal claims

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.880
which keep me from giving
myself to the higher sentiments

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.290
which we all love to see
confessed in a play or a poem.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.530
But bear not utter
for fear of man.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.080
And then as if to confirm
both those higher sentiments

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.040
and the freedom he
seeks describing a trip

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.050
that was never taken
but planned.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.860
Child continues, my dearest
boy, don't think that I'm not

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.120
with you in our plans
for Europe.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.340
I put on the mask of Peleus

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.600
but for a moment thou shalt
be marius on the ruins

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.900
and I shall sketch thee.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.730
We will handle the arms of
the Sid, offer up shillings

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.370
to all the showmen of Athens,
[Inaudible] the prima donna

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.990
at San Carlos, drink tokay
with Metternich and hoc

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.360
with the grand dukes, drop
a tear on every monument

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.890
in Westminster Abbey, buy every
good book in the London shops,

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.710
beat the Frenchmen in amusements
and the German in study,

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.120
take better general views
than Ramez [Phonetic]

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.680
and better gossip than
Basil Hall [Phonetic]

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.390
with such glorious
realities in sight,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.910
who thinks of the
insubstantial phantom, money.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.130
The answer of course
was Child for whom money

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.030
and status were anything
but insubstantial.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.990
Have you any faith to
ask a new light question,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.570
he begins another
letter and continues.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.610
I haven't the slightest.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.680
Though always a little
inclined to affect sad fancies.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.300
I was happy enough as a boy and
being of very sensitive feelings

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.710
and rather a religious
temperament, I had plenty

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.440
of expressions of a lively kind.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.510
To however things
went I was active.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.300
Life was busy and interesting
whether painful or otherwise.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.220
I had many hard times but
always weathered them.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.380
Years have gone by and I am
extremely much better situated

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.680
than ever.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.980
I have materials of happiness
around me that I never expected

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.240
to possess and I am
less happy than ever.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.490
Worst of all I feel dead.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.260
The future has no inviting hopes

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.530
and to my solidity few fears
therefore I am very gloomy.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.930
I know the reason.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.000
It is not because I seek
for what I cannot find

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.580
but because I abhor myself.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.880
But I don't think

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.360
that disappointed ambition is
the secret to all my troubles.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.770
Nothing to me seems
worthy of ambition.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.750
Affect, sad fancies,
I feel dead.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.550
I abhor myself.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.730
Nothing seems worthy
of ambition.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.390
Let us be honest, these
are familiar sentiments

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.830
of adolescents graduating
from college.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:33.870
And not necessarily to
be too overanalyzed.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.220
Yet they are also not what
one might expect from someone

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.440
who had judged the best
of his college class

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.280
and the most likely to rise
to a professorship at Harvard.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.740
Child however was extremely
sensitive about his background.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.790
He was of working class
mercantile origins.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.240
His father was a sailmaker.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.090
He, in his early years,
was a free flowing boy

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:04.580
of the Boston docks rescued by
the Boston Public School system

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.620
if ever there is a testament
for public education,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.510
it is the Boston
Public School system.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.080
Educated by Dick
Swell [Phonetic]

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.870
after his success
at Boston Latin.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.980
And finally on the
basis of loans

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:22.470
from rich seafaring families
in Salem, Massachusetts allowed

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:27.120
to attend Harvard University,
at that time Harvard College.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.410
Still the distance these
facts created between himself

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.800
and his new social
milieu rankerd [Phonetic].

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.560
Quote, we have struggled,
speaking of his family,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.490
we have struggled with
poverty in our day

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.220
and I have always
been the favored one.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.510
The matchless love and
patience of my father

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.820
with his cheerfulness
of intemperament

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.420
which I did not inherit has
carried us through and we are

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.340
in a better place than ever.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.660
Now I am the main
reliance of my family.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.040
You see my dear Ellery you
cannot easily comprehend

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.510
my situation.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.250
You must remember
that I have grown

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.270
up in a circle entirely
different

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.980
from that of my family.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.320
And all my tastes and
notions have been formed

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.990
under different circumstances.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.620
Being extremely sensitive, even
fastidious, you'll may imagine

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.210
that my taste is
frequently offended

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.670
and the comparisons I am obliged
to make between my own home

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.340
and that of my friends
are mortifying.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.450
Not only is Child mortified by
his background, feeling not as,

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.440
not only is Child
mortified by his background,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.920
he is feeling what we in
the 20th century have come

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.160
to recognized as the duel
consciousness and status anxiety

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.050
of bright working class students
who are pulled from that class

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.430
and offered the offered
to opportunity

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.700
to be upper middle
class and professional.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.560
However he is also frightened
of the expected sentimentality

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.850
of 1840s, 1850s middle
class life.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:04.320
Quote, I am a crowd of
womanish sentiments he writes.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.030
And they fill me up
these twilight hours

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:11.720
and I sometimes think that I
indulge them too much for a man.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.500
I should hate to be effeminate

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.540
or have you think me
so my dear Ellery.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.620
I won't make you taste
of all my bitter cups.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.080
I had two or three
to drink yesterday.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.730
They made me wretched
and I cannot escape

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:30.360
from their fascination
but drink, drink, drink.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.480
Child's social anxieties carried

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.140
over into his search
for meaningful work.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.890
Again he had graduated first
in his class and was recognized

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.900
by all Cambridge as
destined for great things.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.980
At the same time he did not
have the privilege as many

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220
of his Harvard classmates
did of waiting

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.970
for greatness to find him.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.520
Immediately after graduation,
driven by the need to replay,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.830
repay his undergraduate
loans, they were interest free

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.360
but nonetheless substantial.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.390
He took the position of tutor
in mathematics at Harvard

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.530
under the great scientist
Benjamin Pierce,

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.250
father of the Charles
Sanders Pierce.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.320
It was not a decision
he welcomed however.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320
He and Pierce clashed
from the beginning

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.300
and increasingly
Child loathed his need

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.730
to hold tightly to the position.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.770
Unfortunately there was
nothing else at Harvard for him

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.380
at the moment nor was there
likely to be it seemed

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.330
for he was extremely
skilled at the work.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.760
Quote, my examinations
were at, were excellent,

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.040
almost triumphant Ell
and Fox, a colleague,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.010
has said that he has
never seen anything

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.680
like the scores my students get.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.720
Still Harvard was unwilling
to find him something else

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.660
to do just because
he was unhappy.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.790
Quote, the president hinted
tonight that I might have

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.310
to teach mathematics again.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.080
One can feel the sigh.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.270
And then added, but he also said

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.160
that Mr. Longfellow
has suggested for me

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.010
to take a small class of
seniors in Anglo-Saxon.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.370
He, the president had thought
on the matter and would

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.280
like to know if I'd
be willing to be set

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.670
down in the new catalogue
as instructor in Anglo-Saxon

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.020
in Lawrence Scientific School.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.280
Notice where he isn't being set
down and in which catalogue.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.750
After some talk on the language

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.120
and books I've used
we separated.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.520
The president concluding with
well I'll tell the corporation

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.320
that they must appoint
you Anglo-Saxon professor.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.710
Happy with the new possibility
yet resigned to necessity,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.110
Child concludes the letter.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.500
Everybody thinks I
am a fool to give

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.030
up my chance of succeeding
Benny.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.380
For such a [Inaudible]
and perhaps I am still,

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.520
they won't persuade me
to be a mathematician.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.760
For all they say of very little
done to bring the old forms

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.720
of English into knowledge
if not into vogue.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.660
And to put piling into a fence

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:05.140
around our fine native speech
will be more to my satisfaction

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.660
than 100 predictions of comets

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.230
and calculations of
invisible planets.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.000
However, aware that he
could not put all his eggs

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.130
in Harvard's basket, Child
began two letters later.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.740
I am driven to the
consideration of the advice

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.360
of many friends to study law.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.490
There is no escaping
the argument

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.200
that if my own hope fails my one

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.290
of obtaining Edward Channing's
place, I am forever stripped

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.000
of my chance of a
comfortable future.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.780
Very reluctantly I am obliged
to acknowledge the wisdom

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.780
of at least providing
an alternative.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.850
Still he confessed, my soul
sickens at the thought of law.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.530
And continued, and when I am
sick I don't get misanthropic,

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.580
I get hypochondriac.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:02.070
I worry he wrote, that I
shall ever come to anything,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.630
know anything or be
worthy of anything good.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.740
And I should pause for a second.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.110
That's the person writing
the letters, my apologies.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.910
That is Child at 23.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.950
[Pause]

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.670
Unable literally to stomach
the law, three letters later,

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.400
he turns his attention
to theology.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.970
I had a long talk today with Dr.
Walton Ell on my prospects here,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.480
and it was clear
when we had finished

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.010
that I had better
study theology.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.230
I told him that most of
my friends recommended me

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.290
to the law, [Inaudible] divinity

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.820
and that the law was
counter to my tastes.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.680
Still I recognized the necessity
of taking some profession

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.230
and little else was
left except divinity.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.920
Of divinity I naturally said

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.700
that I had recently
thought of it.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.440
I felt no particular
call to assume the duties

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.210
of the ministry, was not aware
of any particular talent for it

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.910
and particularly could
never enter the profession

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.950
without some higher views than
earning means of a living.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.390
But it did not run counter to
my tastes and at least had,

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.280
I had no objection to
pursue theological studies.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.320
The doctor openly
recommended me to theology.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.830
He thought I should do
right to begin the study

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.970
in my present state of mind.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.880
Ell, I must have
some profession.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.830
And then undercutting all

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.130
of resolve he had just
written he concluded,

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.000
I can say no more
tonight my dear,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.030
my Anglo-Saxon class
begins tomorrow.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.960
By September of 1848 these
conventional worries were swept

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.580
aside by love.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.190
Edward Everett, the new
president of Harvard,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.700
had arrived fresh from
his ambassadorship

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.170
to England accompanied by his
wife and his daughter Charlotte.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.160
In the normal course
of events Child

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.140
and she had become acquainted

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.010
and a relationship
had begun to blossom.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.040
From casual meeting at
parties and while out walking

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.040
to surreptitiously arranged
meetings to forbidden exchanges

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.480
of letters, their relationship
grew until Cambridge took notice

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.820
and so too did Miss Everett's
parents who proceeded

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.750
to oppose the relationship
loudly and forcefully.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.770
Child wrote to Ell, the embargo
which mama has tried to put

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.050
on our intercourse has
resulted in such, as such,

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.090
as such things usually
do infrequent smuggling.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:42.070
Last week I received four
notes and this two or three.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.100
It was easy for me
to get hers but hard

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.810
to send answers without
detection.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.220
I had written a note or
rather two notes amounting

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.840
to nine pages of note
paper which was in my,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.860
which I put in my pocket and
tried to deliver last night.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.780
In the confusion of
setting, I forgot it.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.790
She was sorry and so was I

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.500
for to tell the truth
there were some things

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.690
which would read better in
the quiet before bedtime

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.720
after an affectionate
talk and moonlight walk

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.010
than under the cold
glare of morning sun.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.050
This morning little sis came

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.210
and took the note
increased by another page.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.080
It was alternately merry, sad
and sentimental and sensible.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.940
There was a description
of love in a cottage.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.040
There was remonstrance about
affection and waltzing.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.500
There was some mitigated
despondency.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.760
There was some nonsense
about dreams.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.410
And then in comment on his
confession Child wrote, Ell,

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.920
you will ask me are
you really in love?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.120
I shall categorically answer no.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.130
Are you going to be?

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.350
As frankly, I do not know.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.870
I am sometimes afraid that I am.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.760
I would not Ellery
yet I love her well.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.920
Looking at it from cold
unchained reason I find the

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.300
business a bad one.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:16.860
Charlotte is to be the only
lady whom I shall ever know.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.740
She is generous,
kind-hearted and sincere.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.400
She has excellent qualities

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.430
under her too frequent
affections.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.060
She is very docile
when told of her faults

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.850
and tries to mend them.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.290
She has a lively mind, abundance
of tact, many nice little ways

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.080
and pretty good taste.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.780
But I am uncertain whether it
is more absurd of me to fancy

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.700
that she could love me
seriously or more dishonorable

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.560
to make me, to make her do so.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.440
My dear Ell, do you
see my perplexity?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.500
Do you think he dotes
and doubts?

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.630
I can't be in danger.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.940
Charlotte would never be
so foolish as to love me

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.920
but I can't give her up.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.790
And won't until things
look worse.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:16.150
Despite his doubts, Child and
his Charlie, she has become

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.610
in the letters, his
Charlie, cannot keep apart

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.590
and he cannot stop
thinking about her.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.180
Your letter came like, your
letter came like Elijah.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.720
Yes I was think fasting
in the desert.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.580
I was sick with hope deferred.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.830
I had felt for the
first time the insipient

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.670
and half ridiculous
torments of love stricken.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.840
On the whole, this week has
been no laughing matter.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.890
I spent four or five hours
each day the perfect slave

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:51.200
of my nerves, sighing, repining,
laughing, swearing and going

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.750
through the in name phrases
proper to my condition.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.720
Reason begins to assertive
dominion about Thursday

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.220
and now I am pretty common safe.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:05.440
With a heroism invisible but
to myself I have refrained

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.150
from writing to anyone else.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.070
Hero he might see in his mirror

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.000
but doomed lover was what
he continued to play.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.080
Quote, I am sure through
all she is attracted to me

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.320
and would be likely, be likely
to love me if there was a way,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.080
if it was ever less than madness
to give into such feeling.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.020
When I think of innumerable
trials

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.750
and inconveniences I
should expose her to,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.190
I am almost convinced
that it would be a cruel

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:42.570
and ungrateful thing to persuade
her to marry me if I could.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:48.290
His issue was the ever
present problem again of money.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.430
Child still did not have any.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.490
Moreover he was unlikely
to get any soon.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.170
He had attended again Harvard
on loans from wealthy Bostonians

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.450
who fully expected
them to be paid back.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.630
And the Everett's
were after all one

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.050
of the wealthiest
families in America.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.340
Child explained his
reality simply.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.220
Quote, I can almost
earn enough to be even

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.040
and I quite can earn enough as
I work now to be happy alone.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.650
But I have now no position
and no hope of any change

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.730
and it would seem to finish us

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.870
if I continue my
present employments.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.280
Charlotte says she is
an expensive creature

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.440
and I have no doubt that she is.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.550
She also says she could
live on very little,

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.110
one-fifth of what she has now.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.630
And I partly believe that too

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.760
but I know her parents
are right.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.780
All the world will call
her silly, foolish girl,

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.080
if she takes up with me.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.480
Do I talk like a stricken
deer and callow heart?

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.930
I will tell you that in spite
of your counsels and concerns,

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.210
in spite of myself,
I am far gone.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.530
Yes my dear friend
there is no denying it.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.900
I am in love and I don't
care if you know it.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.740
And then came the final blow.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.680
Meet the final blow.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.580
Age appropriate picture
of the final blow.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.600
Confronted by the continuant
contacts and reports

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.990
of their stolen intimacies,
President Everett now

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.280
in the guise of father
Everett, quote,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.380
desired a private
conference and informed me

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.210
that he feared an intimacy
was forming between us

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.030
which as he would not be able

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:46.990
to encourage it had better
stop before it goes too far.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.690
Just that day Charlie
had written an account

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.170
of our connections and
put it on his table.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.380
She told him that she loved
me and could be happy with me.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.080
He expressed his
greatest astonishment.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.240
Said he never expected
anything of the sort

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.740
and that we had better
both done wrong

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.840
in keeping the thing secret.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.480
He calmly stated my
circumstances and my prospects,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.310
compared them with his own
at the opening of his career,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.010
showed the great difficulty
and almost impossibility

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.720
of our getting sufficient
means of living properly.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.450
At the earliest he said
several years would necessarily

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.580
intervene before we could marry.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.760
And we would be subject to the
evils of a long engagement.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.460
He was decidedly opposed
to long engagements

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.260
because they made the choices
of young people dependent

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.950
on their chosen associations
for entering society.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.550
Constricted the liberty of
selection, wasted their time

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:48.480
in sentimental intimacies or
unprofitable correspondences.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.270
Father Everett went on to point
out the burden the wife would be

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.280
at the beginning of
an academic career.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.270
Leaving Child in shock
and asking dearest Ell,

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.720
do you think I am
taking it like a man?

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.460
It is not for want of struggling
but I am weaker than a woman.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.810
I faint in thoughts
100 times a day.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.540
I long to wish with sick heart.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.600
I am ready to do
anything for her.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.170
I would give myself up
to the law for her so as

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.470
to have the prospect

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.840
of something better
than a professorship.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.710
That her father might surrender.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.820
I have no hope however that
this would make any difference.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.740
The last three weeks have
included the most unhappy days

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.040
of my life.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.700
My head has been
strangely disordered.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.780
So much as to cause me serious
alarm and I begin to fear

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:42.270
that I should never come to
anything except the madhouse.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.020
Interestingly, Professor Everett
sought to sweeten the pain.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:55.380
The question he wrote, this is
Child to Ellery, was presented

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.320
to me last Friday by Mr.
Everett himself, with reference

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.180
to my literary career.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.430
He asked me to come
to his office and said

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.160
that I would remember his
proposal to me a year ago

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.150
of a course of study in
some foreign university

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.770
and that time he had
expressed a desire to assist me

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.080
in removing any difficulty
which might be in my way.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.630
Circumstances now having
changed for the better

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.830
with his wife's inheritance he
wished to renew his proposal

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.940
and would be very happy
if I would accept a loan

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.680
without inference of such a sum
of money as I might require.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.130
He would regard it as a favor
done to him and would offer it

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.710
as a present if he thought
I would take it as such.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.750
I told him that my plans
were in utter confusion

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.900
and that I had begun to think
more of earning my living

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.800
than gratifying my tastes

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.700
or cultivating my
familial pleasures.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.300
I told him that my
plans and wishes as far

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.890
as they were [Inaudible]
looked toward the department

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.720
of rhetoric.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.690
Quote, Mr. Channing has
been there 30 years said

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.210
the president.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.210
And the man does
not hold on long

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.250
after that teaching at college.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.960
We were interrupted without
settling anything and I am

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.950
to inform him of
my conclusion soon.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.590
It is easy to make.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.020
I must decline.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.770
Agreeable as the plan is in
many respects I cannot take

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.480
on the added debt and
whether it was hypochondria

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.950
or not I have been in a state of
spirits bordering on insanity.

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:29.550
To come to this I have
devoted myself to walking,

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.300
to dumbbells and
to shower baths.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.520
I even resolved to go away
to India and stay there,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.730
to immigrate to the
west to die at once.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.100
Oh Ell, I have been
alone on a wide,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.500
wide sea without God
and without hope.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.790
Life is a nightmare now.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:54.000
I see the skeletons
in everything.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:59.300
Despite family attempts
to separate the couple,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.660
Frank and Charlie continued
their romance underground

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.350
alternating seeing and
fleeing from each other

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.360
across the spring and
early summer of 1849.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.200
In August and September of
that year they were separated.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.580
He was in [Inaudible],
she was at Newport.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.230
Only to renew their relationship
when the new term began.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.630
Quote, and not surprisingly

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.050
at that point Child's
hormones were raging.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.480
Quote, I want to take
her in my arms and kiss

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.700
for an hour he writes to Ell.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.490
She has her faults and is so
humble to entreat me to speak

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.900
of her of what I
do not like in her.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.490
But there is so much good left

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.140
and the soul is so
worth redeeming.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.990
I desire nothing more perfect.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.630
I prefer my Charlie
with all her faults

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.290
to all the faultless women
I ever saw or heard of.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.760
And in his next letter
he writes.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.420
Quote, it is just 6:00
o'clock and I have returned

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.380
from a solitary walk
on a cold rainy night.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.680
We had a dreary sermon about
death this afternoon Ell.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.750
I call it dreary and yet
the man tried to make

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.770
out that death was
a light matter.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.720
Now I have been wanting
to die all day.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.520
And yet the sermon
did not please me.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.820
I cannot communicate

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.700
by description the peculiar
character of my feelings

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.750
when I am in such a
condition as the foremost.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.560
It seems as if some of
my senses have gone.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.040
Every object is tinged
with a dark color.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.140
I have felt the same comfortless
sensation in dreams long ago.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.910
But never like within
this year in waking hours.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:42.120
A week later things sound
even more dangerous.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.350
But Friday night we did
transgress our ardor Ell.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.760
We were in a quiet, quiet
little cozy corner alone.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.770
I did draw Charlie's
head to my heart

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:57.090
and we shared forbidden kisses.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.190
The next day we walked together
and we talked everything over.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:04.320
We talked of being
married, of married love.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.370
Of the early love days
of our past sorrows.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.060
There isn't a hope.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:14.650
Finally at the end of October,
1849 Child is heart-stricken

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.520
in extremists and
something must be done.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.490
Quote, I have got through
with mewing and puking.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.910
I have the written order
of the doctor to go.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.790
Here is what the doctor says.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.360
My advice to you is to indicate
this coming winter to a voyage

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.280
to Europe of such
length than and residence

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.760
as circumstances shall dictate.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.700
My advice is based on the
observation and impression

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.660
of many cases of a peculiar
nervous morbidity to which men

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.870
who have been long
and constantly engaged

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.280
in intellectual pursuits are
not into frequently liable.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.980
It is difficult to make the
theory of this instability

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.190
of the nervous system
very clear to persons

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.350
who pursuits have
not been directed

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.330
to these pathological matters.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.200
But it is no uncommon
case for a person

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.180
to have the patient disturbance
of that group of organs,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.900
the nerves indicating
in sleeplessness,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.740
suffering without palpable
injury augmenting to neuralgia

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.490
of great anguish all without
the disease of digestion

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.390
or the circulatory apparatus.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.350
Of half of the diseases
of literary men

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.300
in my opinion owe their
existence to an overworked brain

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.600
and the dispective

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.760
or consumptive symptoms
are all consequent.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.660
Change, sea voyage, but
especially the abstention

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.170
from books and a
compulsory attention

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.530
to the thousand new excitements
of men and things gives a chance

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.130
to the fully, to
the full cooperation

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.360
of the obstructed parts
of the constitution.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.310
Your complaints are now of a
moderate degree of intensity

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.370
and no different than in
a thousand literary men.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:01.120
But they are a warning
and not to be neglected.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.140
With the full resents
of responsibility

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.260
of recommending a planned
requiring sacrifices I do not

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.520
hesitate in saying the future
perspective advantages outweigh

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.250
all other considerations.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.750
And then Child's
writes in triumph,

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.830
the corporation agrees
that I shall go.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:26.610
And then he ends with what
is an amazing non sequitur.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.610
Did I tell you of my
visit to the madhouse Ell?

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.850
I did it in a frenzy
last winter.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:39.440
Two months later after a
tearful separation and promises

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.370
of constancy, Child
gave Charlie a book.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.630
She gave him a Newport
[Inaudible].

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.740
They kissed chastely and parted

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.700
with understanding
but not engagement.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.950
Child sailed to Europe and
began his studies in Germany.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:40:00.660
Four months later in May, 1850,
beloved Charlie wrote to inform

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.890
that him that she was engaged
to be married in late summer.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.930
Confronting the event in his
feelings he wrote with more

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:13.570
than a touch of New England's
famed emotional frost.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.640
Quote, and now my dear Ell
having run through the facts

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.580
of the last fortnight I
will come to a subject

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.980
which I cannot avoid
to any other than you.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.220
I could not compel
myself to speak of it.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.040
Your surmises as to the contents

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.140
of the letter you enclosed
were perfectly correct

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.130
and before this time
the engagement

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.440
of Miss Everett has now
publically announced.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.630
I need not say that I was not at
all prepared for such an event.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.520
I had not received
the least warning.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.800
The reports of her flirting
which had reached me

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.010
through various channels
affected me disagreeably

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:54.930
as you must have perceived from
the last letter I sent you.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.520
I considered it very
unworthy conduct.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.860
But that a year of such
certainty as ours in the course

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.570
of which she had suffered so
much for me and at the end

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.170
of which she fancied
herself bound to me

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.950
by every tie of infection.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.270
And while she was bound to me
by almost every tie of faith

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.920
that such a painful year should
be forgotten so lightly was not

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.450
in accordance either
with my perceived views

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.360
of feminine character
or with the opinion

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.250
which I fondly entertained of
Miss Everett in particular.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.270
Still I am by no
means more affected

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.070
by this second overthrow
to my hopes than I was

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.510
in December of 1848, liar.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.120
My prevailing thought is

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.700
that I will never hazard
my peace of mind again.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.400
Let me read that once more.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.770
My prevailing habit thought is

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:53.550
that I will never hazard
my peace of mind again.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.260
But for the desire to be,
but the desire to be loved is

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.290
so strong that my
heart sinks sometimes.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.770
I do not deserve such happiness

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.630
and I must not think
of impossibilities.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:11.600
A year later in May of 1851 in
the midst of planning his return

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.300
to Cambridge to take up
the Boylston Professorship,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.810
Channing had in fact
retired after 30 years

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.880
of undergraduates, and
the position that he had

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.900
so desperately coveted,
Child wrote his last words

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.860
on Charlie and their love.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.890
Ell, I have left dente
[Phonetic] to be with you.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.810
Were you here dearest Ell?

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.170
Today is an anniversary for me.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.140
I have a lived a year
since I received the letter

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:43.230
which shattered all my plans
and stifled so many of my hopes.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:46.460
I can say now without
tears though my heart is

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.980
so much harder than before.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:53.170
But I never would set my eyes
for those dead feelings again.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.220
The worst is that I
can never love anymore.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.230
You wonder if I have no regret
that I ever felt such passion

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.680
for one who did not deserve it.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.910
Yet I must confess it
is you, only to you,

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.740
yes she did not deserve it.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.810
Yet she was loved as the
gentlest and truest rarely are.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.140
As every young man
with a heart loves

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.420
for the first and only time.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.180
She is gone forever from me

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.210
and I do not regret
the loss anymore.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.100
For those of you who feel
as if you have wandered

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.830
into a public reading of Gertes
[Phonetic], The Sufferings

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:39.000
of Young Werther, do not quail.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.440
How else might one
react after listening

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.640
to an anguished lover pour out
his heart to his friend William

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.960
about a girl called Charlotte
whom he cannot have and

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.260
yet wants desperately?

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.740
The extravagance of utterance
and feeling the extremes

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.910
of exaltation and
loathing of deprecation

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.930
and grandiosity are
almost difficult to hear.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.920
Nonetheless these
moments of injured love

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.100
and ambition are the way
some overeducated young men

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.360
of Charles generation
suppose they ought

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.900
to express themselves.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.500
Such suffering they
thought was necessary

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.150
to cultivate originality
and of course this Child

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:18.280
in his historical moment is
a nearly perfect exemplar

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.970
of the suffering self
as a work of art.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:27.380
And though Child does not
commit suicide as Werther does,

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.810
well I am not completely sure

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.540
as a Penn graduate I regret
he took the job at Harvard.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.320
He certainly flings himself

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.770
about with the same bathic
[Phonetic] energy as he tries

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:41.690
to merge the realities of who
he is with who he wants to be.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.770
A man, a loyal son, a
professor, an ardent lover.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.490
He also comes to term
with life as it is and not

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.790
as it might have been.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:56.140
Stiffly but sadly Child's
rhetorical identity has shifted.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.670
Injured ambition, poverty,
status anxiety and the excesses

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.530
of love have given way
to a quiet resignation

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.120
and is somewhat measured
reflection.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.590
An identity founded in angst and
nurtured in anguish has mutated

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.580
into the comfortable neuroses

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.430
of an ordinary pertherial
[Phonetic] life.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:17.780
Gertes young romantic
genius chooses

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.900
to accept Thomas Hardy's
life's little ironies

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.530
and the frenzied almost mad
Child, like the rest of us,

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.410
settles for less hazard
and more security.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:34.900
Unlike Orsino in Twelfth
Night he will have his Olivia

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.130
if he can find her and
count himself lucky.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.930
Thank you very much.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:50.370
[ Applause ]

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.680
I should point out
for those of you

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.320
who might be slightly
worried soon

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:00.200
after this he meets
Ellery's sister Elizabeth

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.620
and begins a ten year
courtship with him chasing her

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.200
and her family saying
she's not healthy enough

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.740
until they finally
do get married

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.850
where upon they have four
children in seven years.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:13.180
So I guess they were wrong about
that part of the family worry.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.330
And they remained a
happy couple for many,

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.630
many years in Cambridge.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.560
And my last picture.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.630
This is if not the most famous,
the most important picture

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.400
of Francis James Child.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.220
At their house in Cambridge
they had no front lawn.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.240
It was nothing but rose bushes.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.540
And Child was one

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.170
of the greatest rose
growers in that era.

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.730
People would come to stare at
his front lawn in the spring

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:46.230
and early summer when
all the roses bloomed.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.000
He became jolly and
genial and stubby.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.510
And I'd be happy to take any
questions if you have them.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:00.480
[Pause]

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.650
This is real terror
moment, did I silence you?

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:10.720
&gt;&gt; Well were all dying for
a picture of Charlotte.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.020
&gt;&gt; Oh yes.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Bell: I just
found one about two weeks ago

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.790
in an uncatalogued folder at
the University of Michigan

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.930
but I couldn't get
to it in time.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:25.940
Yea. She later married Henry
Augustus Wise whom she met here

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:31.220
in Washington who was an
author and a soldier and tall

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.010
and exactly the kind of person
her parents wanted her to marry.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.560
He actually was a
famous traveler.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.860
Nancy, yea?

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.070
&gt;&gt; Can you tell a little
bit about your research

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:43.760
about finding [Inaudible]?

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Bell: Okay.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.100
Most of my discoveries of Child
materials is the consequence

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.950
of getting bored in the
library and not wanting to work

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.540
on what I actually
wanted to work on.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.330
So in this particular case every
so, Child scholars like a lot

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.190
of historians periodically
just sit down at Google,

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:07.710
because it's all Google, and
type of Francis James Child just

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.650
to see what the most
recent thing is.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:12.840
And maybe five years ago I typed
in Francis James Child and what

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.650
up popped was Elizabeth
Ellery Sedgwick Child,

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.980
University of Michigan.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.210
And I thought that
doesn't make any sense.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.100
What is Elizabeth Ellery
Sedgwick Child doing

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.450
at the University of Michigan?

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:25.450
And Michigan as libraries do had
bought a collection of papers

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:27.670
that were available at auction.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:31.500
And I looked at the one page
not finding guide, finding guide

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.220
that said collection
includes letters

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.330
between Elizabeth and Francis.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.420
And I thought I have
to see them.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.930
And so my wife asked me
what I wanted for Hanukah?

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.690
And I said I wanted a
plane ticket to Ann Arbor.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.330
And she bought me a plane
ticket to Ann Arbor.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.140
And I went to Ann
Arbor and I stayed

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.440
in the house of a colleague.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.730
We had lived in Ann
Arbor previously.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.360
And I went to the library
and I opened them up.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.770
And in the midst of all these
letters I found the love letters

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.270
of Francis James Child
to Elizabeth Sedgwick.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.510
Of which I have transcribed
two or three

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:07.340
and have a small essay on.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.900
Child's courtship habits largely
come from 2nd Corinthians

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.700
if anyone is interested.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.960
But we really don't have very
many other documents on love

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.420
that quite do it as well
as that document does it.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.270
At least that are not poetry.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.460
And so I came back
to Massachusetts

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.690
and I thought well I wonder
where the Sedgwick papers are.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:31.680
The Sedgwick's being an
extraordinarily famous

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.180
Massachusetts family.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.620
They go back to Theodore who was
actually the lawyer for Mumbai,

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.360
the African American woman who
was one of the first slaves

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.340
who was freed as a consequence

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.280
of northern lawyers
challenging slave laws.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.670
Mumbai is the only African
American buried in what's known

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.070
as the Sedgwick pie which
is the grave yard in Lennox,

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.010
Massachusetts in
the shape of a pie.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.410
Child is also buried
there as [Inaudible].

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.630
And so I thought oh, I'll go

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.120
to the Massachusetts Historical
Society where it turned

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.780
out all the Sedgwick
papers were.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.440
And I went in and I
looked up Elizabeth

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.900
and there were some
things about Elizabeth.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:14.280
And then I saw there was a
note that said Ellery Sedgwick.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.680
And it said correspondence
between he

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.010
and Francis James Child.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:23.210
And I thought how come
nobody knows about this?

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:27.620
And then I thought I
found it, I found it.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:34.160
And I went and literally they,
you know, they bring you the box

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.860
and they're very
wonderful and calm.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.490
And they set the box next to
you and you're in this room

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:42.170
where you feel absolutely, all
of Massachusetts [Inaudible]

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:46.520
and puritan silence
folds in on you.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.190
And I opened up the box and
I opened up the first folder.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:57.340
And I realized that this
was an amazing moment.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.100
We suddenly had access
to Child, the person.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.420
And at the beginning
of his career.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.310
Again, before he
became a ballad.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:10.470
At the moment and I don't
want to make too much of that.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.100
I mean Child's collection
stands apart from Child.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.370
It is an extraordinary piece
of historical documentation.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:18.670
But in a funny sort of way

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.360
because he never
wrote an introduction

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:25.120
and we never knew the man or
had a way of knowing the man.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.920
We really lack the ability

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.330
to say anything about
the collection.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.180
And so it stands as an
origin document for us

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.490
without commentary by and large.

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:38.360
There are five or six
attempts at commentary in Child

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.070
across the last hundred
odd years

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.730
since the last volume
was published.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:45.200
But it really you,
because it isn't in time.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.380
So you can't say oh well, Child
was a really great scholar

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.650
and he collected 305
ballads and X number

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:51.950
of variance of the ballads.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.960
But we have long since
moved on between,

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.540
from Child's original
definition of the ballad.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.010
None of that got said.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.850
And in a funny sort of way
folksong scholarship ended

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:06.270
up being endless collection.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:09.270
But it didn't have any
documentary structure

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:13.490
for its analysis in the ways
folktales did or ironically

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.810
in the way other
smaller genres did.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:17.850
There's a generation
upon generation

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.640
of folklore scholarship
about lots of genres.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.400
But ballads actually
sort of got frozen.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.900
And if it weren't for
folk singers, air quotes,

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.290
they might never have been
sung since most of the people

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:33.470
who collected them
didn't collect their tunes

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:37.760
and didn't actually think
of them as sung documents.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.220
The world of their singing
had disappeared in the,

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.940
at the end of the middle ages.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.660
They were remembered
in recitation mostly

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.090
because they had to be
written down by hand.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:51.330
And many of the people could
not note tunes so they presumed

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.460
to be recitative
documents as much

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.860
as they were singing documents.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:02.310
And so in a sense as
brilliant as the moment

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:07.860
of his collection is it freezes
us apart from and an ability.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:11.800
So think for example and I'm
wandering a bit but I'm not.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.510
Who would essay a
criticism of a ballad today?

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:21.880
Who would treat it like the
poem, the sung poem it is?

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.830
Who would pick up Lamkin
[Phonetic] or Sir Hugh

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:30.130
and the Jew's daughter and read
it the way you would read any

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:31.810
other poem?

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:36.120
We actually lack a
critical, critical language

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.300
for that level of analysis.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.860
We have an extraordinary
language described at structure,

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:46.000
to describe its form, to point
out all of its variation.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.670
Yet in the ballad which doesn't
exist there is no single text.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.640
So in all the text
of all the ballads

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.540
and all the work we've done
historically, to conjure all

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.770
of that structure we
would find it amiss

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:07.680
if we actually commented on the
beauty or the lack of beauty

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.990
of this extraordinary
moment in human creativity

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:18.390
where no one single voice
ever captures the poetry

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.100
of the ballad.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.420
Even if we can't find the poets,
the poetics of that experience

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.160
and the critical value of
that experience is ironically

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.030
something that we've
been denied, I think,

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.930
by the absence of
Child's biography.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.890
So, the more that we can do to
fill that part of the story in,

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:44.780
I think, more the possibility
that we might free ourselves

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:50.480
to begin to call public
attention not to the existence

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.590
of but to the beauty
of the ballad.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.570
I know for a fact many
of us who are sitting

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:02.210
in this room found ourselves
in listening to those songs

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:04.520
for the first time
a long time ago.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:09.800
I know that many of us can
date the moment when they froze

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.900
and we're totally captured.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:18.660
I think if we can tell
Child's story we can give life

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.670
to that part that made
him dedicate his life

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.490
to the collection and
preservation of these materials.

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:29.950
Is that enough there?

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:33.130
And besides it's just fun.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.970
It's just fun.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.290
Any other?

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:44.330
&gt;&gt; So if I remember correctly,
this is just a chunk of letters?

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:45.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Bell:
This is, this is.

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:46.930
You want chapter two?

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:50.740
&gt;&gt; Did he get happier?

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Bell: He got happier.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.500
He actually settled down
at Harvard to a career.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.050
And he very systematically
set out.

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.610
I mean in a way that's
quite remarkable.

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:03.060
He became the Boylston
Professor.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.940
I don't know if you know
what the Boylston Professor

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.800
of Rhetoric did at Harvard.

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.410
The Boylston Professor
of Rhetoric

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.930
at Harvard was a
composition professor.

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:14.650
He taught composition to
freshman and sophomores.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.220
He didn't teach rhetoric.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.110
He corrected compositions,
as in a side,

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.950
all the compositions are
there in Harvard if you want

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.280
to go see Child's corrections.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:29.130
Because apparently they
didn't give them back.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:33.910
He realized that to advance
he had to publish a book.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.630
He found a book of four plays
that had never been published

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.220
in the United States that
had been badly edited.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.930
He edited those plays,
issued that as a book

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.160
and that was his
first publication.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.120
He then searched around
within English studies

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.420
for his next area

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.060
of specialization
and chose Chaucer.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:58.760
And he did extraordinary work
on Chaucer leading to an essay

00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.370
on the language of Chaucer
which is still taught today

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:07.130
in Chaucer classes as the
fundamental foundational text

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.540
of understanding
language both real

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.320
and poetic language in Chaucer.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.470
And then he stopped
doing Chaucer and in one

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:17.550
of the letters to Ell that I've
just been working on he said

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.700
in effect, there is not
career for me in Chaucer.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.490
The English have
the manuscripts.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.650
Nothing I write will ever top
what they can top me with.

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:32.060
And he turned his
attention to Spencer.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:36.750
And he wrote and produced
the first American six

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:39.280
volume Spencer.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.310
But again the English
had Spencer.

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:46.440
And so in a late letter to
Ell, which I've just gotten

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:52.680
to he wrote to Ell and said
I'm going to do some books

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.840
on ballads for the
British poets.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.380
I think I found my subject.

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:02.070
And so he did the six volume
British poets in the 1850s.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:07.750
And then he turned around
almost immediately and did the,

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.530
started the work that would end

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:13.060
up by 1896 being
the five volume,

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:18.620
ten part giant folio English
and Scottish popular ballads.

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:23.610
And that bit with the reason
he dedicated it to Ell was

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:28.450
because Ell had the
collection of books

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:32.250
in which Child first
encountered the ballad

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:36.020
in their roommate moment
with shared bookshelves.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.760
And in fact in this letter that
I'm looking at now Child writes

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.170
to Ell and says, do you
still have the Jamison

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:45.380
in your library?

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.530
Do you think I could borrow it?

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.620
And those of you who know
Child's career know he was

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.810
always writing to
libraries asking for books.

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:58.340
And so that's, that sort
of completes the story.

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:02.880
Thank you very much.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.990
I'll be, I'll, you know,
if you want to come up

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:07.450
and ask questions or whatever
I'm happy to take them as long

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.340
as you can tell, as long
as you want to ask them.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.510
But thank you so
much for coming.

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:18.250
