00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.860
So we have a hip pocket on the right hand
side.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.420
Two and half in.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.040
Six.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.400
Two and a half.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.940
Two and three quarters.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.480
How many years have you been at Anderson &amp; Sheppard?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.140
Mm, thirty, forty years now.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.060
A long time.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.480
We use the machines

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.600
to do the seams, to strengthen it.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.860
But a lot of it is hand sewn.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.910
The fly is hand sewn.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.440
The pocket mouth, inside, is hand sewn.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340
Then the insides are finished.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.860
Right.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.940
That's now done, and we go over to the pressing
machine.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.260
You mark out the top sides. You transfer the
information onto the underneath ones,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.580
to the right side.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.180
Same on the underside.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.260
And then you mark out your bits that you need.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.250
The bands, and the fly and the button catcher,
and then the rest of it you get bits to piece

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.360
together sort of thing.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000
And away you go.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
And here we have all the bits and pieces.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.540
So linen that will go behind the pocket,
and then the pocketing and this is the demet,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.520
which will go on top of the canvas when we
make the canvas up, to build it up.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.370
So mark stitching we use a basting cotton.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.340
It's basically just so that when the two pieces
of cloth get separated,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.460
the mark stitch will then be on the other side of the cloth.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.440
And it just helps us for like working out
where different things are on the cloth.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.690
So like the pocket, the lapel, so where it
will roll.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.790
The button holes.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.660
The shoulders.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.680
Basically I'm going over the chalk marks that
the cutters would do upstairs and we'll just

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.069
decide the size of the outbreast pocket that
we think is the best size with relation to

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.720
how big the job is.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.000
Yeah, we're kind of just like refine the lines
that they do upstairs.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.389
For the first fitting, we will actually put
lining in the pockets in.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.210
So quite a lot of the work is done.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.660
So it will look like a proper jacket once
it's tried on the customer.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.960
On a forward all of the pockets are put in.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.980
An undercollar, which we make up ourselves.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.400
And the sleeves are basted in with no linings.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:56.380
So the fitting will be done by one of the
cutters and all the alterations will be marked.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.720
If it is a bit tight or it needs letting out
or maybe the sleeves are a bit long or maybe

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.000
if the sleeves need lengthening.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.540
Then it will come back to me and then we will
then put the back lining in.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.160
Here's one with the sleeves fully made up.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.380
All the lining is in.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.100
And all of the button holes will all be done
by hand by someone we call the finisher.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.060
The cutter is cutting them, the tailor is
putting them together.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.160
The finishing is actually finishing the product.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.069
It's closing everything.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.789
It's actually many hours.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.960
We do work many hours for the jacket.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.820
And I'm not sure if the customer knows that..

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.100
But definitely they see the value and the results of it, so.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.240
Must be something special about it.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.520
I've been at Anderson &amp; Sheppard for right
about now over thirty years.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.600
I would say about thirty three years.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:47.000
Now a suit off the peg, the lapel will be
totally ironed totally right flat to the first

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.620
button hole, which is where our mark stitch
is.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:59.200
But on a bespoke suit what we do, the roll
is all determined by via the collar.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.000
The undercollar.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.640
You get it lined up.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.380
Exactly where the first button hole would
be.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.220
And there we have it rolling to the first
button.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.200
All that's pressed is from here to here.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.320
Our forward is now ready for the fitting on
the customer.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.100
–Good afternoon, sir.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.300
–Good afternoon, Mr. Powell.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.240
–Are you keeping well?

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.080
–Very well, and you?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.060
–Okay, let's just turn you around into this
mirror please.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.740
We'll just work our way round from the top.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.290
Once again, good on the neck.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.920
It's nice, you got a nice half inch of collar
showing all the way around.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.780
Shoulders are good.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.180
I'd personally leave them at that.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.820
I wouldn't draw them in, or it'll feel too
tight and restrictive.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.920
Got a little bit of ease in the back.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.160
We might give you just a fraction more ease.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.680
It's a little tight.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.640
Actually, here.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.720
Just to give a bit of...

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.920
Waist is nice.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
Length looks good.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680
How do you feel about length?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680
Oh, I love it.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.680
It looks great.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.680
It's amazing.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.000
Let's try to find a bit of cuff.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.940
The only other thing at first glance I would
do as well..

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.010
The shirt looks a good length.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.930
What I'd personally do would be bring that
down.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:37.300
What you want to show is between a quarter
and maybe half an inch of cuff.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
Also...

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.620
Let's pick the back of the sleeve
up as well.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:57.180
What it'll do is give a cleaner line down
the back of the sleeve

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.680
so it's not bunching up.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.160
At the moment there's a little bit...yeah,
just the back of the crowns of the sleeve

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.540
need to be picked up a fraction.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.360
Which helps.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.560
Then unto the front.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.740
Button position.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.200
Lapels are sitting nice over the chest.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.580
Lapel width is a nice width for you.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.380
Chest looks good.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.529
It's got a little bit of drape.

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:29.820
Once again, I'd leave that.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.200
I wouldn't take any of that away.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.780
Okay.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.020
How does it feel?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.820
Really, really comfy.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.820
Yeah.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.360
I do feel a bit of umm...

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.440
We'll let it go a fraction in the back.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.040
Otherwise, I love the shape.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.269
Shape's good.

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:52.089
It's got suppression.

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:53.560
Lapel width, nice width.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.420
–In general, looks very, very nice.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420
–Excellent.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.480
About four weeks, sir.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.000
And we'll be all ready for the next fitting.
