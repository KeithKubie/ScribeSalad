00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.530
With their records now digital, can we
infer the underlying clinical processes

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.530
that patients receive as they traverse
the complex service areas of a hospital?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.230
More importantly, can we identify
differences in these processes and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.210
the impact these have on outcomes and
costs?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.980
This analysis is common
in other industries and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.040
is referred to as process mining.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.870
However, these industries typically have
mechanized processes, where automated

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.580
sensors routinely and accurately
provide digital timestamped data.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.118
This is not yet the case in health care,
which is still a largely manual industry

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:43.775
and one where care steps may
be documented digitally but

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.800
either incompletely,
inaccurately, or after the fact.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:52.950
Nevertheless there are situations where
process mining appears to be feasible.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.000
This is research from the Netherlands,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.460
where process mining
originated in the late 1990s.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.870
It examined the care of ischemic stroke
patients, patients with a clot in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.980
the arteries of their brain,
in two hospitals shown here.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.190
The results clearly indicate
significant differences,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.170
with one hospital on the left here
emphasizing the use of treatments

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
aimed at protecting brain cells to
limit the damage from the ischemia.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.440
This is the more state
of the art approach.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.020
This is early work, but here at
Georgia Tech we feel that process mining

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.335
is a potentially
important technology for

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:36.050
re-engineering a health
care delivery system.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.540
To make it safer,
more cost effective, and ultimately,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.340
a more valuable and
responsible component of our society.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.510
Which of these are limitations of
the Dutch ischemic stroke study?

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.690
Check all that apply.
