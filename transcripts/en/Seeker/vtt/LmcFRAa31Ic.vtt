00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.980
To date we've confirmed 1,821 planets outside
of our solar system.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.980
In 1989, there were zero.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.520
And I think it's fair to say, we've learned
a few things since then.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.250
Hey planetoids, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.820
In 1584, a Catholic Monk, Giordano Bruno claimed
there were "countless suns and countless Earths."

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.690
More than 400 years later, in a 1995 book
on exoplanets three scientists wrote, "The

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.040
detection and study of Earth-like planets
outside our Solar System will be one of the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.300
great scientific, technological and philosophical
events of our time."

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.370
Because even with so much time in between,
no earth-like planets had been confirmed!

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.920
A decade later, the first earth-like planet,
Gliese 581 C, was discovered; and as of March

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.250
2015, we've confirmed 29 water-holding habitable,
earth-like planets; and calculations say there

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.760
might be BILLIONS more,.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.220
Do you feel like you live in the era of a
huge scientific, technological and philosophical

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220
event?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.280
You should!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.790
There's a huge database of possible candidates
and confirmed exoplanets, and as we observe

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.640
OTHER solar systems we're learning things
about how OUR solar system works.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.280
New research in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences used other solar systems

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.150
as a model for our own.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.350
Our solar system was formed from leftovers
after the Big Bang, gas and dust coalesced

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.650
into planets over many many millions of years.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.560
OTHER solar systems have supermassive exoplanets
closer to their sun, but we don't.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.420
Scientists believe Jupiter was the reason
ours looks different.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.750
They believe, Jupiter USED to be closer to
the sun, and tacked outward, dragging all

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.940
the junk from the inner solar system with
it.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.530
When the solar system first formed, there
were planetesimals, or small planetary building

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.570
blocks, flying around in the inner solar system
where Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.570
now.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.910
While today, Jupiter orbits at about 5 AUs,
it used to range from 3 to 10!

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.310
All that motion cleared the way like a wrecking
ball.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.830
It could have even destroyed any other proto-planets
which formed before the four inner planets

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.830
we have now.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.279
This Wandering Jupiter hypothesis isn't the
perfect explanation for why we look different,

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.889
but it hits a lot of checkboxes on the way
to a good theory.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.859
Keeping an eye on the sky has also helped
us feel a little less alone.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.889
A study in the Astrophysical Journal found
Kepler 444, a solar system which has five

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:37.600
Earth-like planets orbiting it in a way very
similar to our own -- AND it's 11.4 billion

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.469
years old, meaning those planets were formed
long before ours and are relatively similar

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.469
in size.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.219
The problem is, they're too close to their
star, orbiting in only around 10 days -- Mercury

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.840
orbits in 84 days.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.349
So, while 444 doesn't have life, it shows
planets can form really FAST, and that's USEFUL

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.730
because there might be life-capable planets
with a billion-year head start on us out there!

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.709
The Kepler telescope was launched in 2009
to search for exoplanets and, in case you've

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.169
forgotten, KEPLER is BROKEN and is STILL finding
them.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:16.790
The Milky Way has between 100 and 400 billion
stars -- that's a lot of places to point a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.790
telescope.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.579
The more we learn, the more scientists can
make educated guesses and point telescopes

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.859
at the right stars.

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.719
It might be blazÃ© to say it, but I'm pretty
sure, finding other planets really is the

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.430
most scientific, technological and philosophical
event that you never think about.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:52.209
And we really should think about it more,
because it teaches us so much about our own!
