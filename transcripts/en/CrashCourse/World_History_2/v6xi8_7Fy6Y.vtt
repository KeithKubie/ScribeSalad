Hi, I'm John Green.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:05.230
This is Crash Course World History, and today
we're gonna return to two of our favorite

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.650
themes: the creation of nation-states and
the role of war.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.909
And we're gonna focus on a region that often
gets overlooked in world history, Latin America.

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.480
Me from the Past: Wait, Mr. Green, Mr. Green--there's
another America?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.580
Where they speak Latin?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.289
Well, yes and no, Me from the Past.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
In fact, the United States is not America.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.320
This is America.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.429
And no, people in Latin America do not speak
Latin.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:35.980
We call it Latin America because, you know,
European hegemony in naming things.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.630
[Intro]

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.490
So I know this will lead me to being accused
of Eurocentrism, but if we're going to talk

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.160
about nation-states in Latin America, we do
have to begin in Europe.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.010
Specifically, I want to talk about a controversial
theory about how nation-states emerge, coming

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.740
from a book called Coercion, Capital, and
European States, by Charles Tilly.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.000
It's a pretty dense book, but the basic theory
is that some European states were able to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.470
transform themselves into what Tilly calls
"national states" between the 16th and 20th

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
centuries, because their rulers were able
to develop the coercive institutions--you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.350
know, like police and especially the army--that
protected their populations from outsiders.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.300
And also to protect from internal revolutions.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.080
So you have the army, that keeps you safe
from outside threats, and then the police,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080
keeping you safe from inside threats.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.720
At the same time, these national states developed
the economic institutions to extract revenue

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.180
to pay for this coercion, which allowed the
state to flourish.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.530
So the state needs revenue to make its army
and police work, and the key to that, of course,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.530
is war.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.030
Or, at least, the threat of war.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.090
But for this cycle that we've talked about
in the past to work, it has to be a specific

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.500
kind of war, right?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.620
It has to be an international war, a war against
a different foreign power.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.670
Because civil wars are not good for the economy,
and also obviously bad for like, the institutions

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.670
of the state.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.670
Okay, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.869
So Tilly starts with the highly debatable
proposition that war creates states, which

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.710
then fight wars, which further enhance the
power of states.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.700
For the most part, European wars were over
control of territory, right?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.729
With the state either trying to extend its
territory, or prevent its neighbors from extending

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.729
theirs.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:16.010
To expand your territory, or defend against
someone else's expansion, rulers needed armies.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.360
And this became the state's first large-scale
organization.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.319
Armies required additional organizations,
especially ones that collected taxes, so states

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.540
with large armies tended to bureaucratize.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.760
According to this theory, wars also helped
in the transition to more direct rule by the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760
state.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.040
Before 1750, most European states relied on
intermediaries, like local clergy and landlords,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.189
to do what governments do.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.749
But these intermediaries could get in the
way, so the rulers started bypassing them

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.160
and instituting more direct forms of rule.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.989
But direct rule was intrusive in citizens'
lives, especially when they were required

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.060
to serve in the army or pay taxes to support
the army.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.770
Now, forced conscription into the army is
generally unpopular, but it does allow citizens

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.709
to have some leverage over the state--because,
you know, then they make up the army.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.220
Citizen soldiers and citizen taxpayers can
use this leverage to extract concessions from

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.590
the state, usually in the form of greater
political participation, which has been a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.159
hallmark of classical European liberal democracy.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.769
Now of course, this is all highly theoretical,
but as a model for state formation, it's also

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.769
somewhat elegant.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.120
And more importantly, because it applies to
Europe, and particularly to post-industrial

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.659
Europe, Eurocentric versions of history will
often hold this theory up as one of the reasons

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.480
for Europe's success in world history.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.569
Especially compared to other regions like,
say, Latin America.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.569
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.109
So, there's this persistent stereotype of
Latin American states, that for most their

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.480
history, most of them have been ruled by military
strongmen who use their armies to create strong

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.670
states that oppressed the people.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.439
And like many of the stereotypical historical
narratives we've seen, there's some truth

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.439
to that picture.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.120
But Latin America encompasses a lot of states
and has been around for a long time, so generalizations

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.959
aren't going to apply equally to all places
at all times.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.809
Like, in general, generalizations just don't
work that well.

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.719
And while there is a lot of shared history
and culture in Mexico and Central America

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.299
and South America, it's worth remembering
that Venezuela is as far away from Uruguay

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.609
as Mali is from Romania.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.210
So anyway, we've got this stereotype of the
strong man ruling these strong Latin American

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.099
states, but it's not that simple.

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.800
In his book Blood and Debt: War and the Nation
State in Latin America, historian Miguel Angel

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.639
Centeno posits that while Latin American has
had more than its share of military regimes,

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.340
this is a reflection of the weakness of the
state.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.409
And then goes on to argue that this may be
the result of the absence of international

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.180
wars in Central and South America.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.680
I mean, yes, there have been wars between
Latin American states, but they've been surprisingly

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.260
brief, and, compared with 20th century European
wars, not particularly destructive.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.229
Part of the reason for that, is that while
Latin American countries have frequently been

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.540
ruled by military leaders, they often lack
the capacity to raise large numbers of troops

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.259
and the taxes to pay for them.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.420
And thus their armies can't fight long, drawn-out
wars.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.750
Another reason is geography.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.419
Latin America's huge and geographically diverse,
but the borders of many of its countries tend

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.240
to be inhospitable for settlement.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.540
And without a lot of people living on the
frontiers, there's less opportunity and less

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.909
reason for conflict.

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.580
It's the same reason the U.S. hasn't gotten
in a war with Canada for like, a hundred seventy

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.580
years.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.580
There's just nothing up there.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.580
No offense, Canada.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.580
Well, some offense.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.439
What do you have that we need, trees?

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.439
Snow?

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:24.439
Hockey?

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.439
We've got hockey in Dallas.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.800
Also, in general, Centeno argues that Latin
American nation states tend to see themselves

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.169
as sister republics, as he wrote, "The continent
is seen as a larger community over and above

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.199
the nation state."

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.371
But, Latin America has seen a lot of civil
wars in the last two hundred years, and this

00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:45.520
is the crucial distinction; when Latin American
states mobilize their military, it's usually

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.159
against their own citizens.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.979
As Centeno puts it, "the enemy of 'La Patria'
was perceived not as the nation next door,

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.599
but as those in the population who threatened
the social and economic status quo."

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.280
Often, these enemies have been indigenous
people, or especially during the Cold War,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.789
communists, and other leftists.

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.930
So, that's one way of thinking about Latin
American states and comparing them to European

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.930
states.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.410
You know, maybe relative international peace
in Central and South America has contributed

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.610
to the states of Latin America being less
successful economically and politically than

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.610
those in Europe.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.960
But, as usual in World History, and also everything
else, the truth resists simplicity.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.870
So, according to Tilly's theory, "Wars can
be beneficial because they provide the potential

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.939
to create states, but that process doesn't
really work unless there's some institutional

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.599
foundation to build on," and most of the countries
in Latin America didn't have that, partly

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:39.110
because colonization was designed to make
sure that people couldn't put those institutions

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.590
into place in their homelands.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.599
And partly because the wars for independence
were so destructive to the region.

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.039
Then, the small-scale wars in Latin America
after independence didn't require states to

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.740
build up their tax collection apparatus, or
the accompanying financial structures.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.659
Because one, they had a steady source of revenue,
in the form of taxes on the exported commodities.

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:01.539
And secondly, like, if you're just gonna have
little wars, you can pay for them with loans

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.800
from Britain, or the United States, which
are happy to help, and all they ask in exchange

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.379
is that the CIA be allowed to run your country.

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:11.689
And also that multi-national corporations
be allowed to extract all of your resources

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:12.689
and keep the profits.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:16.320
So, because these loans and taxes on trade
were available to these states, they didn't

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.759
have to tax their populations.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.699
Now, that may seem like a good thing, but
taxes, and yes, I know that I'm a huge fan

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.810
of taxes; I'm biased toward taxes, TAXES are
good.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.879
Without taxes on individuals, the state didn't
have to bargain with its citizens and develop

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:33.639
the important bonds between the government
and the population that we find in stronger

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.639
states.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:38.020
Like, when a government needs money from its
people to function, it kind of has to listen

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.020
to them.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.469
And then there's the oft cited fact that wars
are really good for fostering nationalism,

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:46.580
and nationalism can, in fact, help build a
state as it did in 19th century Germany, which

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.439
everyone agrees was a great development.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:52.410
Anyway, without a lot of international wars
and especially without a sense of a threatening

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.430
enemy, the nation-states of Latin America
just aren't as nationalist as their European

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.430
counterparts.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.419
Well, I don't know about that, actually, have
you seen Brazil play Argentina at The World

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:02.419
Cup?

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:05.510
Okay, now I wanna turn to another challenge
for would-be nationalists in Latin America:

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.210
Latin America's legacy of racial and class
division.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.230
Viewers of the first Crash Course World History
series will remember that Latin American society

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.020
was divided into a pretty rigid hierarchy,
with Spanish-born peninsulares at the top,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.320
indigenous people and slaves at the bottom,
and Creoles and mestizos in the middle.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.310
When Latin American countries achieved independence,
these divisions became a source of anxiety

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.591
for the new ruling class of Creoles; class
and racial distinctions were intertwined,

00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:34.760
but in general, the ruling class was afraid
of losing too much of its power to the lower

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760
classes.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.140
One finds in world history very few examples
when the ruling class is, like, totally psyched

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.080
to give its power over to the lower classes,
but these race and class divisions also prevented

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.390
the armed forces from bringing people together.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.620
Like, in many countries, the army was one
of the first places where people from different

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.100
regions and of different social classes would
mingle together.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.730
And despite diverse backgrounds, they would
start to feel like citizens of the same nation,

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.520
fighting for a common cause.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.560
But Latin American armies were small, and
the social and economic hierarchy between

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.470
the officers and the enlisted rank were even
more pronounced than they were in, say, the

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.580
United States or in European countries.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.640
Another reason for the relative lack of state
nationalism in Latin America is the absence

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.350
of an external enemy, like, if you look at
European nationalism, one of the common features

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.980
is a clearly identifiable other, used to build
up nationalist feelings and a sense of common

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.980
identity.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.970
Like, Creoles in one Latin American country
likely saw themselves as different from their

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:35.520
own indigenous populations, but not so different
from the Creole elites in neighboring nations.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.840
As Miguel Centeno put it, in Latin America,
"The gulf between white, black, and Indian

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.470
within countries was always greater than the
differences between any of these groups across

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.470
borders."

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.161
So to me, all of this suggests that the connection
between war and building a national state

00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:55.380
is not as simple as Tilly suggests, and maybe
there's something else to learn here as well.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.870
In comparison with strong European states,
like the UK or France or Germany, Latin American

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.120
countries like Argentina and Peru and Mexico
can often appear unstable and violent, like

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.910
they're failing to provide the main thing
that a successful state gives its citizens:

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.910
safety.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.350
But those European states are also a lot richer,
and a big part of the reason that they are

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.160
a lot richer is colonialism.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.630
One of the central advantages that European
states have over Latin American states is

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:27.080
that European states were able to begin their
lives by extracting lots and lots of value

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.690
from Latin America, whereas most Latin American
states had to begin their existence with extremely

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.600
destructive wars for independence.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.150
So because after the 19th century, most of
the European states became more concerned

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.940
with providing for the welfare of their citizens
than using their security forces against those

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.410
citizens, and because these states have achieved
undeniable economic success along with internal

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:52.070
peace, there's a tendency in historical literature
to hold them up as the greatest possible example

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.070
of the nation-state.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.950
And I wanna be clear that many states in Europe
have been really successful.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.130
People tend to live long lives; crime rates
are relatively low; people report feeling

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:06.000
safer and happier, but the conditions in which
European nation-states arose were specific

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.650
to the region and to the time, and it's a
bad idea to try to universalize them as a

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.310
model for the rest of the world.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.880
I mean, thinking about Latin America, where
most of the independent nation-states are

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.570
older than either Italy or Germany should
remind us that, as Miguel Centeno puts it,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.060
"The process that occurred most successfully
in northwestern Europe beginning in the 16th

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.470
century and culminating in the 19th was the
true exception."

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.010
And I think it's also worth noting the tremendous
growth in many Latin American countries in

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.430
the past couple decades, which reminds us
that when it comes to history and picking

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.541
winners and losers, we should remember that
we are not at the end of history, --we're

00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:40.980
in the middle of it.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.980
Thanks for watching.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.980
I'll see you next week.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.320
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis; it's

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.490
made with the help of all of these nice people,
and it exists because of your support at Subbable.com.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.210
Subbable is a voluntary subscription service
that allows you to support Crash Course directly,

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.930
so we can keep it free for everyone forever,
also you can get great perks.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.520
So I wanna thank all of our Subbable subscribers.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.650
I also wanna thank you for watching, especially
thanks to the educators who share these videos

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.750
with your students, and as we say in my hometown,
don't forget to be awesome.
