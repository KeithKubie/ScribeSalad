00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.794
Now that we have a single fraction on one side of our inequality, and zero on

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.638
the other side, we can finally start to solve for x. First of all, what are the

00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:11.669
critical numbers here? What does x need to equal to make the numerator zero? And

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.463
what does it need to equal to make the denominator zero? These will be our two

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:16.430
critical numbers.
