00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.320
Rick just finished eating with
his family at a restaurant.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.990
The total bill for
his family was $52.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.140
And Rick was pretty
impressed with the service.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.830
So he's going to
leave a 25% tip.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
He wants to know
the total amount

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.390
he should leave at the table.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.940
Select the equations Rick
can use and determine

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.774
the total bill,
including the tip.

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:28.190
So the unknown thing, the thing
that we should figure out,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.480
is the total amount he
should leave at the table.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.750
So let's just call that x.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, there's a couple of
ways we could think about it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
We could think about
it as the ratio

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.820
between the total
amount he's going to pay

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.405
and the actual bill.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.780
That should be the
same thing as the ratio

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.850
between the respective ratios.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.810
So you could view the
actual amount of the bill

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.850
as being 100%.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.870
That is 100% of the bill.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510
But he doesn't want
to just pay 100%.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.445
He wants to pay
100% plus a 25% tip.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.310
So we could rewrite everything
that I just did here

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.900
as x over 52 is equal
to 100% plus 25%--

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.091
I could write that
as 125%-- over 100%.

00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:27.590
Now, if we look at
the choices here,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.340
this looks exactly like this.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.630
If we just swap the left
and right-hand side,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.770
we get 125% over 100%
is equal to x over 52.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.380
So we can select this one.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.840
And once again,
this makes sense.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.920
The ratio between
what he's going

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.369
to pay with the tip to
100%, or the percentage

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.910
that he's going to
pay if you include

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.070
the tip relative
to 100% is going

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.260
to be the actual amount he pays
relative to the actual bill.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.150
Now, let's see if any
of these other ones

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.060
make sense over here.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.230
So here he says it's the
ratio of the actual bill

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.406
at 100% is equal to the ratio
you're going to pay at 125%.

00:02:06.406 --> 00:02:07.530
Now, this makes sense, too.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.870
Let me just rewrite
it again for emphasis.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.890
So here they're
constructing a proportion

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.610
where you have the
ratio of the total bill.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.310
And you're saying, hey, look,
that total bill is 100%.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.995
Actually, let me
write that in blue.

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:26.400
The total bill is 100%.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.590
And we want to see
this ratio should

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.450
be the same as the ratio
between the actual amount we're

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.850
paying and 125%.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.200
So you increased this by 25%.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.680
Well, you're going to have
to increase this by 25%

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.660
as well to get the actual
amount that you're paying.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.615
So this makes sense as well.

00:02:51.615 --> 00:02:52.490
Now, what about this?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.000
The ratio between 100% and 125%
should be equal to x over 52.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.630
Now, this does not make
sense, because this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.700
is the ratio between
the full price

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.570
without paying the
tip and the tip.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.954
Well, here is the tip
and the full price.

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:11.870
So if you swapped these
two, if you wrote this

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.840
as 52 over x, then
you could check this.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.900
But here you're not
finding the ratio

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.350
between the
corresponding things.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.460
So I would not check
this one there.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.070
But either way, our
last thing to do

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.310
is actually to figure out how
much tip Rick should leave.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.930
So we need to
actually solve for x.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.640
And we could go back to
this original equation here.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.980
And if we multiply
both sides by 52,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.260
we get x is equal
to 125% divided

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.850
by 100% is 1.25 times 52.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.870
And then I could
just multiply that.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.370
Let's see.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.640
52.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.200
4 goes into 52 13 times.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.677
So this is going to be-- well,
actually, let me just divide.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:03.760
Let me just multiply that.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.260
I don't want to
make a mistake here.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.470
So 1.25 times 52.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.940
2 times 5 is 10.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.880
2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.756
2 times 1 is 2.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:21.589
Let's throw a 0 down
here, because we're now

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.722
multiplying by 50.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.840
5 times 5 is 25.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.920
5 times 2 is 10 plus 2 is 12.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.780
5 times 1 is 5 plus 1 is 6.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.260
So we get 0.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.440
Let's carry that 1.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.210
We get a 5.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.741
We get a 6.

00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:40.990
And then we have two numbers
behind the decimal point.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.882
It is 65.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:43.590
And that's right.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.780
That's 52 plus 1/4
of 52, which is 13.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.260
52 plus 13 is 65.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.380
So he should leave $65 if
we want to include the tip.
