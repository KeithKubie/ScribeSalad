1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,950
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,270
Just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast. And I'm just checking in on Ya.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,750
That's right. I'm not yelling at,
I'm fucking up my voice doing that.

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,060
Every God damn week I'm
starting to drink, throw Coty.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,050
I need to take care of
myself in these next,

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:24,051
this next chapter as they peel off another
layer of the onion or whatever stupid

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,910
artistry thing. I've just decided, you
know, few people in my life, you know,

8
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,470
I'm kind of seeing it. I'm seeing it.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm seeing what live in a certain
lifestyle leads to. And I'm like,

10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,840
you know what? I need to clean up
my act a little bit. All right.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,390
It's time to grow. And so one of
the first things I'm going to do,

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,970
I'm not cutting out the booze or
I'm just going to stop yelling.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,500
I'm checking in on you. You
know, it's baby steps, you know,

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,620
and I'll gradually work towards
laying off the heroin. You know,

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,770
I like it. It helps me,
helps me go to sleep.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,370
You know the amount of times that I always
want to take a nap when I'm standing

17
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:05,840
up outside in public and I just can't do
it because my mind just won't shut off.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,630
You know, that's, that's
when the heroin comes in.

19
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,920
That's when it comes into play. You're
going to have to listen to my phone,

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,620
Ding Dong and cause I got a phone call
coming up and I don't want to miss it

21
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:20,030
here. Um, anyways, let me see here.

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,190
Uh, uh, Jesus. Now I'm going to be looking
at text messages, message messages,

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,860
messages, while I'm
trying to do this podcast.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,270
This is really going to fuck with
my add here. How's your week going?

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm going to tell you something, right?
Oh, but oh, Billy Booz bag. All right.

26
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,150
I had, I had family and flew back.

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,980
Sched some of you guys guessed
the movie by the way. Um,

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,390
it's something you do with a car.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,940
Can't figure it out now
I can't help you. Uh,

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,160
what I love is now everybody
knows what the movie is,

31
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:56,600
but there's still going to tech treat
me like, you know, the long, long,

32
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:01,010
long trailer starring Lucille Ball. Um,

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,240
why don't you guys ask me if it's every
other movie that you can do with the car

34
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,950
other than the one you
notice. How about that?

35
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,810
How about switching it up a little bit?

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,610
Is it Herbie goes to Monte-Carlo you
don't even realize all these years I've

37
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,170
been using that as a reference. Like,

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,880
cause it's the f one of the
first or second movie I saw,

39
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,140
I saw for the love of Benji.

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,500
Then I saw Herbie goes to Monte-Carlo
and my mother was just like,

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,100
my mother told me, you know, they're
just, those kids movies were stupid.

42
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,810
I wasn't going to take it
any more of those, you know,

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,520
basically there wasn't anything there for
her. And she just was looking at like,

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,920
you know, there's really
nothing here for these kids.

45
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:40,580
It's a fucking talking car.
It's a talking dog. You know.

46
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,860
How long are we going to
keep the lie going? Alright,

47
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,740
the fat fuck doesn't come down.
The chimney. Dogs don't talk.

48
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,780
And the fee w beetle, it's a, it's a,
it's an economical car. But you know,

49
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:55,660
at the end of the day it's not respect
itself. That's it. Let's go see stripes.

50
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,760
Um, anyways, uh, completely forgot
what the fuck I was gonna say there

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,430
out of fuck. Did I get to that? I have
no idea. Do I need to go on Brian?

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,980
I need to play some brain games.
Several years. What the fuck was out?

53
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,830
Eat more healthy. I don't know what
it is. Oh yes. Oh Wow. Agamemnon.

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,020
The family back east. I got it.
I got it. We're back. Right.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,260
He'll be those outtakes on Casey Casey
when he flips out screaming, yell.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,540
Now God damn it. I'm not fucking reading
about a fucking dog died. You know,

57
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,430
this is basically like those outtakes,

58
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:35,350
except I don't edit them up and I
also don't have his iconic success.

59
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,820
Yeah. Other than that, I think it
seeks act. Same thing. But anyways,

60
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,680
I had family come and fee and we'd kill
me in palm bakeys twice in this past

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,130
month. And, um, I had to
take them out to the spots.

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,620
We had to drink a little toast
for the little one, a little Nini.

63
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,950
Dude, she's laughing her ass off
now. It's the greatest thing.

64
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,160
It's the greatest thing ever. Um,

65
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,260
could not be in a joint more in a first.
And for the first time in my life I'm,

66
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:10,000
someone can actually look at me
and say happy father's Day. Right.

67
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,800
And I don't have to be like, oh my
God. In what Comedy Club did you work?

68
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,040
How old is it? Um, anyways, now I
was never like that on the road.

69
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,720
I was a good boy, sort of. I had my
moments anyways, plowing ahead here.

70
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,380
Um, so because they came in,
I kind of got off my diet.

71
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,090
I was still doing the cardio every day,

72
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,800
so I stepped on the scale and the
unacceptable second number in my world is

73
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:43,090
eight. Okay. If it's ever a
nine, I'm telling you right now,

74
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,960
I am going to jump off
a fucking building. Um,

75
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,590
I won't do that. I'll just
buy really comfortable.

76
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,530
I'll keep wearing the golf clothes that
I wear that just get bigger. You know,

77
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,450
I was getting to the
John Daily Line. Um, so,

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,130
uh, I'm, I'm back on it. I'm back on
it. Jumped on the scale today. One 78.8.

79
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,390
Still unacceptable.

80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,740
I haven't been having the worst fucking
time trying to get down to my fighting

81
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,330
weight. I wanted to be one
72 by my birthday, my 49th,

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,210
the end of the forties. Wrapping it
up. If I was a professional athlete,

83
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:24,130
I would be 10 years for tired unless I
was Tom Brady with my senior we muscles

84
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:27,700
or whatever the fuck he's doing
with his spongy muscles. Um,

85
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,380
I don't know what he's doing. Sorry,
I'm drinking the throat coat. Oh, Jesus.

86
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:37,180
Bill, you're just annoying on so many
different levels today. I apologize. Um,

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,890
so anyways, I'm just,

88
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm going to try to just lay off
the booze for a little bit. Um,

89
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:47,290
I'm going to San Francisco, uh,

90
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,590
this weekend and, uh,

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm working with fucking my dean
off my Dean Martin. Joe De Rosa.

92
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,190
Okay. So that's going to be, that's
going to be a Mulligan that night.

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,510
Joe.

94
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,430
My friendship with Joe to Rosa in his
friendship with me is one of the great

95
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,670
friendships in show business
history and it's all,

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,540
it's all alcohol fueled. You know,

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,420
I don't think we've ever hung around
each other sober and I don't think that I

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,860
got to get him on the podcast.

99
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,720
I really got to get all fucking Joe to
rose or whatever. His background is,

100
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,760
Egyptian, Italian.

101
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,761
He doesn't know that man was left at
a doorstep of a funny bone way back in

102
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,450
1977. I believe he showed up on a knower,

103
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,520
a baby nobody wanted,

104
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,120
he came out of the womb already
wearing those dark frame glasses.

105
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,990
Um, it's sad, but said I'm
anyways plowing ahead. Okay.

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,950
I'm sure I'm going to hear
about that from old Joey. Um,

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,170
I'm guessing two drinks in, they do.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,700
There was something I want
to talk to you about. It's,

109
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,220
I know you were just joking, but you
know, to bring that up, it's just really,

110
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,110
um, fuck him. He trashed
my dog on stage. Oh,

111
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,580
that's coming out fourth drinking.

112
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,950
I'm trying to guess where the
argument's gonna come from this weekend.

113
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,850
Why drink with Joe? We really don't
argue anymore. Once I discovered,

114
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:19,030
fair enough, you know,
I grew up a little bit,

115
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,710
he grew up a little bit
and that's all we do.

116
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:23,770
We start to argue and then one of
us just goes, hey, fee, fair enough.

117
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,900
And we laugh and it just
diffuses everything. Fair enough.

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,860
Fair enough. Can Stop
Wars. You know what I mean?

119
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,080
This is our borderline now we think it
said, hey, fair enough. Fair enough.

120
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,910
I understand why you would take that,
but I mean, you know, fair enough.

121
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,590
Well are going to give it to us
law. Yeah, I didn't say that.

122
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,740
Well then I'm going to fucking start
shooting. I think. Fair enough. Yeah.

123
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,240
That's what you feel you need to do.

124
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,930
Okay.

125
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,510
It just diffuses the other guy and then
the other guy stayed in there going

126
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,270
like, no, you're supposed
to, you supposed to get mad.

127
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,510
Then you get mad and then I get mad and
then I lie to my people and you lie to

128
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:09,020
your people. We dehumanize each
other. Now, don't we start shooting?

129
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,963
Okay,

130
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,250
fair enough. All right, fair enough. Um,

131
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,790
anyways. Did Anybody Watch the, uh, the
penguin's wrist of fucking predators?

132
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,240
I'll tell you something about these teeth.

133
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:30,241
These penguins from Pittsburgh is they
know how to fucking win a goddamn series.

134
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,980
Jesus Christ,

135
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,250
the predators in an oh two hole for
those of you bad at math when it's best,

136
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:41,410
four out of seven, you're down oh two.

137
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:45,910
That means you have to win
four of the next five. Oh,

138
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,810
the coach isn't going to tell you that.
What's he going to say? All right guys.

139
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:54,710
All right boys. We've got to take
it one game at a time. Okay. Hey,

140
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,950
these crossed the hall
in that Locker Room Bay.

141
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,100
They put their escape to on
one one, one boot at a time.

142
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,540
Okay, we've got to
start winning the batch.

143
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,480
[inaudible]

144
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,020
take it one period of time.

145
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,300
Do they are beating the shit out of
Sidney Crosby, this playoff series.

146
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,970
This plaintiff is just this,
this, this playoff run.

147
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,790
I don't know what he did to the refs,

148
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:26,760
but they had done protecting that guy
this slash and I'm there hooking them.

149
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:31,200
They're fucking hitting him in the
head. Anything that they could do. Um,

150
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,410
I dunno. I think that they, uh, they,

151
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,150
they should have brought
a goon up or something.

152
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,920
Somebody to do something.
I don't know. But anyways,

153
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,840
how about fucking Malkin's goal?

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,360
Absolute fucking s you know,

155
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,790
and I know that they, uh,

156
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,060
pulled out peto today or whatever his
fucking name is for some reason I can't

157
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,240
remember his Goddamn name.
Pekka Rina. Dale's his name.

158
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,730
Uh, Jesus, I can't cock sock. I can't
remember some about it. Dick is the,

159
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:03,564
is the Predator.

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,420
I fucking watched every game and
I still can't remember his name.

161
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,850
The focus is new. Is it Pecorino?
Was that the guy from San Jose?

162
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,760
Was He on San Jose? And then he
went to Nashville. You don't,

163
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:18,510
once I stopped collecting cards,
you know, and I turned to scotch.

164
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:21,180
I just never been able to, I've never
been able to handle the names anymore.

165
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,590
But anyways, I don't give a
fuck who you are, Ken Dryden.

166
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,730
Patrick wa Terry Sawchuck.

167
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,430
Nobody stops that fucking puck.

168
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,170
That was an absolute
filthy, filthy fucking goal.

169
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,750
Um, so my prediction way back
in the day, what did I say?

170
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,980
What did I say before I flip flopped and
said Otto was gonna was gonna win game

171
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:51,000
seven before I did that, I
said the penguins were going
to win the whole thing.

172
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,410
So when it happens,

173
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:55,710
I'm going to ignore the fact that I
thought Ottawa was going to come back and

174
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,100
win game seven cause I was questioning
the goaltending in Pittsburgh.

175
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:03,530
I'm going to ignore all of that and I'm
going to pull up Paul version and say,

176
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:07,630
dude, what did I say
dude? I called it, um,

177
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,670
just out of a, you know,
jealousy. I want to, uh,

178
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,730
I want to see the predators tie
up the series. Not Jealousy,

179
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:19,940
just out of like selfishness.
I want to see the, um,

180
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,610
the NHL season goes as many
games as possible. But uh,

181
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,230
though I tell you right now the
way the tournaments and playing a,

182
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,050
I mean I don't even see this
called back to Pittsburgh. Uh,

183
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,270
we'll see something incredible
has to, how about the WHO?

184
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,910
I don't know who the fuck shot the
goal. That baby face kid there.

185
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,960
I mean I've,

186
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,140
that was like the puck had I said like
there was one little fucking just puck

187
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:48,320
sized space for a split second.

188
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,393
Yeah.

189
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,040
Between old, uh, a penis
there, whatever his name is.

190
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,600
It just opened up for half a second.

191
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,920
The puck literally turned sideways like
some Matrix Shit and went in the guy,

192
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,530
I remember when I, when I saw it
labs, I kind of fuck did that go in?

193
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,960
Okay.

194
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,501
I Dunno man.

195
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:10,170
I'll tell you the hockey gods are
smiling down in Pittsburgh right now. Um,

196
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,350
who knows. We'll see what sort of home
home ice advantage they have. But a,

197
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:19,150
and also the NBA playoffs not
play the, a final starts tonight.

198
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:24,151
Is it the NBA finals and the Stanley Cup
final or was it Stanley Cup finals in

199
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,660
the NBA final? I think
it's the NBA finals. Um,

200
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,110
every time I say something stupid, my
phone rings. That's it right there.

201
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,480
That's a little thing. All right.
I have a call here in fucking,

202
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,770
uh, let's see. 10 minutes, 10 minutes.
So I'm gonna have to hit pause here.

203
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,530
It's not gonna matter to you guys
cause I'll just pick it up. You know,

204
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,670
I'll give me 10 minutes of silence.
Like I'm trying to do something artsy.

205
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,790
Um, that starts tonight. Um,

206
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,330
okay.

207
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,740
I Dunno, I don't have a feeling on this
one. I want the Cavaliers to win. Um,

208
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,960
okay.

209
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,260
I want the capitalist doing cause I
still feel like they don't get their

210
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,094
respect.

211
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,450
People aren't talking about them like
did the defending like they are the

212
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,240
defending NBA champions and it's,

213
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,520
it's cause Doran went to the warriors.

214
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:15,550
I think that that's why nobody
seems to be able to talk about it.

215
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,220
You know what I mean? Just to be able
to see like, hey not for nothing.

216
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,930
These guys beat those
other guys last year.

217
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,370
So I hope they keep disrespecting them
cause I always root against the pylon

218
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,420
team. You know, I even did
it with the red sox in 2007.

219
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,630
I just, I don't even think
I watched the world series.

220
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,640
I mean obviously I was happy that we won.

221
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,380
Obviously I'd rather see us win
than the fucking Colorado Rockies.

222
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:42,520
But I, I was just like, ah,
this is, that's not competition.

223
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,260
You know, having said that,
having said that, when the, uh,

224
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,580
when the bass, when the basketball
and hockey season ends, okay,

225
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,861
I'm getting the,

226
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,861
the MLB package and I'm watching my
$210 million Red Sox who are in second

227
00:13:59,211 --> 00:13:59,541
place,

228
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:03,690
three games behind the evil empire that
has nothing but their own homegrown

229
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,573
talent.

230
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,740
And I'm going to watch that collision
course and see how that goes. Um, I,

231
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I've learned this is what you have to do
if you're a sports fan with some fairly

232
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:22,790
big east is the baseball
is such a great sport,

233
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,950
but the problem is, is the first,

234
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:29,660
almost the first half of the season is
the most exciting time in basketball and

235
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,260
hockey. And your emotions
as a fan are so heightened,

236
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:36,620
even if your team is out of
it, just to watch, you know,

237
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:41,210
there's always something great happens
in the f in the final, unless, you know,

238
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,160
the fucking ref called 38 files on one
team at 15 on the other, then it sucks.

239
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,090
Okay.

240
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,010
Letting it go. Um,

241
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,070
and then all of a sudden it's
over and then you settle.

242
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,850
Ah, just a bit outside a
billable day. Pro Ball game.

243
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,860
Okay.

244
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,860
I'll tell you his on base
percentage is six 45. And uh,

245
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,990
he's really seeing the ball right
now. I kept you played the game.

246
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,550
What was it like when you just,
when you hit a zone like this? Oh,

247
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,310
I'll tell you, you know, when you
hit a all like, just to me that ball,

248
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,310
I mean your eyes are as big as
Christmas. You know, Jermaine, it just,

249
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,540
it's like you can't,

250
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,630
you just stick in the bat out there and
the balls going away and wants to go,

251
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:26,220
but you know, and uh, what do you want?
How do you tell you to try to, uh,

252
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,760
how do you try to stay in that zone? How
you try to do I try to keep it go well,

253
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,160
you know, it's one of those things
you can't control it. You just,

254
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,620
you learn is you,

255
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,530
as you mature as a player to just try
to enjoy those moments in a while.

256
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,810
You know, you hope it goes, as
long as it can put a Veggie,

257
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:43,920
it is going to swing back to the other's
way. And you just hope that that's is,

258
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,810
uh, you know, that the slop doesn't last
as long. So, uh, you know, you could,

259
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,260
uh,

260
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,560
keep your house in that gold digging
whore that you met in a Tulsa when you're

261
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,800
coming up and triple a that you
knocked up and you don't really love,

262
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,530
but you like her, you're
hanging in there for the kid.

263
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,160
Um, you know, you gotta settle into
that. So what you need to do is, uh,

264
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,970
what do you, you gotta just immediately,

265
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:11,240
you gotta slow everything the fuck down.

266
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,000
And what you have to do is
you gotta watch a day game.

267
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,610
You gotta keep score while
you smoke a cigar. You know,

268
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,280
you get you lineup, you
get it all ready to go.

269
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,850
You just fucking sit there and you
like the cigar about the third day,

270
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,290
you know, and you just sit there and
you fucking maybe even on the radio,

271
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,490
listen to it on the radio and
you just, it's like sports yoga.

272
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,680
He just have to totally
just calm your mind,

273
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,980
fucking relax and then slide
into the dog days of baseball,

274
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,363
right?

275
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,800
And then you ride that out for about six
weeks and then all of a sudden it's NFL

276
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,970
preseason. All right. And
it's a preseason comes along.

277
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,110
You're excited about football.

278
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,680
Cause every week's exciting because
they only play 16 games, right?

279
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,180
But baseball is also ramping up.
So then when September comes along,

280
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,360
it's like April, May, June
with basketball and hockey,

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,780
because now it's like you're so
excited. How fuck NFL football,

282
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,800
college football, it's coming back.
I have a reason to live. Right?

283
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,040

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,590
I don't know what the
fuck you got. [inaudible]

291
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,720
it's not my business. It's none of my
business. What time is it? Nine 55.

292
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:51,630
Let's see. I can read advertising in
five minutes. I don't think I can do it.

293
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,060
Especially when I've got to
type in my goddamn password.

294
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,880
The family bag. He sched kidding.

Um, all right. What do we got here?
Oh, love supreme. All right, worry.

better in a suit. You know,

298
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:15,450
when I'm checking out of Fella, I love
boys shorts, just like the next guy.

299
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:20,010
But what really turns me on is a
nice sharp look and fellow in a suit.

300
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,180
You know what I mean? Grab
him by his tie. All right.

301
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,190
Indochino is making it easy to get a
perfectly tailored suit at an incredible

302
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:28,890

pocket. Uh, just the way you want it.

305
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,770
Don't use pills shoe, whether it

00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,750

I picked out a bucket to
our warehouse with three PS.

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,740

Five. Four club. Yo,
you like a short pitch.

329
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,910
This is the five four club.
I'm kidding. I'm looking good.

330
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,680
Doesn't need to cost a fortune five
four club is revolutionizing the way men

331
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:27,330
stop at five fold club. They

affordable for everyone.

333
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:34,440
Five folk club also understands that
your time is extremely valuable.

334
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,281
Why?

335
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:40,281
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around
in stores each month they send you a

336
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,730
crow, a curated box of two to three items.

337
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,850
That just means somebody else picked it
out. I hate that fucking word curated.

338
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,210
You know like somebody gives a shit
the fuck does this guy want tank tops?

339
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,190
The idea fucking tank tops. Why waste it?

So you know I've had funny
feelings. I've gotten funny looks,

379
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,070
I've eaten, I've even eaten funny
smelling Sushi. But let me tell you,

380
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,940
none of those are as funny as CSOs
streaming's library of stand up television

381
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,770
and original content,
especially not the Sushi.

382
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,590
Why would they try to write comedy for
us? Let me do a quick rewrite this.

383
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,550
You know, I've had a
funny feeling in my gut.

384
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,610
I've gone down on a funny smell and Twat,

385
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,573
you know,

386
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,850
I've been in a parking lot late at
night and felt funny like, you know,

387
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,530
is someone going to fucking cut me up?

388
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:05,531
But nothing compares to watch and a
fucking six feet under run on CSO.

389
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,310
All right, maybe I should've

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,880
Somebody has enough time at some point
to fucking splice together every time.

428
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,050
I'm trying to fucking put together
my password yet by the way,

429
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,680
tiger woods, Tiger Woo, uh,

430
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,310
blue and 0.0 the dude was on
pills. You know what I mean? The,

431
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,070
the level of shit that, that guys get,

432
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,400
that guy sacrificed his fucking
body to become great. Okay?

433
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:57,850
Now his body's breaking down and
everybody's blaming it on the fact that he

434
00:26:57,851 --> 00:27:00,970
cheated on his lady. Right.
And that's what did him in

435
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,510
his laser focus. He couldn't block out
the fat I the first two years. Yeah,

436
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm sure it bugged him, but I mean
at some point you move on, right?

437
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,190
His body blade set at the front from the
very beginning they said the way swings

438
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,860
the club, his body's going to break
down at some point. So now look at him.

439
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,650
Now look at him. You know,
he's trying to come back.

440
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,240
He's on all these painkillers.

441
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,770
He wants to win another one probably
before he hangs it up and goes to the uh,

442
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,650
the senior tour. He's
doing what he has to do.

443
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,730
These fucking drugs that you can get
nowadays are completely out of control.

444
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:36,880
When I was a kid, when a drug came
out, bear or any of this shit,

445
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,670
they didn't have 9,000 side effects.

446
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,760
What happened was people used to
be in the pharmaceutical industry,

447
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,660
got into the fucking FDA and they're
the ones who police to pharmaceutical

448
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:47,290
companies.

449
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,340
And those cons just waved everything
around like the third base coast that lost

450
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:55,900
his vision, right? So then they
let opiates into the fucking world.

451
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:59,260
Now you've got a goddamn
heroin epidemic. Okay.

452
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,980
And now tiger woods is taken too many of
those fucking things and he pulls over

453
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,950
to the side of the road and everybody's
saying it's because he did the fucking

454
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,420
blonde haired blue eyed woman
who evidently is a saint
who took his fucking his,

455
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:14,050
his master's money, bought a giant house,

456
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,110
not the fucking thing down
to buy something else.

457
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,760
Where did all that material go?

458
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,190
Where did all those fucking
gold plated toilets go?

459
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:25,650
They went right into the fucking ocean.
Well, you know, but she's a victim. Oh,

460
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,460
give me a break. That's it
for the podcast. Signing off.

461
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,740
Not fucking with the arm.

462
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,680
I'm just trying to energy my way
through the last bit of this a,

463
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,740
what else do I have here to talk about?
Oh, you know what has a great new bits,

464
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,340
a new bit I brought, his name is Charlie,

465
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,670
Charlie Watts drummer for the rolling
stones as a great new book out.

466
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,560
That is just a drummers
that influenced him.

467
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,310
And if you're a drummer and you're
into that shit because he's a,

468
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,660
I guess a jazz drummer at heart.

469
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:57,670
He talked about all these
fucking great drummers that I've,

470
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:01,470
I've heard most of the names and didn't
know enough about him and the fact that

471
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:05,210
he could break down their styles
and what they did has made me a,

472
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,640
I was already listening to a lot of that
shit through some of my drum lessons,

473
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:10,830
but really just trying to listen
to the shit that he's saying.

474
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:14,490
It's a great book. Um, let
me, let me look it up here.

475
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,980
I'm going to fucking hype
his book here. You know,

476
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:19,590
we've been trying to get Charlie
Watson on this podcast for a long time.

477
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,870
I know he doesn't do a
lot of interviews and uh,

478
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,330
but I know he'd want to come on my
podcast. I'm joking. Charlie Watson Book.

479
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,300
Let's see what we got here. Jelly.

480
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,850
You know the fucking Internet works
in like two rooms in my fucking house.

481
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,970
I spent all this money like can you give
me the nuclear level fucking Internet

482
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,680
so I can send out, beat out
my neighbors. And you know,

483
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:49,360
it works for a little
while then that's it. Well,

484
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,750
we sound, Shelly watch 10 things
you didn't know about Charlie Watts.

485
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,280
Why no books about Charlie Watts?
You know, I'm usually good about fun.

486
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,210
Charlie watts books,

487
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,460
drummers influence book. You know,

488
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:12,380
I nailed the John Daily search the
last time. Come on for fuck sakes. Oh,

489
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:14,390
Charlie Watts. Favorite
drum. I, so it did come up,

490
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,060
dude can get it for 12
bucks, $12 and 37 cents. Um,

491
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,300
whiplash, the film that puts
the drummer in the limelight.

492
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,490
Did I have to tell you guys how
much I fucking hated that movie?

493
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,720
I just hated watching somebody getting
berated. It's just like fucking quit.

494
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,940
Go join another band.

495
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:37,150
Why would you sit there taking that level
of shit from the guy and then not to

496
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,550
mention the kids fucking technique. I,

497
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,070
you had to look away when he
was fucking playing real fast.

498
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,680
He was making those faces. You
could just feel the guy's forearms.

499
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,370
Tighten up this guy.

500
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,370
This guy's going to have carpal tunnel
trying to please this complete cut.

501
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,893
You know,

502
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,440
and I gotta tell you the best drums
from that year was not in that movie is

503
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:02,530
great as the drums were the best fucking
drums and some of the best drums I've

504
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,110
heard in a movie, a mainstream
moving along fucking time.

505
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:08,290
Was that Michael Keaton movie. Um,

506
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,790
what the fuck was that movie where he
was the to form a superhero. The bird.

507
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,331
Do you? Not Long.

508
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,720
I watched that movie before I realized
that was him in the costume talking to

509
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:21,310
himself. Spoiler alert.
All right, Michael Keaton.

510
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:27,170
I'm just going to write bird.
Fuck you spell his name.

511
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:30,140
I've only been watching this movies for
30 fucking years. Bill and Jesus Christ.

512
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:32,210
Michael Keaton, bird bird man.

513
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,130
Yo Birdman five. Oh. Um,

514
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,870
who the fuck is the drummer in that?
I know I talked about that before.

515
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:45,140
The drums in that movie
are fucking incredible.

516
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,630
It's like,

517
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,540
like that's what just a whole other level
of drumming would. That guy is like,

518
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,880
he's playing like moods.

519
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,740
Hey supposed to just play in 90
million miles an hour all over the kid.

520
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,860
That guy is, he sees, he's
creating peaks and valleys.

521
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:08,210
I mean that was like a [inaudible] that
was literally a movie score just done

522
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:11,060
with drums. I mean how many people
can have that level of talent?

523
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,980
I can tell you right now, I know, I don't,

524
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,090
I already knew I didn't in the for the
last three weeks cause I've been so damn

525
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:21,680
busy, I've just been playing like,
you know, not on a real drum kit,

526
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,850
you know, little practice pad kit that
I was playing on and I thought I was,

527
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:26,121
you know,

528
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:30,230
I thought I was doing something and
then I went down and I played on a real

529
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:34,190
fucking kitten. Jesus Christ.
Everything that you think you can,

530
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,230
you can do drops by
like 50 bpms. You know,

531
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,110
it'd be basically like if you would
just jogging on a treadmill being like,

532
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,820
wow man, I couldn't run
a seven minute mile.

533
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:46,400
Then you go out to run
down the street, you know,

534
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,830
and you forgot about hills and
shit and all of a sudden, you know,

535
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:52,700
you can't run a seven minute mile
anymore. Even if it was flat,

536
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,790
flat level. Okay. Maybe
if it was flat level,

537
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,580
all of a sudden you run like a fucking
11 minute mile. That's what it's like.

538
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:02,630
It was extremely fucking
disheartening. And um,

539
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,710
I'm doing the a,

540
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:08,180
the comedy jam this weekend up in
San Francisco for cluster fest,

541
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,750
which is just completely
like one of the biggest,

542
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,670
I don't know how they afforded to, to,

543
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,480
to get all of those comedians
and bands and all of that.

544
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,890
They must've had a lot of ad money.

545
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,460
Somebody who's doing something to
establish that comedy festival going,

546
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,660
we're going to go fucking, you know,

547
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:27,350
nine zillion dollars in the
hole to start it out. But uh,

548
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,390
you might want to go this year
because they're going big. Um,

549
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,620
oh, and I almost forgot before I sign off
your thank you to everybody who's been

550
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:40,940
watching season two of f is for family.
Um, got nothing but great reviews.

551
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,400
You know, there's always a couple of
country ones. What are you going to do?

552
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,490
But overall you guys not only like it
but you're saying you think it's even

553
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,540
better than the first season, which
for the amount of work that we put in,

554
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,590
um, to hear that kind of feedback,
you know, I know I'm a jerk a lot.

555
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:58,130
That really means a lot to me. So thank
you guys for not only watching it.

556
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,920
Thank you for the people that took the
time to let me know how much you enjoyed

557
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,990
it. Please let other people know about it.

558
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,430
The more the people people know about it,

559
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:07,910
the more people watch it and the better
chance we have a possibly getting a

560
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:12,800
third season. Um, and that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

561
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,360
Have a great weekend.

562
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:19,340
You can sit there and a is a little bit
of a bit of music from Andrew thumbless

563
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,880
and then we'll play a little half hour,

564
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:27,881
some greatest hits from a Thursday or a
podcast or whatever from Thursday gone

565
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,980

know what we're doing here. All right.

566
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,850
That's not my part of the podcast.
All right, I'll talk to you on Monday.

567
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,903
Hmm.

568
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:39,731
All right. Hey,

569
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:43,210
this is the longest fucking revenge
story I think I've ever read.

570
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:49,250
Let me see if I can, uh, see if I
can fucking just, I'm going to blow.

571
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:51,350
I'm going to read that one next week
when I have the energy. All right.

572
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:55,610
Questions? All right, Bill.
Uh, I have a question for you.

573
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:58,370
I was hoping you might be able
to shine some insight on this.

574
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,510
I have this great friend
that that's a girl mistake.

575
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,090
Um, and we get along great and we have
never had any sort of sexual tension

576
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,790
or interest despite her being attractive.

577
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,430
All right, dude, right there.
You're either gay or you're, Oh,

578
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,840
you're an idiot and I'm gonna try,
I'm giving you some tough love here.

579
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,360
That's a fucking stupid situation
to be involved in. That's stupid.

580
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,321
All right.

581
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:29,920
Unless you're using her to attract
other females to get you fucking late.

582
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,740
Let's see if this is the
case. I will continue reading.

583
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,280
So she has this smoking hot
friend. Oh, there we go.

584
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,280
That met a few times

585
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,750
and always flirted with. But uh,
but it's just been overall friendly.

586
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,010
So this chicks calls me up one night
and I'm at the bar at like midnight and

587
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,160
asked if I want to stay up drinking
with her and she come pick me up.

588
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,780
So obviously I agree.

589
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,990
Things go very good and we have a few
drinks and flirt and when I make my move,

590
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,170
she gets all upset. Like
I should have known.

591
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:02,760
She just wants to be friends when she
calls me up at midnight to say to stay up

592
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,190
drinking with her alone
after the incident,

593
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,030
the bitch still has the balls
to sleep to ask to sleep over.

594
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:10,630
Uh,

595
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,380
since then I have noticed all our friends
are trying to be my friend when all I

596
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,070
want to do is rail the shit out of
them. Bill, I was hoping you could,

597
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:22,600
you should, you could shine some light
on the situation and help me out.

598
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,820
Yeah, dude, never have a
friend as a, as a female,

599
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,573
you know.

600
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,330
Okay.

601
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,920
You always gotta be fucking them. That's
the only reason to be around them,

602
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,020
you know? I know that's really
sexist, but you know, I, I just,

603
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,380
I'm speaking from me.
There's no fucking point

604
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,940
in hanging out with that level of
frustration if you're not having sex with

605
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,920
them. And if they're
actually like a good friend,

606
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,440
then that's the one that you should,
uh, I mean that's the ultimate,

607
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,990
if you're banging them and
they're also a great friend,

608
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:02,930
that's the one you marry because
you've got a connection there. Right.

609
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,310
But if you just, yeah, I mean the,

610
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,090
they using you as like a
live teddy bear and um,

611
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,160
yeah. The next time they call up,
just be like, no, I'm, I'm not,

612
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,530
I can't hang out tonight.
What are you doing?

613
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,270
I'm going to go out and try
to get some ass tonight.

614
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,620
I know I'm not getting any from you.

615
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,030
And it's frustrating because you're hot
and I want to bend you over every piece

616
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:30,260
of fucking furniture in my apartment.
Yay. I can't believe you said that. Yeah.

617
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:34,100
Well, I just did. Are you going
to come over here and fuck me?

618
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,840
Well then great. I have to go. Why are
you being so mean? I'm not being mean.

619
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:42,290
I'm being honest. Okay. Do you have
any times I've jerked off to you.

620
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,460
It's fucking, it's annoying.

621
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,190
Okay.

622
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:47,560
That you just, you just, I'm telling
you like that's a little aggressive,

623
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,850
but that's what you have to start doing.

624
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,040
You just have to be straightforward
and honest and don't do it.

625
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,870
Like I just said it do if do it,

626
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,900
how you can do it and pull it off and
you just say it like that. Just be like,

627
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,720
yeah, I want to go out. I want to
try and get laid tonight. All right.

628
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,580
And I go out with you and
you're not fucking me.

629
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,280
And then other girls see me with you
and they think that I am fucking you,

630
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:11,260
which I'm not. And I ended up going
home, a dry humping my futon, you know?

631
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,400
And it's really fucking
with my self esteem. Okay.

632
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,650
So that's it. So basically where you said,

633
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:24,360
you say that you've had how to stack
your cock, you know, I hang out with me.

634
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,400
Yes. That is what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

635
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,040
Your conversations are awful, you know,

636
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,530
I'm sure they're interesting to
other females, but not to me.

637
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't want it to, I don't
want to talk about that.

638
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,640
I can give a shit about the
hills, the o sea, the ocean,

639
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,400
or whatever the fuck I was stupid.
Show you what? I don't give a fuck.

640
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,830
I don't give a fuck. I
want to fuck you. Okay?

641
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,720
It's worlds every day in
orders. You have a seat.

642
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,510
We'll watch the world series of poker.
When you go all in, that's what you do.

643
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,560
Just say what the fuck you want
to do. You push all your chips in.

644
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,220
Then you stand up and
you start walking around.

645
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:02,200
You wait for that next car to drop.
You see what the fuck happens? Yeah,

646
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:06,250
dude, that's my advice. Get
out of that whole circle a VA.

647
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,900
He's like a big teddy bear.
Fuck debt. Fuck Dad. All right.

648
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,990
You're not a teddy bear
or you are one right now.

649
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:17,080
You've got to stop being that
guy. So fuck all of them. Go. Uh,

650
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,800
where are your guy friends? What are
they doing? Go hang out with them.

651
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,060
Go get a fucking wing man,

652
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,900
get yourself back in the game and
go out there and talk some shit.

653
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,170
Hit on some girl you
don't give a fuck about.

654
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:32,920
So you can practice not giving a fuck
and just say a bunch of shit that you

655
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,610
would never say to some girl
that you gave a shit about, eh,

656
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,690
because you don't give a fuck up. The
Girl Says No. Start with that. You know,

657
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,190
always wear a condom. And uh, and
that's it. That's what I would do.

658
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,350
That's what I should've done. I didn't,

659
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,840
I just have that knowledge
now cause I'm fucking a,

660
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,390
have I ever been the funeral
home? I was never the front,

661
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,900
but I was definitely the douchebag.
I was definitely the, the, uh,

662
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,830
not even pussy whipped was
even pussy. What does this,

663
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,870
I couldn't fucking speak up for myself.

664
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,310
I was afraid of having a confrontation
and then by the time I had the final

665
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,260
confrontation, I was like,
oh, I don't know. I was like,

666
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,710
fuck in a year with this
shit and we broke up. Um,

667
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,873
but that's a whole nother thing.

668
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,240
Stories. Hey, what's up
everybody? It's bill burner.

669
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:20,960
This is the Monday morning podcast that
I'm recording for the third time this

670
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,390
week.

671
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:26,390
Praying and hoping against hope that g
CAS will actually upload this one cause

672
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:31,470
I've already spent 90 minutes doing
podcasts this week. So anyways,

673
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,080
if you're hearing this, it means
I successfully uploaded it.

674
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:38,610
So there's no sense complaining unlike
the rest of the people in my fucking

675
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:40,740
life. You know you have it.

676
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:43,100
Just have one of those weeks where
everyone's just bitching at you.

677
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,010
That's what I got. You know,

678
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,350
that's what I'm dealing with right now.

679
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,050
Like today's my girlfriend's birthday
and she's, she was fucking pissed at me.

680
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,670
[inaudible] she went absolutely
psycho on me this morning. You know,

681
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,470
it had nothing to do with me. Had
nothing to fucking do with me. You know,

682
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,770
I gave her a piece of cake last
night, right at midnight Sanger,

683
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:08,380
happy birthday because
technically it was a birthday.

684
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,380
I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake
and then I gave her a bag of Fritos with

685
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:16,780
a little bow on it. Right.
Just being a silly jackass.

686
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,090
Like that's all you get in
for your birthday. Right?

687
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,540
And everything was going
great. I was a big sweetheart.

688
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,110
And then I woke up this morning and made
the mistake of telling her that I had

689
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:27,700
made a dinner reservation yet.

690
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,870
And then she starts flipping out acting
like I'm just throwing her goddamn

691
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,520
birthday together when I gave her a pre
birthday fucking slice of birthday cake,

692
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,970
you know, start flipping out.

693
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,750
Know I don't know why she was flipping
out. It's like, it's fucking Tuesday.

694
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,550
It's a Tuesday. It's not a holiday.
This who the fuck is going out tonight?

695
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,850
June 2nd. Oh Shit. Was it
Cinco de Mayo? You know,

696
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,140
is it a fuss? I'm fucking New Zealand
holiday that I don't know about.

697
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,260
There's going to be plenty of fucking
reservations and lo and behold,

698
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,190
after she flips out, you
know, screaming at me. Right?

699
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,790
So all my neighbors think that I'm
beating her. Women love doing that Shit.

700
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,090
They just put on this
big fucking show. Right?

701
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,410
And then afterwards they just gone thigh.
I got a little crazy. I don't know.

702
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:24,460
I think just, you don't hate
me, dare you. You forgive me.

703
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,280
They do that shit. Right.
Meanwhile, you know,

704
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,840
your neighbors don't hear that part.

705
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,560
They don't hear the part where they sort
of say really quietly that they flipped

706
00:42:32,561 --> 00:42:34,960
out for no fucking reason. You know,

707
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,760
all they heard was to
screaming and yelling.

708
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:39,220
So now I'm going to get the looks today
I'm going to go down to the garage.

709
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,151
You know,

710
00:42:40,151 --> 00:42:44,050
like it's the 1920s like I should become
walking out with like a fucking wife

711
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:47,810
beater. You know, as I
reattached the belt to my pants,

712
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,910
so this is what happens, right? I ended
up calling up this fucking restaurant,

713
00:42:55,911 --> 00:43:00,410
this, this, Nah, one of the nicest
steak houses out here in la.

714
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,150
I call him up. I said, hey, I'd like a
reservation for two people. I go, okay,

715
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,430
sir, what time would you
like? I said, how about eight?

716
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,090
I can't do anything at aide.
How about eight 30 and I said,

717
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:15,250
you know what sweetheart, that
would be perfect. And she said,

718
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:18,620
okay, and that was it.

719
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,480
That's all I had to fucking
do. But for some reason,

720
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,760
because I didn't do that
before her birthday,

721
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,740
that means that I don't give a fuck.
That's how fucking nuts women are.

722
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,340
She absolutely, she
actually flipped out on me

723
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,460
at 10 o'clock in the
morning on her birthday.

724
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:42,100
She didn't give me a chance to fuck the
day up. She did a preemptive strike.

725
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:46,030
Even though I gave her a pre birthday
slice of cake, I sang happy birthday.

726
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,680
I made a shut arise. I put, I put out
the lights, I lit a candle. I came in,

727
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:53,590
I sang happy birthday and
I gave her a bag of Fritos,

728
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,980
which is fucking ridiculous
and silly. It was great.

729
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,900
And tonight she's getting a real
gift, if you know what I mean. Oh. Um,

730
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,093
you know,

731
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,460
so it's one of those deals
where I'm laying in bed and
then all of a sudden she,

732
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,990
ah, it's just fucking ridiculous,
you know? But I didn't back down.

733
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,570
I didn't back down. I, you know,
actually when she really got mad,

734
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,900
why she started flipping out is because
she, when she was screaming at me,

735
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,080
I was laughing. You know,

736
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:29,110
I don't know if any other guy out there
has that problem you ever had any like

737
00:44:29,111 --> 00:44:30,640
when your girlfriend
starts yelling at you,

738
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:35,090
your first is just to start
laughing. I Dunno why.

739
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,790
Every time my girl yells at me,

740
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:41,791
I instantly feel like I'm in school
again and I'm like in in second grade and

741
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:46,090
I'm getting yelled at and it's just, and
my friends are laughing at me. That's,

742
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:50,680
that's what I feel like.
I feel ridiculous. Okay.
I guess that's what it is.

743
00:44:50,681 --> 00:44:53,350
When when a woman yells at
me, I always feel ridiculous.

744
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,700
You don't want a guy yells at me.
I get mad because I think, oh fuck,

745
00:44:57,701 --> 00:45:01,510
this guy's going to beat the shit out of
me. So you got to get into that energy.

746
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,180
But when a girl woman is
just sitting there, hey,

747
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,723
hey,

748
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,230
what are you supposed to do? You know,
I'm not going to yell back at you.

749
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,150
You're a woman. I don't
want to feel like a bully.

750
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,430
We're not going to get
physical. You're a woman.

751
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,520
You know it's stupid.

752
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:26,050
Stop yelling that fucking high pitch
voice. You sound like a fucking,

753
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,500
he's all like Mickey
Mouse. Sit Down, relax,

754
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,150
collect your thoughts, make a list. If
you have to tell me why you're upset,

755
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:37,031
you know,

756
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:39,910
but don't just sit there fucking yelling
at me like you just took a hit off a

757
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:42,850
helium balloon because
it just sounds hilarious.

758
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,080
Especially when I haven't done anything
wrong and I got a great fucking gift

759
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,730
this year. That's what was killing me.

760
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,710
That actually I actually had that
moment during the fight where I said,

761
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:56,370
you want your gift, fine. And
I went out and I pull it out.

762
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:59,160
It's already wrapped with
a bow on it. You know,

763
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,870
sitting there acting like
I'm not fucking prepared.

764
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,500
There's your fucking present. Bam
wrapped with a fucking bow on it.

765
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,140
Jesus. Everybody giving me shit.

766
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,750
I remember last week when I
called that woman a douchebag.

767
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,620
Remember the douchebag of the week last
week cause she was giving me shit once

768
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:17,600
again, a female surprise.

769
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:22,601
Surprise was giving me shit that when
I read the underrated over aids or the

770
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:26,480
questions people have, I
wouldn't say what sex they were.

771
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,250
And she somehow found out a
way to kind of, I don't know,

772
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:34,860
make me look like I was some chauvinist
that I guess she felt if it was a good

773
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:38,380
question, I credited a guy and uh,

774
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:43,240
you know, it's a free podcast. Alright,

775
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,610
stop being so fucking conti. So
she became douchebag of the week.

776
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:52,160
So evidently she didn't like
it. And what does she do?

777
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,870
She sends me an email, his
email, she sends me a bill.

778
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:59,270
It's nice that you named
me douchebag of the week.

779
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,900
I don't really give a shit because
I always mean what I write.

780
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,190
I didn't know what that means cause I
always mean what I write. Oh really?

781
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,660
What are the rest of us just faking it?

782
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,750
We're just joking around but not you
yourself fucking serious is anyways,

783
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,120
evidently this psycho. This is a
new segment. This is cy. I can't,

784
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,841
I can't figure it out.

785
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:22,110
This is a love letter of the week or
a psycho of the week. I don't know.

786
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,330
You guys name it. I don't give
a shit. So anyway, she goes,

787
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:27,390
I don't really give a shit because I
always mean what I write and it seems

788
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,930
you're just talking shit about two
things that I wrote that seemed bitchy.

789
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,320
Now I was talking about your entire
email. Don't try to knock it down.

790
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,710
All right, continuing here
she goes call me account.

791
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,090
But I really don't give a fuck.

792
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,780
You've read a lot of my
comments previously and
agreed with them or had a good

793
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:44,740
response to them.

794
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,890
I'm literally fixing her sentences because
she doesn't know how to write here.

795
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:52,810
But it's nice that you a will consider
telling the gender of the person who, uh,

796
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,700
who the comments are from.

797
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,170
And I know you have a shit load of
people who listen to your podcast,

798
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,560
but I got you some more since my friends
who heard the podcast thought it was

799
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:04,990
fucking hilarious and then
they started listening to you.

800
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,890
So you really should be thanking
me. Isn't this just typical,

801
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,020
this is just all going to
be woman bashing this week.

802
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,590
Isn't this just typical of a fucking
female? You know what I mean?

803
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,850
She's getting something every
week, every week that is free.

804
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,270
And she still found a way
to bitch about it. Okay.

805
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,270
And then when I call her
out for being a douchebag,

806
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,060
now she's actually trying to make
me feel guilty. Yeah, I just,

807
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,810
you know, you can call me a douchebag
now. Whatever. I mean he just even,

808
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,060
I got a whole bunch of
friends to listen to you.

809
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:41,500
I mean probably should be thanking me,
but you know, that's okay. Shut up.

810
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,220
Just shy. I swear to God. Why? Why
can't you slap women? You know,

811
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,450
back in the day, how great did that feel?

812
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,970
You know you have on the wife Beater, the
wind blowing through your armpit hair,

813
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,190
his you just crack. I know it's evil.
I don't give a fuck. Fuck all you guys.

814
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:02,070
I don't give a shit. This is
the rest of her email. Okay.

815
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:04,170
Before you think I'm an
asshole. This is what she wrote.

816
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:09,090
This is actually so psychotic. It's
hilarious. She writes and yeah,

817
00:49:09,091 --> 00:49:12,900
I do know that the name shows up on
the email even if I don't sign it.

818
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,460
But you just make it seem like you
that much of a retard to notice.

819
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,260
That's literally what she wrote.

820
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,300
And then she wrote your over 40 and
have the vocabulary of a seventh grader.

821
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,520
Your is spelled y, o U. R. All right,

822
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:30,200
for all you morons out there,

823
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,270
your y o u r is possessive
meaning like that's your shirt.

824
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,150
Okay. If you're saying your
over 40 that's you are.

825
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,690
Okay. So that means if you're going
to say your, it's an apostrophe.

826
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,550
Y O u a pause to free our e.

827
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,330
So if you're a dumb fuck like this woman,

828
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,480
if you don't know the next time you go
to write your just stop and see if you

829
00:49:57,351 --> 00:50:00,720
are would still fit. All right?

830
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:05,040
Like your over 40 you are
over 40 okay. Right there.

831
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:10,041
You know you got to use the apostrophe
as as opposed to saying your over 40 so

832
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:15,950
what is over do I own over you? Dumb fuck.

833
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,820
But I do have the vocabulary of a
seventh grade but you know something,

834
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,640
you have the fucking vocabulary
for third grader. All right,

835
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,580
your over 40 and you had the
vocabulary of a seventh grader,

836
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,900
you recognize real words.
How hilarious is this?

837
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:32,130
And she's misspelling stuff.

838
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:35,940
You started when you read and
I hope your dog outlives you

839
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,800
and you die lonely because of your
inability to commit and therefore never

840
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,020
achieve the comedic fame of the
Great George Carlin. So Simon says,

841
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,660
go fuck yourself sense,

842
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,240
it sounds like you have
major brain damage.

843
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,100
All right sweetheart, I'm really going
to try to help you out here. Okay?

844
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:01,670
If you hope that my dog
outlives me and then you say,

845
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:06,620
and then I die lonely. Okay. If
I'm going to die before my dog,

846
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:09,940
mathematically the fucking
dog is still gonna be there.

847
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,520
So how am I going to be lonely? You know,

848
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,350
the dog would have to die first or
run away. So what you should say is,

849
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:21,820
I hope you dog outlives you then runs
away and then you die by yourself as

850
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:24,400
opposed to saying, I hope your dog
outlives you when you die. Lonely.

851
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:28,540
Now I would die before my dog and be
sitting there licking my face and my last

852
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,710
few pathetic moments,

853
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,240
and then evidently because of my
inability to commit to a relationship,

854
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,090
I'll never achieve the comedic
fame of George Carlin. Oh,

855
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,200
that totally makes sense.

856
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,260
It has nothing to do with the fact that
I wasn't blessed with his gifts as a

857
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:42,550
comedian, you know,

858
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,730
all you have to do to be as good as
George Carlin is just commit to a

859
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:50,080
relationship to some psycho
fucking chick like you. All right,

860
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,790
lady. These are podcasts. These are
jokes. When I call somebody a Douchebag,

861
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,640
I'm just fucking around so I don't
take it seriously, but if you want to,

862
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,960
you and your friends can
go fuck yourselves and go
listen to another podcast.

863
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,390
All right. Stop trying to threaten me
like you're going to take podcasts.

864
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,100
Listen, there's listeners away. I
don't give a shit. This is free.

865
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,500
What are you guys going to take
away advertising dollars from me?

866
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,600
I don't give a fuck. Fuck
you and your friends.

867
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,210
I hope you're all listening it together.
Fuck all of you. Look around the room.

868
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,360
Look into each one of your eyes.
I'm saying fuck all of you.

869
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,410
You know what's funny is your friends
are probably laughing at you right now

870
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,410
going, you know what she has?
She has kind of a comment.

871
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,260
She really is like that.
She does have a tendency,

872
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:33,300
I know I shouldn't use that
word, but I'm serious. She has,

873
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,740
she can be real cunty sometimes and she
has a tendency to exaggerate things that

874
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,220
aren't really happening in
fact in here. Okay. All right.

875
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
So that's the first hate mail.
So I figured, you know what,

876
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:45,810
why don't I seek out, I'll try
to find some other hate mail.

877
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,640
Here's one that I got on
youtube. This is a nice one. Um,

878
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,010
basically I, uh, there's a clip on there
from me from about eight years ago,

879
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,980
which he'll obviously notice cause I'm
skinnier and have a full head of hair.

880
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,440
And I'm doing this bit about joining
the military, saying how, you know,

881
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:07,560
when you watch the commercials for the
military, it makes you want to join.

882
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,710
You know, they make it look like
everybody gets their own jet.

883
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,750
Everybody's driving a tank.
Everyone's doing some top gun shit.

884
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:18,310
Everyone's having a, you know,
you're a fucking navy seal.

885
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,480
You get your face painted and you're
clinging to that raft and you comment up

886
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:26,520
out of the water, like fucking
Rambo into the mud and shit.

887
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,880
That's what they make
you look like. Right.

888
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,440
But what they don't show is all
the other jobs that, you know,

889
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,370
you go in there and you think you're
going to be like, you know, Tom Cruise,

890
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,420
oh my God, my dog just
farted. Jesus Christ, Cleo.

891
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,100
You know? Could you at least like,

892
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,420
you don't kills me about
this dog when it farts is it,

893
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:48,860
it doesn't even have the decency that
fucking kind of make a face like, yeah,

894
00:53:48,861 --> 00:53:51,740
that was me. Sorry about
that. She doesn't lays here.

895
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,810
Good Lord. At least it's silent. You know?

896
00:53:56,811 --> 00:54:00,400
It's the worst is when you have a dog
that farts like a person ever been over

897
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,330
somebody's house and the dogs
and a corner, they just go like,

898
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:10,110
it is like, really. Anyways,
so that was the bit,

899
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:13,380
so the bit is yeah, you, you, you, you
see the commercial and you sign up,

900
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:13,981
you thinking, yeah,

901
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:17,910
I'm going to be like Tom Cruise in top
gun and then you show up and you ended up

902
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,800
being that guy. You know
when the jet takes off,

903
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:23,430
you just like point in the same direction
that the jet's going or they give you

904
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:27,900
those, those orange glow sticks from a
rave. You know when the plane comes in,

905
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:31,920
you're that guy, you put the air
in the tires on the jet, you know,

906
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,040
you joined and next thing you know you're
standing there with like a camouflage

907
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:39,300
weed whacker. Wait, wait, gay
man. Yeah, that was a joke. Okay.

908
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,793
Simple joke.

909
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,730
I actually did the joke at a military
base and I also did it at one of the VA

910
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:48,260
hospitals and if fucking
killed, you know what I mean?

911
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:53,810
So this guy of course has to go all
Fox News on Youtube and this is what he

912
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:57,980
writes is actually kind of funny.
He writes you on grateful bitch.

913
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,420
And then he puts in quotes, if you're
dumb enough to join the military. Dot.

914
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:03,254
Dot. Dot,

915
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,240
which is classic of somebody who wants
to take a joke seriously as they don't

916
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:11,750
write. The whole joke is they
just take not even a sentence.

917
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:15,440
They just take a part of a
sentence. Okay. So he writes,

918
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:17,900
if you're dumb enough to join
the military dot, dot. Dot.

919
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:21,710
And then he writes in capital
letters. Fact, fact is,

920
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,810
if it wasn't for the bravery
of the American servicemen
and the American spirit

921
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,150
throughout history, I
like the American spirit.

922
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:33,520
What do you mean chicks who go to
a fucking bake sale? Um, anyways,

923
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,700
you wouldn't even get,

924
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,820
you wouldn't even have the right to mock
those sacrifices which have been made

925
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:41,430
for you. And if you did,

926
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,040
you would probably be doing it in German.

927
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,480
So respect your American servicemen
because it is him in which you owe your

928
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:53,481
freedoms to take to that what people came,

929
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,090
you know, half the time
people think I'm a morons,

930
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,170
cause people can't even write a sentence
because it is him in which you owe your

931
00:56:00,171 --> 00:56:04,940
freedoms to that you take so foolishly
for granted. That's word for word.

932
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:08,870
I appreciate the sacrifices
of other, you coward.

933
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,000
Uh, you know, at what point did I
make fun of servicemen? I didn't,

934
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,350
I was making fun of the how fucking
whatever. You know something.

935
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:22,380
If you guys want to take jokes
seriously, I don't give a fuck and I,

936
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,270
I'm really sick. That hacky thing
where someone goes, you know,

937
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,500
and they did it for you and if you didn't,
you'd be speaking German right now.

938
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,120
That's how dumb people are. You know,

939
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,320
they're just used to say that you'd be
speaking German right now is a hacky

940
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:39,280
fucking reference.

941
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:43,360
You're just saying that because you
heard someone else say it. You know,

942
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,670
why wouldn't I be speaking
like I was from England?

943
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,490
Why wouldn't I be speaking a
Spanish right now? You know,

944
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:52,670
we did fight other countries,
Mexican American war.

945
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,630
How come that one never gets brought up?
I can, I wouldn't be speaking Korean.

946
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,790
I mean, granted they weren't over
here, but you know what I'm saying?

947
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:04,320
I'm so sick of fucking idiots who speak
in sound bites like everyone who like

948
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:07,890
makes fun of France. Yeah,
we full conceived jurors.

949
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,390
[inaudible] read a history book.

950
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,320
We were paying them back for saving
our ass with England. You dumb fucks.

951
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,800
So now we're even all
right, whatever. Look at me.

952
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:20,900
I'm getting all upset here cause
people are morons. All right, let's,

953
00:57:20,901 --> 00:57:24,770
let's move onto saline. Let's, let's get
to some information here for the week.

954
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,450
All right. Um, last week I
was at, Oh, here's going out.

955
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,730
Last week I was at teasing firefighters
and I was talking about how, uh,

956
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,980
you know, 20 trucks show up to
every fire. Why does that happen?

957
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:40,110
How much do those trucks cost? And
a volunteer firefighter wrote in,

958
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,640
he said a up it up. A De I. Yes.

959
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:47,500
How much a fire trucks cost fire
engines, which put the water out.

960
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,720
Uh Oh wait, put the water out.
Fire engines, which put water out.

961
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,230
I think I'm dyslexic. Um,

962
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,610
typically run between
300,000 and $600,000.

963
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:04,130
Fire trucks also called ladder trucks
run between 400,000 and 800,000.

964
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:09,590
The two main differences between the
low and high numbers is the make of the

965
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:11,420
truck and the equipment.

966
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:16,130
It comes with a fire engine with all
the hoses added on and the breathing

967
00:58:16,131 --> 00:58:19,400
apparatus is more expensive
than without. All right.

968
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:22,670
Well here's a question I have with for
you. You saved the make of the truck.

969
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:28,800
So, uh, I guess what Mack
truck, that's a reputable bank.

970
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,850
Reputable law brand as opposed to what?

971
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,640
A High Hyundai fire firetruck.
I guess that that's what it is.

972
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:38,190
I don't even know what the fuck
they are. But anyways, you asked us,

973
00:58:38,191 --> 00:58:41,890
you asked why so many pieces of
apparatus show up to a call a,

974
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:45,090
there are a few reasons for this.
Sometimes it's manpower. In my case,

975
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:49,140
we have three fire companies
consisting of six pieces of apparatus.

976
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:53,250
Since we volunteer, they may not be
enough volunteers in town at any one time.

977
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,220
So all three companies get
banged out, banged out,

978
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:58,890
equals called out in firefighting terms.

979
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,470
Typically at least four
pieces show up for a call.

980
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,600
This allows us to have all the
equipment we need at the scene.

981
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,770
Sometimes you just never know what you're
going to need. All right, fair enough.

982
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,650
Uh, but perhaps the best
reason this is great here,

983
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:16,640
but perhaps the best reason
is that sometimes we are
called for what amounts to

984
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:20,060
be in the end. Absolutely
nothing. About six months ago,

985
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:24,860
my pager went your pager,
Jesus Christ. Dude,

986
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,860
is your firetruck pulled
by a couple of horses?

987
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:33,050
Who the fuck still has a picture? I
know he's going to write back. Girl,

988
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:37,070
should we just special fucking nine 11
pager for firemen? I right. I'm a moron.

989
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,170
I get it. All right. How about six
months ago, my pager went off for,

990
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,240
for a working house fire at 2:00
AM I jumped awake and flew down,

991
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,790
uh, to the firehouse. We got on the
scene. We saw no smoke or flames in, uh,

992
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,180
in speaking with the residents,

993
00:59:52,181 --> 00:59:57,160
they had just woke up and saw a reflection
in their mirror that they thought was

994
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:57,994
a fire.

995
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:02,440
So here's all six of our apparatus
showing up for absolutely nothing,

996
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,020
or the time we called for,
for lightning, hit lightning,

997
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,150
hitting a house on a clear summer night.

998
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,540
The woman heard something and thought
it was lightening hitting her house.

999
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,710
People are fucking idiots
all over. Hope that helps.

1000
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,640
And even though I am a firefighter,
you're firefighter jokes were funny. See,

1001
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,660
they as a cool guy. He
see their sweetheart. Even
though he's a firefighter,

1002
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,230
he sees the joke. He realizes. I'm just
telling jokes out, right? There you go.

1003
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:33,380
People how we learned
something this week. All right,

1004
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,060
you want to learn something else then I'm
going to wrap up this fucking podcast.

1005
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,640
I'm gonna know it's
really short this week,

1006
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,300
but at w I don't understand what the
point of me keep babbling for fucking 50

1007
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:46,020
minutes. If G Cass won't
upload, the files are right.

1008
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,770
Here's some computer
tips for the week. Uh,

1009
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,890
here's some computer tips on
web searching. All right, Bill,

1010
01:00:51,891 --> 01:00:55,160
when you want to find something that, uh,

1011
01:00:56,370 --> 01:01:00,390
that you are Google it, what? That makes
no sense. All right? When you Google,

1012
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,530
use the plus and the minus
signs to find the shit you want.

1013
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,360
So this is how it works. If you
want to search something with uh,

1014
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,220
plus in front of it, then it
will have to contain the word.

1015
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,790
And if you want to put a minus in front
of it that were removed the word from

1016
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:20,271
the listing.

1017
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:24,230
So basically put the plus in front
of the word that you're searching,

1018
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,630
that you want to find an a minus in
front of the one that you don't want.

1019
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,493
For example,

1020
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:34,540
I want to see how many sites have bill
burr on it while limit while eliminating

1021
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:37,360
bilber from, uh, from the search.

1022
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,680
So you would Google the
plus sign plus my name bill,

1023
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,820
then the plus sign,

1024
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,530
and then you write bur minus bill
bird.com and the results will,

1025
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,130
uh,

1026
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,270
will show sites that can AV content with
bill burr on it and not include bill

1027
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,940
bird.com. Huh? Isn't that interesting?
I didn't know that shit. And he said,

1028
01:01:56,941 --> 01:02:00,780
I'm listed on seven hundred thousand
seven hundred six thousand web pages,

1029
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:02,730
not including my website.

1030
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:08,760
706,000 websites have my name on it and
I still can't sell up the third show on

1031
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:12,150
Saturday night. What the
fuck is going on? All right.

1032
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,120
Unless you find some shit out, like uh,

1033
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:19,890
if you want to find some
shit out like to do to you.

1034
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,370
I can't read what you guys write.
If you want to find some shit out,

1035
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:29,050
like to you do when you are on what?

1036
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,140
I can't even paraphrase that.

1037
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:39,630
If you want to find some shit out like
to you do now like you do when you're on

1038
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:45,220
the podcast. All right? You had
an extra word in there, dude.

1039
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,110
If you want to find some shit out like
you do when, uh, you're on the podcasts,

1040
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:53,620
use the above option, the plus, minus or

1041
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,950
or use quotes. All right?

1042
01:02:57,951 --> 01:03:02,240
You wanted to find the names of
female serial killers a few weeks ago.

1043
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,250
Just put quotes around a phrase and it
will only show sites that contain all

1044
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,140
phrases. Okay, I get it. You know,

1045
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:11,240
like you guys ever go to search
something and you're like,

1046
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,870
you'll just write female serial
killers and then a bunch of, uh,

1047
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,450
hits will come out and you have a
bunch that just say female and a bunch,

1048
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,930
several just say serial and other one
would just say killers or whatever. Yeah.

1049
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:26,680
I guess if you put quotes around it,
that puts it all together. You know what?

1050
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:31,140
That's very helpful. I know this part
of the s the podcast. Isn't that funny?

1051
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,980
But God damn it, we, you know, we got
to learn something here. All right.

1052
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:38,160
I should've got some water here. My
fucking mouth is dry as hell. All right,

1053
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:42,000
let's wrap up the podcast here. Uh,
this is the Syrah killer topic. Bill,

1054
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,180
if you want to be a serial killer, uh,

1055
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,770
and use the best weapon
you have to use ice.

1056
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,370
If you stab someone with an icicle
or beat someone to death with ice,

1057
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,550
then it melts and you have no
murder weapon or fingerprints,

1058
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:57,870
no DNA or fingerprint problems.
Oh yeah. That guy who, uh,

1059
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:01,770
that talked about tracking you down with
the type of soil where it was located

1060
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:06,150
and the type of wood used and all
that shit is exactly that bullshit.

1061
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,920
They watch too many shows. CSI does
not do that shit. I know, Dude.

1062
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:13,440
We all knew he was just fucking
around. He was making fun of how,

1063
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:17,980
when you watch those shows. Um, all
right, what else do we got here?

1064
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:22,890
Question. Uh, Bill, you say that you
play the drums. Um, if you could,

1065
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,000
uh, play the drums in any band, living
or dead for one show, one night,

1066
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:28,560
only in any city in the world,

1067
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,190
who would you play and in what city?

1068
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,720
Okay. Fuck. Um,

1069
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,520
Jesus Christ, it would
either be led Zepplin

1070
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,510
you know what's funny is I
think I would have a better,

1071
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:50,130
better chance faking what John Bonam
does than what Phil Rudd does in ACDC.

1072
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,800
Fulfill red does is so fucking difficult.

1073
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,530
If you play drums to just sit
there going, boom, crack, boom,

1074
01:04:56,531 --> 01:05:01,450
crack for fucking two hours straight.
Um, yeah, I think I would play,

1075
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:04,570
I would play with led Zeppelin. I do
it in England at Royal Albert Hall.

1076
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,980
And I would, and I would play
on that, that the Ludwig, uh,

1077
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:12,310
that maple drum kit that he played,
either that or his green sparco kit.

1078
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,670
I don't like the Vista Vista
light kit he had, or the, uh,

1079
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:18,220
the stainless steel one. I
liked the two ones that he had.

1080
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,390
I play on either one of those and somehow
I would sound as good as can I, can I,

1081
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,350
can I have that as part of the fantasy
that I would actually sound as good as he

1082
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:29,470
would sound? You know,
that's what I would do.

1083
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:36,580
Um, and then I'd get fucking some 1969
groupie pussy afterwards. All right,

1084
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,670
next question, Bill. Um,
would you rather be respected,

1085
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,230
be a respected comedian who never
makes it really big like so-and-so and

1086
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,570
So-and-so, I'm not going
to name the names a,

1087
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:49,390
he named two people who are
millionaires playing theaters,

1088
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:52,120
but I guess who can still
walk down the street, he said,

1089
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:56,200
or would you rather be a one trick
pony like a blah, blah, blah,

1090
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:57,670
who has written, uh,

1091
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,620
one catch phrase to fame and fortune and
has more cash than he can ever spend?

1092
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,340
Oh No, I'd much rather be respected
by my peers without a fucking doubt.

1093
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,070
Without a doubt. I would a, you know,

1094
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:17,040
you can become a really big comedian
and not necessarily be super fun.

1095
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:20,070
Like that's the great thing about
entertainment is you, it's easy to become,

1096
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:25,440
I can't say it's easy, but you can become
a millionaire and still not be famous.

1097
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:30,110
You know what I'm saying? And I
always use this, this example,

1098
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:34,460
like that Sitcom Caroline in the city,
they actually made it to syndication.

1099
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:39,490
And the entire cast could walk by me on
a walking down the street and I would

1100
01:06:40,131 --> 01:06:43,310
recognize any of them. So I would,
you know, Dude, you're a millionaire.

1101
01:06:43,311 --> 01:06:44,600
How much fucking money do you need?

1102
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:47,510
And I also think the more I look
at these people being super,

1103
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:51,590
super famous is I just doesn't
look like a good time to me.

1104
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,880
You know, I think I would,

1105
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,240
I want to be a millionaire
who has notoriety,

1106
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,150
which means maybe two, three times
a month, somebody goes a year,

1107
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:06,630
that comedian, I really like what
you do. And then Yay, thanks a lot.

1108
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:09,760
Then I go back to eating my omelette.
I'd rather do that than fucking, uh,

1109
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:14,100
I dunno. You know, I, I don't,

1110
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:17,340
I don't ever want to fucking have to
step out of a limo with no panties on.

1111
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:21,120
You know what I mean? Just so I can
maintain fame at that fucking level.

1112
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,150
Do you think that would whinge, do you
think that that would be miserable?

1113
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,020
I mean, other than when
you're at the, the,

1114
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:29,460
the fucking Celtics game and you
have court side seats in that moment,

1115
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:34,190
that's fucking awesome. You know what
I mean? I've always used this analogy,

1116
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:37,400
but it's someday at some point you're
going to have to fucking blow out a

1117
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:41,630
bathroom in public and you don't want
to be famous at that point. You know,

1118
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,160
you just want to be like, dude,

1119
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,900
you can have some fucking guy just blew.

1120
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:50,040
You don't want a bill burns
just blew out the bathroom.

1121
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:56,580
They literally put a fucking name
to it. It's brutal. Um, all right.

1122
01:07:56,581 --> 01:07:58,080
Overrated or underrated, really quickly.

1123
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:01,200
Overrated beer with the
lime already in it. No joke.

1124
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:04,680
It just tastes fucking gross. Um,

1125
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,610
what else do I got here? I'm sorry,
this is really fucking unraveling here.

1126
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:13,300
I just, I, I, I've done, I've done
this too many times this fucking week.

1127
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:15,070
I don't mind. I lost my passion.

1128
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,650
Like if Pau Gasol was
doing a fucking podcast,

1129
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,840
this is what it would sound
like right now. You know,

1130
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,020
and I'd be thumping my chest acting like
I'm giving you entertainment right now

1131
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:26,750
and I'm not, you know, that's what
I'm going to end with this week.

1132
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,230
What do we got here? I'm 28 minutes in.
Good. I'll keep it under 30 minutes.

1133
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:31,910
I'm going to end with this prediction.

1134
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,860
I think Orlando is going to beat
the Lakers and I think that they,

1135
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,840
they're going to beat them
in six games because uh,

1136
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:42,250
they don't have anybody to stop. Dwight
Howard and I think Turco Lou is a,

1137
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:43,870
I dunno,

1138
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,660
I think that guy's going to get enough
points and then they got that other guy,

1139
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,870
the number two or is he the point guard?
I don't know shit about basketball.

1140
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:50,980
I just fucking hate the Lakers.

1141
01:08:50,981 --> 01:08:55,300
So I'm going to go out on a limb
here with no money down or nothing.

1142
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:56,500
I'm not going out on a limb. I just,

1143
01:08:56,501 --> 01:09:01,170
I just think I got a feeling I
got a fucking feeling. All right.

1144
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,990
I think Van van Gundy
is going to out show.

1145
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,450
He's going to out coach
Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson,

1146
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:08,400
he's making home videos
with his girlfriend,

1147
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,010
his new hot young girlfriend on the,
on his way to the staples center.

1148
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:13,950
Every night. They're soft,
they're fucking soft.

1149
01:09:13,951 --> 01:09:17,190
All they have is Coby
Kobe's to shit. I love Coby,

1150
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,080
but I think his teammates
are scared of them.

1151
01:09:19,081 --> 01:09:20,880
I think they're scared
to fuck up around them.

1152
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,850
They're scared to disappoint them. Uh,

1153
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:26,220
and they just get freaked out
and they just pass him the ball.

1154
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:30,350
That's what I think is gonna happen.
Pago Saul gets the most quietest,

1155
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:35,150
15 fucking rebounds and the quietest
20 points a game. I think he's gonna.

1156
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,010
He's gonna take a fucking Dwight Howard
elbow to his bearded chops sometime in

1157
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:42,860
game two and the Orlando's
gonna win game two.

1158
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,720
They got three in a row in Orlando.

1159
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,180
They're going to win two out of three
and then they're going to come back and

1160
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:50,880
they're going to beat the heartless
Lakers in the staple center. Game Six.

1161
01:09:50,881 --> 01:09:53,420
What the fuck do you guys think
about that? Huh? You liked that one?

1162
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,730
You know, what do you guys think about
the two, three, two play a format?

1163
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:01,620
I think it's bullshit. I think the,

1164
01:10:01,621 --> 01:10:06,560
they give the advantage to the weaker
team because the Lakers should have home

1165
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:09,980
court. Right? And I don't think
they do with a two, three,

1166
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,860
two format because when it's two, three,

1167
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:17,770
two the pressure is on the home
team for the first two games.

1168
01:10:17,771 --> 01:10:19,850
Right. If it was two, two, one, one,

1169
01:10:19,851 --> 01:10:23,930
one like they used to do back in back
in the day you open the first two games,

1170
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:28,910
the pressure are on our Lando to
steal one. Now when it's two, three,

1171
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:30,500
two the, the pressures on the Lakers,

1172
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:34,600
they have to win both of those
fucking games. They can't go one,

1173
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:37,510
one and then path to play three
fucking games in Orlando. Right.

1174
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:41,380
My out of my mind, and this
is, is this all getting boring?

1175
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,770
While I don't give a fuck cause this
is my third one this week. Listen,

1176
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:48,310
my goddamn mouth is dry. Um, so anyways,

1177
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:51,460
I might Abdu do another podcast this
week as I might have a very special

1178
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:54,970
announcement of something that I might
be doing next week that might be on

1179
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:59,630
television. How do you like that? I'm
leaving you with a little cliffhanger. Um,

1180
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:03,190
and with that, I don't
have any gigs until, uh,

1181
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:08,080
the third week in July when I'm going
to be at the comedy works in Denver. Um,

1182
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:13,060
why is that? Um, I booked a
very small part in a very big,

1183
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,670
and, um, I dunno, I'm shooting
like five, six days on it,

1184
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:21,930
but they had to clear out my [inaudible]
my schedule because they're working

1185
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:26,550
around famous people's schedules. So
I'm low man on the totem pole. So, uh,

1186
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:30,660
I gladly cleared out my
Spec, my a schedule. So, uh,

1187
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,420
I'll let you know what the name of the
movie is and all that type of shit,

1188
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,830
when in fact, I know that I haven't been
cut out of it. How's that? All right.

1189
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:42,870
And that's the, a very short, very
succinct Monday morning podcast this week.

1190
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:47,100
The third fucking time I'm praying to
God that this thing is going to actually

1191
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:49,590
get published. All right,
you guys have a good weekend.

1192
01:11:49,591 --> 01:11:53,970
Thanks to everybody who came out to the
Improv a couple of weekends ago out here

1193
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:57,830
in Hollywood. All right, that's
it. Take it easy. Take it easy.
