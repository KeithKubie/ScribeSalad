00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:12.590
Trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi
live on or inside of us,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.389
and maintaining a good, balanced 
relationship with them

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.450
is to our advantage.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.270
Together, they form the gut microbiome,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.880
a rich ecosystem that performs a variety
of functions in our bodies.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.771
The bacteria in our guts
can break down food the body can't digest,

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.621
produce important nutrients,

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.490
regulate the immune system,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.951
and protect against harmful germs.

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.560
We don't yet have the blueprint

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.751
for exactly which good bacteria 
a robust gut needs,

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.672
but we do know that it's important
for a healthy microbiome

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:47.511
to have a variety of bacterial species.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.711
Many factors affect our microbiomes,

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.091
including our environment,

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.270
medications like antibiotics,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.922
and even whether we were delivered
by C-section or not.

00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:01.121
Diet, too, is emerging as one 
of the leading influences

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.611
on the health of our guts.

00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:06.021
And while we can't control all 
these factors,

00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:08.372
we can manipulate the balance
of our microbes

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:11.712
by paying attention to what we eat.

00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:17.572
Dietary fiber from foods like fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:21.151
is the best fuel for gut bacteria.

00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:23.022
When bacteria digest fiber,

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:27.235
they produce short chain fatty acids
that nourish the gut barrier,

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:30.192
improve immune function,

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:34.716
and can help prevent inflammation,
which reduces the risk of cancer.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.426
And the more fiber you ingest,

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:40.904
the more fiber-digesting bacteria
colonize your gut.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:45.123
In a recent study, scientists exchanged
the regular high-fiber diets

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.363
of a group of rural South Africans

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:52.624
with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets
of a group of African-Americans.

00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:57.054
After just two weeks on the high-fat,
low-fiber, Western-style diet,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.962
the rural African group showed
increased inflammation of the colon,

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.525
as well as a decrease of butyrate.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:08.163
That's a short chain fatty acid thought
to lower risk of colon cancer.

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:11.574
Meanwhile, the group that switched
to a high-fiber, low-fat diet

00:02:11.574 --> 00:02:14.943
had the opposite result.

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:20.183
So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria 
when we eat low-fiber processed foods?

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:24.093
Lower fiber means less fuel
for the gut bacteria,

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:27.583
essentially starving them 
until they die off.

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.804
This results in less diversity

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:32.074
and hungry bacteria.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:36.633
In fact, some can even start to feed
on the mucus lining.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:41.175
We also know that specific foods 
can affect gut bacteria.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.345
In one recent microbiome study,

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:44.925
scientists found that fruits,

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:45.864
vegetables,

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:46.614
tea,

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:47.364
coffee,

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:48.263
red wine,

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:49.284
and dark chocolate

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:53.154
were correlated with 
increased bacterial diversity.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.945
These foods contain polyphenols,

00:02:55.945 --> 00:03:00.114
which are naturally occurring 
antioxidant compounds.

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.155
On the other hand,

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.815
foods high in dairy fat,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.504
like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:08.564
were correlated with decreased diversity.

00:03:08.564 --> 00:03:11.055
How food is prepared also matters.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:14.524
Minimally processed, fresh foods
generally have more fiber

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:16.745
and provide better fuel.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:17.836
So lightly steamed,

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:18.598
sautÃ©ed,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.675
or raw vegetables

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.255
are typically more beneficial
than fried dishes.

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:27.785
There are also ways of preparing food
that can actually introduce good bacteria,

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:31.454
also known as probiotics,
into your gut.

00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:35.355
Fermented foods are teeming
with helpful probiotic bacteria,

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:36.564
like lactobacillus

00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.545
and bifidobacteria.

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:40.965
Originally used as a way 
of preserving foods

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:43.387
before the invention of refrigeration,

00:03:43.387 --> 00:03:47.135
fermentation remains a traditional
practice all over the world.

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:48.316
Foods like kimchi,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:49.156
sauerkraut,

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:50.095
tempeh,

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.026
and kombucha

00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:54.196
provide variety and vitality
to our diets.

00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:58.766
Yogurt is another fermented food that can
introduce helpful bacteria into our guts.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:02.877
That doesn't necessarily mean that
all yogurt is good for us, though.

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:05.226
Brands with too much sugar
and not enough bacteria

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:07.527
may not actually help.

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:09.197
These are just general guidelines.

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:11.816
More research is needed before 
we fully understand

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:16.687
exactly how any of these foods
interact with our microbiomes.

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:18.253
We see positive correlations,

00:04:18.253 --> 00:04:23.397
but the insides of our guts are difficult
places to make direct observations.

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:25.258
For instance, we don't currently know

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:28.907
whether these foods are directly
responsible for the changes in diversity,

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:32.381
or if something more complicated
is happening.

00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:36.338
While we're only beginning to explore
the vast wilderness inside our guts,

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:42.167
we already have a glimpse of how crucial
our microbiomes are for digestive health.

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:47.817
The great news is we have the power
to fire up the bacteria in our bellies.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.017
Fill up on fibers,

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:50.668
fresh and fermented foods,

00:04:50.668 --> 00:04:53.677
and you can trust your gut
to keep you going strong.
