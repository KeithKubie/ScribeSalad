00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 align:start position:0%
it's the kind of mentality that goes
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.590 align:start position:0%
it's the kind of mentality that goes

particularly why did this happen well if
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
particularly why did this happen well if
you<00:00:45.470><c> take</c><00:00:45.650><c> immigration</c><00:00:46.370><c> for</c><00:00:46.730><c> example</c><00:00:48.129><c> there</c>

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 align:start position:0%
to keep the country running and so this

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
completely ridiculous way to view it is
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.870 align:start position:0%
completely ridiculous way to view it is
there<00:01:12.110><c> a</c><00:01:12.140><c> connection</c><00:01:12.380><c> between</c><00:01:12.640><c> brexit</c><00:01:13.640><c> and</c>

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
there a connection between brexit and
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.290 align:start position:0%
there a connection between brexit and
what<00:01:14.509><c> we've</c><00:01:14.660><c> seen</c><00:01:14.899><c> happen</c><00:01:15.380><c> and</c><00:01:15.590><c> for</c>

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
recently I do see some parallels
particularly<00:01:22.130><c> with</c><00:01:22.250><c> this</c><00:01:22.400><c> British</c>

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 align:start position:0%
particularly with this British
 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
particularly with this British
government<00:01:23.120><c> after</c><00:01:23.300><c> the</c><00:01:23.510><c> referendum</c><00:01:24.970><c> the</c>

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 align:start position:0%
government after the referendum the
 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.630 align:start position:0%
government after the referendum the
government<00:01:26.540><c> has</c><00:01:26.750><c> become</c><00:01:27.170><c> much</c><00:01:27.380><c> more</c>

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
government has become much more
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.690 align:start position:0%
government has become much more

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 align:start position:0%
authoritarian in quite a lot of ways and
 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.330 align:start position:0%
authoritarian in quite a lot of ways and
I<00:01:31.970><c> think</c><00:01:32.000><c> that's</c><00:01:32.450><c> a</c><00:01:32.540><c> result</c><00:01:32.690><c> of</c><00:01:33.140><c> the</c><00:01:33.590><c> brexit</c>

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 align:start position:0%
I think that's a result of the brexit
 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's a result of the brexit
vote<00:01:34.400><c> and</c><00:01:34.970><c> the</c><00:01:35.360><c> 2-year</c><00:01:35.990><c> time</c><00:01:36.230><c> limit</c><00:01:36.290><c> or</c>
