00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.410
Okay, so what is what does
this diagram look like to you?

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.320
We've got this box in
the middle labeled RL.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.702
I won't tell you what that stands for.

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:09.279
And rewards and interaction with
the environment come in and

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.870
behavior comes out.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.100
&gt;&gt; So it looks like that.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.980
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it'll look like,
it looks like that it looks like that.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.800
&gt;&gt; But
what process does that remind you of?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.358
I'll give you a hint.

00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:18.330
&gt;&gt; Reinforcement learning.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.855
So that's reinforcement.

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.070
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to contrast it with

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.830
inverse reinforcement.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.440
&gt;&gt; I see, okay.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.530
&gt;&gt; All right, so this if this
is reinforcement learning in

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.220
a nutshell, then-
&gt;&gt; It is?

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.940
&gt;&gt; Is it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, environment and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.880
rewards come in.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then behavior comes out.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.040
&gt;&gt; Right so
now I'm going to invert that, right?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.110
So see how I change things?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.100
I added the word, inverse.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.530
I put an I in front of the RL and
I flip these two arrows.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.230
So now in inverse
reinforcement learning,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.160
the learner is experiencing
the environment and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.800
externally from an external
source is experiencing behavior.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.415
So this is coming from those same kinds
of demonstrations that you were talking

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:53.000
about and from that it has to
actually infer a reward function.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.715
So let's do this as an exercise.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:56.405
&gt;&gt; Okay, that would be kind of.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.321
&gt;&gt; Not a quiz.

00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.343
&gt;&gt; No, no that would be wrong.

00:00:58.343 --> 00:00:58.945
&gt;&gt; That would be wrong.
