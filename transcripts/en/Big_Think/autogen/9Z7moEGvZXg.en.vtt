so sleep paralysis is something that's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
so sleep paralysis is something that's
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.550
so sleep paralysis is something that's
actually very common many people have it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
actually very common many people have it
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.830
actually very common many people have it
I've had it myself and what happens is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
I've had it myself and what happens is
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.359
I've had it myself and what happens is
when you're in that REM stage of sleep

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:11.369
when you're in that REM stage of sleep
 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.789
when you're in that REM stage of sleep
your body your brain is very active

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799
your body your brain is very active
 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.379
your body your brain is very active
you're dreaming the most during that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
you're dreaming the most during that
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900
you're dreaming the most during that
stage your mind your eyes are moving

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
stage your mind your eyes are moving
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.460
stage your mind your eyes are moving
there's a lot that's going on it's like

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
there's a lot that's going on it's like
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.610
there's a lot that's going on it's like
fireworks going on in your brain now

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620
fireworks going on in your brain now
 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.780
fireworks going on in your brain now
what happens in the rest of your body

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790
what happens in the rest of your body
 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.240
what happens in the rest of your body
and this is an evolutionary function is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
and this is an evolutionary function is
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.550
and this is an evolutionary function is
that your body has muscle atonia meaning

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
that your body has muscle atonia meaning
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470
that your body has muscle atonia meaning
your muscles are basically turned off

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
your muscles are basically turned off
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.470
your muscles are basically turned off
they can't work so your brain is active

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
they can't work so your brain is active
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.300
they can't work so your brain is active
your muscles can't work now for what

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310
your muscles can't work now for what
 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.030
your muscles can't work now for what
happens in sleep paralysis is that some

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
happens in sleep paralysis is that some
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190
happens in sleep paralysis is that some
patients and will notice this earlier in

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
patients and will notice this earlier in
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.270
patients and will notice this earlier in
the morning because you're having more

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
the morning because you're having more
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.120
the morning because you're having more
REM sleep then we'll wake up in the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130
REM sleep then we'll wake up in the
 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.729
REM sleep then we'll wake up in the
middle of REM sleep so I know myself I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
middle of REM sleep so I know myself I
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.049
middle of REM sleep so I know myself I
woke up once in the middle of REM sleep

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
woke up once in the middle of REM sleep
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.729
woke up once in the middle of REM sleep
and I couldn't move my muscles and it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
and I couldn't move my muscles and it
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650
and I couldn't move my muscles and it
was very scary and it's scary for anyone

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
was very scary and it's scary for anyone
 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330
was very scary and it's scary for anyone
who has it because your mind is very

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
who has it because your mind is very
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340
who has it because your mind is very
active your eyes are active but nothing

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
active your eyes are active but nothing
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410
active your eyes are active but nothing
else is moving so you have to give

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
else is moving so you have to give
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880
else is moving so you have to give
yourself a little while you'll come out

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
yourself a little while you'll come out
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.319
yourself a little while you'll come out
of the REM state your muscles awaken

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
of the REM state your muscles awaken
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119
of the REM state your muscles awaken
it's fine it's a totally normal thing to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
it's fine it's a totally normal thing to
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.139
it's fine it's a totally normal thing to
have now it can be indicative sometimes

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149
have now it can be indicative sometimes
 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.669
have now it can be indicative sometimes
of other sleep disorders so we'll see a

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679
of other sleep disorders so we'll see a
 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.649
of other sleep disorders so we'll see a
lot in narcolepsy so some patients will

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
lot in narcolepsy so some patients will
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.209
lot in narcolepsy so some patients will
report that they have sleep paralysis if

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219
report that they have sleep paralysis if
 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.219
report that they have sleep paralysis if
we see sleep paralysis alone and nothing

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
we see sleep paralysis alone and nothing
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.349
we see sleep paralysis alone and nothing
else we don't really think all that much

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359
else we don't really think all that much
 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.569
else we don't really think all that much
of it but if we see other symptoms then

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579
of it but if we see other symptoms then
 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.980
of it but if we see other symptoms then
it might be a red flag for something

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
it might be a red flag for something
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.700
it might be a red flag for something
else that's going on

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 
so in REM behavior disorder RBD it's a

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190
so in REM behavior disorder RBD it's a
 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.310
so in REM behavior disorder RBD it's a
newer diagnosis I'd say probably about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
newer diagnosis I'd say probably about
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990
newer diagnosis I'd say probably about
the past ten to fifteen years we're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
the past ten to fifteen years we're
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.630
the past ten to fifteen years we're
really recognizing it more and more

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640
really recognizing it more and more
 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.280
really recognizing it more and more
patients will come to our practice then

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
patients will come to our practice then
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160
patients will come to our practice then
they'll say I'm I'm waking up in the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
they'll say I'm I'm waking up in the
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870
they'll say I'm I'm waking up in the
morning and right I have bruises on my

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
morning and right I have bruises on my
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990
morning and right I have bruises on my
arms my fists are bloody or they're say

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
arms my fists are bloody or they're say
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090
arms my fists are bloody or they're say
you know I my house was a mess I found

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
you know I my house was a mess I found
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850
you know I my house was a mess I found
things all over the place generally that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
things all over the place generally that
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770
things all over the place generally that
can be sleepwalking but sleepwalking

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
can be sleepwalking but sleepwalking
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120
can be sleepwalking but sleepwalking
tends to not be as violent and that's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
tends to not be as violent and that's
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.380
tends to not be as violent and that's
earlier in the night when you're in the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
earlier in the night when you're in the
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.170
earlier in the night when you're in the
deeper stages of sleep in RBD it tends

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
deeper stages of sleep in RBD it tends
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.910
deeper stages of sleep in RBD it tends
to be a bit more violent a bit more

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
to be a bit more violent a bit more
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
to be a bit more violent a bit more
aggressive so when you're in REM sleep

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
aggressive so when you're in REM sleep
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.930
aggressive so when you're in REM sleep
your muscles supposed to be have a tone

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940
your muscles supposed to be have a tone
 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.359
your muscles supposed to be have a tone
yet and no known function for them but

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
yet and no known function for them but
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.920
yet and no known function for them but
for some patients their muscles don't

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
for some patients their muscles don't
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.510
for some patients their muscles don't
turn off so if they're having a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
turn off so if they're having a
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.550
turn off so if they're having a
nightmare a very vivid dream they'll

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
nightmare a very vivid dream they'll
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770
nightmare a very vivid dream they'll
actually act out essentially their dream

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
actually act out essentially their dream
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.750
actually act out essentially their dream
in their sleep during REM sleep so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
in their sleep during REM sleep so
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100
in their sleep during REM sleep so
that's why we'll start to see it we'll

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
that's why we'll start to see it we'll
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050
that's why we'll start to see it we'll
see patients come in with bruises their

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
see patients come in with bruises their
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.000
see patients come in with bruises their
beds a mess they might fall out of bed

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
beds a mess they might fall out of bed
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040
beds a mess they might fall out of bed
things like that so it can be for some

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
things like that so it can be for some
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.229
things like that so it can be for some
patients a very violent problem that we

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
patients a very violent problem that we
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.520
patients a very violent problem that we
actually need to treat and aggressively

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
 
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.650
 
yeah there's some that are REM behavior

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660
yeah there's some that are REM behavior
 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.510
yeah there's some that are REM behavior
disorder we'll see for some court

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520
disorder we'll see for some court
 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.950
disorder we'll see for some court
documented cases you know and they

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
documented cases you know and they
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.940
documented cases you know and they
really need to have a thorough

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
really need to have a thorough
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.130
really need to have a thorough
evaluation with a sleep specialist you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
evaluation with a sleep specialist you
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.960
evaluation with a sleep specialist you
can't just say oh I was while I was

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
can't just say oh I was while I was
 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.310
can't just say oh I was while I was
sleeping

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320
sleeping
 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.230
sleeping
there's confusional arousal so there are

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240
there's confusional arousal so there are
 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.030
there's confusional arousal so there are
states and deeper sleep that can happen

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
states and deeper sleep that can happen
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.500
states and deeper sleep that can happen
where people will go and they'll

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
where people will go and they'll
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.480
where people will go and they'll
disappear or they'll they'll take on

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490
disappear or they'll they'll take on
 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.520
disappear or they'll they'll take on
some other persona there or commit some

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
some other persona there or commit some
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.660
some other persona there or commit some
crime but it's all when they're in a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
crime but it's all when they're in a
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.340
crime but it's all when they're in a
very deep stage of sleep so you really

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
very deep stage of sleep so you really
 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.300
very deep stage of sleep so you really
need to have a very thorough evaluation

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310
need to have a very thorough evaluation
 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.850
need to have a very thorough evaluation
but yes there is there's a line of work

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
but yes there is there's a line of work
 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.760
but yes there is there's a line of work
of people who work with people have been

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770
of people who work with people have been
 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.740
of people who work with people have been
charged for crimes and will actually do

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
charged for crimes and will actually do
 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.120
charged for crimes and will actually do
sleep disorder analyses with them
