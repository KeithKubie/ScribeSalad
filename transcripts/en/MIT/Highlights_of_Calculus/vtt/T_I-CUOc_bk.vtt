00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.660
PROFESSOR: OK, hi.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.780
This is the second in my videos
about the main ideas,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.090
the big picture of calculus.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.180
And this is an important one,
because I want to introduce

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.480
and compute some derivatives.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.500
And you'll remember the overall
situation is we have

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.270
pairs of functions, distance
and speed, function 1 and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.570
function 2, height of a graph,
slope of the graph, height of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.000
a mountain, slope
of a mountain.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.650
And it's the connection
between those two that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.220
calculus is about.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.770
And so our problem today is, you
could imagine we have an

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.880
airplane climbing.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.160
Its height is y as it
covers a distance x.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.640
And its flight recorder will--

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.000
Well, probably it has two
flight recorders.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.890
Let's suppose it has.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.120
Or your car has two recorders.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.330
One records the distance, the
height, the total amount

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.430
achieved up to that moment,
up to that time, t,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.990
or that point, x.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.400
The second recorder would tell
you at every instant

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.640
what the speed is.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.050
So it would tell you the
speed at all times.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.040
Do you see the difference?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.732
The speed is like what's
happening at an instant.

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:11.400
The distance or the height, y,
is the total accumulation of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.540
how far you've gone, how
high you've gone.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.750
And now I'm going to suppose
that this speed, this second

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.930
function, the recorder is lost.
But the information is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.480
there, and how to recover it.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.970
So that's the question.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.130
How, if I have a total record,
say of height--

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.940
I'll say mostly with y of x.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.350
I write these two so that you
realize that letters are not

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.660
what calculus is about.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.020
It's ideas.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.150
And here is a central idea.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.660
if I know the height--

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.780
as I go along, I know the
height, it could go down--

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.390
how can I recover from that
height what the slope is at

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.970
each point?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.330
So here's something rather
important, that's the notation

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.740
that Leibniz created, and it was
a good, good idea for the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.330
derivative.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.790
And you'll see where
it comes from.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.190
But somehow I'm dividing
distance up by distance

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.760
across, and that ratio of
up to across is a slope.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.770
So let me develop what
we're doing.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:41.930
So the one thing we can do and
now will do is, for the great

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.250
functions of calculus,
a few very special,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.060
very important functions.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.360
We will actually figure
out what the slope is.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.260
These are given by formulas,
and I'll find a formula for

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.120
the slope, dy/dx equals.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.750
And I won't write it in yet.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.290
Let me keep a little suspense.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.640
But this short list of the
great functions is

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.800
tremendously valuable.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.620
The process that we go through
takes a little time, but once

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.240
we do it it's done.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.640
Once we write in the answer
here, we know it.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.420
And the point is that other
functions of science, of

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.380
engineering, of economics,
of life, come from these

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.410
functions by multiplying--

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.750
I could multiply that
times that--

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.330
and then I need a product
rule, the rule for the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.760
derivative, the slope
of a product.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.490
I could divide that by that.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.090
So I need a quotient rule.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.050
I could do a chain.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.490
And you'll see that's maybe the
best and most valuable.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.360
e to the sine x, so I'm putting
e to the x together

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.700
with sine x in a chain of
functions, e to the sine of x.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.230
Then we need a chain rule.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.620
That's all coming.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.460
Let me start--

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.680
Well, let me even start by
giving away the main facts for

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.930
these three examples, because
they're three you want to

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.350
remember, and might
as well start now.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.120
The x to the nth, so that's
something if n is positive.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.680
x to the nth climbs up.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.920
Let me draw a graph here of y
equals x squared, because

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.940
that's one we'll work out in
detail, y equals x squared.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.370
So this direction is x.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.520
This direction is y.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.610
And I want to know the slope.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.680
And the point is that that slope
is changing as I go up.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.090
So the slope depends on x.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.220
The slope will be
different here.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.330
So it's getting steeper
and steeper.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.400
I'll figure out that slope.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.520
For this example, x
squared went in

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.690
as 2, and it's climbing.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:20.520
If n was minus 2, just because
that's also on our list, n

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.120
could be negative, the function
would be dropping.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.400
You remember x to the minus 2,
that negative exponent means

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.550
divide by x squared.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.630
x to the minus 2 is 1 divided
by x squared,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.730
and it'll be dropping.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.030
So n could be positive
or negative here.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.220
So I tell you the derivative.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.830
The derivative is easy to
remember, the set number n.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.020
It's another power of
x, and that power is

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.610
one less, one down.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.030
You lose one power.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.470
I'm going to go through the
steps here for n is equal to

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.850
2, so I hope to get the answer
2 times x to the 2 minus 1

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.280
will just be 1, 2x.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.860
But what does the slope mean?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.450
That's what this lecture
is really telling you.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.830
I'll tell you the answer for
if it's sine x going in,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.990
beautifully, the derivative of
sine x is cos x, the cosine.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.260
The derivative of the sine curve
is the cosine curve.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.860
You couldn't hope for
more than that.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.470
And then we'll also, at the same
time, find the derivative

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.940
of the cosine curve, which
is minus the sine curve.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.380
It turns out a minus sine comes
in because the cosine

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.280
curve drops at the start.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.640
And would you like
to know this one?

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.480
e to the x, which I will
introduce in a lecture coming

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.220
very soon, because it's the
function of calculus.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.230
And the reason it's so terrific
is, the connection

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:15.220
between the function, whatever
it is, whatever this number e

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.900
is to whatever the xth power
means, the slope is the same

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.200
as the function, e to the x.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.750
That's amazing.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.300
As the function changes,
the slope changes

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.550
and they stay equal.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.059
Really, my help is just to say,
if you know those three,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.950
you're really off to a
good start, plus the

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.500
rules that you need.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.000
All right, now I'll tackle this
particular one and say,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.690
what does slope mean?

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:56.500
So I'm given the recorder
that I have. This

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.850
is function 1 here.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.910
This is function 1,
the one I know.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.700
And I know it at every point.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.710
If I only had the trip meter
after an hour or two hours or

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:15.810
three hours, well, calculus
can't do the impossible.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.440
It can't know, if I only knew
the distance reached after

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.560
each hour, I couldn't tell what
it did over that hour,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.500
how often you had to break,
how often you accelerated.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.360
I could only find an average
speed over that hour.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.820
That would be easy.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.890
So averages don't
need calculus.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.140
It's instant stuff, what happens
at a moment, what is

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.630
that speedometer reading at the
moment x, say, x equal 1.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.280
What is the slope?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.600
Yeah, let me put in x equals 1
on this graph and x equals 2.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.720
And now x squared is going
to be at height 1.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.320
If x is 1, then x squared
is also 1.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.160
If x is 2, x squared
will be 4.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.150
What's the average?

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.970
Let me just come back
one second to

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.810
that average business.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:24.410
The average slope there would
be, in a distance across of 1,

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.840
I went up by how much?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.590
3.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.680
I went up from 1 to 4.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.650
I have to do a subtraction.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.480
Differences, derivatives, that's
the connection here.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.510
So it's 4 minus 1.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.830
That is 3.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:50.125
So I would say the
average is 3/1.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.620
But that's not calculus.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.160
Calculus is looking at
the instant thing.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.633
And let me begin at this
instant, at that point.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.750
What does the slope look like
to you at that point?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.840
At at x equals 0, here's
x equals 0, and

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.120
here's y equals 0.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.380
We're very much 0.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:26.600
You see it's climbing, but at
that moment, it's like it just

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.300
started from a red
light, whatever.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.940
The speed is 0 at that point.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.130
And I want to say
the slope is 0.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.860
That's flat right there.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.800
That's flat.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.350
If I continued the curve, if I
continued the x squared curve

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.030
for x negative, it would be the
same as for x positive.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.620
Well, it doesn't look
very the same.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.680
Let me improve that.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.440
It would start up the same way
and be completely symmetric.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.650
Everybody sees that, at
that 0 position, the

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.050
curve has hit bottom.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.710
Actually, this will
be a major, major

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.420
application of calculus.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.960
You identify the bottom of a
curve by the fact that the

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.600
slope is 0.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.540
It's not going up.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.470
It's not going down.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.250
It's 0 at that point.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.830
But now, what do I mean
by slope at a point?

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.000
Here comes the new idea.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.570
If I go way over to 1,
that's too much.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.540
I just want to stay
near this point.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.140
I'll go over a little
bit, and I call that

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.030
little bit delta x.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:44.300
So that letter, delta,
signals to our

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.660
minds small, some small.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.230
And actually, probably smaller
than I drew it there.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.620
And then, so what's
the average?

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.780
I'd like to just find
the average

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.310
speed, or average slope.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.040
If I go over by delta x, and
then how high do I go up?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.240
Well, the curve is y
equals x squared.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.420
So how high is this?

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:20.120
So the average is up first,
divided by across.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.750
Across is our usual delta x.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.830
How far did it go up?

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:30.530
Well, if our curve is x squared
and I'm at the point,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.830
delta x, then it's
delta x squared.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.011
That's the average over the
first piece, over short, over

00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:46.760
the first piece of the curve.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.342
Out is-- from here
out to delta x.

00:13:49.342 --> 00:13:50.592
OK.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.920
Now, again, that's still only
an average, because delta x

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.480
might have been short.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.370
I want to push it to 0.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:06.680
That's where calculus comes
in, taking the limit of

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.930
shorter and shorter and shorter
pieces in order to

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:17.120
zoom in on that instant, that
moment, that spot where we're

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.630
looking at the slope, and where
we're expecting the

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.500
answer is 0, in this case.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.270
And you see that the average,
it happens to

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.300
be especially simple.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.180
Delta x squared over delta
x is just delta x.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:38.710
So the average slope
is extremely small.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.140
And I'll just complete
that thought.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:55.040
So the instant slope-- instant
slope at 0, at x equals 0, I

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.860
let this delta x get smaller
and smaller.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.440
I get the answer is 0, which
is just what I expected it.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.520
And you could say, well,
not too exciting.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.110
But it was an easy one to do.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.400
It was the first time that we
actually went through the

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.260
steps of computing.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.180
This is a, like, a delta y.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.440
This is the delta x.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.140
Instead of 3/1, starting
here I had delta x

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.290
squared over delta x.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.520
That was easy to see.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.730
It was delta x.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.180
And if I move in closer, that
average slope is smaller and

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.670
smaller, and the slope
at that instant is 0.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.970
No problem.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:43.340
The travel, the climbing
began from rest, but

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.220
it picked up speed.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.300
The slope here is
certainly not 0.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.200
We'll find that slope.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.740
We need now to find the
slope at every point.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.210
OK.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.810
That's a good start.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:04.170
Now I'm ready to find the
slope at any point.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:09.890
Instead of just x equals 0,
which we've now done, I better

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:18.920
draw a new graph of the same
picture, climbing up.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.900
Now I'm putting in a little
climb at some point x here.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.085
I'm up at a height, x squared.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.310
I'm at that point
on the climb.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.410
I'd like to know the slope
there, at that point.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.110
How am I going to do it?

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:45.880
I will follow this as the
central dogma of calculus, of

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.810
differential calculus, function
1 to function 2.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:56.990
Take a little delta x, go as
far as x plus delta x.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.860
That will take you to a higher
point on the curve.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.230
That's now the point x plus
delta x squared, because our

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.730
curve is still y equals
x squared in this

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.919
nice, simple parabola.

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.810
OK.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:19.829
So now I you look at distance
across and distance up.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:25.210
So delta y is the change up.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.360
Delta x is the across.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.500
And I have to put
what is delta y.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.310
I have to write in,
what is delta y?

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.280
It's this distance up.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.700
It's x plus delta x squared.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.120
That's this height minus
this height.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.610
I'm not counting this
bit, of course.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.190
It's that that I want.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.040
That's the delta y,
is this piece.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.600
So it's up to this, subtract
x squared.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.780
That's delta y.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.470
That's important.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.520
Now I divide by delta x.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.820
This is all algebra now.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.320
Calculus is going to come in
a moment, but not yet.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.160
For algebra, what do I do?

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.870
I multiply this out.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.520
I see that thing squared.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.160
I remember that x is squared.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.190
And then I have this
times this twice.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.133
2x delta x's, and then I
have delta x squared.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.820
And then I'm subtracting
x squared.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:47.080
So that's delta y written
out in full glory.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.080
I wrote it out because
now I can simplify by

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.400
canceling the x squared.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.200
I'm not surprised.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.840
Now, in this case, I can
actually do the division.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.420
Delta x is just there.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.520
So it leaves me with a 2x.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.810
Delta x over delta x is 1.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.810
And then here's a delta x
squared over a delta x, so

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.940
that leaves me with
one delta x.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.400
As you get the hang of
calculus, you see the

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.590
important things is like this
first order, delta x to the

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.680
first power.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:34.370
Delta x squared, that, when
divided by delta x, gives us

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.130
this, which is going
to disappear.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.490
That's the point.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:48.940
This was the average over a
short but still not instant

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.080
range, distance.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.870
Now, what happens?

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.130
Now dy/dx.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:09.470
So if this is short, short over
short, this is darn short

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.160
over darn short.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:18.610
That d is, well, it's
too short to see.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.880
So I don't actually now try
to separate a distance dy.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:31.350
This isn't a true division,
because it's effectively 0/0.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.360
And you might say, well, 0/0,
what's the meaning?

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.620
Well, the meaning of 0/0, in
this situation, is, I take the

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:54.140
limit of this one, which does
have a meaning, because those

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.070
are true numbers.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.320
They're little numbers
but they're numbers.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:07.440
And this was this, so now here's
the big step, leaving

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.380
algebra behind, going to
calculus in order to get

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.780
what's happening at a point.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.230
I let delta x go to 0.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.510
And what is that?

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.900
So delta y over delta
x is this.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.380
What is the dy/dx?

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.960
So in the limit, ah,
it's not hard.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.270
Here's the 2x.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.030
It's there.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.570
Here's the delta x.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.280
In the limit, it disappears.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.460
So the conclusion is that
the derivative is 2x.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.000
So that's function two.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.660
That's function two here.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.450
That's the slope function.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.060
That's the speed function.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.390
Maybe I should draw it.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.370
Can I draw it above and then
I'll put the board back up?

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:06.740
So here's a picture of function
2, the derivative, or

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.910
the slope, which I
was calling s.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.070
So that's the s function,
against x.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:16.320
x is still the thing that's
varying, or it could be t, or

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.270
it could be whatever
letter we've got.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.710
And the answer was 2x
for this function.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.970
So if I graph it, it starts
at 0, and it climbs

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.540
steadily with slope 2.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.184
So that's a graph of s of x.

00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:40.460
And for example--

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.490
yeah, so take a couple of
points on that graph--

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.520
at x equals 0, the slope is 0.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.520
And we did that first. And
we actually got it right.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.680
The slope is 0 at the start,
at the bottom of the curve.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.430
At some other point on the
curve, what's the slope here?

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.240
Ha, yeah, tell me
the slope there.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.100
At that point on the curve, an
average slope was 3/1, but

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.180
that was the slope of this,
like, you know--

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.660
sometimes called a chord.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.040
That's over a big jump of 1.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.190
Then I did it over a small jump
of delta x, and then I

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:34.790
let delta x go to 0, so it was
an instant infinitesimal jump.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.630
So the actual slope, the way to
visualize it is that it's

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.560
more like that.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.170
That's the line that's
really giving the

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.860
slope at that point.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.240
That's my best picture.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.920
It's not Rembrandt,
but it's got it.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.040
And what is the slope
at that point?

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.540
Well, that's what our
calculation was.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.410
It found the slope
at that point.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:11.250
And at the particular point, x
equals 1, the height was 2.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.570
The slope is 2.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:17.720
The actual tangent line
is only-- is there.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.400
You see?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.730
It's up.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.350
Oh, wait a minute.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.950
Yeah, well, the slope is 2.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.230
I don't know.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.510
This goes up to 3.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:41.300
It's not Rembrandt, but
the math is OK.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.070
So what have we done?

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:49.130
We've taken the first small step
and literally I could say

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.290
small step, almost a play on
words because that's the

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.180
point, the step is so small--

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.170
to getting these great
functions.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:06.110
Before I close this lecture, can
I draw this pair, function

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:14.630
1 and function 2, and just see
that the movement of the

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.650
curves is what we
would expect.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:23.710
So let me, just for one more
good example, great example,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.510
actually, is let me draw.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.990
Here goes x.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.830
In fact, maybe I already drew
in the first letter, lecture

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.890
that bit out to 90 degrees.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:41.140
Only if we want a nice formula,
we better call that

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.000
pi over 2 radians.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.870
And here's a graph of sine x.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.450
This is y.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.380
This is the function
1, sine x.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.530
And what's function 2?

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.210
What can we see about
function 2?

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.650
Again, x.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.410
We see a slope.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.160
This is not the same
as x squared.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.230
This starts with a
definite slope.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:17.690
And it turns out this will be
one of the most important

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:19.480
limits we'll find.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.760
We'll discover that the first
little delta x, which goes up

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:30.610
by sine of delta x, has a slope
that gets closer and

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.120
closer to 1.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.440
Good.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:42.210
Luckily, cosine does start
at 1, so we're OK so far.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.120
Now the slope is dropping.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.330
And what's the slope at the
top of the sine curve?

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.810
It's a maximum.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:56.710
But we identify that by the
fact that the slope is 0,

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:01.690
because we know the thing is
going to go down here and go

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:02.780
somewhere else.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.410
The slope there is 0.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.400
The tangent line
is horizontal.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.980
And that is that point.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.260
It passes through 0.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.980
The slope is dropping.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.030
So this is the slope curve.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.200
And the great thing is that
it's the cosine of x.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.090
And what I'm doing now is
not proving this fact.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.610
I'm not doing my delta x's.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.160
That's the job I have to do
once, and it won't be today,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.445
but I only have to do it once.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.330
But today, I'm just saying
it makes sense

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.630
the slope is dropping.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.700
In that first part, I'm going
up, so the slope is positive

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.910
but the slope is dropping.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.650
And then, at this point,
it hits 0.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.500
And that's this point.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.730
And then the slope
turns negative.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.110
I'm falling.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.830
So the slope goes negative,
and actually

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.420
it follows the cosine.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.240
So I go along here to that
point, and then I can continue

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.840
on to this point where
it bottoms out again

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.760
and then starts up.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.140
So where is that
on this curve?

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.300
Well, I'd better draw a
little further out.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.730
This bottom here
would be the--

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.980
This is our pi/2.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:36.270
This is our pi, 180 degrees,
everybody would say.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.510
So what's happening
on that curve?

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:47.760
The function is dropping, and
actually it's dropping its

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.510
fastest. It's dropping its
fastest at that point, which

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.640
is the slope is minus 1.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.180
And then the slope is still
negative, but it's not so

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:02.670
negative, and it comes back up
to 0 at 3 pi/2 So this is the

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.500
point, 3 pi/2.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.530
And this has come back
to 0 at that point.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.500
And then it finishes the
whole thing at 2 pi.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.920
This finishes up here
back at 1 again.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.170
It's climbing.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:26.850
All right, climbing, dropping,
faster, slower, maximum,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:33.070
minimum, those are the words
that make derivatives

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.150
important and useful to learn.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:40.930
And we've done, in detail,
the first of our

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.580
great list of functions.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.720
