00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.002
- Abigail Adams was
really very smart.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.587
When you look back, you think,

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:07.465
"Wow, what could she have done,

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:11.761
if she had had the kind of
education women have today?"

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.430
She could've ruled the world.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.852
John Adams served
in the Congresses,

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.355
he served as a diplomat,
he became president,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.942
they were more often
apart than together.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:29.154
And so The Book of
Abigail and John,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.448
of exchanges of
letters between them,

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:35.452
is one of the most read
by colonial historians

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:38.538
that include a woman,
that we've ever had.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.873
- She was a wonderful writer.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.126
There is a kind of
fluency to her language,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.878
it's almost
Shakespearian at times.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.297
She really understood
the human condition,

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.339
and drew upon it.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:52.635
- Abigail was very supportive
of her husband as First Lady,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.013
but she was not much
of an entertainer.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:57.807
- She really hammered
home this importance

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.643
of virtue and education
and everything

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:04.230
that went into making a model
citizen, and she lived it.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.568
- She carried with her that
idea that in a republic,

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:13.323
simplicity, hard work,
distaste for luxuries

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.867
ought to be the cultural norm.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:19.329
She's the first First Lady
to occupy the White House,

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.665
and Abigail makes
use of the house

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:27.086
in such a New England
housewife way.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.714
She hangs her laundry
up in one of the rooms.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.217
You could've
predicted that Abigail

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:36.930
was not going to fancy up the
White House, and she didn't.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.393
Abigail is often touted as
the first feminist in America

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.438
because she wrote
"Remember the Ladies",

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:49.359
the single most
misinterpreted letter ever

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.110
in the history of America.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.114
Almost everyone believes that
she was asking her husband

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.699
that women be given the vote,

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.536
but that was the farthest
thing in the world

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.870
from Abigail's mind.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.080
- She was actually calling

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.916
for legal protections
within marriages.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.126
At the time, a wife
was really considered

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.586
the property of her husband,

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:11.589
he could do, kind of,
whatever he wanted with her.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.718
- She was asking for a
revision of marriage laws

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.388
that gave everything
that a woman owned

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:22.433
from her dowry to her
clothes on her back

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.894
to her body, to her husband.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.105
- She was urging her
husband to remember that

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:30.108
men could be really
brutal to women.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:34.279
- She was saying, we fought
for liberty and independence

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.906
and freedom. Give women
a little independence!

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:41.911
She understood that
economic dependency

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:46.249
was what kept women restrained.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.586
His reply to her
was to laugh at her.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.590
Men would be crazy to
give into what she want.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.260
Had they gotten the married
women's property law

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.847
when Abigail wanted it, the
whole history of American women

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.848
might be different.
