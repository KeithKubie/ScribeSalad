00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.010
Git doesn't any commits when you create the repository.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.420
You'll have to do that yourself.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.410
So the correct answer here is zero.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.620
Now Git could create an initial commit with everything in the directory, but

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.590
it doesn't do that for a couple of reasons.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.850
The first is you might not want to commit everything in the directory, and

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.770
second, you wouldn't be able to write your own commit message if

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.670
Git created the commit for you.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.140
You can find out what commits are in your repository by running git log.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.020
Let's try that out on this new repository.
