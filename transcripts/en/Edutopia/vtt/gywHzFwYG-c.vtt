00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.136
&gt;&gt;Peggy: This community had been
without a school for about 25 years.

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.366
It was a community on the decline.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.096
It had gone from a stable middle
class area to high density,

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:24.856
high transient rate, poverty.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:29.526
So, this community
didn't have a center.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:34.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Five years ago, Principal
Peggy Bryan faced an exciting

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:35.026
yet daunting task.

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:38.116
She was asked to build
a new elementary school

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.796
and assemble a new team of
educators to address the needs

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:43.336
of this diverse community.

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:47.576
&gt;&gt;Peggy: The superintendent said to
me, essentially, she wouldn't want

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:50.716
to walk onto this campus and see
something she's ever seen before.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:54.186
So that was the starting place.

00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:07.056
What we did is we divided up the
prospective parents of the families

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:11.326
that would be coming to Sherman Oaks,
and we called them up one by one.

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.346
And asked them if we could come
out and spend 30 minutes with them

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.566
and hear what their ideas were

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:21.196
for the school their
children would be attending.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:25.806
High interest in technology,
that was key.

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:29.786
They really wanted to see
art education be a big part

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.746
of the school.

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:36.276
And the third thing they said is,
"If you could communicate with us

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:40.366
as much as possible, please do."

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.106
&gt;&gt;Osvaldo: When Peggy approached
me to come in to Sherman Oaks,

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.986
I jumped at the opportunity because
I knew this was going to be the place

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:51.866
where we were going to look
at each child individually

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.736
and not group them, or not
teach them all the same way.

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:59.136
And it was really nice to have
the support of the staff and all

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:02.806
of us having the same philosophy,
which is child-centered and believing

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.126
that each child can
succeed no matter what.

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:09.326
To me this is the place
where I became a teacher.

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:12.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Remember today
we're just looking for pictures

00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:14.426
and places, names of places.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Peggy considers the
teachers at Sherman Oaks her equals.

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:21.136
She creates a culture where
teachers can do their best work

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:23.916
and are encouraged to
learn from one another.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.406
&gt;&gt;Peggy: The staff
is an amazing group.

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:30.436
And they just exude enthusiasm
and belief and confidence.

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:31.966
And it's contagious.

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:37.016
I always turn to the staff and
say, "What do you think about this?

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:38.076
What do you think about that?"

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.776
Everyone has an equal voice.

00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:45.586
I like to provide that kind of
environment for them, just like they,

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.666
then, provide for the kids.

00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:53.886
I come to work every day saying I'm
going to get in every classroom.

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.986
And most of the time
I accomplish that.

00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:01.746
It gives me a personal
connection with the kids.

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:06.666
And they're like my
kids, all 466 of them.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.506
&gt;&gt;Okay, What's happening?

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:10.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: They're working on
journals and then they're going

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:12.306
to come and just go to free choice.

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:15.206
&gt;&gt;Peggy: What I need to do is
keep a sense of the big picture.

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:19.246
My goal is, at any given time,
to keep track of the pulse

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.646
of the school, to know, in
general, what are trends are

00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:23.776
and what are next steps are.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:27.616
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Peggy at the school
has a great leadership role.

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.476
And I've admired her since I met her.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.206
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Okay, here's the Internet.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:33.046
Show me how to get on.

00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:34.866
&gt;&gt;Sandra: She's the best
role model that I've seen

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.696
for life long learning,
which is what we promote

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:39.156
for our kids at this school, too.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.836
&gt;&gt;Peggy: We wanted technology
accessible to kids all the time.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:47.516
So we don't have a technology lab.

00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:49.506
You wouldn't have a
pencil lab now would you?

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:53.776
So our kids, when they need to use
a computer, we want them to be able

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.746
to stand up and go use a computer.

00:03:57.246 --> 00:04:02.096
Getting the kids so familiar and
so comfortable with technology,

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:05.506
with online access, with
fax machines and emails,

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:06.896
so it's second nature to them.

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:09.816
&gt;&gt;Sandra: For where these kids
are going to be in the future,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.286
they're not going to have a choice
but to know about technology.

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:15.216
I mean you'd be surprised,
they really only need for me

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:19.036
to show them once how to do
anything, and they remember.

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:22.116
&gt;&gt;So the kids are on
the Internet right now.

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.056
And so, they are learning
the language that is spoken

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.066
in the country that
they are studying.

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:30.966
So we've got Sophia on a
German website right now.

00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:32.356
&gt;&gt;Sophia: That means how are you.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:36.866
&gt;&gt;Sandra: These guys over
here are looking at Russian.

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:37.916
&gt;&gt;Peggy: All right, thank you.

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:38.886
Let's do thank you.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:39.976
Thank you very much.

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:43.066
[speaks Russian]

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:46.096
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, thank you very much.

00:04:46.096 --> 00:04:47.846
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Thank you very much.

00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:50.236
&gt;&gt;Sandra: It's just learning
more about what's new to bring

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:52.086
into the classroom
and going from there.

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:54.276
And really it's asking the
kids what they want to do

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:57.976
and being a facilitator for them.

00:04:58.106 --> 00:04:59.316
&gt;&gt;Peggy: With a letter grade...

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:01.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Peggy,
communication is the key

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:04.496
to the success of Sherman Oaks.

00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:07.706
One of the school's
innovations is the mid-day block

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:11.486
where for 90 minutes every
day, the entire staff meets

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:15.306
to discuss everything from new
curricula to individual students.

00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:18.636
&gt;&gt;Peggy: So from 11:30 to 1,
the teachers are off together.

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:25.356
That makes a big difference
in your community of learners.

00:05:25.506 --> 00:05:29.186
It's simple, inexpensive, and
it makes all the difference.

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:35.366
This fosters an incredible amount of
dialogue and inquiry and discovery

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:37.376
and learning between teachers.

00:05:37.496 --> 00:05:40.956
&gt;&gt;Osvaldo: She enjoys
writing and can write forever.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:44.856
&gt;&gt;We have so much built
in into that mid-day block

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:47.896
that it's constant
communication going on.

00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.246
&gt;&gt;Sandra: There's so much to learn.

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.666
There's always more I can learn.

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:53.996
Questioning, we're always
questioning, you know.

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:54.926
Don't ask why.

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:55.566
Ask why not.

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:59.046
&gt;&gt;Peggy: It happens when you have
a group of people that all believe

00:05:59.406 --> 00:06:00.876
that what you're doing is right.

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:02.906
And it spills over.

00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:06.796
And you give people opportunities
to also do what they think is right.

00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:09.746
And they get bolder and
bolder and more confident.

00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:12.476
You have to be able to reach
out to your colleagues.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:16.216
You have to be able to go the extra
mile with our kids and our parents.

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:18.896
You have to see yourself
as taking an active role

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:22.436
and really turning this
whole industry upside down.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:24.546
That's what we're in this for.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:25.466
It's for the kids.

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:29.676
