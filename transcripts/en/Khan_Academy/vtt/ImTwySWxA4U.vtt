00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.677
- [Voiceover] The Lewis
electron-dot diagram

00:00:02.677 --> 00:00:06.545
for C_two H_four is shown
below in the box on the left.

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:08.106
In the box on the right,

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:11.033
complete the Lewis electron-dot diagram

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.616
for C_two H_five OH or ethanol,

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.695
by drawing in all of the electron pairs.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:19.288
So as they said, this right over here,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:23.189
this is the Lewis electron-dot
diagram for ethene

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.205
and they want us to fill in all of the,

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:26.502
they want us to draw in all

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.428
the electron pairs for ethanol.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.354
And what we could do,
and I'll do it in a way

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:35.507
where we can see which
electron comes from which atom,

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:37.197
but they're not even
asking you to do that.

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:39.928
But in blue, I'm going
to make the electrons

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:41.358
from the hydrogens.

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:44.024
So each hydrogen, you can
think of it as contributing

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:46.202
one electron to each pair,

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:48.250
and that's what's forming
the covalent bonds.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.891
So say this hydrogen is going
to contribute this electron,

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.594
this hydrogen can
contribute this electron,

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:59.919
this hydrogen can
contribute this electron,

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.422
this hydrogen can
contribute that electron,

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:04.991
this hydrogen can
contribute that electron,

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:08.491
this hydrogen can contribute this electron

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:11.265
right over there.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.151
And then, let's see.

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.938
So now let's think about the carbons.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.108
And if you were actually
taking the EP test,

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.384
you wouldn't, probably you
don't even have markers around,

00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:19.393
but I'm gonna do it in different colors

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:20.562
just so you can see it.

00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:22.967
So each carbon has four valence electrons

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:26.218
that it can contribute
for covalent bonding.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:29.718
So this carbon over here, that's one, two,

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:32.714
three, and then four.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.880
And now this carbon
over here can contribute

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.713
one, two,

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:41.740
three, and four.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:46.714
And now we think about the oxygen.

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:48.501
So oxygen's interesting.

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:50.874
It's going to have two lone pairs.

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:52.629
So it's gonna have one lone pair.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:53.670
I can do it there.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.303
One lone pair like that.

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.286
And then, it's going to
have, it's going to form

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.089
this bond by contributing
one electron to this pair

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.657
and one electron to this
pair right over there.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.063
So each of these pairs
represent a covalent bond.

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:08.786
This one I could have
drawn a little bit lower,

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:10.964
but I think you get the idea.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:15.047
Those, I have drawn in
all of the electron pairs.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.051
And I'll just think about part e.

00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:19.448
What is the approximate value

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:22.569
of the carbon-oxygen-hydrogen bond angle

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.300
in the ethanol molecule.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.315
So, in the ethanol, they're really saying,

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.891
so the ethanol molecule, they
want to know the bond angle.

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:34.224
You have the oxygen bonded to a hydrogen

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.180
bonded to the C_two H_five.

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:42.140
So I'll just write that as,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.057
C_two, I'll just write
C_two H_five, like that.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.874
And they want to know
what is approximately

00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:52.182
this bond angle going to be.

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:54.393
And the important thing to realize is,

00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:56.766
when you form these bonds with
oxygen, it's going to have

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:59.171
pretty close to a tetrahedral shape.

00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:03.170
Why? Because the oxygen
has these two lone pairs.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.136
So these two lone pairs are
forming the other parts,

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.886
the other, the other,

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:13.800
I guess you could say points
of the tetrahedral shape.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.205
And so if we were
talking about just water,

00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:18.060
so, water, if we were talking about

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.952
a water molecule right over here,

00:03:20.952 --> 00:03:22.739
and I'm not doing a
good job of drawing it.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.658
You could draw one electron pair there

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:25.535
and then the other electron pair

00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:26.932
would be here in the back.

00:03:26.932 --> 00:03:29.502
Actually, I could, let
me draw it like this.

00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:33.046
Let me draw, I could draw it like this.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.311
If we were talking about water,

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:37.887
I could draw one hydrogen popping out.

00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:41.235
I could draw the other
hydrogen popping in.

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:44.682
And then one electron pair is over here

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:47.216
and one electron pair is over here.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.492
This bond angle over here in water,

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.215
this is, I guess, a semi-useful thing

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:52.793
to know in general.

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:54.237
You could kind of eyeball, and say,

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:55.697
oh that looks like a little bit more

00:03:55.697 --> 00:03:57.420
than 100 degrees, and you'd be right.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.587
This is approximately 100
point four point five degrees.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.123
And this is actually not a
perfect tetrahedral shape.

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:08.504
It gets distorted because
these lone pairs of electrons

00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:11.982
are repelling each other
and making these two get in

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.422
a little bit closer
together with each other.

00:04:14.422 --> 00:04:16.891
And if you have a pure tetrahedral shape.

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:18.808
So you have something in he middle.

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:19.718
Well, let me just,

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.514
if you had a pure
tetrahedral shape like this.

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:25.017
So let me, so let me draw it like this.

00:04:25.017 --> 00:04:27.781
So something popping out.

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.934
You have something, something going in.

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:33.047
And then you have two things like this.

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:35.030
That's one way to think
about a tetrahedron.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.103
There's others.

00:04:36.103 --> 00:04:37.923
Then the bond angle between all of these

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:39.548
if it's a more, I guess you could say,

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:43.775
symmetric tetra, a
non-distorted tetrahedral shape,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.192
is 109.5 degrees.

00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:48.106
And this is a reasonable,

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:51.478
a reasonably useful number to know,

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:52.725
obviously for this question as well.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:53.699
I don't know if you could,

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.031
if this is obvious.

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.851
Let me actually draw the tetra-hed,

00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:59.679
let me connect the tetrahedron.

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:03.093
So, you could draw it like that,

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:04.816
and then that would be the
other side right there.

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:05.661
I don't know if that helps.

00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:07.774
Let me draw another one.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:10.691
So, if I were to draw a tetrahedron

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.853
and if this was transparent,

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:17.137
you have a molecule, or you have an atom

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:19.964
in the middle, and then
you have the four bonds.

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:21.797
One, two, three, four.

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:25.556
I could say four bonds or lone pairs.

00:05:25.556 --> 00:05:29.619
Then, let me make sure you
see the one in the center,

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.423
then the angle here is
approximately 109.5 degrees.

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:36.348
So this is going to be tetrahedral,

00:05:36.348 --> 00:05:37.974
we have these lone pairs

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:40.672
that are going to be repelling
each other a little bit.

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:42.525
So you're going to be
someplace in the neighborhood,

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:44.378
of, I don't know, around where water is

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:46.328
or more pure tetrahedral shape.

00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:48.501
So I would say your bond
angle is going to be,

00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:51.951
I don't know, between 104 and 110 degrees.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.534
104 to 110 degrees.

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:57.705
In fact, I would, I would estimate

00:05:57.705 --> 00:05:59.688
that it's going to be more than 104.5,

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:02.021
because these, well, I just,

00:06:03.394 --> 00:06:06.255
I won't try to dig too much into it.

00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:08.563
They really just want us to approximate,

00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:10.482
approximate the value.

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:13.374
So you could give anything in this range

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:16.457
would be a suitable, suitable answer.
