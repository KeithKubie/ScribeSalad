00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:07.341
WITH A ONE HERMAN MANKIEWICZ,
SCREENWRITER,

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.409
AND MANKIEWICZ ALL OF A SUDDEN
STARTS GOING LIKE,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.813
YEAH, I WAS--I WAS AT
SAN SIMEON THE OTHER WEEK,

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.016
AND ORSON'S LIKE,
YOU HAVE INSIDE INFO

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.653
AND--AND LIKE LITTLE JUICY
TIDBITS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.654
AT THE HEARST CASTLE?

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.955
HE'S LIKE, OH, YEAH.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.659
HE'S LIKE, OH [bleep],
I HAVE AN INSIDE GUY.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.095
DO TELL, DO TELL.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.063
I PARTIED THERE REGULAR.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.166
I'M HAVING DRINKS, SMOKING CIGS,
DRINKING CHAMPY,

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.603
HAVING DELICIOUS APPETIZERS
WITH MARION DAVIES

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.507
AND DOUGIE FAIRBANKS
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE, LOVING IT.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:45.045
HE'S WITNESSING THIS STUFF
FIRST HAND OF [chokes] HOLD ON.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.148
[bleep]

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.850
SORRY, WHISKEY BEARD.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.487
[laughs and burps]
OH, MAMA.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.156
BUT THEN HEARST WOULD LEAVE
THESE PARTIES AND GO OUT

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.558
AND SPREAD ALL
HIS NEWSPAPERS OUT

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:58.892
AND JUST LORD OVER HIS POWERS,

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:02.629
LIKE I CONTROL MEDIA,
WHICH CONTROLS THE WORLD.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.897
I AM [bleep] GOD.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:08.569
AND ORSON GOES STOP.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.605
I NEED YOU TO WRITE ME

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.741
A SCREENPLAY ABOUT THIS,

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.443
AND I AM GOING TO MAKE IT

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.212
INTO A FEATURE FILM.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.449
DEAL WAS MADE.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.288
ORSON WELLES KNEW THAT WE NEED
TO KIND OF KEEP THIS TOP SECRET,

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:31.491
AND KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS
BECAUSE OF HEARST.

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.794
MANKIEWICZ WOULD POUND
OUT THE PAGES,

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.429
ORSON WELLES KEPT ON
READING THIS STUFF,

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.200
HE WAS LIKE,
THIS IS AMAZING SCREENWRITING.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.071
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST MOVIE EVER,

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:48.008
LIKE I'M MAKING A [bleep]
KICKASS MOVIE MAN.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.511
CAPICHE?

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.080
HE WROTE, PRODUCED,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.583
DIRECTED,
HE STARRED IN IT.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.485
WHEN THE MOVIE WAS COMPLETE,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.888
THE MOST POWERFUL
GOSSIP COLUMNIST OF THE TIME,

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:04.725
SHE SAID TO HEARST, THEY MADE
MARION DAVIES LOOK LIKE

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.661
A COMPLETE FLOOZY,
HORRIBLE PERSON.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.764
I MEAN THE--THE WHOLE MOVIE
WAS BASICALLY TRASHING

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.032
THE HEARST NAME.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.669
HEARST HEARS ABOUT THIS,
AND HE SEES RED.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.672
HE STARTS THREATENING
ANY NEWSPAPER OUT THERE

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:22.543
IF YOU PUT A REVIEW,
IF YOU PUT AN AD OUT FOR THIS,

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:23.844
YOU'RE DONE.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.747
HE TOLD EVERY MOVIE THEATRE,
IF YOU RUN THIS MOVIE,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:32.419
WE WILL NEVER PLACE AN AD FOR
ONE OF YOUR FILMS EVER AGAIN.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.288
SO.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:40.327
HMM, UM.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:45.065
OH, WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT?

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.266
- CITIZEN KANE?

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:50.571
- [laughs]
THAT WAS VERY GENERAL,

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.605
UM [laughs]
AH, RKO CALLED ORSON WELLES
