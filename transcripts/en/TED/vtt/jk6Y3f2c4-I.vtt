Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.691
Tiffany Kagure Mugo: OK.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:20.063
So we've signed up,
there's no turning back now.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.088
(Laughter)

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:23.605
Siphumeze Khundayi: Hi, guys.
TKM: Hello, everyone.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:26.438
TKM: So, you think you know about sex.

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:28.050
Chances are you don't,

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:30.334
and we are here to tell you
that you don't.

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:34.268
SK: We are here to tell you
that no matter where you come from,

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:37.943
Abuja to Alabama,
Dubai to downtown London,

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.085
sex has and continues to change.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.776
And we need to understand this

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.402
if we're going to keep things
safe and spicy.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:47.306
TKM: So now, the act
of rubbing our naked bodies together

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.672
has undergone a number of changes.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:53.466
And those changes have been
affected by eons of ideas.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.084
Even you, as an adult,
have some internalized ideas about sex

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:58.776
that you never challenge.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.490
Some good, some bad
and some very, very strange.

00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:04.403
(Laughter)

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:06.856
SK: So when you allow someone
to see you butt naked,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.982
do you ever think about
how the ideas that you internally have

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:15.229
will affect whether you will like them
tickling your elbow or kissing your thigh

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.897
or shouting out the name of a chose deity?

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.850
One must do internal
monitoring and evaluation

00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:24.010
if we are going to live
our best sexy lives.

00:01:24.034 --> 00:01:27.297
TKM: And we're going to tell you
how to have a great sex life, right?

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.956
But the first thing you need to do

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.822
is let go of the bad ideas
you have about sex.

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:35.292
SK: Think about the things
that we need to change.

00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:38.975
TKM: And the things we need to embrace
in all of their shiny newness.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.628
So, we're going to take you
on a journey of sex:

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:45.930
the bad parts of sex,
historically great sexual practices

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:47.628
and the future of sex.

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:53.505
SK: Now, judging by the cool
seven billion people on this planet,

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.909
human beings have been doing
the sex thing for a long time.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.713
And in vast quantities.

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:02.212
But this does not mean
we are actually good at it.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.004
From the top of my head -- rape culture.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.458
TKM: How tradition and culture
limit ideas of pleasure.

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:11.221
SK: Or even the idea that the nipple

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:14.545
deserves the same treatment
that a DJ gives his deck

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.918
when he's trying to turn up the volume.

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:19.656
TKM: Like, that is a personal
pet peeve of mine.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.009
SK: We are so scared of sex.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.757
TKM: And we need somebody
to blame for our fear.

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:32.534
Enter women, and our fear
of every part of their anatomy,

00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:34.982
unless we are the ones
using their sexiness.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.204
SK: Think about it.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:39.712
You can quite easily go to someone
and say, "My elbow hurts."

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:41.633
But try going to someone and saying,

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:44.847
"Excuse me, my vagina
has a strange buzzing feeling,

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:47.720
do you know where I can find
the buzzing-vagina ointment?"

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:50.065
And see how well that goes down.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.791
(Laughter)

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:53.109
TKM: Does not go down well.

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.594
I once challenged friends
to simply go into supermarkets

00:02:56.618 --> 00:02:59.299
and say to strangers, "Thighs."

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:00.473
No one did it,

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.053
despite the fact that they could have been
talking about chicken or turkey.

00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:05.115
(Laughter)

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.872
SK: So a number of cultural
and historical notions

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.038
have burrowed so deeply within us,

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:14.109
we don't even notice that it's strange
to freak out when somebody says "nipple"

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:15.672
as opposed to "left knee."

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.466
We refuse to engage with sex properly.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.331
And the first step
is admitting that it exists

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:25.855
outside of trying to sell us products
like bottled water or coffee.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.119
The unrealistic depictions in movies

00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:31.839
or that one thing that you saw
on the internet "by mistake."

00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.029
TKM: Mhm.

00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:35.994
So, now in order to cure
this ailment, again,

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:40.379
let us just first admit that we have
some messed-up ideas of sex.

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:41.720
SK: And breathe in --

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.006
(Inhales)

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.402
And let it all go.

00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:49.439
Now, it all seems pretty morbid --

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:54.257
that culture and society have failed us
in our quest for coitus.

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.622
But this is not the case.

00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:57.665
There are things
that the past can teach us

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.983
to help us upgrade the present.

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:04.285
TKM: So now, if I had a glass of Merlot --
which I really wish I did --

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.288
I would pour the ancestors a drink,

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.129
because there are ways
in which African societies

00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:12.145
huddled this sex thing
before the C that shall not be named --

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.637
SK: (Whispering) Colonization.

00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:14.876
TKM: Came through.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.908
Within African societies, we had spaces,
both social and spiritual,

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:23.649
that helped institutionalize
healthy sexual practices.

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:28.362
We had sexuality schools
that taught social and erotic cues.

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:31.720
We had spaces where teenagers
could engage, understand

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:35.577
and like, properly know
how to handle sexual urges,

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:40.321
and places where adults could handle
the stresses and strifes of adulting.

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:43.514
SK: Ways that didn't include
you hiding your credit card bill

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:45.863
or deleting that toll-free number
from your phone.

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:49.505
These spaces of old
were so important for women.

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.379
TKM: There were African sexual practices
that centered women

00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:54.482
and in particular, their pleasure.

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:56.950
SK: And we're going to talk
about one in particular

00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:58.847
that's named "osunality."

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.586
TKM: Also known as the African erotic.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.688
Yes, my people,
welcome to the Thunderdome.

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:07.070
The erotic takes on
different shapes and forms

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:09.180
as you travel the globe.

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.180
Now let's take a bow to the "Kama Sutra,"

00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:15.268
the world's first book on the pleasures
of sensual living.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:20.156
More than just a mere depiction
of contortionist sexual positions,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.418
it provided a comprehensive guide
on living a good life.

00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:26.703
What is particularly interesting for us

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:31.299
is that it focused on women
and creating pleasure for women.

00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:36.306
TKM: Mhm. Shout-out to the "Kama Sutra,"
but back to the African erotic.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.656
SK: OK, my bad, bringing it back.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.608
So, Nkiru Nzegwu says that Osun,
who is an orisha of the Yoruba people,

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:45.855
typically associated with water,

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.505
purity, fertility, love
and, most importantly, sensuality,

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.648
represents a female-centered
life-transforming energy

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:58.593
that courses through and animates life.

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:01.252
She says that women
who typify the osun force

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:05.342
brandish their sexuality quite openly
and unselfconsciously.

00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:07.497
And she goes on to say ...

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.133
TKM: There you go,
you got that line this time.

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:13.005
"The flow need not result
in conception and birth

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.422
but doesn't tell the principle of pleasure
at the heart of copulation.

00:06:17.446 --> 00:06:20.763
This pleasure principle
at the heart of the creative energy

00:06:20.787 --> 00:06:23.890
is metaphorically known as 'osun honey'."

00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:25.883
Sorry, I did not want to misquote that.

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:28.398
So now, osun honey and osunality

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:32.356
re-affirm the normality
of sexual pleasure and the erotic.

00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:37.775
Osun, like other female
deities of fertility across Africa,

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:42.347
made sure and emphasized
the importance of female sexuality

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:45.156
without negating male sexuality.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.069
We had the Tonga, the Bemba, the Sande

00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:51.093
and other similar
sexuality schools of thought

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:55.132
that taught young women
about the power of this inner force.

00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:56.927
TKM: So within the African continent,

00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:00.441
there's a great deal of talk
about the synergic nature of sex

00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:02.958
and how it comes together
as a social good.

00:07:02.982 --> 00:07:05.037
For example, within Rwanda,

00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.938
there is the notion
that the rivers are replenished

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:10.343
by the act of a woman squirting.

00:07:10.724 --> 00:07:12.053
(Laughter)

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:16.847
SK: But modern-day ideas of sex
have become some sort of battle

00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:19.863
in which we are all trying
to subvert each other.

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:24.997
TKM: We are pounding the pussy,
using sex as a weapon,

00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:27.195
playing hard to get, conquering --

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:30.006
a constant power struggle.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.839
SK: And there is always a loser
when it comes to this war.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.108
TKM: So now the ability to openly brandish
and explore your sexuality and your sex

00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:42.264
without it being a threat to others

00:07:42.288 --> 00:07:46.212
is at the core of engaging
with healthy sexual practices.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:51.022
SK: Now this is where it begins
to get really, really good.

00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:52.998
TKM: So what does it mean

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:57.945
to reconceptualize sex away from this idea
of the monster hiding in the night?

00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:00.411
What is the potential for doing greatness

00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:04.108
on the kitchen counter, a secluded beach,
the backseat of a car

00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:06.306
or even simply in between the sheets?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.409
Now in learning from the past
and sliding into the present,

00:08:10.433 --> 00:08:12.528
a radical theory of sex

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:17.752
must identify, it must describe,
explain and denounce

00:08:17.776 --> 00:08:20.561
sexual oppression and erotic injustice.

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:22.712
TKM: And sex positivity
is one of the realms

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:25.467
in which the new
can be unpacked and explored.

00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.181
SK: We're asking you
to call upon the osun honey

00:08:28.205 --> 00:08:32.188
to engage with new ideas
of sex and pleasure

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:35.529
so that we can start
to build a new identity

00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:37.617
that feels more like a fitted dress

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:42.649
and less like a wooden coffin
slowly choking the life out of us.

00:08:42.673 --> 00:08:46.339
Now there are a lot of people
charting their own sexual paths.

00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:48.241
But, because as HOLAAfrica --

00:08:48.265 --> 00:08:50.974
SK: We do sex and sexuality online --

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:54.751
TKM: We would be foolhardy
not to mention the digital realm.

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:59.569
There are women who are online,
creating incredible conversations,

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:02.260
chatting about the clitoris,

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:05.196
chatting about the reverse cowgirl
and also cunnilingus.

00:09:05.553 --> 00:09:07.196
SK: I like the word "cunnilingus."

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.315
TKM: I bet you do.
But that's not the point.

00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:13.498
Anyway, these women
are resurrecting the work of ancestors

00:09:13.522 --> 00:09:15.863
to have some incredible conversations

00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:18.728
that have been previously
buried and sealed.

00:09:18.752 --> 00:09:23.019
SK: They are asking the questions
that we are so afraid to ask,

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:25.704
so that we don't end up
in sticky situations.

00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:26.879
TKM: That's true.

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:30.783
And another space that we've been seeing
the charting of a new sexual path

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:34.007
is by queer women
and their engagement in kink.

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.876
SK: Now, think "Fifty Shades of Grey"

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.561
without the creepy rich guy
who does not understand consent.

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:43.974
(Laughter)

00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:48.271
TKM: So one fascinating subset of kink
is actually rope play.

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:52.958
SK: Shibari, also known as Kinbaku,
is the Japanese art of rope play.

00:09:52.982 --> 00:09:57.743
Originally used as a means
of restraining captives,

00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:00.721
it became sexualized
and spreading across the globe

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:05.052
as a kinky form of restraint
with a respected and erotic aesthetic.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.398
TKM: And it landed on our shores.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.354
Who would have thought that African
queer women would be kinksters?

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:16.807
Coming from a history of sexual violence,
slavery and a lack of bodily autonomy.

00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.474
Is it not too soon, you ask.

00:10:18.498 --> 00:10:19.648
SK: No, it's not,

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:22.998
and these women have taught us
that despite the dark history

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.244
that covers the body of women
from our beautiful continent,

00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:29.618
these women are actively
and beautifully constructing

00:10:29.642 --> 00:10:32.133
what sex and pleasure means to them.

00:10:32.157 --> 00:10:37.561
TKM: This is not to say that everyone
now needs to rush out and engage in kink.

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:40.593
But if these queer women
can come out of a history

00:10:40.617 --> 00:10:44.680
of, again, sexual violence,
slavery, colonization

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:48.815
and all manner of traditional,
religious and cultural pitfalls,

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:52.426
to reconceptualize what sex
and pleasure means to them,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.625
then you can do it, too.

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:56.353
SK: You can do it too, boo-boo.

00:10:56.377 --> 00:10:57.534
Yes, you can.

00:10:57.558 --> 00:10:58.720
(Laughter)

00:10:58.744 --> 00:11:02.058
TKM: It is in taking the ideas
that we have about sex -- the bad ones,

00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:03.426
and head-butting them,

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.720
holding on to the good ones
and creating new ones

00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:09.377
that we can have an incredible engagement

00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:13.601
with one of the most prolific
and natural human acts ever.

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:16.966
SK: It's about figuring out
what counts as a system bug.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.734
TKM: What to term a classic.

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:20.910
SK: And what new features we should add.

00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:24.384
Human beings are infamous
for their superpower to upgrade.

00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:26.741
This should count for our sex, too.

00:11:27.448 --> 00:11:28.614
TKM: Thank you.

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:36.048
(Applause)
