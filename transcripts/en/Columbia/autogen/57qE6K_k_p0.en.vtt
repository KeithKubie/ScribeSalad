good afternoon everybody so last time

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240
good afternoon everybody so last time
 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.830
good afternoon everybody so last time
last time I asked who had been immunized

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840
last time I asked who had been immunized
 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.120
last time I asked who had been immunized
so does anyone know if they've taken

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
so does anyone know if they've taken
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.990
so does anyone know if they've taken
antivirals Tamiflu acyclovir see much

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
antivirals Tamiflu acyclovir see much
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.269
antivirals Tamiflu acyclovir see much
fewer people then immunized which is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
fewer people then immunized which is
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.439
fewer people then immunized which is
good that's the way it should be you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
good that's the way it should be you
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900
good that's the way it should be you
should only take an antiviral if you're

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
should only take an antiviral if you're
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.310
should only take an antiviral if you're
infected and you haven't had a vaccine

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
infected and you haven't had a vaccine
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959
infected and you haven't had a vaccine
so that's all we're going to talk about

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
so that's all we're going to talk about
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.380
so that's all we're going to talk about
today antivirals and as we said last

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
today antivirals and as we said last
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.330
today antivirals and as we said last
time vaccines have been pretty

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
time vaccines have been pretty
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.270
time vaccines have been pretty
successful in preventing viral diseases

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280
successful in preventing viral diseases
 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.549
successful in preventing viral diseases
but if you're already infected they

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
but if you're already infected they
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410
but if you're already infected they
usually don't have much of an in fact of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
usually don't have much of an in fact of
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.700
usually don't have much of an in fact of
an effect right

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
an effect right
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.610
an effect right
what is the one exception you can be

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
what is the one exception you can be
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.490
what is the one exception you can be
infected and still be immunized

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500
infected and still be immunized
 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.340
infected and still be immunized
vaccinated did somebody say rabies yes

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
vaccinated did somebody say rabies yes
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130
vaccinated did somebody say rabies yes
yes because the incubation time is so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
yes because the incubation time is so
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200
yes because the incubation time is so
long for rabies that even after you're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
long for rabies that even after you're
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840
long for rabies that even after you're
bitten there is time to get the vaccine

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
bitten there is time to get the vaccine
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760
bitten there is time to get the vaccine
and to develop immunity that will

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
and to develop immunity that will
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.090
and to develop immunity that will
protect you from dying because rabies is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
protect you from dying because rabies is
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.510
protect you from dying because rabies is
about a hundred percent fatal because

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
about a hundred percent fatal because
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219
about a hundred percent fatal because
the virus takes a long time to travel up

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
the virus takes a long time to travel up
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.609
the virus takes a long time to travel up
nerves but for all the other cases when

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
nerves but for all the other cases when
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.109
nerves but for all the other cases when
you're already infected you need an

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
you're already infected you need an
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.200
you're already infected you need an
antiviral so that's what we're gonna

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
antiviral so that's what we're gonna
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880
antiviral so that's what we're gonna
talk about today that's our second

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
talk about today that's our second
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700
talk about today that's our second
arsenal antiviral drugs they can stop an

arsenal antiviral drugs they can stop an
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.270
arsenal antiviral drugs they can stop an
infection once it has started now we've

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
infection once it has started now we've
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580
infection once it has started now we've
been working on antivirals for about 50

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
been working on antivirals for about 50
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.090
been working on antivirals for about 50

the talk today we're going to explore
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590
the talk today we're going to explore
why that's so and most of these are

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
why that's so and most of these are
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.740
why that's so and most of these are
against HIV and herpes viruses these of

be chronic infections they go on for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
be chronic infections they go on for
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609
be chronic infections they go on for
long periods of time so you can diagnose

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
long periods of time so you can diagnose
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.090
long periods of time so you can diagnose
them and treat as opposed to an acute

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
them and treat as opposed to an acute
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.630
them and treat as opposed to an acute
infection which is over in a few days so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
infection which is over in a few days so
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.650
infection which is over in a few days so
here are some examples of the some of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
here are some examples of the some of
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720
here are some examples of the some of
the antivirals we have not all of them

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
the antivirals we have not all of them
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580
the antivirals we have not all of them
these are some target

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
these are some target
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.979
these are some target
here you can see there are targets that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
here you can see there are targets that
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.830
here you can see there are targets that
many of the steps of the replication

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
many of the steps of the replication
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.770
many of the steps of the replication
cycle uncoding replication preliminary

release so we'll talk about some of

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
release so we'll talk about some of
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.610
release so we'll talk about some of
these in some detail today and you can

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
these in some detail today and you can
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.339
these in some detail today and you can
see mostly HIV herpes viruses influenza

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349
see mostly HIV herpes viruses influenza
 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.160
see mostly HIV herpes viruses influenza
we have three antivirals against flu and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
we have three antivirals against flu and
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.740
we have three antivirals against flu and
coming up now are a number of hepatitis

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
coming up now are a number of hepatitis
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.979
coming up now are a number of hepatitis
C virus antivirals brand new ones just

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989
C virus antivirals brand new ones just
 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.920
C virus antivirals brand new ones just
in clinical trials about to be used

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
in clinical trials about to be used
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.949
in clinical trials about to be used
we'll talk about those as well so why

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959
we'll talk about those as well so why
 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.800
we'll talk about those as well so why
are there sooo so few antiviral drugs

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
are there sooo so few antiviral drugs
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.650
are there sooo so few antiviral drugs
one of the reasons is that you know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
one of the reasons is that you know
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.830
one of the reasons is that you know
viruses are obligate parasites of the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
viruses are obligate parasites of the
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920
viruses are obligate parasites of the
cell so compound that interferes with

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
cell so compound that interferes with
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.960
cell so compound that interferes with
the growth of a virus may affect the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
the growth of a virus may affect the
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.300
the growth of a virus may affect the
cell so you can have the right effects

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
cell so you can have the right effects
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.520
cell so you can have the right effects
often and we don't want to have a lot of

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
often and we don't want to have a lot of
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.050
often and we don't want to have a lot of
side effects obviously we want to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
side effects obviously we want to
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.610
side effects obviously we want to
minimize them and know antiviral is

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
minimize them and know antiviral is
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.030
minimize them and know antiviral is
without side effects though so if you

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
without side effects though so if you
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.210
without side effects though so if you
can find a specific virus function that

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
can find a specific virus function that
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.099
can find a specific virus function that
doesn't exist in the cell that's a good

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109
doesn't exist in the cell that's a good
 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:25.610
doesn't exist in the cell that's a good
target

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620
target
 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.370
target
but there often is an overlap just a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
but there often is an overlap just a
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.410
but there often is an overlap just a
random overlap with a cellular function

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420
random overlap with a cellular function
 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910
random overlap with a cellular function
so you have side effects so that's one

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
so you have side effects so that's one
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.800
so you have side effects so that's one
reason most of the compounds that are

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810
reason most of the compounds that are
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.690
reason most of the compounds that are
effective at inhibiting virus

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
effective at inhibiting virus
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.800
effective at inhibiting virus
replication are toxic the other reason

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
replication are toxic the other reason
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.860
replication are toxic the other reason
is many of the important viruses are

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
is many of the important viruses are
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.280
is many of the important viruses are
either very dangerous or we can't grow

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
either very dangerous or we can't grow
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.270
either very dangerous or we can't grow
them or we can't test them in animals so

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
them or we can't test them in animals so
 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.240
them or we can't test them in animals so
for example HBV no one still no one can

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
for example HBV no one still no one can
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.580
for example HBV no one still no one can
grow hepatitis B virus in a laboratory

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
grow hepatitis B virus in a laboratory
 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.949
grow hepatitis B virus in a laboratory
human papilloma viruses now can be

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
human papilloma viruses now can be
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.379
human papilloma viruses now can be
propagated it's not easy though rather

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389
propagated it's not easy though rather
 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.170
propagated it's not easy though rather
difficult system for many diseases there

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
difficult system for many diseases there
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.979
difficult system for many diseases there
are no animal models HIV smallpox

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
are no animal models HIV smallpox
 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.129
are no animal models HIV smallpox
measles and these viruses are very

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139
measles and these viruses are very
 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.039
measles and these viruses are very
dangerous to work with Ebola lass

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
dangerous to work with Ebola lass
 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.040
dangerous to work with Ebola lass
smallpox yes

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050
 
 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.350
 
why can't you grow it I don't know if we

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360
why can't you grow it I don't know if we
 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.620
why can't you grow it I don't know if we
knew we would grow it right people have

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630
knew we would grow it right people have
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.450
knew we would grow it right people have
been struggling for years for Hep C for

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940
example from its discovery in the 80s
 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.720
example from its discovery in the 80s
no one could grow it and then so maybe

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730
no one could grow it and then so maybe
 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.850
no one could grow it and then so maybe
people made full-length DNA clones of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
people made full-length DNA clones of
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.740
people made full-length DNA clones of
the RNA genome they put those in cells

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750
the RNA genome they put those in cells
 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.540
the RNA genome they put those in cells
couldn't get it to grow and then the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550
couldn't get it to grow and then the
 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.640
couldn't get it to grow and then the
Japanese investigator found a different

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650
Japanese investigator found a different
 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.580
Japanese investigator found a different
sera type and that grew so it was just a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
sera type and that grew so it was just a
 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.320
sera type and that grew so it was just a
different sequence was able to grow so

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330
different sequence was able to grow so
 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.820
different sequence was able to grow so
now everyone is working with that sera

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
now everyone is working with that sera
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.600
now everyone is working with that sera
type now with h HPV required a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610
type now with h HPV required a
 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.430
type now with h HPV required a
specialized cell culture system which

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440
specialized cell culture system which
 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590
specialized cell culture system which
was then developed and you can now grow

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600
was then developed and you can now grow
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.970
was then developed and you can now grow
those but HBV still no one can grow and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980
those but HBV still no one can grow and
 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.710
those but HBV still no one can grow and
we don't know why we don't know what the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720
we don't know why we don't know what the
 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.710
we don't know why we don't know what the
block is so that makes it hard but with

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720
block is so that makes it hard but with
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.430
block is so that makes it hard but with
recombinant DNA the ability to express a

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440
recombinant DNA the ability to express a
 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.260
recombinant DNA the ability to express a
single protein and look for inhibitors

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270
single protein and look for inhibitors
 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.790
single protein and look for inhibitors
of its function you can still develop

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
of its function you can still develop
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.130
of its function you can still develop
antivirals but they're hard to test if

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140
antivirals but they're hard to test if
 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.930
antivirals but they're hard to test if
you can't grow the virus in cell culture

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940
you can't grow the virus in cell culture
 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.360
you can't grow the virus in cell culture
the first test is you're gonna see to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370
the first test is you're gonna see to
 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.220
the first test is you're gonna see to
see if your compound inhibits growth in

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230
see if your compound inhibits growth in
 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.140
see if your compound inhibits growth in
cell culture so that you have to bypass

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150
cell culture so that you have to bypass
 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.790
cell culture so that you have to bypass
that it's very difficult third reason is

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800
that it's very difficult third reason is
 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.810
that it's very difficult third reason is
that any antiviral really must block

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820
that any antiviral really must block
 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.660
that any antiviral really must block
viral replication completely so we say

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670
viral replication completely so we say
 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.420
viral replication completely so we say
it has to be potent you can't have any

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430
it has to be potent you can't have any
 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.240
it has to be potent you can't have any
room here for replication now many of

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250
room here for replication now many of
 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.640
room here for replication now many of
the standard drugs that we take not for

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650
the standard drugs that we take not for
 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.980
the standard drugs that we take not for
viruses or not bet not antibiotics but

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990
viruses or not bet not antibiotics but
 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.970
viruses or not bet not antibiotics but
just drugs to treat various things they

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980
just drugs to treat various things they
 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.550
just drugs to treat various things they
work even if they partially block enzyme

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560
work even if they partially block enzyme
 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.810
work even if they partially block enzyme
activity okay but for an antiviral drug

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820
activity okay but for an antiviral drug
 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.420
activity okay but for an antiviral drug
you can't have partial inhibition

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430
you can't have partial inhibition
 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.550
you can't have partial inhibition
because you will get resistance if you

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
because you will get resistance if you
 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.800
because you will get resistance if you
do that so these are very different from

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810
do that so these are very different from
 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.140
do that so these are very different from
most pharmaceuticals in that you require

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150
most pharmaceuticals in that you require
 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.420
most pharmaceuticals in that you require
a complete inhibition of virus

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430
a complete inhibition of virus
 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.080
a complete inhibition of virus
replication so they have to be safe then

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090
replication so they have to be safe then
 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.520
replication so they have to be safe then
you can't have side effects and they

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530
you can't have side effects and they
 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.280
you can't have side effects and they
must be potent so that's a difficult

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290
must be potent so that's a difficult
 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.900
must be potent so that's a difficult
combination and that's one of the

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910
combination and that's one of the
 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.210
combination and that's one of the
reasons why we have so few to achieve

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220
reasons why we have so few to achieve
 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.710
reasons why we have so few to achieve
both you have to do a lot of searching

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720
both you have to do a lot of searching
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.160
both you have to do a lot of searching
and chemistry and testing and it takes a

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170
and chemistry and testing and it takes a
 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.150
and chemistry and testing and it takes a
lot of time and it's expensive and as I

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160
lot of time and it's expensive and as I
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.130
lot of time and it's expensive and as I
said if a drug doesn't block replication

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140
said if a drug doesn't block replication
 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.770
said if a drug doesn't block replication
completely we will get virus mutants

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780
completely we will get virus mutants
 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.350
completely we will get virus mutants
in fact this is the perfect way to get

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360
in fact this is the perfect way to get
 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.210
in fact this is the perfect way to get
drug-resistant mutants is to have virus

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220
drug-resistant mutants is to have virus
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.740
drug-resistant mutants is to have virus
replication in the presence of an

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750
replication in the presence of an
 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.780
replication in the presence of an
inhibitor even low levels of replication

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790
inhibitor even low levels of replication
 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.270
inhibitor even low levels of replication
because you will get viral mutants and

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280
because you will get viral mutants and
 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.560
because you will get viral mutants and
among those will be some that are

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570
among those will be some that are
 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.480
among those will be some that are
resistant and they will grow and they

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490
resistant and they will grow and they
 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.150
resistant and they will grow and they
will dominate the culture if you'd have

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160
will dominate the culture if you'd have
 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.460
will dominate the culture if you'd have
any replication you can't get resistant

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470
any replication you can't get resistant
 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.750
any replication you can't get resistant
mutants because there's no replication

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760
mutants because there's no replication
 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.090
mutants because there's no replication
at all so you can have no selection so

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100
at all so you can have no selection so
 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.990
at all so you can have no selection so
this is a theoretical graph that just

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000
this is a theoretical graph that just
 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.360
this is a theoretical graph that just
illustrates this idea we have viral load

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370
illustrates this idea we have viral load
 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.620
illustrates this idea we have viral load
here on the y axis with time so we have

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630
here on the y axis with time so we have
 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.570
here on the y axis with time so we have
a virus infection and we're looking at

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580
a virus infection and we're looking at
 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.060
a virus infection and we're looking at
the amount of virus we give a drug at a

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070
the amount of virus we give a drug at a
 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.700
the amount of virus we give a drug at a
certain time so in this system we start

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710
certain time so in this system we start
 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.980
certain time so in this system we start
out with high virus levels we give drug

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
out with high virus levels we give drug
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.320
out with high virus levels we give drug
and we wait and we measure virus over

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330
and we wait and we measure virus over
 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.480
and we wait and we measure virus over
time and the optimal dose of drug

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490
time and the optimal dose of drug
 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.580
time and the optimal dose of drug
inhibits virus replication so there's no

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590
inhibits virus replication so there's no
 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.890
inhibits virus replication so there's no
more maintenance of virus right here

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900
more maintenance of virus right here
 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.740
more maintenance of virus right here
optimal dose now load those slightly

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750
optimal dose now load those slightly
 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.780
optimal dose now load those slightly
inhibits but eventually the virus

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790
inhibits but eventually the virus
 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.670
inhibits but eventually the virus
rebounds because the resistant mutants

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680
rebounds because the resistant mutants
 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.990
rebounds because the resistant mutants
emerge same with even an intermediate

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000
emerge same with even an intermediate
 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.200
emerge same with even an intermediate
dose alright so again you can't have

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210
dose alright so again you can't have
 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.330
dose alright so again you can't have
this middle-of-the-road inhibition you

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.340
this middle-of-the-road inhibition you
 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.700
this middle-of-the-road inhibition you
have to completely inhibit and again

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
have to completely inhibit and again
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.110
have to completely inhibit and again
that's different from a lot of other

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
that's different from a lot of other
 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.690
that's different from a lot of other
targets for it for drugs that we take

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700
targets for it for drugs that we take
 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.870
targets for it for drugs that we take
non viral inhibitors but you don't have

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880
non viral inhibitors but you don't have
 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.719
non viral inhibitors but you don't have
to have complete inhibition to have a

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:50.729
to have complete inhibition to have a
 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:08:03.740
to have complete inhibition to have a
therapeutic effect yes

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750
 
 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.950
 
right so when viruses replicate they

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960
right so when viruses replicate they
 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.220
right so when viruses replicate they
make mutants always and so if you allow

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.230
make mutants always and so if you allow
 

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.750
make mutants always and so if you allow
little viral replications in the

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:11.760
little viral replications in the
 

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.000
little viral replications in the
presence of a drug among the mutants of

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.010
presence of a drug among the mutants of
 

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.470
presence of a drug among the mutants of
the mate or are going to be some that

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:15.480
the mate or are going to be some that
 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.600
the mate or are going to be some that
are resistant to the drug and then those

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:17.610
are resistant to the drug and then those
 

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.390
are resistant to the drug and then those
will replicate and take over right so

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400
will replicate and take over right so
 

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.600
will replicate and take over right so
you want no replication zero all right

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:26.610
you want no replication zero all right
 

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.540
you want no replication zero all right
so the problem of acute infections that

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.550
so the problem of acute infections that
 

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.750
so the problem of acute infections that
most most virus infections are too short

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:31.760
most most virus infections are too short
 

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.450
most most virus infections are too short
by the time you feel ill like in a

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:35.460
by the time you feel ill like in a
 

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.120
by the time you feel ill like in a
common cold it's too late to have an

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.130
common cold it's too late to have an
 

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.990
common cold it's too late to have an
impact on the progress of the disease

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.000
impact on the progress of the disease
 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.870
impact on the progress of the disease
okay so you have to give antivirals for

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880
okay so you have to give antivirals for
 

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.260
okay so you have to give antivirals for
these kinds of infections very early and

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:47.270
these kinds of infections very early and
 

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.850
these kinds of infections very early and
influenza is a good example you have to

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860
influenza is a good example you have to
 

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.730
influenza is a good example you have to
take an antiviral for flu within 48

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740
take an antiviral for flu within 48
 

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.770
take an antiviral for flu within 48
hours of feeling your first symptoms

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:54.780
hours of feeling your first symptoms
 

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.300
hours of feeling your first symptoms
otherwise it's not going to really

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.310
otherwise it's not going to really
 

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.500
otherwise it's not going to really
affect the course of infection now an

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:00.510
affect the course of infection now an
 

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.660
affect the course of infection now an
alternative is to give drug to everybody

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:02.670
alternative is to give drug to everybody
 

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.030
alternative is to give drug to everybody
all the time right it's not a good idea

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040
all the time right it's not a good idea
 

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.180
all the time right it's not a good idea
what why isn't that a good idea yeah

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.190
what why isn't that a good idea yeah
 

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.950
what why isn't that a good idea yeah
then if there's a little bit of virus

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:12.960
then if there's a little bit of virus
 

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.940
then if there's a little bit of virus
around you're going to select for

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:13.950
around you're going to select for
 

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.490
around you're going to select for
mutants and that's really bad plus you

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500
mutants and that's really bad plus you
 

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.720
mutants and that's really bad plus you
don't want to give people drugs if

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:17.730
don't want to give people drugs if
 

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.790
don't want to give people drugs if
they're healthy in general right because

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
they're healthy in general right because
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.020
they're healthy in general right because
they can't have side effects and the

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.030
they can't have side effects and the
 

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.520
they can't have side effects and the
more people you give a drug the more

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:22.530
more people you give a drug the more
 

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.079
more people you give a drug the more
likely you're going to see a side effect

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:24.089
likely you're going to see a side effect
 

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:25.700
likely you're going to see a side effect
so you don't want to give drugs to

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:25.710
so you don't want to give drugs to
 

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.470
so you don't want to give drugs to
healthy people if we had broad-spectrum

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480
healthy people if we had broad-spectrum
 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.990
healthy people if we had broad-spectrum
antivirals this problem might be solved

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000
antivirals this problem might be solved
 

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.940
antivirals this problem might be solved
because as soon as you feel ill you take

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:34.950
because as soon as you feel ill you take
 

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.320
because as soon as you feel ill you take
the broad spectrum you don't have to

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.330
the broad spectrum you don't have to
 

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.120
the broad spectrum you don't have to
diagnose what virus it is and get a

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.130
diagnose what virus it is and get a
 

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.790
diagnose what virus it is and get a
virus specific antiviral right but we

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800
virus specific antiviral right but we
 

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.550
virus specific antiviral right but we
don't have any such things there's one

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560
don't have any such things there's one
 

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.190
don't have any such things there's one
hint of a broad spectrum against

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200
hint of a broad spectrum against
 

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.470
hint of a broad spectrum against
envelope viruses but that's far from

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480
envelope viruses but that's far from
 

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.530
envelope viruses but that's far from
being developed so right now we have

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:50.540
being developed so right now we have
 

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.490
being developed so right now we have
antivirals that are really specific for

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500
antivirals that are really specific for
 

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.020
antivirals that are really specific for
each virus so you have to know what you

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.030
each virus so you have to know what you
 

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.740
each virus so you have to know what you
have before you can be treated and it

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.750
have before you can be treated and it
 

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.440
have before you can be treated and it
takes time to identify the virus so you

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.450
takes time to identify the virus so you
 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.690
takes time to identify the virus so you
feel ill maybe you wait a day until you

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700
feel ill maybe you wait a day until you
 

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.210
feel ill maybe you wait a day until you
feel worse right and then you may go to

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220
feel worse right and then you may go to
 

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.280
feel worse right and then you may go to
a physician most of us don't and then

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.290
a physician most of us don't and then
 

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.630
a physician most of us don't and then
you have to get a prescription then you

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640
you have to get a prescription then you
 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.460
you have to get a prescription then you
have to go to a drugstore and get it and

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.470
have to go to a drugstore and get it and
 

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.949
have to go to a drugstore and get it and
this by the time you do all that unless

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959
this by the time you do all that unless
 

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:16.390
this by the time you do all that unless
you're very efficient some people are

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:16.400
you're very efficient some people are
 

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.910
you're very efficient some people are
if your it's gonna be too late so this

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920
if your it's gonna be too late so this
 

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.880
if your it's gonna be too late so this
there has to be some intervention here

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:21.890
there has to be some intervention here
 

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.030
there has to be some intervention here
and really the key which I have

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040
and really the key which I have
 

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.530
and really the key which I have
mentioned before is the lack of rapid

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:26.540
mentioned before is the lack of rapid
 

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.470
mentioned before is the lack of rapid
diagnostic reagents we could make

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480
diagnostic reagents we could make
 

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.630
diagnostic reagents we could make
antivirals basically for any virus

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640
antivirals basically for any virus
 

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.270
antivirals basically for any virus
that's around but if you can't use them

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:34.280
that's around but if you can't use them
 

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.610
that's around but if you can't use them
because of these acute issues then

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:36.620
because of these acute issues then
 

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.140
because of these acute issues then
they're not going to be made and

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.150
they're not going to be made and
 

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.180
they're not going to be made and
companies won't invest the money in them

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:40.190
companies won't invest the money in them
 

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.700
companies won't invest the money in them
until we get rapid Diagnostics so one

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:42.710
until we get rapid Diagnostics so one
 

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.470
until we get rapid Diagnostics so one
day we will have a rapid diagnostic

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480
day we will have a rapid diagnostic
 

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.240
day we will have a rapid diagnostic
that's very accurate right now we have

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.250
that's very accurate right now we have
 

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.550
that's very accurate right now we have
some rapid ones for flu but they're 50

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560
some rapid ones for flu but they're 50
 

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.890
some rapid ones for flu but they're 50
percent wrong half the time they're

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:50.900
percent wrong half the time they're
 

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.230
percent wrong half the time they're
wrong so might as well just take the

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240
wrong so might as well just take the
 

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.870
wrong so might as well just take the
antiviral when you feel bad with flu and

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880
antiviral when you feel bad with flu and
 

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.180
antiviral when you feel bad with flu and
as I said before that's the strategy

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.190
as I said before that's the strategy
 

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.010
as I said before that's the strategy
that's taken but someday we'll have

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.020
that's taken but someday we'll have
 

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.430
that's taken but someday we'll have
better ones and then you will see many

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440
better ones and then you will see many
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.940
better ones and then you will see many
more antivirals against acute infections

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:05.950
more antivirals against acute infections
 

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.680
more antivirals against acute infections
so let's go and look back at the history

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:08.690
so let's go and look back at the history
 

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.030
so let's go and look back at the history
of antiviral drugs

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040
of antiviral drugs
 

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.790
of antiviral drugs
the first searches really began in the

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800
the first searches really began in the
 

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.880
the first searches really began in the
early 50s by this time there were

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:15.890
early 50s by this time there were
 

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.400
early 50s by this time there were
already a number of antibiotics used for

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:18.410
already a number of antibiotics used for
 

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.920
already a number of antibiotics used for
bacteria so people thought well we have

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:20.930
bacteria so people thought well we have
 

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.260
bacteria so people thought well we have
these drugs that block bacterial

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.270
these drugs that block bacterial
 

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.030
these drugs that block bacterial
infections we should be able to do the

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040
infections we should be able to do the
 

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.790
infections we should be able to do the
same thing for viruses and some of the

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800
same thing for viruses and some of the
 

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.460
same thing for viruses and some of the
early antibiotics were sulfonamide so

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:30.470
early antibiotics were sulfonamide so
 

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.520
early antibiotics were sulfonamide so
chemists began to modify these and check

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:33.530
chemists began to modify these and check
 

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.230
chemists began to modify these and check
the derivatives to see if they would

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240
the derivatives to see if they would
 

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.830
the derivatives to see if they would
inhibit viruses then parks viruses were

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:38.840
inhibit viruses then parks viruses were
 

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.010
inhibit viruses then parks viruses were
large targets back then because after

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.020
large targets back then because after
 

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.660
large targets back then because after
we're still after World War two smallpox

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:43.670
we're still after World War two smallpox
 

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.580
we're still after World War two smallpox
was a big problem in fact as recently as

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:45.590
was a big problem in fact as recently as
 

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.090
was a big problem in fact as recently as
1967 millions of people died of smallpox

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100
1967 millions of people died of smallpox
 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.350
1967 millions of people died of smallpox
globally so there was still a need for

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360
globally so there was still a need for
 

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.880
globally so there was still a need for
antivirals against smallpox and these

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:54.890
antivirals against smallpox and these
 

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.980
antivirals against smallpox and these
are the thio semi karbas ohms which are

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:56.990
are the thio semi karbas ohms which are
 

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.250
are the thio semi karbas ohms which are
found to be active in the 60s and 70s

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.260
found to be active in the 60s and 70s
 

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.950
found to be active in the 60s and 70s
this got momentum this whole idea of

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:02.960
this got momentum this whole idea of
 

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.560
this got momentum this whole idea of
looking for antiviral drugs they drug

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:05.570
looking for antiviral drugs they drug
 

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.240
looking for antiviral drugs they drug
companies launched what we call blind

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.250
companies launched what we call blind
 

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.450
companies launched what we call blind
screening programs to find chemicals

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:10.460
screening programs to find chemicals
 

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.550
screening programs to find chemicals

the chemists so the cameras to identify
 

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.519
the chemists so the cameras to identify
what the compounds are and then they

what the compounds are and then they
 

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:50.650
what the compounds are and then they
modify them to reduce toxicity to make

them more soluble make them bioavailable
 

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.639
them more soluble make them bioavailable
so that when you take them they they go

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:54.649
so that when you take them they they go
 

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:56.920
so that when you take them they they go
where they're supposed to and also to

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:56.930
where they're supposed to and also to
 

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.530
where they're supposed to and also to
improve their pharmacokinetic properties

00:13:59.530 --> 00:13:59.540
improve their pharmacokinetic properties
 

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.759
improve their pharmacokinetic properties
you want them to last as long as

between doses so you can make chemical

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800
between doses so you can make chemical
 

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.800

thousands of molecules before you even
 

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.100
thousands of molecules before you even
test something in humans so you start

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.110
test something in humans so you start

but in some cases there is
 

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.460
but in some cases there is
susceptibility so it's still useful

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:52.470
susceptibility so it's still useful

and try and design inhibitors as you've

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.110
and try and design inhibitors as you've
 

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.600

learned from this course we know all the

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.610
learned from this course we know all the
 

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.300
learned from this course we know all the
life cycles pretty well so we can we can

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.310
life cycles pretty well so we can we can
 

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.280
life cycles pretty well so we can we can
isolate a specific phase of the life

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:01.290
isolate a specific phase of the life
 

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.600
isolate a specific phase of the life
cycle and say we want to make an

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.610
cycle and say we want to make an
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.580

and typically what's done nowadays is to
 

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.480
and typically what's done nowadays is to
delete the gene from the virus and show

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.490
delete the gene from the virus and show
 

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.400
delete the gene from the virus and show
that the virus doesn't replicate because

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:32.780
and three trials in humans and
 

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.300
and three trials in humans and
eventually if everything works out you

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.310
eventually if everything works out you
 

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.240
eventually if everything works out you
can get it approved by the FDA but you

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.250
can get it approved by the FDA but you
 

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.860
can get it approved by the FDA but you
cannot take dozens and dozens of

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:38.870
cannot take dozens and dozens of
 

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.960
cannot take dozens and dozens of
candidates down this route this is very

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:40.970
candidates down this route this is very
 

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.670
candidates down this route this is very
expensive so you have to make decisions

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:42.680
expensive so you have to make decisions
 

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.250
expensive so you have to make decisions
about which ones to go with and which

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.260
about which ones to go with and which
 

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.390
about which ones to go with and which
ones to cancel very tough things so this

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400
ones to cancel very tough things so this
 

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.040
ones to cancel very tough things so this
process that we've talked about doesn't

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.050
process that we've talked about doesn't
 

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.860
process that we've talked about doesn't
actually find drugs a drug is a compound

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:53.870
actually find drugs a drug is a compound
 

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.620
actually find drugs a drug is a compound
that's licensed okay so the end result

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:56.630
that's licensed okay so the end result
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.860
that's licensed okay so the end result
in this pathway a drug is what happens

00:19:59.860 --> 00:19:59.870
in this pathway a drug is what happens
 

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.690
in this pathway a drug is what happens
after you do all of this so this path of

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:01.700
after you do all of this so this path of
 

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.760
after you do all of this so this path of
drug discovery doesn't find a drug until

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:03.770
drug discovery doesn't find a drug until
 

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.300
drug discovery doesn't find a drug until
the very end it get hits you get leads

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.310
the very end it get hits you get leads
 

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.830
the very end it get hits you get leads
and you have to find a drug in the end

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840
and you have to find a drug in the end
 

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.930
and you have to find a drug in the end
out of all of that some of the things

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940
out of all of that some of the things
 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.120
out of all of that some of the things
you need to answer in this process will

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.130
you need to answer in this process will
 

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.530
you need to answer in this process will
to get to the right place

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:14.540
to get to the right place
 

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.470
to get to the right place
bioavailability will it persist long

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480
bioavailability will it persist long
 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.860
bioavailability will it persist long
enough pharmacokinetics and will it be

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:20.870
enough pharmacokinetics and will it be
 

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.680
enough pharmacokinetics and will it be
safe toxicity and specificity so only

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.690
safe toxicity and specificity so only
 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.090
safe toxicity and specificity so only
until you've answered all the questions

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.100
until you've answered all the questions
 

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.220
until you've answered all the questions
do you have a drug that you can test in

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:27.230
do you have a drug that you can test in
 

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.330
do you have a drug that you can test in
people so we call this research and

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:31.340
people so we call this research and
 

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.970
people so we call this research and
development for a reason because you do

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:33.980
development for a reason because you do
 

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.370
development for a reason because you do
research to find a lead compound and

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.380
research to find a lead compound and
 

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.510
research to find a lead compound and
then you have to develop it further

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520
then you have to develop it further
 

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.480
then you have to develop it further
develop it so it's active potent not

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:40.490
develop it so it's active potent not
 

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.330
develop it so it's active potent not
toxic and so forth and all of this can

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:43.340
toxic and so forth and all of this can
 

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.680
toxic and so forth and all of this can
be one to two hundred million dollars

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:44.690
be one to two hundred million dollars
 

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.410
be one to two hundred million dollars
per drug that you're testing so that's

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:47.420
per drug that you're testing so that's
 

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.870
per drug that you're testing so that's
why you can't do ten drugs at a time so

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880
why you can't do ten drugs at a time so
 

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.340
why you can't do ten drugs at a time so
if you're the director of antiviral

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:51.350
if you're the director of antiviral
 

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.950
if you're the director of antiviral
research you have to make a decision at

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960
research you have to make a decision at
 

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.600
research you have to make a decision at
some point along that discovery process

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:55.610
some point along that discovery process
 

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.360
some point along that discovery process
a person who used to work in the

industry once told me those managers who

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.430
industry once told me those managers who
 

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.390
industry once told me those managers who
can't project usually lasted longer in

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400
can't project usually lasted longer in
 

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.670
can't project usually lasted longer in
the company than those who let projects

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:06.680
the company than those who let projects
 

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.920
the company than those who let projects
go on longer because you can't a project

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:08.930
go on longer because you can't a project
 

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.120
go on longer because you can't a project
you save money even if you don't get a

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.130
you save money even if you don't get a
 

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.430
you save money even if you don't get a
drug in the end you don't waste money

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440
drug in the end you don't waste money
 

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.070
drug in the end you don't waste money
it's a little bit ironic but that's the

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080
it's a little bit ironic but that's the
 

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.990
it's a little bit ironic but that's the
way it is

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000
way it is
 

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
way it is
so you go through thousands of leads in

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.010
so you go through thousands of leads in
 

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.530
so you go through thousands of leads in
the end you get one candidate for

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:20.540
the end you get one candidate for
 

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.400
the end you get one candidate for
further development and remember you

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:24.410
further development and remember you
 

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.860
further development and remember you
have to not only develop development is

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:26.870
have to not only develop development is
 

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.990
have to not only develop development is
all the steps in taking the lead

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000
all the steps in taking the lead
 

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.030
all the steps in taking the lead
compound through safety testing which is

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.040
compound through safety testing which is
 

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.920
compound through safety testing which is
where a lot of drugs fail scale-up of

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:32.930
where a lot of drugs fail scale-up of
 

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.080
where a lot of drugs fail scale-up of
synthesis so you could have a very nice

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.090
synthesis so you could have a very nice
 

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.970
synthesis so you could have a very nice
candidate which looks good in animals

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:36.980
candidate which looks good in animals
 

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.920
candidate which looks good in animals
then you go to scale it up and you can't

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:38.930
then you go to scale it up and you can't
 

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.890
then you go to scale it up and you can't
do the chemistry so it fails their

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:40.900
do the chemistry so it fails their
 

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.790

injection pharmacokinetic studies and
then of course clinical trial is the

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:48.560
then of course clinical trial is the
 

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.010
then of course clinical trial is the
true test whether it helps people and

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.020
true test whether it helps people and
 

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.690
true test whether it helps people and
whether it's not toxic in people these

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:52.700
whether it's not toxic in people these
 

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.760
whether it's not toxic in people these
are the most expensive of course because

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:54.770
are the most expensive of course because
 

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.230
are the most expensive of course because
they can involve hundreds and hundreds

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240
they can involve hundreds and hundreds
 

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.020
they can involve hundreds and hundreds
of people five to ten years typically

drug now for HIV this was fast-tracked

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.110
drug now for HIV this was fast-tracked
 

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.260
drug now for HIV this was fast-tracked
because it was an urgent medical need so

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.270
because it was an urgent medical need so
 

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.880
because it was an urgent medical need so
this was cut in half really and some

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:12.890
this was cut in half really and some
 

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.200
this was cut in half really and some
drugs were out there at a couple of

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.210
drugs were out there at a couple of
 

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.450
drugs were out there at a couple of
years but for most drugs it takes a long

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:16.460
years but for most drugs it takes a long
 

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.170
years but for most drugs it takes a long
time and a lot of money so here is the

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:20.180
time and a lot of money so here is the
 

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.590
time and a lot of money so here is the
ladder of drug discovery and we start

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600
ladder of drug discovery and we start
 

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.260
ladder of drug discovery and we start
with hundreds of thousands of compounds

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.270
with hundreds of thousands of compounds
 

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.780
with hundreds of thousands of compounds
in your library and you do some screens

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:28.790
in your library and you do some screens
 

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.150
in your library and you do some screens
and you reject the bunch because they

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.160
and you reject the bunch because they
 

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.040
and you reject the bunch because they
don't have any antiviral effect in cell

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.050
don't have any antiviral effect in cell
 

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.680
don't have any antiviral effect in cell
culture so the red is rejected and then

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:35.690
culture so the red is rejected and then
 

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.930
culture so the red is rejected and then
you reject more because they're toxic in

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:37.940
you reject more because they're toxic in
 

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.470
you reject more because they're toxic in
cells

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480
cells
 

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.570
cells
if the toxic in cells forget it you

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580
if the toxic in cells forget it you
 

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.850
if the toxic in cells forget it you
don't even go further than that then you

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:42.860
don't even go further than that then you
 

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.380
don't even go further than that then you
put them in animals see if they have an

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:44.390
put them in animals see if they have an
 

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.990
put them in animals see if they have an
antiviral effect and then bunch don't

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000
antiviral effect and then bunch don't
 

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.420
antiviral effect and then bunch don't
you reject those toxicity and animals

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:49.430
you reject those toxicity and animals
 

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.640
you reject those toxicity and animals
you reject those then you go into people

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.650
you reject those then you go into people
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.240
you reject those then you go into people
and you reject them if they don't have

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.250
and you reject them if they don't have
 

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.090
and you reject them if they don't have
antiviral effects but in fact here we're

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.100
antiviral effects but in fact here we're
 

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.580
antiviral effects but in fact here we're
not really testing ten compounds we're

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:00.590
not really testing ten compounds we're
 

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.040
not really testing ten compounds we're
testing one so it's either yes or no at

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.050
testing one so it's either yes or no at
 

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.990
testing one so it's either yes or no at
this point if it's if it has an

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000
this point if it's if it has an
 

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.420
this point if it's if it has an
antiviral effect and it's it doesn't

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.430
antiviral effect and it's it doesn't
 

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.010
antiviral effect and it's it doesn't
have toxicity in fact you would check

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:09.020
have toxicity in fact you would check
 

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.660
have toxicity in fact you would check
the toxicity first and then the

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:10.670
the toxicity first and then the
 

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.910
the toxicity first and then the
antiviral activity in humans and then at

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:12.920
antiviral activity in humans and then at
 

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.620
antiviral activity in humans and then at
the end you have one compound after five

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.630
the end you have one compound after five
 

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.780
the end you have one compound after five
or ten years so if you want to have a

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:16.790
or ten years so if you want to have a
 

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.210
or ten years so if you want to have a
career in drug companies this is what

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.220
career in drug companies this is what
 

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.220
career in drug companies this is what
you're looking at you can spend five and

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:21.230
you're looking at you can spend five and
 

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.810
you're looking at you can spend five and
ten years working on a project

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:22.820
ten years working on a project
 

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.700
ten years working on a project
can you imagine then the FDA doesn't

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:24.710
can you imagine then the FDA doesn't
 

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.340
can you imagine then the FDA doesn't
approve it what that would do to your

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:27.350
approve it what that would do to your
 

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.190
approve it what that would do to your
self-esteem so you go to an you go

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200
self-esteem so you go to an you go
 

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.870
self-esteem so you go to an you go
another company because you can't stand

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880
another company because you can't stand
 

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.760
another company because you can't stand
to see all the people you work with all

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:33.770
to see all the people you work with all
 

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.210
to see all the people you work with all
those years so what here are some

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:37.220
those years so what here are some
 

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.820
those years so what here are some
examples of screens that are done this

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:39.830
examples of screens that are done this
 

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.260
examples of screens that are done this
is a mechanism based screen we're

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:41.270
is a mechanism based screen we're
 

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.090
is a mechanism based screen we're
looking for an inhibitor of a viral

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100
looking for an inhibitor of a viral
 

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.430
looking for an inhibitor of a viral
protease so we know what the cleavage

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440
protease so we know what the cleavage
 

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.470
protease so we know what the cleavage
site is we know what the Proteas we have

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480
site is we know what the Proteas we have
 

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.690
site is we know what the Proteas we have
to all the research to identify that so

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:49.700
to all the research to identify that so
 

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.310
to all the research to identify that so
here's our protease we've clone it and

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320
here's our protease we've clone it and
 

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.860
here's our protease we've clone it and
we can express it in some kind of system

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:53.870
we can express it in some kind of system
 

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.680
we can express it in some kind of system
and we develop a assay that's really

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:56.690
and we develop a assay that's really
 

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.550
and we develop a assay that's really
quick and can be done on high scale we

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:00.560
quick and can be done on high scale we
 

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.760
quick and can be done on high scale we
have a bead attached to a short peptide

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:03.770
have a bead attached to a short peptide
 

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.530
have a bead attached to a short peptide
that contains the cleavage site for the

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.540
that contains the cleavage site for the
 

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.990
that contains the cleavage site for the
protease and then we have a little green

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000
protease and then we have a little green
 

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.120
protease and then we have a little green
light here which we can a say a green

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.130
light here which we can a say a green
 

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.740
light here which we can a say a green
fluorescent protein or something like

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:11.750
fluorescent protein or something like
 

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.580
fluorescent protein or something like
that and if the protease cleaves it will

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.590
that and if the protease cleaves it will
 

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.010
that and if the protease cleaves it will
separate the bead part from the soluble

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:18.020
separate the bead part from the soluble
 

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.680
separate the bead part from the soluble
part which has the green light on it and

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:20.690
part which has the green light on it and
 

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.990
part which has the green light on it and
you can do an essay you can go time

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000
you can do an essay you can go time
 

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.500
you can do an essay you can go time
versus fluorescence intensity and so you

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:26.510
versus fluorescence intensity and so you
 

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.940
versus fluorescence intensity and so you
can separate you could look at the

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:27.950
can separate you could look at the
 

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.450
can separate you could look at the
supernatant and separate that from the

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:31.460
supernatant and separate that from the
 

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.890
supernatant and separate that from the
bottom part here and then if you have

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:32.900
bottom part here and then if you have
 

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.600
bottom part here and then if you have
inhibitors you can screen the inhibitors

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:34.610
inhibitors you can screen the inhibitors
 

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.970
inhibitors you can screen the inhibitors
of the protease because this now will be

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:36.980
of the protease because this now will be
 

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.520
of the protease because this now will be
this line will be depressed if an

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:39.530
this line will be depressed if an
 

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.160
this line will be depressed if an
inhibitor is present so you measure this

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.170
inhibitor is present so you measure this
 

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.560
inhibitor is present so you measure this
the color and the supernatant and then

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.570
the color and the supernatant and then
 

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.150
the color and the supernatant and then
that's the way you can screen for an

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:46.160
that's the way you can screen for an
 

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.900
that's the way you can screen for an
inhibitor here's another example of a

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:49.910
inhibitor here's another example of a
 

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.000
inhibitor here's another example of a
screen just that previous one was in

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.010
screen just that previous one was in
 

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.490
screen just that previous one was in
solution there were no whole cells this

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:54.500
solution there were no whole cells this
 

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.130
solution there were no whole cells this
is a cell based screen where you take

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:57.140
is a cell based screen where you take
 

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.530
is a cell based screen where you take
bacteria and you have you make them

00:24:59.530 --> 00:24:59.540
bacteria and you have you make them
 

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.320
bacteria and you have you make them
tetracycline resistant for example by

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:02.330
tetracycline resistant for example by
 

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.930
tetracycline resistant for example by
putting a tetracycline efflux protein

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:04.940
putting a tetracycline efflux protein
 

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.620
putting a tetracycline efflux protein
into their membrane so now when you add

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.630
into their membrane so now when you add
 

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.300
into their membrane so now when you add
tetracycline they won't the the bacteria

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:10.310
tetracycline they won't the the bacteria
 

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.760
tetracycline they won't the the bacteria
will replicate because they have this

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:12.770
will replicate because they have this
 

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.920
will replicate because they have this
resistance pump that gets rid of the

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:14.930
resistance pump that gets rid of the
 

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.260
resistance pump that gets rid of the
tetracycline you can engineer a protease

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.270
tetracycline you can engineer a protease
 

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.450
tetracycline you can engineer a protease
cleavage site for the HIV protease here

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:19.460
cleavage site for the HIV protease here
 

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.890
cleavage site for the HIV protease here
this is in fact one of the screens that

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:20.900
this is in fact one of the screens that
 

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.410
this is in fact one of the screens that
was done so now if you add protease to

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:23.420
was done so now if you add protease to
 

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.210
was done so now if you add protease to
these bacteria you can express it in

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:25.220
these bacteria you can express it in
 

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.970
these bacteria you can express it in
them will cleave this part here and it

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:27.980
them will cleave this part here and it
 

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.750
them will cleave this part here and it
renders this a flux protein inactive so

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760
renders this a flux protein inactive so
 

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.250
renders this a flux protein inactive so
now the bacteria are sensitive to

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:33.260
now the bacteria are sensitive to
 

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.680
now the bacteria are sensitive to
tetracycline so if you put in if you

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.690
tetracycline so if you put in if you
 

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.270
tetracycline so if you put in if you
screen for inhibitors of the protease

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:37.280
screen for inhibitors of the protease
 

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.160
screen for inhibitors of the protease
those will make the bacteria

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.170
those will make the bacteria
 

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.080
those will make the bacteria
tetracycline resistance so that will be

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.090
tetracycline resistance so that will be
 

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.670
tetracycline resistance so that will be
your readout Tetrick growth in the

a tetracycline for inhibitors that block

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:45.590
a tetracycline for inhibitors that block
 

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.040
a tetracycline for inhibitors that block
the HIV protease so that's a cell based

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.050
the HIV protease so that's a cell based
 

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.400

one of the main ways that people get it

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:14.980
one of the main ways that people get it
 

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.890
one of the main ways that people get it
in Pakistan here's a Pakistan or

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:17.900
in Pakistan here's a Pakistan or
 

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.940
in Pakistan here's a Pakistan or
Bangladesh people collect date palm sap

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.950
Bangladesh people collect date palm sap
 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.620
Bangladesh people collect date palm sap
and they put it in these big containers

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:23.630
and they put it in these big containers
 

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.820
and they put it in these big containers
and they leave it outside their house

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:24.830
and they leave it outside their house
 

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.160
and they leave it outside their house
and at night the bats come to drink the

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.170
and at night the bats come to drink the
 

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.500
and at night the bats come to drink the
date palm sap because they like it and

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:29.510
date palm sap because they like it and
 

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.230
date palm sap because they like it and
they defecate and urinate in it and they

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240
they defecate and urinate in it and they
 

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.270
they defecate and urinate in it and they
put virus in it the bats have this virus

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:34.280
put virus in it the bats have this virus
 

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.190
put virus in it the bats have this virus
they're fine and then people drink the

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200
they're fine and then people drink the
 

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.560
they're fine and then people drink the
sap and they get they get this infection

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:38.570
sap and they get they get this infection
 

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.750
sap and they get they get this infection
so we're looking for antivirals but

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760
so we're looking for antivirals but
 

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.640
so we're looking for antivirals but
these viruses are very dangerous to work

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:42.650
these viruses are very dangerous to work
 

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.900
these viruses are very dangerous to work
with you don't want to be screening

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:43.910
with you don't want to be screening

here in the city what you do is you make

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:50.900
here in the city what you do is you make
 

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.690
here in the city what you do is you make
a virus you can you make a pseudo type

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:52.700
a virus you can you make a pseudo type
 

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.820
a virus you can you make a pseudo type
virus you have say vesicular stomatitis

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:54.830
virus you have say vesicular stomatitis
 

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.460

safe and you engineer the glycoproteins

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:00.590
safe and you engineer the glycoproteins
 

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.880
safe and you engineer the glycoproteins
of of Hendra virus into it so that it's

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:03.890
of of Hendra virus into it so that it's
 

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.710
of of Hendra virus into it so that it's
not dangerous as Hendra would be but you

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720
not dangerous as Hendra would be but you
 

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.600
not dangerous as Hendra would be but you
have the glycoproteins and now you can

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:07.610
have the glycoproteins and now you can
 

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.780
have the glycoproteins and now you can
infect cells and look for inhibitors of

in the particles that produce don't have
 

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.530
in the particles that produce don't have
glycoproteins because you've actually

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:26.540
glycoproteins because you've actually
 

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.680

particles are made in another cell that
 

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.520
particles are made in another cell that
expresses the viral glycoprotein but the

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:36.530
expresses the viral glycoprotein but the
 

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.920

they've done here is they express the
 

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.500
they've done here is they express the
Hendra glycoproteins on the target cell

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.510
Hendra glycoproteins on the target cell
 

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.350

so now not only can this pseudo type

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360
so now not only can this pseudo type
 

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.450
so now not only can this pseudo type
virus in fact but the particles that are

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:49.460
virus in fact but the particles that are
 

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.180
virus in fact but the particles that are
released will have Hendra glycoproteins

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:52.190
released will have Hendra glycoproteins
 

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.920
released will have Hendra glycoproteins
on them they still have the genome of

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:53.930
on them they still have the genome of
 

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.350
on them they still have the genome of
VSV but they can you can look at the

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360
VSV but they can you can look at the
 

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.980

whole

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:56.990
whole
 

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.630
whole
located cycle you can look at not only

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640
located cycle you can look at not only
 

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.180
located cycle you can look at not only
entry but budding from the host cell you

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.190
entry but budding from the host cell you
 

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.250
entry but budding from the host cell you
can get multi cycle infection and you

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:03.260
can get multi cycle infection and you
 

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.600
can get multi cycle infection and you
could look for inhibitors of a broader

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:04.610
could look for inhibitors of a broader
 

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.180
could look for inhibitors of a broader
range of targets so that's this is being

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.190
range of targets so that's this is being
 

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.390
range of targets so that's this is being
used now to look for inhibitors because

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:09.400
used now to look for inhibitors because
 

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.910
used now to look for inhibitors because
Hendra is a longer acute infection so if

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:12.920
Hendra is a longer acute infection so if
 

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.280
Hendra is a longer acute infection so if
you diagnose it you could apply the an

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:15.290
you diagnose it you could apply the an
 

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.520
you diagnose it you could apply the an

mechanized approaches to do this so you

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:25.700
mechanized approaches to do this so you
 

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.630
mechanized approaches to do this so you
use multi-well plate so your many of you

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640
use multi-well plate so your many of you
 

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.280

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.610
each well you can do an essay for a
different compound and you you don't

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:42.620
different compound and you you don't
 

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.620
different compound and you you don't
have people putting compounds into these

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:44.630
have people putting compounds into these
 

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.870
have people putting compounds into these
wells it's too tedious and they would

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880
wells it's too tedious and they would
 

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.030
wells it's too tedious and they would
make mistakes so you have these robots

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.040
make mistakes so you have these robots
 

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.799
make mistakes so you have these robots
you have rooms that companies full of

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:50.809
you have rooms that companies full of
 

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:52.930
you have rooms that companies full of
these robotic arms and what they're

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:52.940
these robotic arms and what they're
 

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.520
these robotic arms and what they're
doing here is they're picking out the

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:54.530
doing here is they're picking out the
 

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.320
doing here is they're picking out the
plates from an incubator and they're

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:56.330
plates from an incubator and they're
 

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.120
plates from an incubator and they're
gonna place them on a table and then

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.130
gonna place them on a table and then
 

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.890
gonna place them on a table and then
another robot will inject all the

00:28:59.890 --> 00:28:59.900
another robot will inject all the
 

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.840
another robot will inject all the
compounds into this and the arm will

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:01.850
compounds into this and the arm will
 

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.940
compounds into this and the arm will
take it and put it back so this is now

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:03.950
take it and put it back so this is now
 

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.830
take it and put it back so this is now
how it's done by these robots

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840
how it's done by these robots
 

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.040
how it's done by these robots
high-throughput screening so by this

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.050
high-throughput screening so by this
 

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.930
high-throughput screening so by this
approach you can do ten thousand

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:10.940
approach you can do ten thousand
 

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.060

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.490
compounds a day easily you can rip
through libraries very quickly and you

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:15.500
through libraries very quickly and you
 

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.290
through libraries very quickly and you
use chemical libraries as I've said that

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:17.300
use chemical libraries as I've said that
 

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.490
use chemical libraries as I've said that
the company may have or you could

whole division of people that would go
 

00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:27.790
whole division of people that would go
out on a daily basis and go to the

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:27.800
out on a daily basis and go to the
 

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.490
out on a daily basis and go to the
swamps of New Jersey or the woods and

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500
swamps of New Jersey or the woods and
 

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.260
swamps of New Jersey or the woods and
just pick up samples and bring them back

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:32.270
just pick up samples and bring them back
 

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.120
just pick up samples and bring them back
and they would search them for active

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.130
and they would search them for active
 

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.400
and they would search them for active

about an example of that and now you can
 

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.150
about an example of that and now you can
even do in silico screening you use a

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.160
even do in silico screening you use a
 

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.610
even do in silico screening you use a
computer to say what kind of compound

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:54.620
computer to say what kind of compound
 

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.650
computer to say what kind of compound
will fit into this pocket the best and

will fit into this pocket the best and
 

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.480
will fit into this pocket the best and
you use the computer to iterate through

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.490
you use the computer to iterate through
 

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.310
you use the computer to iterate through
many many different kinds of structures

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320
many many different kinds of structures
 

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.169
many many different kinds of structures
and will tell you in general what kind

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:02.179
and will tell you in general what kind
 

00:30:02.179 --> 00:30:03.610
and will tell you in general what kind
of structure you need then you can

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:03.620
of structure you need then you can
 

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.380
of structure you need then you can
synthesize it and test it so that's

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:05.390
synthesize it and test it so that's
 

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.190
synthesize it and test it so that's
called in silico screening now when we

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200
called in silico screening now when we
 

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.840
called in silico screening now when we
make all these drugs in the end

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:10.850
make all these drugs in the end
 

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.490
make all these drugs in the end
were frustrated because we get

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:12.500
were frustrated because we get
 

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.820
were frustrated because we get
resistance and basically any antiviral

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:15.830
resistance and basically any antiviral
 

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.110
resistance and basically any antiviral
you make you're going to get resistance

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120
you make you're going to get resistance
 

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.450
you make you're going to get resistance
too you should not say if you're gonna

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.460
too you should not say if you're gonna
 

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.480
too you should not say if you're gonna
get resistance but when because that's

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:22.490
get resistance but when because that's
 

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.880
get resistance but when because that's
because viruses replicate very well they

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:24.890
because viruses replicate very well they
 

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.560
because viruses replicate very well they
have pretty good mutation frequencies

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:26.570
have pretty good mutation frequencies
 

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.370
have pretty good mutation frequencies
and we'll talk about that next time

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:29.380
and we'll talk about that next time
 

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.350
and we'll talk about that next time
anywhere from modest to high mutation

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360
anywhere from modest to high mutation
 

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.750
anywhere from modest to high mutation
frequencies depending on the virus and

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760
frequencies depending on the virus and
 

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.180
frequencies depending on the virus and
this is a particular concern for viruses

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:37.190
this is a particular concern for viruses
 

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:39.400
this is a particular concern for viruses
that replicate over long periods of time

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:39.410
that replicate over long periods of time
 

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.650
that replicate over long periods of time
it's paradoxical because these are the

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:41.660
it's paradoxical because these are the
 

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.210
it's paradoxical because these are the
viruses that are best treated with

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:43.220
viruses that are best treated with
 

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.160
viruses that are best treated with
antivirals you can diagnose them and you

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.170
antivirals you can diagnose them and you
 

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.410
antivirals you can diagnose them and you
have a long period of time for treatment

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:47.420
have a long period of time for treatment
 

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.960
have a long period of time for treatment
yet because they're replicating so long

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:49.970
yet because they're replicating so long
 

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.690
yet because they're replicating so long
they are very likely to give off

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:51.700
they are very likely to give off
 

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.600
they are very likely to give off
resistant mutants

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:54.610
resistant mutants
 

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.790
resistant mutants
we have mutants resistant to every drug

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:57.800
we have mutants resistant to every drug
 

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.000
we have mutants resistant to every drug
in our antiviral Arsenal right now so we

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.010
in our antiviral Arsenal right now so we
 

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.940
in our antiviral Arsenal right now so we
have as I said about 30 or so antivirals

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:03.950
have as I said about 30 or so antivirals
 

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.830
have as I said about 30 or so antivirals
and their virus is resistant to every

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840
and their virus is resistant to every
 

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.520
and their virus is resistant to every
one of them so they in fact as you will

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:09.530
one of them so they in fact as you will
 

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.280
one of them so they in fact as you will
see doesn't matter how many we make in

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.290
see doesn't matter how many we make in
 

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.180
see doesn't matter how many we make in
the future there will always be

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:13.190
the future there will always be
 

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.120
the future there will always be
resistance to all of them so you really

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.130
resistance to all of them so you really
 

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.980
resistance to all of them so you really
have to have very special approaches to

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:17.990
have to have very special approaches to
 

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.690
have to have very special approaches to
get around this problem so right now the

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:19.700
get around this problem so right now the
 

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.000
get around this problem so right now the
antiviral Arsenal is small this has been

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.010
antiviral Arsenal is small this has been
 

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.060
antiviral Arsenal is small this has been
overcome as you'll see for HIV but we

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.070
overcome as you'll see for HIV but we
 

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.590
overcome as you'll see for HIV but we
haven't done that for other viruses and

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600
haven't done that for other viruses and
 

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.180
haven't done that for other viruses and
infections now what's the problem with

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.190
infections now what's the problem with
 

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.760
infections now what's the problem with
drug resistance this is really obvious

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:30.770
drug resistance this is really obvious
 

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.770
drug resistance this is really obvious
you can't keep treating with the same

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:32.780
you can't keep treating with the same
 

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.990
you can't keep treating with the same
drug if a patient develops resistance to

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000
drug if a patient develops resistance to
 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.960
drug if a patient develops resistance to
it it's useless sometimes no other drug

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:37.970
it it's useless sometimes no other drug
 

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.060
it it's useless sometimes no other drug
is available so it's a death sentence

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.070
is available so it's a death sentence
 

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:43.720
is available so it's a death sentence
for the patient we do study resistance

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:43.730
for the patient we do study resistance
 

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.450
for the patient we do study resistance
to understand how viruses become

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:46.460
to understand how viruses become
 

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.120
to understand how viruses become
resistant so we would like to know the

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.130
resistant so we would like to know the
 

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.070
resistant so we would like to know the
sequences that are involved and maybe we

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080
sequences that are involved and maybe we
 

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.780
sequences that are involved and maybe we
can get insight into getting around it

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:54.790
can get insight into getting around it
 

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.870
can get insight into getting around it
and maybe developing new strategies to

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880
and maybe developing new strategies to
 

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.420
and maybe developing new strategies to
get around the problem what are the

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:01.430
get around the problem what are the
 

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.690
get around the problem what are the
mechanisms well RNA viruses all nucleic

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:04.700
mechanisms well RNA viruses all nucleic
 

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.400
mechanisms well RNA viruses all nucleic
acid polymerases as you know are

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:06.410
acid polymerases as you know are
 

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.990
acid polymerases as you know are
error-prone but those of RNA viruses are

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000
error-prone but those of RNA viruses are
 

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.590
error-prone but those of RNA viruses are
particularly because there's no

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600
particularly because there's no
 

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.140
particularly because there's no
correction mechanism they can't correct

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.150
correction mechanism they can't correct
 

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.760
correction mechanism they can't correct
the mistake they make and they typically

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:15.770
the mistake they make and they typically
 

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.120
the mistake they make and they typically
make one missing corporation for every

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.130
make one missing corporation for every
 

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.450
make one missing corporation for every
10,000 to 100,000 nucleotides that are

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:22.460
10,000 to 100,000 nucleotides that are
 

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.430
10,000 to 100,000 nucleotides that are
polymerized so remember the RNA viruses

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440
polymerized so remember the RNA viruses
 

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.700
polymerized so remember the RNA viruses
have

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:24.710
have
 

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.769
have
to replicate their genomes and that's

00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:26.779
to replicate their genomes and that's
 

00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:29.590
to replicate their genomes and that's
the error rate it's about a million

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600
the error rate it's about a million
 

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.139
the error rate it's about a million
times greater than the error rate of our

00:32:32.139 --> 00:32:32.149
times greater than the error rate of our
 

00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:35.889
times greater than the error rate of our
DNA polymerases so that's that's quite

00:32:35.889 --> 00:32:35.899
DNA polymerases so that's that's quite
 

00:32:35.899 --> 00:32:39.760
DNA polymerases so that's that's quite
high so in an RNA virus genome of ten

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:39.770
high so in an RNA virus genome of ten
 

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.760
high so in an RNA virus genome of ten
kilobases this range basically gives you

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:42.770
kilobases this range basically gives you
 

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.159
kilobases this range basically gives you
one mutation in each genome or every 10

00:32:45.159 --> 00:32:45.169
one mutation in each genome or every 10
 

00:32:45.169 --> 00:33:03.160
one mutation in each genome or every 10
genomes depending on the frequency yeah

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.170
 
 

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.440
 
so why is there any replication at all

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:05.450
so why is there any replication at all
 

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.080
so why is there any replication at all
so if you it depends if you start

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:08.090
so if you it depends if you start
 

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.760
so if you it depends if you start
treating a person they have a very large

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:09.770
treating a person they have a very large
 

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.740
treating a person they have a very large
viral load the likelihood is that

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:11.750
viral load the likelihood is that
 

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.540
viral load the likelihood is that
they're already resistant mutants in

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:13.550
they're already resistant mutants in
 

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.720
they're already resistant mutants in
there it's just one scenario the other

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:16.730
there it's just one scenario the other
 

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.550
there it's just one scenario the other
scenarios that people stop taking their

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:18.560
scenarios that people stop taking their
 

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.010
scenarios that people stop taking their
antivirals and you give the virus as a

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:21.020
antivirals and you give the virus as a
 

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:28.150
antivirals and you give the virus as a
window to replicate so a DNA virus is

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:28.160
window to replicate so a DNA virus is
 

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.270
window to replicate so a DNA virus is
the polymerase can excise and replace

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:31.280
the polymerase can excise and replace
 

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.460
the polymerase can excise and replace
the mistakes that are Mis incorporated

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:33.470
the mistakes that are Mis incorporated
 

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.210
the mistakes that are Mis incorporated
nucleotides these therefore evolve more

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:37.220
nucleotides these therefore evolve more
 

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.190
nucleotides these therefore evolve more
slowly so here is a DNA polymerase

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200
slowly so here is a DNA polymerase
 

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.740
slowly so here is a DNA polymerase
copying a template here's the three

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:41.750
copying a template here's the three
 

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.750
copying a template here's the three
prime end of the growing strand you have

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760
prime end of the growing strand you have
 

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.760
prime end of the growing strand you have
a miss incorporation here as soon as a

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.690
mismatch the wrong base was put in that
happens but these DNA polymerases have 3

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:52.700
happens but these DNA polymerases have 3
 

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.120
happens but these DNA polymerases have 3
to 5 prime exonuclease activities which

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:55.130
to 5 prime exonuclease activities which
 

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.840
to 5 prime exonuclease activities which
can excise the mistake and replace it so

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:58.850
can excise the mistake and replace it so
 

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.750
can excise the mistake and replace it so
this makes the error frequency for DNA

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760
this makes the error frequency for DNA
 

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.690
this makes the error frequency for DNA
viruses much lower it's not non-existent

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:03.700
viruses much lower it's not non-existent
 

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.750
viruses much lower it's not non-existent
and that's probably a evolutionary

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760
and that's probably a evolutionary
 

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.940
and that's probably a evolutionary
advantage you should probably make some

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:09.950
advantage you should probably make some
 

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.010
advantage you should probably make some
errors otherwise you don't evolve right

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:12.020
errors otherwise you don't evolve right
 

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.639
errors otherwise you don't evolve right
if you were totally genetically stable

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:14.649
if you were totally genetically stable
 

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:16.930
if you were totally genetically stable
you couldn't have any variation you

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:16.940
you couldn't have any variation you
 

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.669
you couldn't have any variation you
wouldn't be able to adapt so there has

00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679
wouldn't be able to adapt so there has
 

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.919
wouldn't be able to adapt so there has
to be some mutation rate but this is why

00:34:20.919 --> 00:34:20.929
to be some mutation rate but this is why
 

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.520
to be some mutation rate but this is why
it's much lower for the DNA viruses so

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:24.530
it's much lower for the DNA viruses so
 

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.649
it's much lower for the DNA viruses so

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:43.490
herpes simplex virus the thymidine
 

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:46.660
herpes simplex virus the thymidine
kinase or the TK gene so this is very

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:46.670
kinase or the TK gene so this is very
 

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.450
kinase or the TK gene so this is very
specific for virus infected cells the

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:49.460
specific for virus infected cells the
 

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.280
specific for virus infected cells the
phosphorylation won't occur this first

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:51.290
phosphorylation won't occur this first
 

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.020
phosphorylation won't occur this first
far away phosphorylation doesn't occur

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.030
far away phosphorylation doesn't occur
 

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.220
far away phosphorylation doesn't occur
in uninfected cells so you have the

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.230
in uninfected cells so you have the
 

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.440
in uninfected cells so you have the
first phosphorylation event here the P

00:35:59.440 --> 00:35:59.450
first phosphorylation event here the P
 

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.920
first phosphorylation event here the P
is added by HSV TK so the drug gets into

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:02.930
is added by HSV TK so the drug gets into
 

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.870
is added by HSV TK so the drug gets into
the cell if it's infected with herpes

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880
the cell if it's infected with herpes
 

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.000
the cell if it's infected with herpes
simplex virus it gets one phosphate then

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.010
simplex virus it gets one phosphate then
 

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.070
simplex virus it gets one phosphate then
another then two other cellular kinase

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:09.080
another then two other cellular kinase
 

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.900
another then two other cellular kinase
has add one in two more phosphates so

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:10.910
has add one in two more phosphates so
 

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.670
has add one in two more phosphates so
now it's a triphosphate and you need

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680
now it's a triphosphate and you need
 

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.800
now it's a triphosphate and you need
triphosphates to be incorporated into

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:14.810
triphosphates to be incorporated into
 

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.140
triphosphates to be incorporated into
DNA of course now this gets incorporated

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.150
DNA of course now this gets incorporated
 

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.140
DNA of course now this gets incorporated
into DNA alright so now we're putting in

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.150
into DNA alright so now we're putting in
 

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.640
into DNA alright so now we're putting in
the acyclovir right here but the problem

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:24.650
the acyclovir right here but the problem
 

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.370
the acyclovir right here but the problem
is that you're missing the bottom part

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.380
is that you're missing the bottom part
 

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.830
is that you're missing the bottom part
of the sugar right which is where the

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:29.840
of the sugar right which is where the
 

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.490
of the sugar right which is where the
next base would be attached so remember

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:33.500
next base would be attached so remember
 

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.820
next base would be attached so remember
if this were guanosine the hydroxyl

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:36.830
if this were guanosine the hydroxyl
 

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.470
if this were guanosine the hydroxyl
would be the next site of the next

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480
would be the next site of the next
 

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.880
would be the next site of the next
triphosphate addition but there's no

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:39.890
triphosphate addition but there's no
 

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.670
triphosphate addition but there's no
guanosine here so the chain

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680
guanosine here so the chain
 

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.960
guanosine here so the chain
incorporation stops so that's why this

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:43.970
incorporation stops so that's why this
 

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.810
incorporation stops so that's why this
inhibits DNA synthesis because it's a

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:46.820
inhibits DNA synthesis because it's a
 

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.770
inhibits DNA synthesis because it's a
chain terminator we call it okay we get

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:50.780
chain terminator we call it okay we get
 

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.050
chain terminator we call it okay we get
readily resistance to a cycle via these

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:53.060
readily resistance to a cycle via these
 

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.230
readily resistance to a cycle via these
mutants arise spontaneously during virus

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240
mutants arise spontaneously during virus
 

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.600
mutants arise spontaneously during virus
replication and there's some kinds of

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:58.610
replication and there's some kinds of
 

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.580

mutants that cannot phosphorylate the

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:00.590
mutants that cannot phosphorylate the
 

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.830
mutants that cannot phosphorylate the
prodrug these are mutations in the gene

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:02.840
prodrug these are mutations in the gene
 

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.760
prodrug these are mutations in the gene
for the viral thymidine kinase so they

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:06.770
for the viral thymidine kinase so they
 

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.420
for the viral thymidine kinase so they
don't recognize the acyclovir they can't

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:10.430
don't recognize the acyclovir they can't
 

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.970
don't recognize the acyclovir they can't
phosphorylate so it cannot inhibit viral

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:12.980
phosphorylate so it cannot inhibit viral
 

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.770
phosphorylate so it cannot inhibit viral
replication so these are variants of the

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:14.780
replication so these are variants of the
 

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.720
replication so these are variants of the
TK gene that are selected for by the

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:16.730
TK gene that are selected for by the
 

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:21.400
TK gene that are selected for by the
drug other mutants can't incorporate the

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:21.410
drug other mutants can't incorporate the
 

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.010
drug other mutants can't incorporate the
the phosphorylated drug so these mutants

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.020
the phosphorylated drug so these mutants
 

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.400
the phosphorylated drug so these mutants
they the drug is phosphorylated but

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.410
they the drug is phosphorylated but
 

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.170
they the drug is phosphorylated but
there are mutations in the viral DNA

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:29.180
there are mutations in the viral DNA
 

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:29.799
there are mutations in the viral DNA

such that they don't incorporate the
 

00:37:31.519 --> 00:37:34.660
such that they don't incorporate the
phosphorylated acyclovir okay so two

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:34.670
phosphorylated acyclovir okay so two
 

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.880
phosphorylated acyclovir okay so two
kinds of resistance mutants one the

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:36.890
kinds of resistance mutants one the
 

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.380
kinds of resistance mutants one the

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:38.390
phosphorylation doesn't occur in a
 

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.189
phosphorylation doesn't occur in a
second the DNA polymerase doesn't use

00:37:41.189 --> 00:37:41.199
second the DNA polymerase doesn't use
 

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:46.269
second the DNA polymerase doesn't use
the phosphorylated compound now this is

00:37:46.269 --> 00:37:46.279
the phosphorylated compound now this is
 

00:37:46.279 --> 00:37:49.390
the phosphorylated compound now this is
a problem because you may not be able to

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400
a problem because you may not be able to
 

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.339
a problem because you may not be able to
treat the infected patient any longer

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:51.349
treat the infected patient any longer
 

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:52.749
treat the infected patient any longer
this is particular problem in AIDS

00:37:52.749 --> 00:37:52.759
this is particular problem in AIDS
 

00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:54.249
this is particular problem in AIDS
patients who as you know are

00:37:54.249 --> 00:37:54.259
patients who as you know are
 

00:37:54.259 --> 00:37:56.979
patients who as you know are
immunocompromised and they can and

00:37:56.979 --> 00:37:56.989
immunocompromised and they can and
 

00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:59.529
immunocompromised and they can and
herpes infections can be problematic so

00:37:59.529 --> 00:37:59.539
herpes infections can be problematic so
 

00:37:59.539 --> 00:38:01.059
herpes infections can be problematic so
if you're treating an AIDS patient with

00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:01.069
if you're treating an AIDS patient with
 

00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:03.699
if you're treating an AIDS patient with
acyclovir you get resistance you may get

00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:03.709
acyclovir you get resistance you may get
 

00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:05.589
acyclovir you get resistance you may get
disseminated disease as a consequence

00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599
disseminated disease as a consequence
 

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.679
disseminated disease as a consequence
and sometimes you get cross resistance

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:08.689
and sometimes you get cross resistance
 

00:38:08.689 --> 00:38:10.299
and sometimes you get cross resistance
there are other nucleoside analogs and

00:38:10.299 --> 00:38:10.309
there are other nucleoside analogs and
 

00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:12.400
there are other nucleoside analogs and
you can try them but depending on the

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.410
you can try them but depending on the
 

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.469
you can try them but depending on the
mutation it may be resistant to those as

00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:14.479
mutation it may be resistant to those as
 

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:16.719
mutation it may be resistant to those as
well there is a different drug entirely

00:38:16.719 --> 00:38:16.729
well there is a different drug entirely
 

00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:18.789
well there is a different drug entirely
called Foss Garnett which is a DNA

00:38:18.789 --> 00:38:18.799
called Foss Garnett which is a DNA
 

00:38:18.799 --> 00:38:20.949
called Foss Garnett which is a DNA
polymerase inhibitor sometimes the

00:38:20.949 --> 00:38:20.959
polymerase inhibitor sometimes the
 

00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:22.959
polymerase inhibitor sometimes the
resistant mutants can be inhibited with

00:38:22.959 --> 00:38:22.969
resistant mutants can be inhibited with
 

00:38:22.969 --> 00:38:24.640
resistant mutants can be inhibited with
that but this has higher side effects

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:24.650
that but this has higher side effects
 

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.670
that but this has higher side effects
than acyclovir and if you are resistant

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680
than acyclovir and if you are resistant
 

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.749
than acyclovir and if you are resistant
to all of these then you have no

00:38:28.749 --> 00:38:28.759
to all of these then you have no
 

00:38:28.759 --> 00:38:30.609
to all of these then you have no
treatment options so that's why it's

00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:30.619
treatment options so that's why it's
 

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:33.969
treatment options so that's why it's
important to have a big arsenal and in

00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:33.979
important to have a big arsenal and in
 

00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:35.429
important to have a big arsenal and in
this case we don't

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:35.439
this case we don't
 

00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:38.589
this case we don't
now acyclovir has been improved over the

00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599
now acyclovir has been improved over the
 

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:40.269
now acyclovir has been improved over the
years I just want to give you a sense

00:38:40.269 --> 00:38:40.279
years I just want to give you a sense
 

00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:42.459
years I just want to give you a sense
for the kind of things that have been

00:38:42.459 --> 00:38:42.469
for the kind of things that have been
 

00:38:42.469 --> 00:38:46.089
for the kind of things that have been
done the original drug is acyclovir and

00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:46.099
done the original drug is acyclovir and
 

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:49.539
done the original drug is acyclovir and
this has been modified chemically by

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:49.549
this has been modified chemically by
 

00:38:49.549 --> 00:38:52.029
this has been modified chemically by
adding a valine here and I mean of the

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:52.039
adding a valine here and I mean of the
 

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:53.259
adding a valine here and I mean of the
amino acid valine

00:38:53.259 --> 00:38:53.269
amino acid valine
 

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:55.419
amino acid valine
then it's called a Valis cycle of air

00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:55.429
then it's called a Valis cycle of air
 

00:38:55.429 --> 00:38:58.929
then it's called a Valis cycle of air
and this has improved bioavailability so

00:38:58.929 --> 00:38:58.939
and this has improved bioavailability so
 

00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:00.989
and this has improved bioavailability so
this is an orally this can be an orally

00:39:00.989 --> 00:39:00.999
this is an orally this can be an orally
 

00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:05.469
this is an orally this can be an orally
taken drug and this one is more

00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:05.479
taken drug and this one is more
 

00:39:05.479 --> 00:39:08.410

bioavailable after oral administration

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:08.420
bioavailable after oral administration
 

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.630
bioavailable after oral administration
what happens here you take it orally and

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640
what happens here you take it orally and
 

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.749
what happens here you take it orally and
then cellular enzymes cleave off the

00:39:13.749 --> 00:39:13.759
then cellular enzymes cleave off the
 

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:16.509
then cellular enzymes cleave off the
valine right here so that it can be

00:39:16.509 --> 00:39:16.519
valine right here so that it can be
 

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.039
valine right here so that it can be
phosphorylated otherwise it couldn't be

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:18.049
phosphorylated otherwise it couldn't be
 

00:39:18.049 --> 00:39:18.939
phosphorylated otherwise it couldn't be
phosphorylated

00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:18.949
phosphorylated
 

00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:22.029
phosphorylated
and then this is the active form so it's

00:39:22.029 --> 00:39:22.039
and then this is the active form so it's
 

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:23.679
and then this is the active form so it's
released in you so this is then a pro

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:23.689
released in you so this is then a pro
 

00:39:23.689 --> 00:39:25.329

which I'm sure you all remember very

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:44.900
which I'm sure you all remember very
 

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.350
which I'm sure you all remember very
well this is an ion channel that is

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:47.360
well this is an ion channel that is
 

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.440
well this is an ion channel that is
present in the very odd now you remember

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.450
present in the very odd now you remember

the purple ones the heat in the
 

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.730
the purple ones the heat in the
neuraminidase is the orange one and then

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:00.740
neuraminidase is the orange one and then
 

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.520
neuraminidase is the orange one and then
there's another membrane protein which

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.530
there's another membrane protein which
 

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.770
there's another membrane protein which
is very low abundance in the virion you

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:05.780
is very low abundance in the virion you
 

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.510
is very low abundance in the virion you
can see it here there's just one of them

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520
can see it here there's just one of them
 

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.750
can see it here there's just one of them
shown here that is the m2 protein it

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760
shown here that is the m2 protein it
 

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.720
shown here that is the m2 protein it
forms an ion channel and just to review

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:13.730
forms an ion channel and just to review
 

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.570
forms an ion channel and just to review
during entry of the virus into cells

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:16.580
during entry of the virus into cells
 

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.520
during entry of the virus into cells
that's when that ion channel is

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:18.530
that's when that ion channel is
 

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.220
that's when that ion channel is
necessary so remember the virus binds a

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.230
necessary so remember the virus binds a
 

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.770
necessary so remember the virus binds a
receptor which has silac acid in it gets

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:23.780
receptor which has silac acid in it gets
 

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.340
receptor which has silac acid in it gets
taken up by endocytosis the endosome 's

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:27.350
taken up by endocytosis the endosome 's
 

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.130
taken up by endocytosis the endosome 's
get acidified protons are pumped into

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:30.140
get acidified protons are pumped into
 

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.370
get acidified protons are pumped into
the endosome that lowers the pH and then

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:33.380
the endosome that lowers the pH and then
 

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.830
the endosome that lowers the pH and then
as the pH drops there's a fusion event

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:35.840
as the pH drops there's a fusion event
 

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.270
as the pH drops there's a fusion event
that occurs between the viral membrane

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280
that occurs between the viral membrane
 

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.330
that occurs between the viral membrane
and the endosome so that the viral RNA

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:40.340
and the endosome so that the viral RNA
 

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.860
and the endosome so that the viral RNA
can then get out and get into the

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:41.870
can then get out and get into the
 

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.900
can then get out and get into the
nucleus so you need low pH now during

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:43.910
nucleus so you need low pH now during
 

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.140
nucleus so you need low pH now during
this step as these protons go in the

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:47.150
this step as these protons go in the
 

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.990
this step as these protons go in the
endosome they then get pumped into the

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000
endosome they then get pumped into the
 

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.140
endosome they then get pumped into the
virus through this ion channel this

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.150
virus through this ion channel this
 

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.960
virus through this ion channel this
em--to ion channel and you need to have

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:55.970
em--to ion channel and you need to have
 

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.600
em--to ion channel and you need to have
reduced pH in the virion itself so that

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:58.610
reduced pH in the virion itself so that
 

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.550
reduced pH in the virion itself so that
these RNAs can dissociate and go in the

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560
these RNAs can dissociate and go in the
 

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.950
these RNAs can dissociate and go in the
nucleus so amantadine blocks the

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960
nucleus so amantadine blocks the
 

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.830
nucleus so amantadine blocks the
function of this channel so it doesn't

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:05.840
function of this channel so it doesn't
 

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.840
function of this channel so it doesn't
allow protons to go into the interior of

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:07.850
allow protons to go into the interior of
 

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.960
allow protons to go into the interior of
the particle hence when the fusion event

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:10.970
the particle hence when the fusion event
 

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:15.220
the particle hence when the fusion event
occurs these RNAs remain stuck to the

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.230
occurs these RNAs remain stuck to the
 

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.260
occurs these RNAs remain stuck to the
membrane they don't come off and they

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.270
membrane they don't come off and they
 

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:18.700
membrane they don't come off and they
don't go in the nucleus so that's how

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:18.710
don't go in the nucleus so that's how
 

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.150
don't go in the nucleus so that's how
you inhibit replication so here is a

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160
you inhibit replication so here is a
 

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.820
you inhibit replication so here is a
model of this the M 2 ion channel is

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:24.830
model of this the M 2 ion channel is
 

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.630
model of this the M 2 ion channel is
shown here

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640
shown here
 

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.360
shown here
it's a tetramer we're showing two chains

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:28.370
it's a tetramer we're showing two chains
 

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.310
it's a tetramer we're showing two chains
here this is the lipid membrane of the

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:30.320
here this is the lipid membrane of the
 

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.190
here this is the lipid membrane of the
virus so normally protons would be

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200
virus so normally protons would be
 

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.650
virus so normally protons would be
pumped through here but the amantadine

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:35.660
pumped through here but the amantadine
 

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.390
pumped through here but the amantadine
fits right in the channel it blocks the

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400
fits right in the channel it blocks the
 

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.790
fits right in the channel it blocks the
protons from being pumped in so that's

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800
protons from being pumped in so that's
 

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.620
protons from being pumped in so that's
why it blocks infectivity because it

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:41.630
why it blocks infectivity because it
 

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.440
why it blocks infectivity because it
blocks entry or encoding of the viral

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:44.450
blocks entry or encoding of the viral
 

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.840
blocks entry or encoding of the viral
RNA so in fact by studying amantadine

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:49.850
RNA so in fact by studying amantadine
 

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.120
RNA so in fact by studying amantadine
and amantadine resistance we learned a

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.130
and amantadine resistance we learned a
 

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.240
and amantadine resistance we learned a
lot about uncoding we didn't know that

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:54.250
lot about uncoding we didn't know that
 

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.720
lot about uncoding we didn't know that
acidification

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:55.730
acidification
 

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.550
acidification
Yuriy on was needed for a virus on

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560
Yuriy on was needed for a virus on
 

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.290
Yuriy on was needed for a virus on
coding until we started studying these

00:41:59.290 --> 00:41:59.300
coding until we started studying these
 

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.349
coding until we started studying these
amantadine resistant mutants because we

00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359
amantadine resistant mutants because we
 

00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:03.940
amantadine resistant mutants because we
had him Anthony we knew worked we knew a

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:03.950
had him Anthony we knew worked we knew a
 

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.130
had him Anthony we knew worked we knew a
block the infectivity we didn't know how

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:06.140
block the infectivity we didn't know how
 

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.680
block the infectivity we didn't know how
and then people got amantadine resistant

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:08.690
and then people got amantadine resistant
 

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.420
and then people got amantadine resistant
mutants they sequenced them and they

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:10.430
mutants they sequenced them and they
 

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.820
mutants they sequenced them and they
said wow this the mutations are in m2

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:12.830
said wow this the mutations are in m2
 

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.849
said wow this the mutations are in m2
that's unusual so what does m2 doing and

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:15.859
that's unusual so what does m2 doing and
 

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:17.470
that's unusual so what does m2 doing and
that led to discovering this so really

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480
that led to discovering this so really
 

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.420
that led to discovering this so really
that's why you studying resistance can

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:19.430
that's why you studying resistance can
 

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.440
that's why you studying resistance can
be very important another flu antiviral

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:23.450
be very important another flu antiviral
 

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.200
be very important another flu antiviral
is an inhibitor of the neuraminidase so

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.210
is an inhibitor of the neuraminidase so
 

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.430
is an inhibitor of the neuraminidase so
we haven't talked much about this

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440
we haven't talked much about this
 

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.160
we haven't talked much about this
protein except to say that it Cleaves

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:30.170
protein except to say that it Cleaves
 

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.910
protein except to say that it Cleaves
sialic acid from proteins on the cell

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920
sialic acid from proteins on the cell
 

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.730
sialic acid from proteins on the cell
surface so let's talk about its function

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:36.740
surface so let's talk about its function
 

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.560
surface so let's talk about its function
and when virus is when flu viruses

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:38.570
and when virus is when flu viruses
 

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.349
and when virus is when flu viruses
infect cells remember they are produced

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359
infect cells remember they are produced
 

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:43.680
infect cells remember they are produced
new viruses are produced by budding

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:43.690
new viruses are produced by budding
 

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.030
new viruses are produced by budding
alright so viruses are produced by

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040
alright so viruses are produced by
 

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.820
alright so viruses are produced by
budding these viruses get glycoproteins

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:48.830
budding these viruses get glycoproteins
 

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.580
budding these viruses get glycoproteins
from the plasma membrane DHA in the NA

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:51.590
from the plasma membrane DHA in the NA
 

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.250
from the plasma membrane DHA in the NA
and then the released particle floats

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:54.260
and then the released particle floats
 

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.320
and then the released particle floats
away from the cell now there's a little

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:56.330
away from the cell now there's a little
 

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.720
away from the cell now there's a little
paradox inherent in this and that if you

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:58.730
paradox inherent in this and that if you
 

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.780
paradox inherent in this and that if you
remember the receptor for these viruses

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:01.790
remember the receptor for these viruses
 

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:06.280
remember the receptor for these viruses
is silac acid and salic acid is present

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.290
is silac acid and salic acid is present
 

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.859
is silac acid and salic acid is present
on this cell so as these new viruses are

00:43:08.859 --> 00:43:08.869
on this cell so as these new viruses are
 

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.780
on this cell so as these new viruses are
budding off they would just stick to the

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:10.790
budding off they would just stick to the
 

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.310
budding off they would just stick to the
surface of the cell if they didn't have

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:12.320
surface of the cell if they didn't have
 

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.530
surface of the cell if they didn't have
near minute eights there to clear the

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:14.540
near minute eights there to clear the
 

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.140
near minute eights there to clear the
sialic acid off of the places where the

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:17.150
sialic acid off of the places where the
 

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.960
sialic acid off of the places where the
viruses are budding so in fact many

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:19.970
viruses are budding so in fact many
 

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.740
viruses are budding so in fact many
years ago we shown that if you block the

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:23.750
years ago we shown that if you block the
 

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.470
years ago we shown that if you block the
function of the viral new many days the

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480
function of the viral new many days the
 

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.450
function of the viral new many days the
viruses that have produced all cluster

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.460
viruses that have produced all cluster
 

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.310
viruses that have produced all cluster
on the cell surface so this was done in

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:30.320
on the cell surface so this was done in
 

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.880
on the cell surface so this was done in
the 1960s and you could see the virus

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:33.890
the 1960s and you could see the virus
 

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.500
the 1960s and you could see the virus
has never got away and so that led to

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:35.510
has never got away and so that led to
 

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.150
has never got away and so that led to
the idea of inhibiting the neuraminidase

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160
the idea of inhibiting the neuraminidase
 

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.270
the idea of inhibiting the neuraminidase
maybe that would be a good antiviral

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280
maybe that would be a good antiviral
 

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.690
maybe that would be a good antiviral
approach now many many years later the

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:43.700
approach now many many years later the
 

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.340
approach now many many years later the
structure of the neuraminidase was

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:45.350
structure of the neuraminidase was
 

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.160
structure of the neuraminidase was
solved in conjunction with sialic acids

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:48.170
solved in conjunction with sialic acids
 

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.290
solved in conjunction with sialic acids
or the substrate for the nerman days is

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.300
or the substrate for the nerman days is
 

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.720
or the substrate for the nerman days is
sialic acid this is italic acid right

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:52.730
sialic acid this is italic acid right
 

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.510
sialic acid this is italic acid right
here it fits into a pocket and what the

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520
here it fits into a pocket and what the
 

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.370
here it fits into a pocket and what the
neuraminidase does is cleave it Cleaves

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:57.380
neuraminidase does is cleave it Cleaves
 

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.109
neuraminidase does is cleave it Cleaves
it off the protein that it's bound to

00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119
it off the protein that it's bound to
 

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:01.480
it off the protein that it's bound to
so the crystallographers looked at this

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:01.490
so the crystallographers looked at this
 

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.820
so the crystallographers looked at this
and they said let's design compounds

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:03.830
and they said let's design compounds
 

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.790
and they said let's design compounds
that look just like silac acid and make

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800
that look just like silac acid and make
 

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.560
that look just like silac acid and make
them bind tightly in the new

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:08.570
them bind tightly in the new
 

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.210
them bind tightly in the new
many days so that they block its

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:10.220
many days so that they block its
 

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.280
many days so that they block its
activity they prevent sialic acid from

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:12.290
activity they prevent sialic acid from
 

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.700
activity they prevent sialic acid from
getting in and so that's how the two

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:14.710
getting in and so that's how the two
 

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.990
getting in and so that's how the two
neuraminidase inhibitors that we use

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000
neuraminidase inhibitors that we use
 

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.880
neuraminidase inhibitors that we use
today Tamiflu and Relenza that's how

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:18.890
today Tamiflu and Relenza that's how
 

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.130
today Tamiflu and Relenza that's how
they were developed over a 30-year

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:21.140
they were developed over a 30-year
 

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.840
they were developed over a 30-year
period so that's they're the two

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:22.850
period so that's they're the two
 

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:28.210
period so that's they're the two
compounds is in am aveer or Rolen's a--

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:28.220
compounds is in am aveer or Rolen's a--
 

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:33.430
compounds is in am aveer or Rolen's a--
and also oseltamivir or Tamiflu all

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440
and also oseltamivir or Tamiflu all
 

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.220
and also oseltamivir or Tamiflu all
right and these were designed to mimic

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.230
right and these were designed to mimic
 

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.710
right and these were designed to mimic
sciatic acid which is the ligand of the

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720
sciatic acid which is the ligand of the
 

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.070
sciatic acid which is the ligand of the
inhibitor and the idea was if we make

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:42.080
inhibitor and the idea was if we make
 

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.400
inhibitor and the idea was if we make
these look really much like sialic acid

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:45.410
these look really much like sialic acid
 

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.010
these look really much like sialic acid
the virus will not be able to mutate to

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:48.020
the virus will not be able to mutate to
 

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.720
the virus will not be able to mutate to
resistance because then they won't be

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.730
resistance because then they won't be
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.760
resistance because then they won't be
able to bind sialic acid and then the

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:51.770
able to bind sialic acid and then the
 

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.040
able to bind sialic acid and then the
viruses will be dead so this would be a

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.050
viruses will be dead so this would be a
 

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.590
viruses will be dead so this would be a
good strategy okay

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:55.600
good strategy okay
 

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.480
good strategy okay
so they did that but only one of these

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:58.490
so they did that but only one of these
 

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.750
so they did that but only one of these
two is a really good mimic of sciatic

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760
two is a really good mimic of sciatic
 

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.500
two is a really good mimic of sciatic
acid and that's an AM aveer so Tama vir

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:05.510
acid and that's an AM aveer so Tama vir
 

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.460
acid and that's an AM aveer so Tama vir
is close but not exactly like sciatic

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:09.470
is close but not exactly like sciatic
 

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.820
is close but not exactly like sciatic
acid so guess which inhibitor you get

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:12.830
acid so guess which inhibitor you get
 

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:17.710
acid so guess which inhibitor you get
resistance to the one that's exactly

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720
resistance to the one that's exactly
 

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.470
resistance to the one that's exactly
like sciatic acid or the one that's not

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480
like sciatic acid or the one that's not
 

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.130
like sciatic acid or the one that's not
exactly like you get resistance to

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:24.140
exactly like you get resistance to
 

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.580
exactly like you get resistance to
Tamiflu a lot of Tamiflu resistance so

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:27.590
Tamiflu a lot of Tamiflu resistance so
 

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:32.370
Tamiflu a lot of Tamiflu resistance so
here's a cartoon that illustrates this

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:32.380
here's a cartoon that illustrates this
 

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:37.150
here's a cartoon that illustrates this
so here is neuraminidase on the virion

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160
so here is neuraminidase on the virion
 

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.880
so here is neuraminidase on the virion
surface and silac acid on a glycoprotein

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:39.890
surface and silac acid on a glycoprotein
 

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.270
surface and silac acid on a glycoprotein
on the host cell all right so remember

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280
on the host cell all right so remember
 

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.980
on the host cell all right so remember
what's happening is the neuraminidase is

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:44.990
what's happening is the neuraminidase is
 

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.350
what's happening is the neuraminidase is
binding the salic acid and it's going to

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:47.360
binding the salic acid and it's going to
 

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.030
binding the salic acid and it's going to
cleave it off so that the virus

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040
cleave it off so that the virus
 

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.390
cleave it off so that the virus
particles can get released from the cell

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400

so that's not bad but there is one out

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:55.790
so that's not bad but there is one out
 

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.580
so that's not bad but there is one out
there and when there's one there's going

there and when there's one there's going
 

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:01.330
there and when there's one there's going
to be more and then we have the pandemic

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:01.340

h1n1 strain 2290 817 which is 0.7% so

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:07.490
h1n1 strain 2290 817 which is 0.7% so
 

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.910
h1n1 strain 2290 817 which is 0.7% so
slightly higher than the h3n2 so it's

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920
slightly higher than the h3n2 so it's
 

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.580
slightly higher than the h3n2 so it's
not a lot but the number is growing and

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:12.590
not a lot but the number is growing and
 

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.380
not a lot but the number is growing and
with each successive season the more we

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:14.390
with each successive season the more we
 

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.240
with each successive season the more we
use these inhibitors the more we select

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:16.250

non-nucleoside inhibitors bind a short
 

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.600
non-nucleoside inhibitors bind a short
distance from the active site so they

distance from the active site so they
 

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.150
distance from the active site so they
probably perturb the active site enough

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160
probably perturb the active site enough
 

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.280

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.320
resistant to one drug you don't want to
give them another drug to which they're

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:17.330
give them another drug to which they're
 

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.120
give them another drug to which they're
already resistant so you need to know

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.130
already resistant so you need to know
 

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.430
already resistant so you need to know
their resistance profiles and some

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440
their resistance profiles and some
 

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.520
their resistance profiles and some
surprising results have been have

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:24.530
surprising results have been have
 

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:26.530
surprising results have been have
emerged and these are all examples of

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:26.540
emerged and these are all examples of
 

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.120
emerged and these are all examples of
where resistance to one drug actually

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:30.130
where resistance to one drug actually
 

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:31.350
where resistance to one drug actually
restore

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:31.360
restore
 

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.330
restore
susceptibility to another so here we

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:34.340
susceptibility to another so here we
 

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.660
susceptibility to another so here we
have for example a change which confers

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:37.670
have for example a change which confers
 

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:41.410
have for example a change which confers
resistance to this inhibitor and that if

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:41.420
resistance to this inhibitor and that if
 

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.480
resistance to this inhibitor and that if
you put them on a second drug died an

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:43.490
you put them on a second drug died an
 

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.820
you put them on a second drug died an
Essene and you get resistance to that it

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:45.830
Essene and you get resistance to that it
 

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.160
Essene and you get resistance to that it
restores susceptibility to the original

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:48.170
restores susceptibility to the original
 

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:51.370
restores susceptibility to the original
drug so this is this is the case for all

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:51.380
drug so this is this is the case for all
 

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.830
drug so this is this is the case for all
of these compounds if the resistance to

00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:53.840
of these compounds if the resistance to
 

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.410
of these compounds if the resistance to
a second compound restore susceptibility

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:56.420
a second compound restore susceptibility
 

00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:09.690
a second compound restore susceptibility
yeah well in heart there are only six

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:09.700
yeah well in heart there are only six
 

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.010
yeah well in heart there are only six
combinations that are approved and some

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:12.020
combinations that are approved and some
 

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.330
combinations that are approved and some
and these are some of the considerations

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:13.340
and these are some of the considerations
 

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.520
and these are some of the considerations
that are part of that yeah you want to

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:15.530
that are part of that yeah you want to
 

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:16.630
that are part of that yeah you want to
make sure that you're not going to get

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640
make sure that you're not going to get
 

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.400
make sure that you're not going to get
if resistant to one doesn't give you

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:18.410
if resistant to one doesn't give you
 

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:21.010
if resistant to one doesn't give you
resistance to all three but also some of

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:21.020
resistance to all three but also some of
 

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.720
resistance to all three but also some of
these considerations come into play as

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:22.730
these considerations come into play as
 

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.370
these considerations come into play as
well so actually you don't make up your

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:24.380
well so actually you don't make up your
 

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.100
well so actually you don't make up your
own combinations you have to use

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.110
own combinations you have to use
 

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:29.290
own combinations you have to use
pre-approved ones and those issues have

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:29.300
pre-approved ones and those issues have
 

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:33.160
pre-approved ones and those issues have
come into play in fact nowadays if you

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:33.170
come into play in fact nowadays if you
 

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.760
come into play in fact nowadays if you
are diagnosed with AIDS you have to the

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:36.770
are diagnosed with AIDS you have to the
 

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.620
are diagnosed with AIDS you have to the
you have to have a resistance profile

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:38.630
you have to have a resistance profile
 

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:40.990
you have to have a resistance profile
done best way is to sequence the genome

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000
done best way is to sequence the genome
 

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.690
done best way is to sequence the genome
in all the areas of known resistance and

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:43.700
in all the areas of known resistance and
 

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.100
in all the areas of known resistance and
see what mutations you have and then

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:45.110
see what mutations you have and then
 

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:47.110
see what mutations you have and then
pick the treatment based on the sequence

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:47.120
pick the treatment based on the sequence
 

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.480
pick the treatment based on the sequence
and obviously the more sensitive the

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:49.490
and obviously the more sensitive the
 

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:50.740
and obviously the more sensitive the
sequencing the better off you are

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:50.750
sequencing the better off you are
 

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.540
sequencing the better off you are
because there can be very small variants

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:52.550
because there can be very small variants
 

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.810

was shown that this protease was

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:25.820
was shown that this protease was
 

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.140
was shown that this protease was
essential so it was used to develop

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:28.150
essential so it was used to develop
 

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.360
essential so it was used to develop
antiviral drugs a key discovery was that

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:31.370
antiviral drugs a key discovery was that
 

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:33.610
antiviral drugs a key discovery was that
it would recognize small peptides he

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:33.620
it would recognize small peptides he
 

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.740
it would recognize small peptides he
didn't need a whole protein substrate to

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:35.750
didn't need a whole protein substrate to
 

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.570
didn't need a whole protein substrate to
be recognized but you could have a small

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:37.580
be recognized but you could have a small
 

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:41.470
be recognized but you could have a small
peptide and that the active site of the

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480
peptide and that the active site of the
 

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.870
peptide and that the active site of the
protease contains seven amino acids of

protease contains seven amino acids of
 

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.190
protease contains seven amino acids of
the substrate so that was

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200
the substrate so that was
 

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.790
the substrate so that was
also useful so initially a number of

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:48.800
also useful so initially a number of
 

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.120
also useful so initially a number of
inhibitors protease inhibitors that had

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:52.130

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.040
leads for this work
these protease inhibitors actually

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.050
these protease inhibitors actually
 

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.490
these protease inhibitors actually
inhibited the HIV protease these are

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:03.500
inhibited the HIV protease these are
 

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.260
inhibited the HIV protease these are
peptidyl mimics they mimic the natural

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:05.270
peptidyl mimics they mimic the natural
 

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.870
peptidyl mimics they mimic the natural
cleavage site so these were the first

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880
cleavage site so these were the first
 

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.950
cleavage site so these were the first
drugs and then subsequently

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960
drugs and then subsequently
 

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.960
drugs and then subsequently
mechanism-based screens and and other

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:10.970
mechanism-based screens and and other
 

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.760
mechanism-based screens and and other
structure based designs were used to

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:12.770
structure based designs were used to
 

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.970
structure based designs were used to
discover more so here is the sequence of

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:15.980
discover more so here is the sequence of
 

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.040
discover more so here is the sequence of
the protease substrate these are the

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.050
the protease substrate these are the
 

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:20.740
the protease substrate these are the
amino acids that comprise one cleavage

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:20.750
amino acids that comprise one cleavage
 

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.080
amino acids that comprise one cleavage
site in one of the viral proteins and

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.090
site in one of the viral proteins and
 

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.320
site in one of the viral proteins and
this is the recognition sequence here

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:26.330
this is the recognition sequence here
 

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.080
this is the recognition sequence here
and then this inhibitor on the bottom

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.090
and then this inhibitor on the bottom
 

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:32.140
and then this inhibitor on the bottom
mimics this protease cleavage site you

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:32.150
mimics this protease cleavage site you
 

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:33.580
mimics this protease cleavage site you
can see here and then it's different on

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:33.590
can see here and then it's different on
 

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.110
can see here and then it's different on
either side so this might this binds

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:35.120
either side so this might this binds
 

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.260
either side so this might this binds
very tightly to the protease it's a

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.270
very tightly to the protease it's a
 

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:40.090
very tightly to the protease it's a
peptide oh man medic it mimics the

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:40.100
peptide oh man medic it mimics the
 

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.980
peptide oh man medic it mimics the
substrate and inhibits its activity so

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:44.990
substrate and inhibits its activity so
 

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.870
substrate and inhibits its activity so
now we use combination therapy triple

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880
now we use combination therapy triple
 

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.590
now we use combination therapy triple
therapy because the resistance the

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:50.600
therapy because the resistance the
 

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.020
therapy because the resistance the
probability of resistance is it just the

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:53.030
probability of resistance is it just the
 

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.090
probability of resistance is it just the
product of the individual resistances so

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:55.100
product of the individual resistances so
 

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.210
product of the individual resistances so
if you have two drugs with probabilities

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:58.220
if you have two drugs with probabilities
 

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.980
if you have two drugs with probabilities
of resistance one in ten to the three

01:00:59.980 --> 01:00:59.990
of resistance one in ten to the three
 

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.270
of resistance one in ten to the three
one in ten to the four you need to have

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280
one in ten to the four you need to have
 

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.670
one in ten to the four you need to have
ten to the seventh variants to get

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680
ten to the seventh variants to get
 

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.320
ten to the seventh variants to get
resistance which is not a lot

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:05.330
resistance which is not a lot
 

01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:07.230
resistance which is not a lot
considering you get ten to the seventh

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240
considering you get ten to the seventh
 

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.820
considering you get ten to the seventh
ten to the tenth particles made a day

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:09.830
ten to the tenth particles made a day
 

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.380
ten to the tenth particles made a day

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.560
chain and each virus does a change at a
different position in theory so you make

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:56.570
different position in theory so you make
 

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.920

little better but eventually you will
 

01:02:21.819 --> 01:02:24.299
little better but eventually you will
get resistance in about a year and then

01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:24.309
get resistance in about a year and then
 

01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:28.109
get resistance in about a year and then
if you do three drugs the rate is 10 to

this is a a big change a negative change

01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:57.460
this is a a big change a negative change
 

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.880
this is a a big change a negative change
in the baseline of RNAi compared to the

01:04:59.880 --> 01:04:59.890
in the baseline of RNAi compared to the
 

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:02.610
in the baseline of RNAi compared to the
placebo proportion of patients with less

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:02.620
placebo proportion of patients with less
 

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.670
placebo proportion of patients with less
than 50 copies per mil 66 percent

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680
than 50 copies per mil 66 percent
 

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.700
than 50 copies per mil 66 percent
compared to 13% so you can see this is

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:08.710
compared to 13% so you can see this is
 

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.590
compared to 13% so you can see this is
quite effective slightly more effective

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:10.600
quite effective slightly more effective
 

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.920
quite effective slightly more effective

milligrams this is an inhibitor of ccr5

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440
milligrams this is an inhibitor of ccr5
 

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.370
milligrams this is an inhibitor of ccr5
which we talked about a long time ago

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380
which we talked about a long time ago
 

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.590
which we talked about a long time ago
ccr5 is the co receptor remember that is

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:22.600
ccr5 is the co receptor remember that is
 

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.350
ccr5 is the co receptor remember that is
needed for HIV infection it's a small

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:25.360
needed for HIV infection it's a small
 

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.320
needed for HIV infection it's a small
molecule that binds in ccr5 and causes a

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:28.330
molecule that binds in ccr5 and causes a
 

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.780
molecule that binds in ccr5 and causes a
change in the molecule such that the

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:30.790
change in the molecule such that the
 

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.300
change in the molecule such that the
virus doesn't undergo high affinity

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.310
virus doesn't undergo high affinity
 

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.070
virus doesn't undergo high affinity
binding but of course you get resistance

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:35.080
binding but of course you get resistance
 

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.040
binding but of course you get resistance
to that as well and finally there are

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:38.050
to that as well and finally there are
 

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:41.340
to that as well and finally there are
fusion inhibitors these are actually

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:41.350
fusion inhibitors these are actually
 

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:45.710
fusion inhibitors these are actually
peptides 36 amino acid peptides which

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720
peptides 36 amino acid peptides which
 

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.940
peptides 36 amino acid peptides which
interfere with the fusion reaction so

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:47.950
interfere with the fusion reaction so
 

01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:51.090
interfere with the fusion reaction so
normally when fusion occurs here's the

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:51.100
normally when fusion occurs here's the
 

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.190
normally when fusion occurs here's the
viral membrane and here's the host cell

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200
viral membrane and here's the host cell
 

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.640
viral membrane and here's the host cell
target gp120 or the envelope protein

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:56.650
target gp120 or the envelope protein
 

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.490
target gp120 or the envelope protein
binds the receptor on the host cell the

01:05:59.490 --> 01:05:59.500
binds the receptor on the host cell the
 

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.980
binds the receptor on the host cell the
fusion protein is exposed inserts into

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:01.990
fusion protein is exposed inserts into
 

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:04.680
fusion protein is exposed inserts into
the cell membrane and then remember

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:04.690
the cell membrane and then remember
 

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:07.290
the cell membrane and then remember
there's a conformational change in this

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:07.300
there's a conformational change in this
 

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.780
there's a conformational change in this
protein that hairpins draws the two

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:09.790
protein that hairpins draws the two
 

01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:11.730
protein that hairpins draws the two
membranes together so that they can fuse

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:11.740
membranes together so that they can fuse
 

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.920
membranes together so that they can fuse
we looked at movies of this a long time

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:13.930
we looked at movies of this a long time
 

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:17.940
we looked at movies of this a long time
ago these peptides what they do is they

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:17.950
ago these peptides what they do is they
 

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:21.420
ago these peptides what they do is they
bind these alpha helixes that have

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:21.430
bind these alpha helixes that have
 

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.430
bind these alpha helixes that have
extended here in the glycoprotein so

01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440
extended here in the glycoprotein so
 

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.590
extended here in the glycoprotein so
these small cylinders are the peptides

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:25.600
these small cylinders are the peptides
 

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.130
these small cylinders are the peptides
the anti

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:26.140
the anti
 

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.049
the anti
our peptides that are binding and they

01:06:28.049 --> 01:06:28.059
our peptides that are binding and they
 

01:06:28.059 --> 01:06:30.029
our peptides that are binding and they
lock it into this position so it can't

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039
lock it into this position so it can't
 

01:06:30.039 --> 01:06:31.680
lock it into this position so it can't
undergo the hair pinning and the fusion

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:31.690
undergo the hair pinning and the fusion
 

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:35.490
undergo the hair pinning and the fusion
so these block fusion these are very

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:35.500
so these block fusion these are very
 

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.339
so these block fusion these are very
expensive drugs and they have to be

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:38.349
expensive drugs and they have to be
 

01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:41.309
expensive drugs and they have to be
reconstituted just before injection so

01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319
reconstituted just before injection so
 

01:06:41.319 --> 01:06:43.130
reconstituted just before injection so
you get them as a dry powder you add

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140
you get them as a dry powder you add
 

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.660
you get them as a dry powder you add
buffer to them and you inject them and

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:45.670
buffer to them and you inject them and
 

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:48.210
buffer to them and you inject them and
it's very expensive and of course we get

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:48.220
it's very expensive and of course we get
 

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.329
it's very expensive and of course we get
resistance by amino acid changes along

01:06:51.329 --> 01:06:51.339
resistance by amino acid changes along
 

01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:53.190
resistance by amino acid changes along
these alpha helixes that simply prevent

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200
these alpha helixes that simply prevent
 

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.849
these alpha helixes that simply prevent
the binding of the peptide and some of

01:06:56.849 --> 01:06:56.859
the binding of the peptide and some of
 

01:06:56.859 --> 01:06:59.700
the binding of the peptide and some of
these are just examples of the kinds of

01:06:59.700 --> 01:06:59.710
these are just examples of the kinds of
 

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.650
these are just examples of the kinds of
mutations that you get these have been

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:01.660
mutations that you get these have been
 

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.109
mutations that you get these have been
well studies changes in gp41 which is

01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119
well studies changes in gp41 which is
 

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:06.390
well studies changes in gp41 which is
the subunit of the glycoprotein to which

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400
the subunit of the glycoprotein to which
 

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.210
the subunit of the glycoprotein to which
these peptides bind and these are all

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:09.220
these peptides bind and these are all
 

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.529
these peptides bind and these are all

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:13.539
tracked that I website the HIV DB where
 

01:07:13.539 --> 01:07:15.690
tracked that I website the HIV DB where
you can look at all the resistance

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:15.700
you can look at all the resistance
 

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.440
you can look at all the resistance
mutations in real time so this is the

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:19.450
mutations in real time so this is the
 

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:21.839
mutations in real time so this is the
chart of all the available HIV

01:07:21.839 --> 01:07:21.849

antivirals at the moment they're

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:24.190
antivirals at the moment they're
 

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:27.390
antivirals at the moment they're
classified according to the mechanism so

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400
classified according to the mechanism so
 

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.690
classified according to the mechanism so
you can see nucleoside RT inhibitors

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:30.700
you can see nucleoside RT inhibitors
 

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.420
you can see nucleoside RT inhibitors
non-nucleoside inhibitors protease

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:33.430
non-nucleoside inhibitors protease
 

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:35.700
non-nucleoside inhibitors protease
inhibitors then we have our fusion

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:35.710
inhibitors then we have our fusion
 

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.210
inhibitors then we have our fusion
inhibitor we just talked about the ccr5

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:38.220
inhibitor we just talked about the ccr5
 

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:42.140
inhibitor we just talked about the ccr5
inhibitor integrase inhibitor and then

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:42.150
inhibitor integrase inhibitor and then
 

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:45.359
inhibitor integrase inhibitor and then
various combination products so this is

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:45.369
various combination products so this is
 

01:07:45.369 --> 01:07:47.400
various combination products so this is
the triple a-- a triple a-- which is the

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:47.410
the triple a-- a triple a-- which is the
 

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:50.309
the triple a-- a triple a-- which is the
pill that contains three different drugs

01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319
pill that contains three different drugs
 

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:52.890
pill that contains three different drugs
and then other combinations can be given

01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:52.900
and then other combinations can be given
 

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.519
and then other combinations can be given
separately what's interesting about this

01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:55.529
separately what's interesting about this
 

01:07:55.529 --> 01:07:58.349
separately what's interesting about this
table is that you can see they're very

01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359
table is that you can see they're very
 

01:07:58.359 --> 01:08:01.950
table is that you can see they're very
very rapid approval rate for most of

01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960
very rapid approval rate for most of
 

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.509
very rapid approval rate for most of
these drugs usually takes much much

01:08:03.509 --> 01:08:03.519
these drugs usually takes much much
 

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:06.089
these drugs usually takes much much
longer to have drugs approved so this is

01:08:06.089 --> 01:08:06.099
longer to have drugs approved so this is
 

01:08:06.099 --> 01:08:07.740
longer to have drugs approved so this is
the time to approval where you submit

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:07.750
the time to approval where you submit
 

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.620
the time to approval where you submit
your data to the FDA and they say it's

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:10.630
your data to the FDA and they say it's
 

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:13.829
your data to the FDA and they say it's
okay and this of course being an urgent

01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839
okay and this of course being an urgent
 

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.749
okay and this of course being an urgent
situation they're all fast-tracked and

01:08:15.749 --> 01:08:15.759
situation they're all fast-tracked and
 

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.200
situation they're all fast-tracked and
given fast-track type approval so some

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:19.210
given fast-track type approval so some
 

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:20.490
given fast-track type approval so some
of them are just a few months to

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:20.500
of them are just a few months to
 

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.530
of them are just a few months to
approval which is amazing so you see we

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:22.540
approval which is amazing so you see we
 

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.360
approval which is amazing so you see we
have a big arsenal and that allows it to

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:24.370
have a big arsenal and that allows it to
 

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:31.379
have a big arsenal and that allows it to
be effectively treated yes

01:08:31.379 --> 01:08:31.389
 
 

01:08:31.389 --> 01:08:42.999
 
is it sorry for drugs yeah okay and what

01:08:42.999 --> 01:08:43.009
is it sorry for drugs yeah okay and what
 

01:08:43.009 --> 01:08:48.269
is it sorry for drugs yeah okay and what
would be the resistance to for drugs B

01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279
would be the resistance to for drugs B
 

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:50.559
would be the resistance to for drugs B
would be very high but eventually you'd

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:50.569
would be very high but eventually you'd
 

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:53.289
would be very high but eventually you'd
probably get there but remember this is

01:08:53.289 --> 01:08:53.299
probably get there but remember this is
 

01:08:53.299 --> 01:08:56.019
probably get there but remember this is
why a lot of genomes on the planet and

01:08:56.019 --> 01:08:56.029
why a lot of genomes on the planet and
 

01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:58.089
why a lot of genomes on the planet and
no matter what you make you're gonna get

01:08:58.089 --> 01:08:58.099
no matter what you make you're gonna get
 

01:08:58.099 --> 01:09:00.730
no matter what you make you're gonna get
resistance
