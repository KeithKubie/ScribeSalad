00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Why would anybody peel a carrot when they
could use an oversized pencil sharpener built

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.200
just for them?
And the same goes for cigarette...pencils.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.620
It's episode 27 of LÜT.
For pencils that are more musical, grab yourself

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.800
a pair of drumstick pencils.
And David Bizer records the waveform of a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.010
word or phrase you speak and then makes this,
whose pieces you can pop out to make your

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.120
own waveform into a necklace.
He's also published instructions on how to

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.610
make your own for free.
Now, brass knuckles are a more useful form

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.590
of jewellery, especially when you upgrade
to the kind that's also a taser.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.380
Projectile defences improve by using a target
dummy, so you better choose the bleeding zombie

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.960
target.
This brain-eater will actually bleed when

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.340
hit.
You can rub it in by wearing a Kentucky Fried

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.920
Brains t-shirt or this one, which reminds
all of us that zombies ar...were people too.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.000
Now keep your hair tidy with periodic table
barrettes and make some customized art right

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.980
away with myDaVinci[.com].
With one click you can personalize and order

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.720
prints just the way you want them.
Now, while photos and lockets are romantic,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.020
this Mystery Science Theatre 3000 frame pendant
makes whatever photo you put in it that much

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.030
more hilarious.
Stay safe and bright with monkey lights, a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.170
brilliant array of LEDs for your bike tires
that can display patterns while you ride.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.340
If it's a chilly bike ride you're taking,
be sure to wear these matching lobster gloves

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.500
and hat.
Food time.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.740
Use this mold to bake a 1-up cupcake and decorate
food with goggly eyes, that you can eat.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.090
Season the rest of your food with some salt
and pepper shakers gnome butt.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.700
Or if you feline like it, use these shakers
that look like cat butts.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.330
Now, cats also love couches,
so get yourself a cat tunnel couch.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.000
If you've upgraded from a cat to baby, don't
carry it like a square.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.640
Stick your kid in a baby holster like a real cowboy.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.280
You know, like the kind that ride on dogs.
Feeling handy?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.260
Paint the house with electrically conductive
paint and install this power-up plate on top

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.440
of your switches to control your lights with
buttons and a joystick.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.640
You can install the whole thing with a handgun drill.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.280
And then go to the hardware store to cut this
rude key into something useful.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.660
The labyrinth aquarium is a mansion for sealife,
but don't count out owning this one you can

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.920
fill with actual jellyfish they sell you.
Even scarier is a jack-o'-lantern with pumpkin

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.099
teeth.
Your pumpkin will feel beautiful.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.439
So next, raise your own self-esteem by using
self deprecating golf balls from TheCheeky[.com].

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.879
They contain phrases like "we both know that
shot was my fault."

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.919
Tetris is kind of like putting together a
puzzle, which makes this a puzzle puzzle.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:09.069
ThinkGeek[.com] offers a pack of 566 digit magnets,
which you can use to spell things out like

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.089
an old calculator, but on your fridge, which
might contain soda bottles.

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:19.149
But why not replace them with Vat19[.com]'s
giant cola gummies?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.520
The only thing more luxurious is a slide for
your yacht, which you, of course, captain

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.560
while wearing a pair of 24 carat gold-dipped
NIKE's, while sipping tea brewed with your

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.940
TIE fighter Death Star infuser.
But don't do these things alone.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.880
Be watched by these ominous security cameras,
that are actually a lamp.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.240
In this notebook, your doodles and scribblings
become automatic tattoo art.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.599
And even trash can be useful.
Like these playing cards Metrodeck makes out

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.599
of discarded subway cards.
Your furniture can contain optical illusions,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.819
like these cracked cabinets or perspective
curtains that close off a room while presenting

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.459
what looks like lies behind them.
Here's a table that is a bad dog.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.560
And the glass sides of this chair make it
look impossibly balanced from the side.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.140
In the same way that letters on the street
are elongated, so you can read them from a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.640
shallow angle,
so are the numbers on Tokyoflash's newest watch.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.380
From above, it looks like almost nothing.
And, of course, because Tokyoflash is so saucy,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.300
using code VSTF gets you $10 off.
All of those things are really cool and you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.400
could find out more by clicking links in this
video's description.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.520
Of course, Vsauce also has a Facebook page,
a Twitter page and as they say in Poland...

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.530
Jak zawsze, dziękujemy za oglądanie.
[And as always, thanks for watching.]

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.979
Vsauce cupcakes!
