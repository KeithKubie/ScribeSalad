00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi. I’m John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and today, we’re talking about Toni Morrison’s novel Sula.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.060
Sula is a story about the power and peril of friendship in adolescence, but it’s also a fascinating study of how places and families make us up.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.580
Morrison’s slim novel explores many of our
biggest questions:

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.950
Are we fated to a certain life by race and
class and gender and upbringing?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.849
Is human life better when we honor the conventions
of our social order, or should we defy them?

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.709
And how can good and evil truly be opposites
when they so often resemble each other?

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:34.429
You probably don’t read Sula in your high
school English classes, but you should.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.480
God knows it’s better than Lord of the Flies.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.260
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.520
Stan, I know I need to let it go, but I’m still mad at you for making me make a video about Lord of the Flies.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.800
Right, but about Sula.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.320
So, the novel opens with a description of a mostly African American neighborhood situated above the fictional city of Medallion, Ohio:

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.280
“In that place, where they tore the nightshade and blackberry patches from their roots to make room for the Medallion City Golf Course, there was once a neighborhood.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.980
It stood in the hills above the valley town
of Medallion and spread all the way to the river.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.360
It is called the suburbs now, but when black
people lived there it was called the Bottom.”

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.860
So, Sula is a eulogy for this place of nightshade and blackberry – plants that it's easy to associate with black rootedness, which has been torn out to build a golf course.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.140
But nightshade and blackberry serve other
metaphorical functions, too.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.820
Like, in an essay called “Unspeakable Things Unspoken,” Morrison explains that nightshade is an “unusual” plant that produces “toxic” berries.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.920
While Blackberry is a “common” plant that
produces “nourishing” fruit.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.460
So we see the nourishing and the poisonous situated together immediately in the novel, as well as the common and the rare.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.270
And we’re told that both thrived there together,
in that place when it was a neighborhood.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.420
So, this is an internally diverse, multidimensional community – and Morrison refuses to portray it, or her characters, as simply one thing or another.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.520
We also learn in Sula’s opening pages about
the fraught history of the name, the “Bottom.”

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.720
The story goes like this:

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.220
A farmer promises a slave freedom and land at the bottom of the valley if he completes a bunch of difficult chores.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.640
The slave manages to finish the tasks, and then the farmer gives him rocky land in the hills.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.800
The farmer justifies this treachery with a
turn of phrase, saying:

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.740
“when God looks down, it’s the bottom […]
the bottom of heaven – best land there is.”

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.520
So this is a world in which the bottom is not necessarily under the top, which, for one thing, undermines a tendency to privilege whiteness as above blackness.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.380
But this is also one way that Sula encourages its readers to reconsider assumptions that emerge from binary thinking.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.780
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.840
So, Binary thinking, or distinguishing between opposing items like hot OR cold, light OR dark, good OR evil, is deeply embedded in Western philosophy.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.140
In the structuralist literary theory proposed
by people like Ferdinand de Saussure,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.260
binary oppositions give units of language their meaning, because each unit becomes defined by its complementary relationship with another term.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.540
Like, you know goodness by knowing evil; you
know hot by knowing cold; etc.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.600
But there are big problems with binary thinking, especially when it comes to language,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.420
because one term tends to dominate, or at least become culturally privileged over, the other.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.840
The post-structuralist Jacques Derrida, for
instance, considered binary thinking to be

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.400
“a violent hierarchy” where “one of
two terms governs the other.”

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.820
Like, in Western thought, the concept of light
tends to dominate the concept of dark.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.200
Light is associated with knowledge and truth and revelation; darkness with evil, ignorance, and confusion.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.080
And when that sort of binary thinking gets projected onto race, the consequences are disastrous.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.920
And it happens with gender as well.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.880
We tend to view gender as binary, even though
it isn’t, any more than race is.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.140
But we often define femaleness in the context
of maleness.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.100
If we think men should be strong, aggressive, leaders, then binary thinking can lead us to conclude that women should be weak, timid followers.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.460
By inverting “bottom” over top, by valuing both the nightshade and the blackberry,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.620
and by presenting both the main female characters in the novel without judgement,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.740
Morrison encourages the reader to reconsider undervalued identities, and to set aside the false binaries that truly can make language a tool of oppression.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.880
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.860
So, while I consider Sula to be an elegantly crafted refutation of binary thinking, Morrison later found flaws in the book’s design.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.660
In 1973, when Morrison published Sula, she felt that she needed to create a “threshold” through which the reader could enter the text.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.600
So she opened the novel from the perspective of a “valley man,” that is, a white male farmer.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.260
And Morrison later wrote that she found the accommodation of what she called an “outside-the-circle” gaze “embarrassing.”

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.620
Morrison later wrote, in “Unspeakable Things
Unspoken,”:

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.220
“The stage-setting of the first four pages
is embarrassing to me now,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.240
but the pains I have taken to explain it may be helpful in identifying the strategies one can be forced to resort to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.960
in trying to accommodate the mere fact of
writing about, for and out of black culture

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.740
while accommodating and responding to mainstream
'white' culture.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.340
The 'valley man’s' guidance into the territory
was my compromise.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.570
Perhaps it 'worked,' but it was not the work
I wanted to do.”

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.780
But Sula quickly pivots away from the valley man to focus on the beautifully wrought friendship between Nel Wright and Sula Peace.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.180
Nel is a quiet girl, raised by her imperious
mother, Helene Wright.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.820
As the narrator explains, “Under Helene’s
hand the girl became obedient and polite.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.640
Any enthusiasms that little Nel showed were calmed by the mother until she drove her daughter’s imagination underground.”

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.400
But Nel eventually discovers the power of
independence.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.300
In one of my favorite passages from the novel,
she thinks,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.650
“I’m me. I’m not their daughter. I’m not Nel. I’m me. Me.”

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.080
Each time she said the word me there was a gathering in her like a power, like joy, like fear...

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.700
“Me,” she murmured.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.680
And then, sinking deeper into the quilts,
“I want…I want to be… wonderful.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.210
Oh, Jesus, make me wonderful.”

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.500
Nel connects being “wonderful” with her friend Sula, who was raised in very different circumstances.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.860
Sula was raised in her grandmother’s house
slash boarding house,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.530
a “…wooly house, where a pot of something
was always cooking on the stove;

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.350
where the mother, Hannah, never scolded or gave directions; where all sorts of people dropped in;

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.740
where newspapers were stacked in the hallway, and dirty dishes left out for hours at a time in the sink,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.620
and where a one-legged grandmother named Eva handed you goobers from deep inside her pockets or read you a dream.”

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.020
Sula’s mother, Hannah, also lives in the
house.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.560
And Hannah regards sex as “pleasant and
frequent, but otherwise unremarkable.”

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.930
She has sex with boarders and her friends’
husbands purely for pleasure.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.250
So, Sula has been raised outside the conventions
of the social order,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.260
and she seems almost magically free to Nel, whose upbringing was all about becoming “obedient” and “polite.”

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.960
And as an adult, Sula continues to be wonderful.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.590
She travels, she takes on lovers, she refuses
to sacrifice herself to anyone.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.800
But she also sleeps with Nel’s husband.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.080
Which for her, is part of not making sacrifices.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.600
We might think of Sula as the novel’s nightshade, “unusual” and compelling, but also at times “toxic.”

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.900
By contrast, Nel follows the more socially
sanctioned path of marrying and raising children.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.670
So we might think of Nel as the novel’s
blackberry, “common” and “nourishing.”

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.650
Except no!

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:17.880
Because this is a novel that exposes the limitations of binary thinking, and we're made to see throughout the novel how these opposites in many ways aren’t.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.480
Like, let’s look at the internal differences
within each of these characters.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.340
Consider how each reacts to the great traumatic
moment of their childhood.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.180
The girls are playing together in the grass on a river bank, and a little boy called Chicken Little appears in the trees.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.320
The girls tease him and playfully swing him
in circles.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.310
But then Sula loses her grip on Chicken Little,
and he falls into the water.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.080
“The water darkened and closed quickly over
the place where Chicken Little sank.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.560
The pressure of his hard and tight little fingers was still in Sula’s palms as she stood looking at the closed place in the water.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.820
They expected him to come back up, laughing.
Both girls stared at the water.”

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.860
The girls don’t tell anyone about their
role in the drowning.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.700
At Chicken Little’s funeral, they, “…held hands and knew that only the coffin would lie in the earth;

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.420
the bubbly laughter and the press of fingers
in the palm would stay aboveground forever.”

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.840
Nel is proud of her self-control that day,
but later, she realizes that

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.940
“what she had thought was maturity, serenity, and compassion was only the tranquility that follows a joyful stimulation.”

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.280
Nel had been excited and intrigued by the death – and that’s much more the stuff of nightshade than blackberry.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.460
And Sula is equally complex.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.820
Although she commits her unwilling grandmother to an institution, has multiple affairs with married men, including Nel’s husband,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.380
we're told that she secretly craves the “common” pleasures of a “nourishing” love.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:39.800
And as a child, Sula enjoys sitting in Nel’s formal living room for hours, which is as close as she can get to a normal life.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:48.280
And as an adult, she falls in love with a man named Ajax, and discovers “what possession was,” and loses her mental and physical health when Ajax leaves.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.540
These desires for stability, of a life inside the social order are much more the stuff of blackberry then nightshade.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.320
And although they have very different lives,
and make very different choices, Nel and Sula

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.600
are alike in such deep profound ways that at times there doesn’t seem to be a boundary between them.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.180
When the adult Sula returns to the “Bottom”
after ten years, Nel thinks:

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.000
“It was like getting the use of an eye back,
having a cataract removed.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.400
Her old friend had come home. Sula.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.280
Who made her laugh who made her see old things with new eyes, in whose presence she felt clever, gentle and a little raunchy.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.400
Sula, whose past she had lived through and with whom the present was a constant sharing of perceptions.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.880
Talking to Sula had always been a conversation
with herself.”

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.500
In the foreword to the 2002 edition of Sula, Morrison explains that she had been motivated by the following questions while writing the book:

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.170
“What is friendship between women when unmediated
by men?

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.730
What choices are available to black women
outside their own society’s approval?

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:51.540
What are the risks of individualism in a determinedly individualistic, yet racially uniform and socially static, community?”

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.940
Sula often considers “female freedom” in terms of sexual freedom, but the idea of freedom takes many forms throughout the novel.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:03.140
For Sula, freedom is defined by her “resistance
to either sacrifice or accommodation.”

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.150
But, of course, much is lost in the name of
never sacrificing or accommodating –

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.680
not least the damage done to the central friendship of both women’s lives when Sula sleeps with Nel’s husband.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.520
But then again, much is lost in Nel’s accommodation
to the social order.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.240
I mean, if you are looking for simple answers
on how best to lead a good life, look elsewhere.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.960
We've all imagined what it would be like to
have a wonderful life.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.480
What if I don’t go to college or get a job
or get married or acquire kids and a house?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:39.779
But Sula reminds us that there are losses and gains in any choice, and that the binary of the extraordinary life and the ordinary one is treacherous and profoundly false.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:43.540
And this is even more profoundly true for
people living within systems of oppression.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:51.340
Morrison later wrote of Sula, “Hanna, Nel, Eva, Sula were points of a cross – each one a choice for characters bound by gender and race.”

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.800
In the end, she wrote, “…the only possible
triumph was that of the imagination.”

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.200
So, what might a triumph of the imagination
look like?

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.410
Well, we can see it in Nel and Sula’s enduring
connection – the intensity of their friendship,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.460
the violence of their betrayals, and the power
of their mutual recognition.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:14.980
Sula eulogizes a community in which African Americans bonded together to withstand economic, social, and psychological hardships.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.680
But it’s hardly an idealized community.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.340
There’s violence within it, as well as scapegoating.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.380
Places are not merely good or merely bad any
more than people are.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.480
Morrison’s characters, like her places,
are troubled and triumphant, weak and strong,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.700
joyful and heartbreaking, but they’re never
just one thing or the other.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.800
And what makes Sula a masterpiece is its refusal
to give in to the seductions of simplification.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.740
Instead, it depicts the complexities and richness
of human connection.
