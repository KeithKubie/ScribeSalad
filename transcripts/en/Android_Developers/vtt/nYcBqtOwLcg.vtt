00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.440
Bokkers: I get really happy
when I'm riding somewhere

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.600
where there's nothing.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
To be out there just feeling it
as it is.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.320
I've done
over 150,000 kilometers

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.760
over land or over sea.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.240
I'm not a planner.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.960
I know a specific region
that I want to go to.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.960
And then from there,
I'm just gonna

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320
see what I see.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.960
I'm not going anywhere soon.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.760
My battery broke,
but we're here now.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.080
That's more like it.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.640
[rousing rock music]

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.320
I don't know where
I'm gonna sleep.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.000
I don't know what I'm gonna
eat or who I will meet.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.840
For me, that's the adventure.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.080
boy: Where are you from?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.680
Bokkers: I am from
the Netherlands.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.520
If you're open for that,
then the cool stuff happens.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.080
And maybe someday
I will look back at it

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.520
and feel like,
yeah, I've had a good life.
