00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.440
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Hello.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.180
It's not every day that
we get to have Lady Gaga

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.470
and RuPaul's Drag Race welcoming
us to the Coolidge Auditorium

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.780
so this is a great event.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.130
Good evening and Happy Pride.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.430
&gt;&gt; Woooo!

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.120
&gt;&gt; On behalf of the Librarian
of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.660
I want to welcome you to the
Library of Congress tonight.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.290
It's great to see
everybody here tonight

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.460
for what was a sold-out
event celebrating pride month

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.360
so we're very excited
about that.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.570
My name is Travis
Painter and I'm the chair

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.720
of the Library's LGBTQ+
employee organization,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.310
it's called LC Globe.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.470
LC Globe was organized 24
years ago and we are proud

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.450
to represent the
Library's LGBTQ+ employees.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.520
Within a quarter of a century,
LC Globe has provided resources

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.290
and information and supported
the Library's collections

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.080
by hosting educational,
cultural,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.340
and professional programs.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.310
We're excited to
co-host tonight's event

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.530
in celebrating a
brilliant author tonight.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.630
He's the writer of several
award winning novels,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.200
including the bestseller
"Call Me By Your Name,"

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.800
and that was adapted to an
Academy Award winning screenplay

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.390
and best picture nominee.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.640
We're honored to have
tonight Mr. Andre Aciman.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.980
We're eager to hear him talk
about the "Call Me" book

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.680
and movie, his memoire,
literary inspirations,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.190
and many other things.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.920
First I want to thank
our partners

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.260
who helped make this
evening a success.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.520
The LGBT Congressional
Staff Association, CSA,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.470
the Senate GLASS caucus,
and the organizers

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350
of Capital Pride, of course.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.410
I want to encourage you to
visit the Library's display

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.950
that we have out front
right when you came

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.630
and you probably saw it.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.460
We have amazing items from
our LGBT collection here

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.760
at the Library.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.030
We have iconic poetry from
Walt Whitman, we have some

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.670
of the manuscripts from the
founding of LGBT activism here

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.060
in Washington DC, Frank
Kameny, and we have the papers

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.650
of Jonathan Larson, he was the
composer of musical "Rent,"

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.320
and it has his handwritten notes

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.290
of how he did the
math tabulation

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.740
for "Seasons of Love."

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.190
525,6... Okay.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.150
525,600 minutes from the
song "Seasons of Love."

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.470
And so I hope you enjoy
that song being in your head

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.200
for the rest of the night.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.970
We want to remind you
that tomorrow along

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.840
with the Pride celebrations
for this week,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.540
we have another author coming
and it will be Becky Albertalli.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.900
She was the author of "Simon
Versus the Homo Sapien Agenda,"

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.100
and that also turned into
the movie "Love, Simon."

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.310
So we hope you can
join that as well.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.540
For tonight's event,
following the discussion,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.840
there will be a book signing
over in Little Pavilion,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.230
you passed it on
your way into this.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.390
And books will be for
sale so you're able

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.000
to purchase over there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.610
Andre Aciman is an
award-winning writer.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.540
He's the writer of many works of
short fiction and non-fiction,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.420
including his 1995
memoire "Out of Egypt."

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.370
And that won him
the Whiting Award.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.250
He's also the author of several
novels, including as we know,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.550
"Call Me By Your Name,"

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.770
which won the 2007
Lambda Literary Award.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.070
And his latest novel
"Enigma Variations."

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.060
The New York Times describes
Mr. Aciman and his work

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.170
as "a magnificent
and living thing."

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.740
And I think we all that have
read his books have found

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.040
that to be very true.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.760
He'll be interviewed
tonight by the Library

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.040
of Congress Chief Communications
Officer Roswell Encima.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.230
And like many of you, he
has read this book "Call Me

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.300
By Your Name" at least
three times and counting.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.280
So please help me
welcome now to the Library

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.510
of Congress Mr. Andre Aciman.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:18.510
[ "Mystery of Love" Playing ]

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well
good evening everyone.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580
Thank you for being here and
Happy Pride as Travis said.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.890
So we're so happy
that you're all here

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.190
at the Library of
Congress tonight.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.120
And of course, we're
here for this gentleman.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.920
So I'm hoping that
you're all anxious

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.860
to hear what he has to say.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.350
You're having such
a year, aren't you?

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.920
A bit of the past two years.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.220
How's it been?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.580
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Unusual.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.880
Very busy.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.320
But gratifying no end.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.740
I mean I never expected this.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.460
So it was wonderful.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.100
And basically the trick
is get a movie made,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.510
and then the rest
just falls into place.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well, as you
see, I've been a complete nerd

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.550
for the past two weeks and you
know, pouring through your books

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.850
with all these tabs and stuff.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.340
So my boss was very proud of me.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.240
Your uncle Billy said in your
memoir "Aren't we or aren't we?"

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.250
I think he used to say
this when he was boasting

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.950
about his success or
when he, you know,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.990
he did something really good.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.190
Could you be asking
yourself that now?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.490
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
Am I or am I not?

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.790
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.710
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: No, you
have to be sort of arrogant.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.400
In the most vile manner to
say "Eh, am I or am I not?"

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800
And it was a very
boastful thing to say.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.200
And when you heard him say it,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.630
it was like "Please,
don't say this.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.930
Don't boast.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.490
We don't boast in this family."

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.520
But he was all boast
and I don't boast.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.130
So, I'm saying, you know, I
wouldn't be writing the kinds

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.930
of books I write if I
were a boastful person.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.270
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well, for the folks

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.400
who haven't read your memoir,
it came out in the mid-90's,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.830
"Out of Egypt," it's about your
childhood when you were growing

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.450
up in Alexandria, Egypt.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.400
The characters between
your father, your mother,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.000
and all your extended family.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.830
There's a lot of fun
stories, a lot of sad stories,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.120
wrapped into the crisis
that was happening

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.420
in Egypt at the same time.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.270
How did that shape you
as a writer growing up?

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.150
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I think I
always wanted to be a writer

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.200
because one day I wrote a poem.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.060
I don't know why
I wrote the poem,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.950
but everybody says
"Oh, he's a poet.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.250
He's very good."

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.550
And it was a dreadful poem

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.860
because I read it
many years later.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.180
I said "How could you even
show it to your father?"

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.480
But they were all very pleased.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.860
And so I realized that
if I write more poetry,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.140
that I'll get more
sort of accolades.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.940
And in fact, they did.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.140
The stuff I wrote was gibberish.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.080
But it doesn't matter.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.060
But I did like the
idea of being a writer.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.950
And I think since I was 10
years old I was always invested

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.430
in the idea of becoming
a writer.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.550
I wanted to go to law
school and then I said

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.850
"You're going to be a lawyer?"

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.460
I was never going
to be a lawyer.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.120
I want to business school
and I thought about it,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.330
I can't even do anything
much less sell anything.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.680
And so it was always literature
for me, ever since I was a kid.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.100
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well
you talk about like a place

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.470
that doesn't exist anymore.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.770
And it's so beautiful.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.140
And you end the book by saying
you always hated the place

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.380
but on your last night,
you fell in love again.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.680
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I did.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.000
And that is one of the
biggest thing about writing.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.660
Is that essentially it can
change anything you say

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.180
in a minute.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.590
I wrote about Egypt,
where I suffered a lot,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.110
and at the very end of
the book, I say you know,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.490
here I am looking up to the sea,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.410
this is my last night
ever in my whole life.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.710
I knew that.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.010
In Alexandria.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.830
And Alexandria's never
going to be the same.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.780
And I never knew how
much I loved this city.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.400
Except that I had written

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.130
"I never knew how much
I hated this city."

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.580
And my editor said
"You can't do that!

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.640
You've been saying that you
loved and longed for this Egypt.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.940
And now you say you hate it?"

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.040
I said "You want
me to change that?"

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.440
And she said "Absolutely,
you have to change that."

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.740
I said "Fine."

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.040
So I crossed out
the word 'hated'

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.080
and I put in the word 'loved.'

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.190
And it was very easy.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.510
But that's what--
that's what writing does.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.000
You can make up things
as you go along.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.300
And that's the joy of it.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.880
Is that none of it
has to be true.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.070
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Is that
what attracted you to writing?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.680
The making up stuff?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.980
I'm-- just based on your memoir,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.980
you admit that you weren't
really good at school

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.280
when you were in Egypt.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.580
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I would
as terrible at school.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.880
I hated school.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.150
I still hate school
and I'm a professor.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.170
And I get total anxiety
in the fall.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.070
As soon as fall approaches, I
know school is going to start.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.830
Summer vacation is
over, I get anxious.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.610
And I look at my students, I
say "Aren't you guys anxious?"

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.250
"No, we are looking
forward to it."

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.430
Say what kind of
people are these anyway?

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.670
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So your
memoir was your first major

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.970
published book.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.270
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.570
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You had a
lot of essays and short stories

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.870
that you wrote afterwards.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.940
Then what was the tipping point
that you decide "It's time

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.240
for me to write a novel"?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.540
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I did.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.710
I wrote a chapter of a novel
about a man who meets a woman

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.250
at a party and they have
a-- they clearly are in love

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.520
or will be in love
or might be in love.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.820
I never made up my mind.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.430
But it was published
in the New Yorker.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.730
And I said "Okay."

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.240
And so publishers right away,
as soon as they see anything

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.960
in the New Yorker
they contact you.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.640
And they said "You
want a contract?"

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.410
So I said "Yes, I
do want a contract."

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.820
So we signed the
contract right away.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.120
I loved the contract.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.230
Then I started writing the book,
and it was a difficult book.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.420
Basically because the man and
the woman, I didn't want them

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.720
to have sex right away.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.100
I wanted them to
wait a few days.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.010
Which people looked at me every
time I told them the story they

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.950
said "how many days?"

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.370
And so eventually, I
needed to take a break.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.610
And so I started something else
called "Call Me By Your Name."

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.900
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well
speaking of sex, yes.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.580
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I
wasn't going to go there.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.430
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Well
I just want to point

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.120
out that you are a straight man.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.420
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.720
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.020
With a beautiful wife
and three grown kids.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.320
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.160
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: That said,
what, who were your inspirations

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.200
for these gay characters
and why did you decide

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.000
to make your first book
about gay characters?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.300
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
Well it started,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.250
it wasn't even a character.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.760
It started with a house.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.310
It was a house in Italy and I
was going to go to that house

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.130
in Italy and I was fantasizing
about the house and then I said

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.050
"Okay, there's going to
be a bit of romance."

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.200
And this is all happening while
I'm stopping this other novel

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.010
which I'm on contract for.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.920
So that's not out of my mind.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.890
So and then I said "Okay, it's
going to be boy and a girl

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.180
and he's 17 and she's whatever."

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.990
And then I said no, no,
no, he's going to have to,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.570
it's going to be two guys.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.090
And that, as soon
as that happened,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.070
as soon as that decision
was made,

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.130
I decided, I just got consumed.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.130
It just wrote itself.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.600
As if it was waiting since my,
you know, birth, to be written.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.470
And it wrote itself
in three months.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.770
And I was done.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.900
And I remember I was visiting
Washington with my family

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.130
and I'm reading in the train
the finished manuscript.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.430
And correcting it.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.230
And so it was done,
sometimes I think less

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.770
than three months actually.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.370
It was very, very fast.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.990
And then I went back
to the other book.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.290
It was a disaster.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.590
Nobody reads it.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.770
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Somebody
on Twitter actually asked

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.080
to ask you how do
you know everything

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.840
about the things that matter?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.550
I mean that goes back
to what Elio said,

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.690
it happened on page 72 here.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.990
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yeah.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.290
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: He says
"I know nothing, Oliver.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.660
Nothing, just nothing."

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.760
"You know more than everyone
around here," Oliver says.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.950
"Why was he returning
my mere tragic tone

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.910
with bland ego boosting?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.450
If he only knew how
little I know

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.910
about the things
that really matter."

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.210
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
Things that matter

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.470
in that particular context is
his, I don't know if it's love,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.210
lusting for, longing for.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.240
Oliver. That's what
really matters to him.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.480
At that point in his life,
this is all he cares about.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.080
And he's trying to hide it.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.880
And so they have
this conversation.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.700
Which wasn't easy to write.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.310
That was the only time that
I had difficulty writing

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.320
because I didn't want
him to say "Oliver,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.490
I think I'm falling for you."

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.310
Which would have been very
gawky and awkward and eugh.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.250
Okay. I wanted him to not want
to say, but it sort of slips

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.900
out of his mouth and the other
person immediately suspects

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.200
what's going on.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.920
Nobody knows, nobody
said anything.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.070
But they both know what
they were talking about.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.990
And I wanted it that way.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.550
But what really matters is
that he is longing for Oliver.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.850
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
You talk about longing

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.810
or you describe longing and
I guess lust in "Call Me

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.790
By Your Name" and
your latest novel

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.170
"Enigma Variations"
very beautifully.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.490
Actually one of the reviews
by the New York Times says

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.830
"Aciman writes arousal

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.510
so beautiful you miss
it when it's gone."

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.900
How do you feel about that?

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.200
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: It's
nice, it's very nice.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.530
I forgot that line but it
makes me like some kind

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.730
of profit of desire, you know?

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.250
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I
should say though, how,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.150
who inspired, or
what inspired you?

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.450
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
To write this book?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.750
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.550
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: There was,
when I was a boy, I was 9

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.070
or 10 years old and
I was in Egypt.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.940
And there was a beach area where
we rented the house every year.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.720
It was the same beach house.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.020
And right across the house,
there was a volleyball court

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.160
where people just go, gather in
the afternoon to avoid the sun.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.880
And then they would
play volleyball.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.180
And I was 9 or 10.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.420
And there was a guy who was
probably 17, 18 years old.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.720
I never knew.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.940
And I wanted to be his friend.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.230
And he was the macho
of the group.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.530
He commanded everybody,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.280
everybody followed
what he wanted to do.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.350
He was the captain of
the volleyball team.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.320
I was not even on
the volleyball team.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.520
But I wanted him
to be my friend.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.180
And it was very disturbing.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.370
Because I never quite
understood what it is

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.670
that I wanted from him.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.990
And I still don't know
what I wanted from him

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.970
because I knew nothing.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.620
And if I had suspected
something,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.030
I would have snuffed
it out right away.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.530
But I, that was the
inspiration for the story.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.540
It's about a boy or an
adolescent in this case,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.850
who has a very clear
longing for an older man.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.740
And I wanted it to be sexual
as opposed to just nothing.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.340
And that was the
seed of the story.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.190
And it went in its
own direction.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.590
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
talk about the title.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.120
Or the line in the book.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.420
"Call by my your name."

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.720
Where did this come from?

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.970
Because it's so tender
and very innocent.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.020
I think that's what we all
kind of like about the book.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.320
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
Well it's ideally,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.070
it's swapping of identities.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.400
It means call be my your
name, in other words,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.220
I want to have your name and
you're going to have my name.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.370
And we're going to
not know where I begin

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.370
and you end and whatever.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.830
But it came to me
because I had two friends

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.740
and they were a gay
couple, female gay couple,

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.420
and they had the same name.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:14.040
And so I mean, you think
I would make this up?

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.930
But they did have the same name.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.640
And they were very
close friends,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.350
one of them died eventually.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.320
But they had the same name
and I always wondered where,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.840
when they were having sex and in
a moment-- okay, I'll shut up.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.580
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Keep going!

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.010
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: No but I always
thought, "What do they say?"

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.410
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: That
may never be my problem.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.970
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: But
the idea came to me

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:48.070
that if they call each other,
and meaning the other person,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.100
what if they took a step
forward and when I call you such

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.920
and such which is your name,
it's really my name I'm using.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.250
And that swapping of identities.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.230
I think if you think about
it, the most beautiful thing

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:06.400
that can happen in life, it's
not lasagna and it's not Proust,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.820
it's none of those things.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.300
It is really being intimate
with another person.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.430
Being completely shamelessly
intimate with somebody else.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.260
In other words you have
no more inhibitions

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.620
because you've left them out.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.920
They've been out.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.020
And that I think is
the best thing in life.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.320
I can't think of
anything better.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.660
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And there's
so many instances in the book

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.540
that address that from the scene
in Rome to everything else.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.500
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Eventually I
had to go to vomit to toilet

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.400
and to everything just to make
the point if you didn't get it.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.050
And of course, don't
forget, fruit.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.970
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I'm not
sure if you're opening a window

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.700
for me to start talking
about that.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.650
We'll get there in
a second, though.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.090
So how much from your personal
life are the characters?

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.610
I know you could speak
French and Italian

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.500
and Greek and Elio does, too.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.800
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes, Elio does.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.100
He doesn't speak
French in the book,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.470
he speaks French in the film.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.700
But the film basically
figured it out.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.170
That you have a cosmopolitan
family.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.450
They are living in Italy
but they could be living

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.850
in North Africa as
far as I'm concerned.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:15.950
And that was a moment of genius
and necessity on the part

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.060
of the director who
figured there's got

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.030
to be something more
ample to give that family

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.750
and that's what they did.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.920
I am Elio, I am very
much like Elio.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.280
I'm hesitant, timid,
dividend, insecure,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.450
inhibited, the whole thing.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.010
And I think that's what Elio is.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.580
Oliver is somebody
totally different.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:41.720
Oliver is almost arrogant, he's
self confident, he is the kind

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.090
of person that I
never understood.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.390
People who are self confident,

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.110
I usually don't even
want to talk to them.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.480
Because there's nothing to say.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.590
They don't want you
to think too much.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.690
And so people ask
me all the time

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.430
"Could you please write
'Call Me By Your Name'

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.200
from the point of
view of Oliver?"

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.840
I said "Oliver would
never write a book!"

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.980
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
He'll correct you.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.280
So [inaudible] has called
"Call Me By Your Name"

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.580
like the successful gay novel.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.550
Or the successful
crossover gay movie.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.580
Over the weekend, there's
been a lot of discussion.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.930
Booker winner Allen Hollingshurt
says "The gay novel is dead."

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.160
Then a writer from
the Guardian came back

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.230
and says "Gay stories
still need to be told."

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.130
Last night I was at an author
event at Politics and Prose

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.120
with the latest Pulitzer prize
winner, Andrew Sean Greer,

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.420
and he piped in as well.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.920
And he says that there should
be no gay fiction or gay erotica

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.510
or gay non-fiction and that
they should all just be fiction.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.630
And non-fiction and erotica.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.600
Where do you stand on this?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.650
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Oh,
god, I don't know.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.530
It seems like basically
I think there was a time

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.430
when they said the
author was dead.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.450
Then the author turns out
not to have been dead.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.350
They said the novel was dead,
and the novel is not dead.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.650
We like novels.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.700
In fact, we like
19th century novels.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.000
[Inaudible], you know.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.710
I don't know.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.800
I think that people
want stories.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.080
Whether they're true or not,
the people love memoirs now.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.450
They're consumed.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.740
And so I think they're wrong.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.620
There's no such thing
as a dead--

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.950
I was told when I was writing
my other love story, "Oh,

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.070
nobody writes a love novel
any longer, those are dead."

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.830
Well they're not
dead because we want

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.330
to see romance in the movies.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.570
When you go on a
plane, you know,

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.490
"Notting Hill" is still
played all the time.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.790
It certainly is not dead.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.100
And there's "Love Actually"
also on the same thing

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.040
that you have to
click, whatever.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.560
So I usually go from
one to the other

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.270
and I've seen them
a million times.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.970
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: A friend of
mine describes both the book

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.920
and the movie as very positive.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.220
And I tend to agree.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.580
A lot of gay movies

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.610
or gay novels always
have, it's very tragic.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:58.910
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.210
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Either connected to AIDS

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.750
or they get beat up or just
something really awful happens

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.050
to them.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.580
But with this one, and with
some new novels like the author

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.880
that we have tomorrow,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.150
the "Simon Versus the Homo
Sapien Agenda," it's just love

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.590
and relationships and I think
whether you're straight or gay,

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.740
black or white, republican
or democrat, you can always--

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.040
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: No.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.160
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
-- relate to it.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.460
But do you agree with that?

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.760
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I certainly do.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.480
I think that, we
discussed this before.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:35.710
But basically the typical 19th
century opera always had a woman

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.940
who had basically
misled her life

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.930
or was leading the wrong life.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.530
And she has to die at the end.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.020
And she dies of tuberculosis.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.560
I mean this is the
typical ending, you know.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.370
She has a bad cold and she dies.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.950
She has to be put away.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.290
For those of you who have
seen the movie "High Noon,"

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.010
at the very end of the
film, the woman who's,

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.890
I think she is Latina, she
has to be gotten rid of.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.820
She takes the train and leaves.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.120
But she could have been killed.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.240
It would have had
the same effect.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.540
Basically you want to get rid

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.450
of the person who's
creating the problem.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.980
And as, I didn't want that.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.080
I wanted basically,
because it's a distraction.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.650
It is true that AIDS existed
and still exists and one has

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.890
to sort of deal with that.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.920
But eventually what really
matters to somebody who is young

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.670
and desires someone else,
it's, he wants to bring

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.460
about the object of his desire.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.430
Which is to have
sex with a person.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.730
And to have a relationship.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.920
So to have other things
coming in the way,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.820
it becomes a bit
of a distraction.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.060
A necessary distraction,
it's politically correct

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.360
to have that distraction.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.730
But fundamentally,
it's not necessary.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.230
And the beauty of a romance
is the fact that it can happen

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.210
in a household that welcomes it
among parents who are not going

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.420
to give you trouble, there are
nobody in the streets is going

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.130
to prevent you from
kissing in the street.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.850
Nobody's going to beat you up

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.880
and there's no AIDS
and whatever.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.420
And I wanted it then because
I wanted to focus on desire.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.030
And not fear.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.500
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Speaking
of accepting parents,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.730
I think I could probably speak
on everybody here in the room,

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.030
one of the best parts

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.590
of the book is the father's
monologue towards the end.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.390
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yeah.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.270
[ Applause ]

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.570
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: As
a gentleman who came

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:27.870
out in his 20's, I was hoping

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.410
that my father would give
me the same monologue

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.790
if he was alive today.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.190
What was your inspiration
for that speech?

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.760
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: It
was actually my father.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.330
Because my father was a very,
very open-minded person.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.910
I've said this in public,
I mean, in the 1960's

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.800
when we had all the
sexual revolution,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.170
he used to make fun of it.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.470
He says "What's new?

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.190
What are they saying
that's new?"

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.490
Basically "So?"

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.230
And my father said essentially,
he was always telling me,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.060
"You have to go and
sleep with someone.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.070
This is not going
to go on, okay?"

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.170
Because I was always
reading books.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:07.080
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And I think
Elio's father tells him the

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.380
exact same thing.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.680
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Exactly.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.980
And I showed my father
the passage, I said,

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.280
"Do you recognize yourself?"

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.440
And he did, he did, he
was dying at the time

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.410
but of course that's
a different issue.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.570
But the point is that
my father was such--

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.390
he was a brilliant man,
he was extremely well read

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:25.960
and had been a great
business man

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.180
so he had both ends
of the spectrum.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.880
And he was a womanizer.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.180
There's no question.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.580
My mother didn't
like that very much.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.160
But she didn't have much choice.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.050
But my father had once given me
a piece of advice which stayed

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.680
with me for the rest of my life.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.020
He says that "Whatever
you do with a human being,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.860
once your clothes are off,
there is no shame left."

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.400
In other words, nothing that
you do naked is wrong as long

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.700
as you don't kill somebody.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.180
But essentially that was
such a freeing thing.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.980
He said once your clothes are
off, then everything is okay.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.150
There's nothing you
should be ashamed of.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.940
If you think about it,
there are certain things

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.480
that we might want to do--

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.580
but my father said "Don't
even think of it, do it."

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.880
And--

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.180
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Before we take questions

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.310
from the audience, I wanted to
hear your take on the movie.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.620
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Okay.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.450
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: How do
you feel about the ending?

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.750
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: The ending.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.250
When I heard about the ending,
because the director said

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.030
as we are walking
through the piazza

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.770
and he's mining a
million things, "Oh,

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.660
at the end of the movie, we're
going to have Elio looking

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.150
into the camera and he's
going to be crying."

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.730
And of course I said
well, that's very nice.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.440
I told the director of course
I'm muttering to myself,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.700
"Who wants a boy crying?"

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.350
Because that was
not in the book.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.070
And it's not the kind of
movie I would have envisioned.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.370
Crying in front of the camera

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.580
because he's brokenhearted,
really?

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.210
That got me a bit annoyed.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.510
But then I saw the film.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.790
And oh my god, this is a
better ending than my book.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.110
And I told him that.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.560
I've said that to him twice

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.380
because he didn't
believe me the first time.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.050
It is an amazing ending.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.910
We've never seen an
ending of a film like that.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:10.400
In other words, it
was such a long wait.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.750
For those who didn't
know the story,

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:15.110
you had no idea where
it was headed.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.920
and that is a wonderful,
because you just are incubating

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.220
in this Italy thing for a while.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.720
And you don't know
where we're going.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.210
And suddenly, you have a
moment in which Elio realizes

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.860
that he's really interested,
more than he had let on.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.120
And then you have the
very ending of the movie,

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.510
which takes about three to
four minutes of actual sort

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.030
of staring into a camera.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.330
Where have you ever seen that?

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.630
With the music in
the background.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.810
And I thought it was
a wonderful ending.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.630
Because it wasn't just moving,
it was, I think it was a moment

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.360
of recollection for Elio.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.470
To basically, he's going
through the whole episode

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.990
of their summer together
and then suddenly,

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.990
as you're watching the
scene, and I don't know,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.000
how many of you have
seen the film?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.450
Oh, okay. Fine.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.130
But basically at some moment,
it's a wonderful moment,

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.900
because suddenly, and this
has never happened before ever

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.260
in my life, you see
the credits coming on.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.820
And as soon as you see the
credits you say "Oh my god,

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.620
this is the end of the movie.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.280
The story is over.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.900
Oh gosh." Basically because
you thought maybe there's hope,

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.720
maybe something is
going to happen.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.270
And as soon as you see the
credits, there's a kind

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.490
of finality about
credits and they come

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.020
in very softly, unannounced.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.620
There's no clamorous
music in the background

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.610
where that's the
end of the movie.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.490
You pick up your coat
and you want to leave.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.790
Here you don't.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.510
And so you want to stay
until the very, very end.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.410
I thought it was a
wonderful ending.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.350
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Who read the book?

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.650
But I mean, there's
that whole part in Rome.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.520
The whole [inaudible] syndrome.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.510
I mean, I think it
kind of illustrated

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.890
of what could have been.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.680
And I felt like that's what
was missing from the movie

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.820
and I kind of wanted
to see that more.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.370
Do you feel the same
way or is that just me?

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.930
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Well, when
I met James Ivory and Luca,

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.060
I met them together
in a restaurant.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.580
And they said "This
is what we want to do,

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.920
we're really very excited."

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.350
Yeah, of course they
have to tell me that.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.230
Okay. And I'm going
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.530
They say "Well, we're
going to sort

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.190
of dilute the scene in Rome."

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.940
I said "Well that's
fine, yeah, go ahead."

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.000
"Actually, we're going to
reduce it quite a bit."

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.310
I said "Yeah, sure,
I can see that.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.720
That's fine with me."

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.020
"Well, actually Andre,

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.160
we're going to eliminate
it altogether."

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.040
And I'm going "Okay, fine,
you know, it's fine."

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.560
But it also explains why there's
a need and talk of a sequel.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.890
Because the Roman part

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.090
for me was the most
intellectually satisfying.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.590
Because nothing happens in Rome.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.980
But they are together
and they're going

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.770
from one restaurant to
a bar to a book reading

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.550
to a company together.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.600
And you suddenly have
the feeling that Elio

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.460
for the first time in his life
is among adults and he says

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.900
"This is the life I've wanted."

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.080
To just be in Rome on
a evening with people

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.580
who have read all the
books in the world

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.520
and know all the
music in the world.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.340
"And I'm among my own."

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.390
And he's there, and
he's with Oliver.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.830
And people are talking
about them.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.140
"Look at these two,
they're totally in love."

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.810
And basically it's the most
welcoming thing he's ever seen.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.920
So that part is missing
from the movie.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.280
And so they moved
it to [inaudible].

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.340
And it's a shorter scene.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.580
But I understand that
the Roman thing can eat

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.030
up the whole movie.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.440
And it made perfect
sense to avoid it.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.740
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You
mentioned a sequel.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.710
Do you think there's enough
there to make a sequel

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.900
between the scenes in
Rome and the flash-forward

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.450
at the end of the book?

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.560
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: The sequel is
going to be a bit of a problem.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.090
Because you're going to have
to bring in novel information.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:00.150
And that makes me a bit nervous
because it might be districting

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.280
from what is actually
the story itself.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.920
So that the story
might move elsewhere.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.180
And we don't know
where that might be.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.730
And we still don't know that
there is going to be a sequel.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.030
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
I mean there's talk

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.410
that they may fold
in the AIDS crisis.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.710
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes,
he wants to do that.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.840
Because he's been told
"There's no AIDS here.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.140
What are you going to do?"

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.360
And okay, fine, we're
going to have AIDS, okay.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.890
But it's still up with talking.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.190
We're just talking, so.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.430
I have no idea if it's
ever going to happen.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.010
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Speaking of the movie,

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:36.650
how many of you caught
that he's in the movie?

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.190
He's, if you watch it again,
he's one of the two guests,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.990
you know the couple
that was gay?

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:48.300
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.540
I honestly caught it on my
third time I watched it.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.840
I didn't really notice
it at first.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.160
How was that?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.460
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: It was
the most brilliant piece

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.510
of acting in the movie.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.580
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.440
No, it was, basically I arrived
in Italy, they said "We want you

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.990
on the set," so I said
"Well I'm going to go to--

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.110
", we arrived in Milan, and
so I said "I'm going to sleep"

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.410
because I wanted to catch up.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.710
He said "No, he wants
you right now."

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.730
So I go there and they say
"We want you in the movie."

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.480
I said "What do you
want me to do?"

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.200
They had asked for my size

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.480
and I never understood
why they wanted my size.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.700
But they put me in
this ridiculous custom

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.690
and because I made the
characters ridiculous.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.990
There was a reason.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.860
And then my partner
has the same suit on.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.970
So we both look totally
ridiculous.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.500
And he's the producer of
the film, the partner.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.200
So we were like basically, as
I like to say "free talent."

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.120
Talent is in quotation marks.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.420
But it was wonderful.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.970
It was a lot of fun.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.970
I was not nervous,
he said, you know,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.950
"You can say whatever you
want, it doesn't matter."

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.250
And I did.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.550
And it was a lot of fun.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.850
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well it looked

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.150
like you were having
a lot of fun.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.450
How many takes did you do?

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.750
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Four.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.050
Which was nothing, if
you think about it.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.350
But it wasn't that important.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.650
It was almost incidental.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.630
But it brought up something
about Elio which is,

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.420
I thought that the scene was
important for me as a writer

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.490
because I wanted to have the
cliche gay couple come in.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:22.420
And as the father says "Do you
dislike them because they're gay

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.350
or is it because
they're ridiculous?"

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.580
So, and they are ridiculous.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.560
And what I wanted
is on the same night

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.180
that these two guests are
there being whatever they are,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.380
ridiculous or whatever,
they're a good couple, upstairs,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.120
Elio and Oliver are going to
have their first night together.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.420
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Midnight
was going to happen that night.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.720
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.360
And so I wanted the
contrast to be there.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.970
And they kept it.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.630
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I know
everybody here probably wants

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.700
to ask, now they know that
you were in the movie,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.560
how was it with, you know, Armie
Hammer and Timothee Chalamet?

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.860
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: You know what?

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.530
They're wonderful people.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.360
Armie Hammer called
me Mr. Aciman.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.660
I said "Are you joking?"

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.480
I mean he's very nice.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.430
And so Timmy is also very nice.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.800
He went to school in the same
school where my kids went.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.740
So it's a whole upper
west side thing.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.650
And lovely, lovely,
lovely both of them.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.960
And Michael Stahlberg
is also very nice.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.510
He's much younger than
he looks in the film.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.440
And I felt he should have
gotten an Oscar for that part.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.230
Just for the monologue,
just for the-- he needed it.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.250
It was the best thing
I've seen in years.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.800
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I love
that you call him "Timmy."

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.300
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Ti-mo-thee.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.600
Okay.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.900
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So,

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.200
let's take some questions
from the audience.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.750
I know you're dying
to hear from everyone.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.030
So there's going to be people
running around with microphones

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.520
like Phil Donahue and Oprah.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.570
So. I'll let you point to them.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.740
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: This is the
first time I see the audience.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:55.630
Whoa, there's a lot of you.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.880
&gt;&gt; So after I read the
book the second time,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.840
I read "Enigma Variations."

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.110
And I was really struck
by the intersection

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.410
between the two books,

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.550
especially because the San
Clemente syndrome discussion

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.890
in Rome at the end of
"Call Me By Your Name" is

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:13.730
about bisexuality, which is
a theme of Enigma Variations.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.000
I'd love to hear how you
think the two books connect

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.010
to each other and especially
about the first section

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.310
of Enigma Variations,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.970
which seems very
parallel to young Elio.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.620
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: The first
section of Enigma Variations,

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.320
for those of you, I'm not
going to give away the story,

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.380
but it is about a young
boy who's 12 years old

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:40.920
who has a crazy, crazy crush
on a man who's in his late 20's

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.480
who is a cabinet maker and comes

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480
to their house to
fix the furniture.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.070
And he goes and visits the
cabinet maker's shop almost

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.640
every day eventually
after he has his tutorial

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.130
in Greek and Latin.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.150
Because he failed his exam.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.010
And his mother makes him feel
very badly about having failed,

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.720
she hates him, whatever.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.060
It is the same story
in many respects.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.550
It's as if I hadn't
worked out something

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.020
in "Call Me By Your Name."

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.570
It's in Italy, it's sort
of the same situation,

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:16.310
except the boy has no
sense of what sex is.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:20.640
Now kids at 12 know everything
there is to know about sex.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:25.960
When I was 12, I knew
absolutely nothing.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.090
I'm not going to be specific.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.690
But you understand.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:36.780
The reason why is because
it was that same story again

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.070
with that guy already who
when I was 8, 9 years old,

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:45.040
and I was very interested
in becoming his friend.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.850
And I wanted to play that again.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.760
It's as if I hadn't finished it.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.710
I hadn't worked it out.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.470
Enigma Variation, as
Call Me By Your Name,

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.400
assumes that everybody
is bisexual.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.180
And that is a given in the text.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.840
Now you may agree, you may
disagree, that's another story.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.460
But the fact is that in
Call Me By Your Name,

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.870
Elio has a girlfriend,
it's in the book,

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.240
he has seen prostitutes
before that in the city.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.740
And it's done very sort
of cagily but it's there.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.860
And you don't know what the rest
of his life is going to be like.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.480
You have no idea
that when he speaks

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.780
of subsequent love
affairs whether it's

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.770
with men, women, or both.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:31.000
And you have the same
feeling about Oliver as well.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.370
There's a moment in Call Me
By Your Name for those of you

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.630
who read the book when Elio
goes to visit him at school

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.500
and Oliver doesn't
recognize him.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.720
And he immediately suspects

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.970
that they may have met
in a very lush place.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.900
And suddenly it goes away

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.300
because he suddenly
realizes it's Elio.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.630
But I wanted that, these sort
of insinuations to be in place.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.700
And in Enigma Variation,
it's the same thing.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.190
He has a girlfriend, he's in
love with a man, he's in love

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.170
with a girlfriend, again.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.600
She tells him that he
should go back to his man

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.010
because that's where he belongs.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.850
And eventually there's
another revelation

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.210
at the very end of the book.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.510
So you have a sense

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.150
that everything is open,
everything is fluid.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.760
And I do believe that
everything is fluid.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.060
In everything.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.680
My nationality, my religion,

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.080
everything about me
has always been fluid.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.740
And I believe that that's,
if ever I had a place,

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.810
it would be in no man's
land between two opposites.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.110
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
You mentioned faith.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.150
Many, most of your books,
including Call Me By Your Name,

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.040
faith has a big part of it.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.410
Is that a conscious
decision, or?

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.710
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Faith.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.270
I am Jewish.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.790
And I don't practice
Judaism at all.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.140
I was not bar mitzvah'd,
I was asked.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.440
And I said no.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.360
Okay. That's my father.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.120
And I don't believe
in any Jewish rituals.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.120
I've been to more churches
than I've been to synagogues.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.630
And in fact, I avoid
all religious houses.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.200
The house of the lord is not
for me, I'm not interested.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.550
And so except that
there's a sort of,

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.800
a sort of a spasmatic appearance
of Judaism in most of my books.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And
they both, Elio and Oliver,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.420
connected because of this.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.720
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.980
It's as if there was some
sort of connection or bridge

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.690
between them that was there
before even they recognize each

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:31.130
other, the Jewishness was a sort
of a statement of some affinity

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.230
between them that they
don't realize they have.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.330
But that's never been
the case with me.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.150
I know that when I met my
wife, I went out with her

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.280
because I had forsworn
going out with Jewish women,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.600
I was never going to go out
with a Jewish woman again.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.030
And I thought she was Catholic.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.430
And so I started speaking
about Christianity.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.370
And she goes "I don't know
about this, I'm Jewish."

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.670
And I said "Oh god."

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.310
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
take our next question here.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.310
&gt;&gt; Great, thanks so much for
being here and for writing

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:05.770
such a wonderful novel.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.870
One of my favorite parts of the
book, which is hard to translate

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.740
to any movie, is your use of
various literary references.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.000
You know, Elio is very well read

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.630
and cites a lot of
different authors.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.820
And I was wondering if you
could comment more about that.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.540
Particularly the use of Dante,
you know, an Italian poet, who,

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.770
you know, puts homosexuals
in one of his circles of hell

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:34.060
and so, but like reclaiming
some of that language to tell

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.020
of their love story
is very powerful.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.850
I was just wondering if you
could comment more on the use

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.460
of that reference
and any others.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.410
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Well,
Dante's references

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.560
to homosexuals, there's
quite a few.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.150
I think in 15 and 16.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.130
And he's extremely nice.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.580
Very kind to his teacher,
who was a homosexual.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:00.470
But I find that literary
references are sometimes,

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.470
they're not an attempt
on the part of an author

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.950
to show off his novel.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.470
That would be very bad.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:07.770
It's in bad taste.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.330
It's as if saying that Montagne
was showing off every time he

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.250
quoted a Latin or Greek writer.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.550
That's not the case.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.130
It is a shortcut to a
bigger piece of information

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.890
that an author doesn't want
to get into, but he assumes

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.980
that you will understand
the reference.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.660
If you don't get the
reference, it doesn't matter,

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.300
it doesn't change the
story in the slightest bit.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.340
I mean there's a line by
[inaudible] in the book itself,

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:37.760
Call Me By Your Name, which
is a beautiful verse about,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.840
it's between "never and always."

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.440
Actually it's between
always and never.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.420
And I always believed
that this is where I live.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.470
Between the always,
I've always wanted you,

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.840
I've always loved you,
and I will never have you.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.130
You know? That's really
what I write about.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:40:01.180
So references are plentiful, but
they're not meant to intimidate

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.850
or to offend or to infuriate,
as some people have said.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.130
The most important reference,
and I'm just going to say this,

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.820
is the third chapter, which
is in Rome, and it takes place

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.670
where they're all
having dinner together.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.110
It's very much of a banquet.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.760
And eventually somebody comes in
whose head have arrived earlier

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.140
but he got lost in his car.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.510
And he's drunk now and he
comes in now and makes a speech

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.950
about whatever, desire
and whatnot.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.850
And the whole thing is taken
out of Plato's Symposium.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.480
Now do you need to know that?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.290
No. I'm having fun
as an author with it

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.310
because it says something
that I want only the people

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.920
who know to appreciate.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.520
And trust me, nobody has.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.970
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We'll
take a next question here.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:05.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wanted to ask you,
I was living in Florence

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.300
when this movie came out.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.880
And I was actually trying to
avoid it because I didn't,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.090
I was told by a friend of mine
that it was this huge love story

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:15.910
and I was going through
a break-up

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.490
and I was trying to
stay away from it.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.330
And I got dragged
into the theatre

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.540
and this amazing thing
happened in Florence

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.690
where suddenly just
the rainbow kind

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.490
of came out of the woodwork.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.590
It was hiding while I was
there for most of the time

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:30.890
and I hadn't seen it

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.270
and I hadn't been near
it in a long time.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.370
And I didn't realize
how much I missed it.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:39.710
In what way do you look
at your work as operating

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:45.200
in this global space
and in what way--

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.290
I don't know, what I'm
trying to ask I guess.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:52.770
Because I mean, in China
it got rejected from,

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.070
or there was a conversation
about pulling it

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.640
from the itinerary
of a film festival.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.470
So I mean, in what way do you
view your work as operating

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.160
in this global, public
space and--

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.460
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: In this globe?

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:04.760
I'm sorry.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.240
I'm having a hard time because
there's a lot of resonance.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.540
&gt;&gt; It's okay.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.920
In what way do you view
your work as opening spaces

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.740
and what do you think
about the reaction

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.360
that this piece is getting
on the global scale?

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.660
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Oh.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.960
Let me put it this way.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.900
I'm a very self conscious
author.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.290
In other words, there's
very little that I say or do

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.940
that I haven't mulled
quite a bit.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.010
Even if it's done very fast.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.910
I think I'm maybe one of the
few writers, and this is going

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.920
to sound terribly
arrogant, I don't mean to be,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.100
who really know what
they're doing.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:53.080
Many authors will tell you
that "I know what I'm doing."

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.630
And maybe I don't
know what I'm doing.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:00.820
But for me the most important
thing is the sentences.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.120
The style.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.930
What does the style
do to someone?

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:08.080
In other words, if
you're a decent writer,

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.210
anything you say provided it's
done within a certain kind

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.790
of style, with a particular
kind of rhythm and cadence,

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:19.930
whatever it is, what you're
asking a reader to do is

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.850
to follow in your footsteps.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.150
You're giving them your hand.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.450
You're walking them.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.750
And you say "Okay, now
we're going to stop

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.140
because there's a comma here.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.570
But don't stop walking, we'll
take another few steps further.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.430
Now there's a semi-colon, we're
going to stop a bit longer,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.920
now catch your breath."

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.580
But once you do that to a
reader, what you're forcing them

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.650
to do is to believe everything
you say, trust in what you say,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.620
and basically open up to you.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.310
Basically, to use a cliche,

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:56.010
you're introducing the
reader to himself, herself.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.900
That's the point of
the whole exercise,

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.670
as far as I'm concerned
as a writer.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:05.810
Is I'll say things about myself,
and lay myself open to whatever.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.130
But in fact what I'm trying
to do is by doing that,

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:13.890
I'm forcing you, or at least
inviting you, to open yourself

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.050
up to what I have to say.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.950
And at some point,
we become really

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.790
like very, very close friends.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.050
And you're saying you know, I've
always known this about myself,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.630
I've known it, you're
not telling anything new.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.590
But I never quite considered it.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.220
And I think that's what I
want to bring to people.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.530
So it takes a lot of work
because it's all, in my case,

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.760
it's all not in the
story, not in the plot,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.150
there's hardly any plot in
anything I write, it's not even

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.830
in the characters, whether
they're flamboyant or not,

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.530
it's all in the style.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.380
And that's why I said, an author

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:53.110
who doesn't understand style
should maybe go back to school.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.150
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You talk
about Italy a lot in the book.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:57.450
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.750
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I should say

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.360
that country should
give you a sort of award

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.700
because I'm assuming you
increased tourism there.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.000
I know--

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.300
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: People
go to [inaudible] now.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.600
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: There's
a lot of [inaudible] going

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.580
and even touring the
house or the villa

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:09.880
where the movie was shot.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.180
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Yes.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.480
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I understand
it's for sale and people are--

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.780
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman:
Nobody's buying it

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.400
because it needs a lot of work.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.810
But no, I think that Italy

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.830
for me is really a
metaphor for the body.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.870
For pleasure, for desire.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.640
For all those wonderful things

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.170
that basically make
life worth living.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:34.300
And for love.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.050
&gt;&gt; Music plays a large
role in the book.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.620
And music plays a very, very
large role in the movie.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.900
So I was wondering if you could
talk about your relationship

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.340
with music, do you play
instruments, or, and then talk

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.360
about how you brought
it into the book

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.760
and also what you thought
of the filmmaker's choices

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.170
and the selections that
were included in the film.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.470
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Sure.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.770
Well let me start
with the selection.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.370
Because I've gone
public with this.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.770
When Luca Guadagnino told
me they were going to,

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:03.890
that Sufjan Stevens was
going to compose two songs,

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.470
I said "Oh, that's great."

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.850
The problem is that I had never,

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.820
ever heard of who
Sufjan Stevens was.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.300
Never even known, I said
I was being nice, okay?

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.690
And so I went, I spoke to one
of my sons and he said "Oh,

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.260
he's very famous, how
could you not know?"

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.020
So and it was not,
I mean for me,

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.920
the book has only
classical music.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.430
And all my books have a
lot of classical music

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:33.430
because for me it's one of the
ways in which I punctuate what,

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.710
again, same thing as
literary references.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.130
You punctuate what is important
to that particular sensibility

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.840
in the book or in the
voice of the character.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:48.710
But I think that the music
that was played, I don't even

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.130
like John Adams, the composer.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.770
I know that Luka adores him.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.050
So we don't get along
on that, big deal.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:59.820
But I do think that the use of
the piano music at the beginning

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.380
of the film is magnificent.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.980
And I think the closing song

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.110
by Sufjan Stevens is
absolutely amazing.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:10.790
In fact, I own the music, I
listen to it occasionally.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.480
And it works.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.780
It's the soundtrack.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.450
Even the Italian songs
in the film I like.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.420
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So
you must be very happy

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.030
that they pretty much verbatim
copied what was in the book

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.710
and translated it into the
movie, that whole piano scene.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:29.280
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Oh yeah, yeah,
that was, that's the Bach,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.160
[inaudible] and [inaudible]
thing.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.950
I love that the thing,
they kept it.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:37.140
And I think they did it
so well because at some--

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:42.270
I didn't have that in the book,
but when Elio plays the music

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:46.140
with another variation, this
kind of savage [inaudible] one,

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.690
Oliver says "Okay,
okay I get the point."

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.150
So he walks out.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.680
And at that point he plays
it the way Bach would have

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.980
written it.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.620
And Oliver comes back into
the room and sits down.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:01.350
And it's a wonderful,
intimate moment between them.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.650
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Beautiful.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.950
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: I was
very happy that they kept--

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.400
they kept a lot of the
stuff from the book.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.570
So how could you not be happy?

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.510
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Let's
take another question.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.700
&gt;&gt; Mr. Aciman, thank you
for being here tonight.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.540
This is actually a good time for
the question that I had in mind.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:23.490
The life of the mind plays a
central role in the relationship

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.820
between Elio and Oliver.

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.920
They share language and
music and sculpture.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.220
They banter back and forth.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:36.970
That could have been about
tourism or food or sports.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.990
It could have been anything
that they might have in common

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.980
that you could have
expounded upon.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.050
Why did you choose culture?

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.290
What's special about culture
in the life of the mind

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.060
in a romantic relationship?

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.370
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Good question.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.160
First of all, I know
nothing about sports.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.270
I don't. I just, I
don't, I can't stand

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.070
when I hear it in
the background.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.540
I just don't like sports.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.000
The best I can do is watch
tennis and then I get bored.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.450
And I play tennis, so.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:15.810
I do like performing, but
I, the whole sort of--

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:18.550
I think that culture is
the only thing I know.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.300
And so I wanted characters

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:27.170
who would basically not fear
basically discussing culture

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.540
with one another.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.580
And because culture is
the highest thing I know.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.460
I mean, and I treasure it.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.070
Classical music, classical text.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.440
The canon for me is
extremely important.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.300
These are things that I consider
are the base of a relationship.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.940
It can be of course, if they
were both interested in pugilism

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.470
and they wanted to discuss
it, that would be fine, too.

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:51.780
It would bring them together.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.340
But I know nothing about boxing.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.290
So, that's out of the question.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.610
But they do discuss
enough culture.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:03.000
And Elio is so well read
that he mentions people

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.730
that Oliver had never heard

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.650
of who had just discovered
a few weeks earlier.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.280
And he's impressed.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.610
And yet Elio knows
that, you know,

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.170
all this culture doesn't
add up to anything.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:18.210
Because what really matters to
me are the things that matter.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.510
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: What
things that matter?

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.810
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: The
things that matter

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.310
between you and me basically.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.360
And I think that's a reduction.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.270
So it's, again, it's not that
I'm elitist, it's what I know.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.470
And I felt very comfortable
moving from [inaudible] to Homer

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.540
to Heraclites to all that stuff.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.840
It was comfortable for me.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.550
It was easy.

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.850
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We
probably have time for two

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.970
to three more questions here.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:42.640
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.940
Bonsoir, Monsieur.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.140
Thank you for being
here tonight.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.380
I mean your movie, your novel
has really changed my life,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.680
I have to say.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.180
I just want to say I
came, I just arrived

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.790
from Switzerland a
couple of hours ago.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.570
I'm here actually for
business but my friend Kim here

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.180
from the Facebook group told me

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.080
that this event was
taking tonight place

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.630
so this is just an example of
how you bring people together

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.340
from around the world.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.280
My first question is are
you going to come to Europe

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.700
at some point to give
talks like these tonight?

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.120
And my second question is you
were speaking about a sequel,

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120
you were talking about a sequel.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:22.030
If you're familiar
with Before Sunrise?

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.980
Takes place in Vienna,
which is my hometown.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:29.160
And it sort of has some
similarities maybe if you talk

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.500
about the chapter in Rome
and Before Sunrise and maybe

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.860
that could be an
idea for a sequel.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.530
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Thank you.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.790
That's a good question.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.910
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Actually yes,
it's a very good question.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.480
And the thing is that Luca
Guadagnino, the director,

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:48.350
has brought up you know,
the triple series of films.

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.890
And also the Before
Sunset and After Sunset

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.860
and whatever it is in between.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.700
And that is a model for a
story that is not ending.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.970
And that we don't
want it to end.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.460
One of his arguments is
that he's trying to wait

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.670
for the actors to age a bit

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.650
so that he can capture them
slightly later in life.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.920
And that's a terrific idea.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.370
Then the other one is
I am going to Europe.

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.930
In fact in a couple of weeks.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.280
And I'm going to be all
over Italy to speak.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.520
And I adore speaking in Italian
because it makes me very happy.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.700
Even though I make a lot of
mistakes, but it doesn't matter.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.730
And then there are other
places that I'm mostly going

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:32.720
to South America as well.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.620
So I mean, there's
something going on.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.890
And it's not unusual, I'm sure
the Godfather has played all

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.190
over the world.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.020
And I like the Godfather
because whenever I see it

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.890
on TV, I'll watch it.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.900
But there's something
in this story

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:53.320
that basically moves people
beyond their borders in a way.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:58.350
And that appeals to them and
tells them there's some form

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:02.870
of love out there
that is desired.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:06.330
And not just to be
respected and tolerated,

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.390
but that is actually desired.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.490
And when people love to see
that, and they respond to it.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:15.630
I mean the ironic thing is that
in China, it was slated to be

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:18.870
in the Beijing Film
Festival, then they sort

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:20.320
of removed it from that.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.980
And the Chinese people who have
read my book, there are many,

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.400
many of them, and they
watch it all illegally

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.560
on their computers, you know.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.140
And I have never had a problem

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.530
with people downloading
my books and whatever.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:33.830
I don't care.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.800
You know, the technology
exists, take advantage

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.510
of it, that's the end of it.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.090
I have no problem with that.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.520
But it is a wonderful thing to
hear that people who are living

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.400
in countries where they
cannot watch this film

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.180
or read this book
basically have to go

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.490
through all kinds
of shenanigans.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.500
They can't even order, I have a,

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:58.160
I met a kid from Iran who's
translating the book in Persian

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.750
and I said "But you can't
sell this book in Persia."

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.270
He says "Doesn't matter,
people will read it anyway"

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.970
because there's this
whole network of people

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:08.640
who basically pass information
from one to the other.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.550
And it's wonderful.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:15.780
It's almost like Tiananmen
Square happening again.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.740
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Two
more questions here.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.980
&gt;&gt; Hi, yes, again, thank
you so much for being here.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:27.880
And I wanted to talk about the
narration, which I feel is one

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.800
of the most appealing
aspects of the novel.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.130
Elio's narration.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:34.710
I think you tap in very well

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:38.630
to the hypersensitivity
of first love.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:42.410
So I think my question
to you is do you see Elio

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.650
as an unreliable narrator?

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.850
Is he somebody that projects
his insecurities onto Oliver

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:51.040
and his family and friends?

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.790
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: The
answer is I don't know.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:54.950
Because you don't have
enough information.

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:59.850
The unreliable narrator
is also dead, by the way.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.420
I don't know if he's unreliable.

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.520
What I wanted him to
do is make mistakes.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.010
He, basically when he assumes

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:13.520
that Oliver has a
particular personality

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.550
when he's wearing
his red bathing suit,

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:17.280
but when he wears the
green bathing suit,

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.710
he is more welcoming,
and blue is even better,

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.310
and yellow you don't know.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:26.120
Okay, he knows he's
interpreting in the void.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.570
He knows that this is not true.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:32.120
But he likes to see patterns
because when you're in love

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.010
with someone, and desire
someone, you cannot say anything

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.470
to them, you want to understand
what their life is like.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:43.140
So you're trying to take
guesses at what are they doing?

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.440
Who are they really like?

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.470
And there's a wonderful scene
in the book where he says

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.090
"I know he sees other
people at night.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.920
I don't know mind,
I'm not jealous

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.400
that he's with other people.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.900
I just don't want him to turn

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.010
out to be somebody
totally different

00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.310
when he's with other people.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.900
I want him to be
the Oliver I know."

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.020
And that's I think the biggest
danger when you're jealous

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.740
of somebody who is
cheating on you is

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.500
that they become
somebody totally different

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.250
with different people.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:13.550
You want them to be the same.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:15.400
Okay cheat on me all you
want but as long as I know

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.750
that you are who you
are consistently.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:21.690
So I, he's interpreting.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.640
That's-- it is about
adolescent love but it's also

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.410
about adolescent love when it is
constantly trying to make sense

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:33.040
of what it is, and what
the other person is doing.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.470
And it's constant
interpretation.

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:37.330
Constant. It's tireless.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.110
And half of the time it's wrong.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.440
And it admits to
itself "Oh, I was wrong.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.740
He was not doing that.

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.300
I was misinformed."

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.640
That sort of thing.

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.090
I don't know that I'm
answering your question.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:53.340
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We'll
do one more question.

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.020
&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you so
much for being here.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.550
I just wanted, I guess we
can kind of end on this,

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.380
it's a nice note to end on.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.580
Any advice, you know, obviously
you've peppered in a lot

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.170
of advice and thoughts
on love and writing.

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:06.900
But any final advice you have

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.910
for young lovers
and young writers?

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.540
&gt;&gt; Andre Aciman: Oh, god.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:17.270
The one advice I have, I
always say this, is patience.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:25.380
Because it takes, experience
is not necessary for a writer.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.850
Because [inaudible] observing.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:29.650
And intuiting and projecting.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.980
You're constantly projecting.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.190
You don't need the experience,
"I haven't had enough experience

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.650
to write about this and that."

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.950
You don't need it.

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:38.440
You can imagine it and
that's good enough.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.740
But it's patience.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.340
Because that some point, you
will know, you will just know,

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:48.060
you're no longer
writing for yourself

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:51.500
or for the publishing
world, you're writing

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.690
because what you're
doing is important.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:55.760
At some point, you just know.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.880
Now, you may be mistaken,
but it has to feel--

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.960
no, it has to feel
totally important.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.570
In other words, I'm going
to sacrifice this whole year

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.190
and I won't take this job, I
won't do this, I won't do that,

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.830
I won't travel, I
won't go out at night

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.370
because I need to write this.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.710
It matters to me.

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.380
It matters to me.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.540
And that's the beginning of it.

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:22.490
Then the other part is the
probably more difficult one.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:25.510
Is to read good writers.

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:27.530
Not just published writers.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.830
Good writers.

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:32.700
The ones who really changed,
basically who change us.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.370
Who changed humanity.

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:36.440
I mean you can't read The Iliad.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.890
Sorry, this is boring.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:40.750
You can't read the
Iliad and assume

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.170
and that it's just
another story.

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:45.930
The Iliad changes you.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.080
You can't read Proust
and say "Okay,

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.410
this is about a tormented
rich kid."

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:52.180
No, it changes who you are.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.640
It has to change you.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:58.710
Otherwise, you don't
know how to read.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:00.540
But those are the, I
mean basically you have

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.620
to choose a certain
number of texts

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.290
that you are willing
to learn from them.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:10.680
Because they also happen to
