00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:03.580
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.060
Welcome to today's talk.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.420
We have a very, very
special guest today.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.530
And I couldn't be more pleased.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.160
In thinking about an
introduction for him,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.510
I quickly realized
there's nothing that's

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.530
going to beat his own words.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.450
So I'm going to share a couple
of snippets from his writings

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.650
over the years.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.860
And as I do so, think about
what would be your guess when

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.040
he wrote them.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.090
So here's one.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.930
The bottom line is that many
of the investors setting

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.730
the prices in today's markets
don't care about valuation.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290
I get no sense, at all, that
the analysts and portfolio

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.780
managers backing
the large cap growth

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.870
stocks and internet
high flyers can imagine

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.310
prices at which they would be
mere holds or, heaven forbid,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.180
sells.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.685
When do you think
this was written?

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:57.545
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.545 --> 00:00:59.260
MALE SPEAKER: This was '99.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.860
So yeah, there's something
to say about the timeliness

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.000
of what our guest writes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120
And here's one more.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.260
This is from the last 10 years.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.760
In the end, buyers took out
the biggest mortgage possible

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.500
given their incomes and
prevailing interest rates.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.280
Such mortgages would land them
in the houses of their dreams

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.230
and would leave
them there as long

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.720
as conditions did
not deteriorate,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.490
which they invariably do.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.760
Anyway you slice it,
standards for mortgage loans

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.640
have dropped in recent years
and risk has increased.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.870
Logic based?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.850
Perhaps.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.930
Cycle induced and exacerbated?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.280
I'd say so.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.390
Certainly, mortgage
lending was made riskier.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.350
We'll see in a few
years whether that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.660
was intelligent risk taking or
excessive competitive order.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.320
When was this?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.236
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:00.420
MALE SPEAKER: This was 2007.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.030
And we are a few
years from there.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.020
And we've seen what happened.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.990
So I'm sure all of you want
to know what's on our guests

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.370
mind today.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.920
And we are so fortunate that
he's here with us in person.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.680
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.510
please join me in welcoming
the one and only Howard Marks.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:27.030
HOWARD MARKS: Well
that's quite an induction

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.970
and [INAUDIBLE] puts a
lot of pressure on me

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.020
that I have to be right.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.140
So it's hard.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.070
But I'm really
excited to be here.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.640
I want to thank [INAUDIBLE]
for setting up this event.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.660
And he's worked
very hard to make

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.910
it go well for you and for me.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.510
And I hope it'll be
fun for all of us.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.940
And because I get the
impression here at Google

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.231
that fun is important.

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:52.730
Right?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.640
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.680
HOWARD MARKS: So there aren't
too many things in life

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.210
that are worth doing
if they can't be fun.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.910
As you know, I
wrote a book in 2011

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.490
called the most important thing.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.140
And the reason it has that title
is because I would find myself

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.490
in my client's office.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.400
And I would say the most
important thing in investing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.192
is controlling risk.

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:18.650
And then five minutes later,
I would say the most important

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.040
thing is to buy at a low price.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.540
And five minutes later, I would
say the most important thing

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.630
is to act as a contrarian.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.085
So back in 2003,
I believe, I wrote

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.710
a memo called The
Most Important Thing.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.370
I listed 19 things.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.910
Each of which was the
most important thing.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.900
And then I used that.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.230
I couldn't think of a
better format for my book.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.120
So I used the same
format in 2011.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120
Interestingly, some of
the things are different.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.960
That goes to show you that one's
thinking should still be alive

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.560
and should still evolve.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.180
And I know that [INAUDIBLE]
and some of the other fellows

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.830
went to see Charlie Munger
speak in Los Angeles

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.650
this week at age 91.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.760
And I'm sure he's still
evolving and getting younger.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.205
So I'm going to
try to do the same.

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.580
Now I should tell you, and I
don't know if you know this,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.540
but I write memos
to the clients.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.810
And I'll refer to a lot of
memos in this session, probably.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.350
And they're all available on
oaktreecapital.com website.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.339
And the price is right.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.047
They're all free.

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:27.850
And I've been sending
them out now 25 years.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.470
I started in 1990.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.840
And I got a letter
from a guy named

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.120
Warren Buffet in 2009 or '10.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.660
And he said, if
you'll write a book,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.770
I'll give you a
quote for the jacket.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.930
So I had been planning
on writing a book when

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.830
I retired from work.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.780
But Buffet's promise caused me
to accelerate my time frame.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.290
And what the book is is--
who here has read it?

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.750
OK, about half.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.880
So what the book is,
it's a recitation

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.740
of my investment philosophy.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.330
And as it says in the forward
to the philosophy, which

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.320
I took the forward-- I
don't know about you,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.740
I never read the forwards books.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.390
But I took the forward
to mine very seriously.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.890
And what it says
in there-- it's not

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.890
designed to tell you
how to make money.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.600
And it's not designed to tell
you how easy investment is

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.310
or to try to make it easy.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.640
And in fact, my highest
gold is probably

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.970
to make it clear how hard it is.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.120
Investing is very
difficult because it's,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.840
kind of, counter intuitive.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.380
And it, kind of, turns back
on itself all the time.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.530
And there are no
formulas that work.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.060
So what I tried
to do in the book

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.440
is teach people how to think.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.570
Now the thoughts they should
hold change from time to time.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.550
But how to think, I think,
is valid in the long term.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.850
And it's my invest philosophy.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.410
And I wasn't born with
an investment philosophy.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.010
You'll hear from
a lot of people,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.135
if you're interested in
investing, he'll say, well,

00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:10.240
I started reading prospectuses
at age eight, and I didn't.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.170
Or you know, at 13, I
invested my bar mitzvah money,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.280
which I didn't do.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.760
But in fact, when I was getting
out of graduate school-- age

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.720
23 in 1969 so I know you
can all do the math--

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.340
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.850
I had studied finance at Wharton
and accounting at Chicago.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.850
And I knew I wanted to
do something in finance.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.270
But I wasn't very specific.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.600
So I interviewed in five
or six different fields.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.290
Large consulting firms,
small consulting firm,

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.120
accounting firm,
corporate treasury,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.960
investment management,
investment banking, six, so I

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.460
ended up in the
investment business.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.960
Why?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.335
Because I had a
summer job in '68

00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:57.459
at city in the investment
research department and I

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.160
liked it.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.440
I had fun, right.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.750
That's a good reason.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.950
So I went there.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.815
And by the way,
interestingly, there

00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:06.940
was nothing magical about
working in the investment

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.880
business at that time.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.630
It paid the same
as all the rest.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.860
All six jobs that I was
offered had the same pay.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.430
Between 12.5 and 14
a year, not a month.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.100
And there were no famous
investors at the time.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.770
Investing was not
a household word.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.370
There were no
investment TV shows.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.410
So I just did it
because I liked it.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.230
I liked the people.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:38.100
And I thought that the investing
was intellectually interesting.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.310
So I didn't have a philosophy
then when I started.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.050
And I had some things I
had learned in school.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.070
But I think that your
philosophy-- your philosophy--

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.940
as opposed to somebody
if you studied

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.660
Descartes or Locke
or somebody like

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.300
that, you learn his philosophy.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.259
You might learn a philosophy
by studying a religion.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.550
But that's not your philosophy.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.810
Your philosophy will
come from the combination

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.060
of what you have been
taught by your teachers

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.670
and parents and your experiences
and what your experiences tell

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.190
you about the things
you were taught

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.850
and how they have
to be modified.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.170
So I developed my philosophy.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.860
It might seem like I started
writing the memos a long time

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.470
ago-- 25 years-- but I
had been working already

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.250
over two decades, at that time.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.110
So I think that the integration
of real life into philosophy

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.970
is essential.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.140
Now I prepared a few
slides for today.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.710
And basically, the
slides are here

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.549
to illustrate where
philosophy came from.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.460
Talk to you about some of
the foundations and roots.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.549
So I call it origins
and inspirations.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.180
And I hope you'll
find it interesting.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.670
So first of all, not in
order chronologically

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.030
but, hopefully, in order to try
to make something intelligible.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.600
Fooled by Randomness, by
Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.090
Now who here has read that?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.170
All right, more people
than have read my book.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.065
And I think it's very important.

00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:12.520
I think it's an excellent
book with very, very

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.290
important ideas.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.610
Now don't tell
Nassim I said this,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.670
but I tell all the people I
speak to that it is either

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.040
the most important badly written
book or the worst written very

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.580
important book that
you'll ever read.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.710
I think it's not very clear.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.310
And I think it's
not-- well, maybe

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.850
there's no attempt
to make it clear.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.520
But I think a lot of the ideas
are very important and even

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.600
profound, in my opinion.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.250
So among other things,
and the basic theme

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.780
is that in investing
there's a lot of randomness.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.200
And if you look at
investing as a field

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.280
without randomness where
everything is determinative,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.140
you'll get confused
because you will not

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:09.740
draw the proper inferences
from what you see.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.700
For example, just a brief
example, you see somebody

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.480
and they report a great
return for the year.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.370
The scientist who thinks that
the investment world runs

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.380
like the world of physics
might think, well,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.190
great return, that means
the guy's a great investor.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.975
But in truth, it might be
somebody who took a crazy shot

00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:33.280
and got lucky.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.980
Why?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.230
Because there's a lot of
randomness in the world.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.500
When I went to Wharton
in 1963, the first book

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.870
I remember learning was
called Decision Making

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.620
Under Uncertainty, by
C. Jackson Greyson who

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.290
became, as I recall,
America's first energy czar.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:54.600
And I learned a couple
important things from that book.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.130
Number one, that you
can't tell from an outcome

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.367
whether a decision
was good or bad.

00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:05.200
It's very important.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.380
Most people don't
understand this.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.640
Totally counter intuitive.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.510
But the truth is,
in the real world

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.116
where there's randomness
at work-- I mean,

00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:17.409
if you build a bridge
and it falls down,

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:19.200
then you must assume
that the engineer made

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.660
a mistake that it
was a bad decision

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.150
to build the bridge that way.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:31.790
But in the real world of
where there's randomness,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.120
good decisions fail
to work all the time.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.745
Bad decisions work all the time.

00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:42.440
The investment business is
full of people who are, quote,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.690
right for the wrong reason.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.360
Made a bad decision, it didn't
work out the way they thought,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.430
but they got lucky.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.127
And they were bailed
out by events.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.210
So this is very important.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.680
And this is the basic theme
of "Fooled By Randomness,"

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.710
Taleb's first book.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.037
Since then, he has written
the black swan, which

00:12:01.037 --> 00:12:03.370
became more famous, but I
don't think is as good a book.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.320
And he's written a book
called anti fragile.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.220
And that one didn't get famous.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.840
But I think that this book is
something everybody should read

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.030
it if you have an interest
in numbers, investing,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.440
and how the world works.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.510
So as I say, the book is all
about the role played by luck.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:29.490
And basically, even if you
know what's most likely,

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.390
many other things
can happen instead.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.440
This is very, very important.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.480
We talked earlier at
lunch about what's

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.170
the most important
lesson you can draw.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.410
Well, of course, I'll never
say most important to anything.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:47.100
But one very important
lesson for you to learn

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.230
is that you should not act as
if the things that should happen

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.770
are the things that will happen.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.910
Again, in the world of
the physical sciences,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.580
you could probably
bet that that's true.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.400
And the electrical
engineer knows

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.630
that if he turns on a
light switch over here,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.790
the light will go on there
every time because it's

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.410
subject to physics.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.780
Not in the world of investing.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:20.550
So for every
possible phenomenon,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.230
There is a range of
things that can happen.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.850
There may be one where
it's possible to discern

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.610
which one is the most likely.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.930
And if we draw a
probability distribution,

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.680
that may be the highest
point on the distribution.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.580
The most likely single
outcome but that

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.570
doesn't mean it's
going to happen.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.740
And the reason we don't have
many probability distributions

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.460
that look like this
but rather that

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.680
look like this is because a
range of things can happen.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.402
And it's very, very
important to notice

00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:54.860
that, number one, there are
lots of things that can happen.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.250
So you have to allow for them.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.310
And number two, the thing
that is most likely to happen

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.900
is far from sure to happen.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.369
So that's very key.

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:10.410
There's a professor at
the London Business School

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.420
who put it so simply.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.650
He said risk means more things
can happen than will happen.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.435
And again, this is
profound in my opinion.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.140
In the economic world,
people generally

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.180
make decisions
based on something

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.380
called expected value, which
is to say that you multiply

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.870
every possible outcome.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.670
First of all, of
course, you don't think

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.420
in terms of a single outcome.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.530
You think in terms of
a range of outcomes.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.780
So you take every-- if
you could iterate over

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.010
so many-- you take
every possible outcome,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.840
you multiply it by the
likelihood that it'll happen,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.420
you sum the results,
and then you

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.540
get something called
the expected value

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.840
from that course of action.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.910
And you choose your
course of action

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.830
based on the highest
expected value.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.080
And that sounds like a
totally rational thing.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.760
But what if the course of
action that you're considering

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.140
has some outcomes that you
absolutely can't withstand?

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.670
Then you may not do it.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:17.110
You may not do the highest
expected value course of action

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.950
because it has some you
can't live with, you know.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.400
Who here is willing
to be the skydiver who

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.510
was right 98% of the time?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.670
You know, for example.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.720
So you may elect to do bike
riding on the Google campus

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.570
rather than skydiving, even
though skydiving is more

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.390
exhilarating 98% of the time.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:45.330
Anyway, so the point is as I
lived my life from learning

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.580
about [INAUDIBLE]
learning about Taleb,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.790
from learning from
my own experience,

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:55.670
I realized that should
does not equal will.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.770
Lots of things that should
happen fail to happen.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.630
And even if they
don't fail to happen,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.700
they fail to happen on schedule.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.800
So the thing that the economist
or the financier thinks

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.120
should happen this year
may happen in three years.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.030
And you got to live three
years to see it happen.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.680
One of my favorite
sayings is never forget

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.540
the six foot tall
man who drowned

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.440
crossing the stream that was
five feet deep on average.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.850
We can't live by the averages.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:27.860
We can't say, well, I'm
happy to survive on average.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.210
We got to survive
on the bad days.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.630
And if you're a
decision maker, you

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.520
have to survive long
enough for the correctness

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.290
of your decision
to become evidence.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.330
And you can't count on
it happening right away.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.520
I always remind
people overpriced

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.790
is not the same as
going down tomorrow.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.220
And if you bear that
simple truth in mind,

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.730
I think it helps.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.450
So Taleb and the role of
lock luck, very important.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.110
Then John Kenneth Galbraith.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.100
John Kenneth Galbraith,
for those of you

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.110
who are not familiar
with ancient history,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.760
was an American economist.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.710
Died around '05, I think, maybe
a little after and at the age

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.300
of about 98 and he was
one of my favorites.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.310
He was a little
on the left side.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.109
He was somewhere between free
enterprise and socialism.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:28.069
But he was what we call
a liberal in the days

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:32.040
when it was OK to say that word.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.280
But he was very, very smart.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.350
And he was not famous
as an economist.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.400
But he played a lot of
roles in government.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.800
And he was a diplomat.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.640
But he wrote some
very good books.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.520
And one of them is
called A Short History

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.380
Of Financial Euphoria.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.380
And I like thin books.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.940
And his is thin.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.190
Especially the ones he wrote
in the last decade or two

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.469
of his life were very thin.

00:17:56.469 --> 00:17:57.260
So I enjoyed those.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.840
But the short
history is very good,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.970
and I'll recommend that to you.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.780
And one of the things
he says is we have

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.487
two classes of forecasters.

00:18:04.487 --> 00:18:06.820
The ones who don't know and
the ones who don't know they

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.460
don't know.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.360
Now I don't believe in
forecasts, macro forecasts.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.150
People who forecast
interest rates, performance

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.020
of economies, and
performance of stock markets.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.470
And I don't think
that my efforts

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:26.300
to be a superior investor
and most other people's are

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.090
aided by macro forecasts.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.130
So am I saying that the
forecaster is never right?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.580
No, I'm not saying that.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.030
The forecasters are often right.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.140
Last year, GDP grew 2%.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.440
Many forecasters forecast that
GDP will grow this year at 2%.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.590
That's called extrapolation.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.570
And usually, in economics,
extrapolation works.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:04.140
Usually, the future looks
like the recent past.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.660
So usually, the people who
forecast a continuation

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.200
of the current are right.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.490
The only problem is they
don't make any money.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:22.230
Because let's take the
economy-- most people

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.060
forecast two something
for this year.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.670
A growth rate of
two something is

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.110
cooked into the prices
of securities today.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:37.980
If the growth rate turns
out to be two something,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.470
everybody who forecasted
that would be right.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.370
But security prices
will not change much

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.520
because that two
something growth

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.520
was anticipated and
discounted a year or two ago.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:58.530
So all those people who are
right won't make any money.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.090
So that's correct.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.780
So extrapolation
works all the time.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.340
Forecasts that
are extrapolations

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.070
work all the time, but
they don't make any money.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.430
Logically, am I saying that
forecasts never make any money?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:17.540
No.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.890
The forecasts that make
money are the forecasts

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.890
of radical change.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.120
If everybody's predicting
2.4% growth for this year

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.540
and if I predict minus 2 and
it turns out to be minus 2

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.330
or I predict six and
it turns out to be six,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.810
I'll make a lot of money.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.990
So forecasts which are not
extrapolations-- forecasts

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.840
which are radically different
from the recent past--

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.120
are potentially very
valuable if they're correct.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.650
Of course, they do not have
any value if they're incorrect.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.670
And if they're
incorrect, they'll

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.200
cost you a lot of money.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.237
If everybody else thinks
it's going to be 2.4

00:20:56.237 --> 00:20:58.070
and you predict six and
it turns out at 2.4,

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.444
you're probably going to have
taken the wrong investments

00:21:00.444 --> 00:21:02.260
and lost a lot of money.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:08.990
So deviant forecasts,
which turn out to be right,

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.830
are potentially very
valuable but it's

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.580
very hard to make them.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.720
It's very hard to
make them correctly.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.690
It's very hard to make the
correctly consistently.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.410
And somebody at lunch
mentioned an early memo I wrote

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.250
called the value of forecasts.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.250
And in one, there was
the value of forecast

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.630
and then there was the value of
forecasts two, I think, right.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.130
And in one of those, I
reviewed the history,

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.660
the recent history, of the
Wall Street Journal poll.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.630
Every six months, the
Wall Street Journal

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.890
publishes the results
of a poll of economists

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:49.070
on GDP growths, CPI, the
value of $1, price of oil,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.420
whatever it might be,
a bunch of phenomena.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.530
They do it consistently.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:57.310
And they ask ask, like, 30
people consistently over time.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.450
So it shows,
basically, that most

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.920
of the time when
people get it right

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.700
it's because they predicted
extrapolation and nothing

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.160
changed.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.620
Once in awhile, something
changes radically.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.050
And invariably,
somebody predicted it.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.890
But the problem is, if
you look at that person's

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.000
other forecasts
over the years, you

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.780
see that that person always
made radical forecasts

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.780
and never was right
any other time.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.760
So of course, if you're
getting your information

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.940
from a forecaster, the
fact that he was right once

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.740
doesn't tell you anything.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.260
The views of that
forecaster would not

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.740
be of any value to you unless
he was right consistently.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.330
And nobody's right consistently
in making deviant forecasts.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.840
So the bottom line for
me is their forecasting

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.330
is not valuable.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.250
And that's something that
my experience has told me.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.510
So we don't know
what's going to happen

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.940
and randomness will play a
big role in what happens.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.250
And randomness is, by
definition, unpredictable.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:15.160
Number three, The Losers
Game, by Charlie Ellis.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.410
This is very interesting.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.060
Anybody here know the
name of the company TRW?

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.400
A few people.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.810
TRW used to be a
big conglomerate.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.170
And now it's known
primarily for credit scores.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.080
And there was a
guy named Si Ramo.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.370
He was the R.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.710
It was Thompson,
Ramo, Wooldridge.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.780
And he was the R in
TRW and very smart.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.030
And Si Ramo wrote a book.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:50.180
And it was about
winning at tennis.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.020
Who here plays tennis?

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.780
OK, this is good because as
I go around the world now,

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.350
very few people
play tennis anymore.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:04.150
But what Ramo said is that there
are two kinds of winning tennis

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.100
players.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:14.200
If you look at Pete Sampras,
or Nadal, or Djokovic,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.200
how do they win?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.600
The winning champion
tennis player

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.530
wins by hitting winning shots.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.550
Hits shots that the
opponent can't return.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:30.970
They're either so well placed,
or so strategic, or so fast

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.600
and hard that the opponent
can't return them.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.530
And if Nadal hits a shot, which
is not a potential winner,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.800
then his opponent can
probably put it away

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.910
because it doesn't have
enough difficulty on the ball.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.800
So the championship tennis
player wins by hitting winners.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.850
You play tennis, right?

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:56.510
How do you win?

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.239
Do you win?

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.072
AUDIENCE: Sometimes.

00:24:58.072 --> 00:24:59.550
HOWARD MARKS: How do you win?

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.590
AUDIENCE: If I win, it's
by not hitting it out.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.890
HOWARD MARKS: That's right.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.860
The amateur tennis
player like him and me,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.630
we win not by hitting winners
but by avoiding hitting losers.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:16.460
And we believe that if we can
just push it back 20 times

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.100
and just get it over
the net 20 times,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.920
our opponent can only do it 19.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.190
We believe that we'll
out-steady him, outlast him,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.830
and eventually he'll hit it
into the net or off the court.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.200
We'll win the point.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.040
But we'll win the point
without having hit a winner.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.240
So there are obviously
two styles of tennis.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.480
So the same is
true for investing.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.760
So Charlie Ellis wrote an
article called The Losers Game.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.370
And he said he thought that
investing-- so championship

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:52.660
tennis is a winners game.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.840
It's won by winners.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.420
He thought amateur
tennis is a losers game.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.350
It's won by the people
who avoid being losers.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:07.260
Charlie thinks or thought that
investing is a losers game.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.550
So the best way to
win at investing

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.190
is by not hitting losers.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:20.210
Now I believe also that
it's a losers game.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.780
Not as much as Charlie believes
and not for the same reason.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.070
Charlie believes that
investing is a losers game

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.050
because the market is
efficient and securities

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.432
are priced right.

00:26:30.432 --> 00:26:31.890
I believe there
are inefficiencies.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.830
I just think it's hard
to consistently take

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.750
advantage of them.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.540
And you have to be
an exceptional person

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.230
to take advantage of them
on a consistent basis.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.680
And the reason that the
pro can go for winners

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.460
is because he is
so well schooled

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.244
and practiced and steady
and talented that he knows

00:26:48.244 --> 00:26:49.660
that if he does
this with his foot

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.951
and this with this hip and
this with his elbow and this

00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:55.720
with his wrist that the
ball will go where he wants.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.736
He doesn't worry about
miscues, wind, sun in his eyes,

00:27:01.736 --> 00:27:03.780
or distraction.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.640
He's so well schooled.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.770
In fact, in scoring
tennis matches,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.940
they keep track of something
called unforced errors.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.670
And the reason they
keep track of them

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.410
is because there are so few.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.400
The pro doesn't make a
lot of unforced errors.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.540
We make unforced
errors all the time.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.490
So in order to survive,
we have to avoid them.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.490
So the point is, if you're
going to be an investor,

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.640
you have to decide am I good
enough to go for winners,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.620
or should I emphasize
the avoidance

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.225
of losers in my approach?

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.130
So I say here that the
difficulty of getting it right

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.000
is what makes
defensive investing

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.870
so important because
it's just for us

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.320
in investing, especially
because there's randomness,

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.200
if we do the right thing
with our foot and hip and arm

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.890
and elbow, we're not going
to get a winner every time.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.790
And then the fourth origin that
I wanted to talk about today

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.820
was my meeting with Mike
Milken in November 1978.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:12.280
So in '78, I got a call
from my boss at Citibank.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.374
And he said, there's some guy
in California named Mike Milken,

00:28:15.374 --> 00:28:17.540
and he deals with something
called high yield bonds.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.234
Can you figure out
what that means

00:28:19.234 --> 00:28:21.650
because one of our clients had
asked for a high yield bond

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.150
portfolio.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.275
And in that day,
nobody knew about it.

00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:27.370
It was unknown.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:32.320
So I met with Mike
in November of 1978.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.180
He came to see me
at Citi in New York.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.330
He was looking for clients.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.440
He was just starting off in
the high yield bond industry.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.980
And there was a great meeting.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.170
And he explained to me
that if you buy AAA bonds,

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.170
there's only one way to go.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.990
AAA bonds are bonds that
everybody thinks a great.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:55.350
There companies are
making a lot of money.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.560
They have prudent
balance sheets.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.840
The outlook is good.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.840
Everything's perfect.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.039
So if everything's perfect,
that means it can't get better.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:08.580
And if it can't get better, that
means it can only get worse.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.000
It doesn't have to get worse.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.800
But if there is a change, it's
going to be for the worse.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.340
And if you've bought a
bond on the assumption

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:19.950
that it's perfect and it gets
worse, then you lose money.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.410
So that's important.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.010
On the other hand, he said,
if you buy single-B bonds

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:29.050
and they survive, there's
only one way for them to go,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.224
which is upgrade.

00:29:30.224 --> 00:29:31.890
Now that's not exactly
true because they

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.360
can default and go bankrupt.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:40.030
But the ones that survive
will go up, will be upgraded,

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.360
and the surprises are
likely to be on the upside.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.830
So this is very important.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.690
Again, this is about trying to
hit winners and avoid losers.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.170
And if you're buying bonds that
most people don't think much

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.700
of, it's hard to
have a big loser

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.887
because such low expectations
are incorporated.

00:29:59.887 --> 00:30:01.720
Now let me digress for
a minute because this

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.553
is really important.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.300
How do you make
money as an investor?

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.810
The people who don't
know think the way

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:16.280
you do it is by buying good
assets, a good building,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.450
stock in a good company,
or something like that.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.320
That is not the
secret for success.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.100
The secret for
success in investing

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.520
is buying things for
less than they're worth.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.070
So if you buy a high quality
asset-- and I say in the book,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.150
there's a guy on the radio.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.250
When I lived in LA, I listened
to NPR on the way work.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.190
And there was a guy
and I heard him say it.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.230
He said, well, if you go into a
store and you like the product,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.942
buy the stock.

00:30:45.942 --> 00:30:48.620
He couldn't be more
wrong because what

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.470
determines the success of an
investor is not what he buys

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.450
but what he pays for it.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.420
And if you buy a high quality
asset but you overpay for it,

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.070
you're in big trouble.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.980
You can buy a very
low quality asset.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.770
But if you pay less
than it's worth,

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.980
chances are you're
going to make money.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.120
So the book says-- chapter three
says-- the most important thing

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.880
is value.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.560
Figuring out what the
value of an asset is.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.030
But chapter four says
the most important thing

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.830
is the relationship
between price and value.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.660
So let's assume that you're
able to figure out the value.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.690
If you pay more than
that, you're in trouble.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.090
If you get it for less,
the wind is at your back.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:32.460
So it was very, very important
then to be in an area

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.270
where the surprises were
likely to be on the upside.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.350
And if you buy the bonds of B
rated companies which there are

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.950
such low expectations,
maybe it's

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.610
easy for there to be
a favorable surprise.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:51.680
Now how can I prove to you
that the expectations were low?

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.630
The answer is that if you
look in the Moody's guide

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:01.890
to bonds in those years, what
was the definition of a B rated

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.420
bond?

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.050
Quote, fails to possess
the characteristics

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.870
of a desirable investment.

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.960
In other words, it's
a bad investment.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.110
Now, I drove here from
the airport in my car.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.390
And if I take you
outside to look at my car

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.190
and I offer it to you
for sale because I

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.410
don't need that car anymore.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:26.057
When I'm done here,
I'm not coming back.

00:32:26.057 --> 00:32:27.640
If I say to you,
would you like to buy

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.550
my car, what is the one
question you must ask me

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.810
before saying yes or no?

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.220
Price.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.660
You get an A. You get
an A. So in other words,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.280
it's a good buy at
a certain price.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.730
It's a bad buy at another price.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.800
Moody is now saying
that B rated bonds

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.180
are a bad by without
any reference to price.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.720
So in other words,
there's no price

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.590
at which a company that
has some credit risk

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.300
is worth investing in.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.550
And by the way, before I turned
to high yield bonds and '78,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.110
I was part of the
banks machinery

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.657
to buy the stocks of
America's best companies.

00:33:05.657 --> 00:33:07.490
And I explained to
[INAUDIBLE] if you bought

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.790
the bonds of Hewlett
Packard, Perkin Elmer, Texas

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:14.110
Instruments, Merk Lilly Xerox,
IBM, Kodak, Polaroid, AIG, Coca

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.760
Cola, and Procter &amp; Gamble, and
if you bought them all in '68

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.281
and you held them until '73,
you lost 90% of your money.

00:33:20.281 --> 00:33:20.780
Why?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.760
Because they were overpriced.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.450
The average stock
since the postwar

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.210
has traded at 16 times
its next year's earnings.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.281
These were trading
at 80 and 90 times.

00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:29.780
Why?

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.150
Because they were so good.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.180
Everybody says these
are great companies.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.055
Nothing can go wrong.

00:33:33.055 --> 00:33:34.780
So it doesn't matter
what price you pay.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.430
And if you pay 80 or
90 times, that's fine.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.790
So here we are,
in my experience--

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.264
again, experience
as a teacher-- you

00:33:44.264 --> 00:33:45.930
invest in the best
companies in America,

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.727
you lose a lot of money.

00:33:47.727 --> 00:33:49.560
Then you go to the high
yield bond business,

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.830
you invest in the worst
companies in America,

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.790
you make most money.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.310
So it's an instructive lesson
if you have your eyes open

00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:02.480
and you learn from
experience, which I did.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.010
But the key words
were and they survive.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.540
Right?

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.230
This little trap
there because you have

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.150
to catch those three words.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.139
If you buy single-B
bonds that don't survive,

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.070
then you're in big trouble.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.980
But obviously,
it's tautologically

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.980
true that if a company about
which the expectations are low

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.620
survive, it'll
probably, at minimum,

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.820
it'll pay off at maturity.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.080
And maybe in the meantime
it'll be upgraded or taken

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.370
over if they survive.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.270
So what that convinced
me when I was starting

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.561
the high-yield bond business
and this conversation came

00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:38.130
at a great point in time
is that my analyst should

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.170
spend all their time
trying to weed out

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.870
the ones that don't survive.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.540
Not finding the ones that
will have favorable events

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.260
but just excluding the ones
that have unfavorably events.

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.260
And that's what we did.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.429
Now I'll tell you an
interesting story.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:35:02.380
Around '05 or '06, the bible
of investing is a book called

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.810
Security Analysis written
by Graham and Dodd.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.140
And they wrote the
first edition 1934.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.440
But Ben Graham was
Warren Buffett's teacher

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.600
at Columbia and, in many ways,
the father of value investing.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.820
And he and David Dodd
wrote this book in '34.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.590
And they updated it in '40
and then several times after.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.040
And the '40 edition is
considered to be a great

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.030
edition.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.990
So in '05 McGraw Hill,
which owned the book,

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.730
said they want to
update the book.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.690
And they turned it over
to Seth Klarman who's

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.540
a great debt investor
in Boston at Baupost

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.757
and a professor-- I can't
remember his name right now.

00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:48.256
What?

00:35:48.256 --> 00:35:48.955
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Greenwald.

00:35:48.955 --> 00:35:49.530
HOWARD MARKS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.280
That's right.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.959
Bruce Greenwald at Columbia.

00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:53.000
So you should be up here.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.820
I'll sit down.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.530
And they turned it
over to Seth and Bruce

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.160
to bring out this revision.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.030
And they, in turn, asked
people to revise the sections.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.700
And they asked me to
revise a section on debt.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.530
So that meant I had to go and
read the 1940 edition in order

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.520
to update it.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.910
And I came across
something fascinating.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:20.200
And it was and it verified
what I had always thought.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:26.160
It said that bond investing
is a negative art.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.150
What does that mean?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.180
What it means is, I
don't know how many of

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.580
you know how bonds work, but
a bond is a promise to pay.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.430
You give me $100, and
I promise to give you

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.030
5% interest every year, and
then give your money back in

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.450
20 years.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.860
Fixed income it's called because
all the events are fixed.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.880
The contract is fixed.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.610
The return is fixed,
assuming the promise is kept.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:54.370
So all 5% bonds that
pay will pay 5%.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.200
None will pay six.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.340
None will pay four.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.770
All the ones that
pay will pay 5%.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.260
What does that mean?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.410
It means of the
ones that pay, it

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.146
doesn't matter
which ones you buy.

00:37:05.146 --> 00:37:06.270
I'm going to like this one.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.150
I like that one a lot.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.790
That pays five.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:08.400
And I like that one.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.010
That pays five.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.301
It doesn't make any difference.

00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:12.280
You're not going to
be a hero by choosing

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.190
among the bonds that pay.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.900
The only thing that
matters is to exclude

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.440
the ones that don't pay.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.890
So if there are 100
bonds, 90 will pay.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.190
They'll all pay the same thing.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.780
It doesn't matter which
of the 90 you choose.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.710
The only thing that
matters is excluding

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.130
the 10 that don't pay.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.430
Negative art.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.740
The greatness of
your performance

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.210
comes not from what you buy
but from what you exclude.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.287
So I thought that
was very useful.

00:37:38.287 --> 00:37:39.620
I should have that up here, too.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:45.430
But anyway, Milken
was my fourth input.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.420
So Taleb says that
the future consists

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.570
of a range of possibilities
with the outcome significantly

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.040
influenced by randomness.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.510
And Galbraith says the
forecasting is futile.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.870
And Ellis says that if the
game isn't controllable,

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.740
it's better to work to avoid
losers than to try for winners.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.640
And Milken says that holding
survivors and avoiding defaults

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.410
is the key in bond investing.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.430
So if you put them
all together, that's

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.010
how you get the philosophy
that's in the book.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.140
These were my origins.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.890
So when we started Oak Tree
April 10 of 1995 almost

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.830
exactly 20 years ago, we wrote
down our investment philosophy.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:23.610
And here it is.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.550
We published it.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.250
We were a bunch of guys who
had been working together

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:33.130
for most of the previous 10
years at a different employer.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.860
And we left there as a group.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.320
And we started Oak Tree.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.270
So for a philosophy, I believe
in writing things down.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.530
And like learning
at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.560
says today right
them down, right.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.604
So we wrote down our philosophy.

00:38:47.604 --> 00:38:48.270
We published it.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.640
We never changed a word since.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.780
And the clients like
knowing what our roadmap is.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.180
So these were the six tenets
of the investment philosophy.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.180
So the first one says that
the most important thing

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.490
is risk control.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.710
And we tell the clients we
think that for excellence

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.510
in investing, the most
important thing is not

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.444
making a lot of money.

00:39:08.444 --> 00:39:09.610
It's not beating the market.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.320
It's not being in
the top quartile.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.610
The most important thing
is controlling risk.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.472
That's our job.

00:39:15.472 --> 00:39:16.680
That's what we'll do for you.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.420
And the clients
come to us who want

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.440
to invest in our asset classes
with the risks under control.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.590
There are other people
who put less emphasis

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:27.740
on controlling risk.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.010
And they have better
results in the good times

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.490
and worst results
in the bad times.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.810
Our clients want
what we give them.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.940
Number two, we have an
emphasis on consistency.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.670
So we say we don't try for the
moon at the danger of crashing,

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.570
you know.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.860
The first memo that
I wrote in 1990--

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.340
I'm sure you remember
that, [INAUDIBLE]--

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.610
talked about a guy who was head
of an asset manager that had

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.840
a terrible year.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.340
And he said, well,
it's very simple.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.839
If you want to be in the top
five percent of money managers,

00:39:57.839 --> 00:40:00.380
you have to be willing
to be in the bottom.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.670
I have no interest in
being in the bottom 5%.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.835
And I don't care about
being in the top 5%.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:07.580
I want to be above the
middle on a consistent basis

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.810
over the long term.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.280
And there's a funny bit of math.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.950
This will confound
the-- what did you call

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.840
yourself-- data scientists?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.760
This will confound the data
scientists in the room.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.030
So in that first memo, I
contrasted the comments

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:32.040
from that money manager with a
comment from one of my clients

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.110
who told me right about
the same time there

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.960
was the juxtaposition
that caused

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.350
me to write that first memo.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.310
He told me that for
the previous 14 years,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:44.940
his pension fund had never
been above the 27th percentile

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.260
or below the 47th percentile.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.200
So it was solidly in
the second quartile

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.839
every year for 14 years.

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:54.380
So let's see.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.030
27.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.550
47.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.450
The average of
that is 37, right?

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:59.760
What percentile do
you think that fund

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.510
was in for the whole 14 years?

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:03.900
HOWARD MARKS: Four.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.410
Four.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.990
And if you think about it,
it's really almost mysterious.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.190
Why the fourth?

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.940
Not the 37th.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.980
And the answer is that
when people blow up,

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.130
they really blow up.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.300
So we said we want consistency.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.810
We want to be a little bit
above the middle all the time.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.790
Maybe we'll pop up to
the top in the years

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:29.140
when the markets are
terrible and our risk control

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.360
is rewarded.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.720
But we think that over
a long period of time

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.940
we'll be very
respectable that way.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.220
And our clients
will have an absence

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.780
of bad experiences,
which I think,

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.690
for them, is very important.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.960
So then macro-forecasting is
not critical to investing.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.680
We do not make our decisions
based on macro-forecasts,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.850
as I explained to you.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.540
We all have opinions.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.740
We-- our official dictum is that
it is OK to have an opinion.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.270
You just shouldn't
act as if it's right.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.790
And I think this
is very important.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.432
You know, Mark Twain
said, "it's not

00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:03.390
what you don't know that
gets you into trouble.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.660
It's what you know for
certain that just ain't true."

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.320
So we try to avoid
holding strongly

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.400
to those macro opinions.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.370
And finally, we don't do a
lot of market timing, which

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.880
is very, very hard to do.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.090
We do long term investing
in assets that we think

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.804
are underpriced.

00:42:22.804 --> 00:42:24.220
So that's the Oak
Tree philosophy.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:29.240
You could see how the origins
and inspirations that I

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.740
went through fit into that.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.700
And in fact, it's all distilled
in our model, which says

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.560
that if we avoid the
losers, the winners

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.310
take care of themselves.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.960
And if we can make a large
number of investors and just

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.570
weed out the
problems, then we'll

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.900
have-- just think of
the bell shaped curve.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.960
We'll have a lot to do
OK and an occasional one,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.390
which is exceptional if
we can weed these out.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.460
So a lot of money managers
go into the clients

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.050
and say we will get
you in the top quartile

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.820
into the great right hand tail.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.184
I think it's hard to do
on a consistent basis.

00:43:08.184 --> 00:43:10.350
And if you aim for the right
hand tail and you miss,

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:11.790
you end up in the
left hand tail.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:15.742
What we say is we'll just
lop off the left hand tail.

00:43:15.742 --> 00:43:17.200
And if we can do
that successfully,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.080
and we pretty much have,
then what will you have?

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.810
OK, good, very good, great,
terrific, but no terrible,

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.480
the average will be very good.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.770
And that's basically
what we've had.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.010
So lastly, I'll just leave you
with what I consider my three

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.180
greatest adages.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.400
Not mine but the
ones I've encountered

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.880
over my career and that
have been the most helpful.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.056
And they're all
used in the book.

00:43:43.056 --> 00:43:45.680
First of all, what the wise man
does in the beginning, the fool

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.660
does in the end.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:52.210
In every trend in investing,
it eventually becomes overdone.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.600
If you find an asset which is
cheap and buy it, that's great.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.665
If everybody else figures
it out that it's cheap,

00:43:58.665 --> 00:44:00.050
then it will go up.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.030
Then people see
that it's rising.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.800
And more people jump on the band
wagon and it goes up, up, up.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.830
And the last person
to buy it is a fool.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.360
And the first person to
buy it is a wise man.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.600
It's the same asset.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.060
Just at different prices.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:20.930
And as people say,
first the innovator,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.810
then the imitator,
then the idiot.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.850
So that's another way
to look at this adage.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:29.451
Number two, never forget
the six foot tall man

00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:30.950
who drowned crossing
the stream that

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.590
was five feet deep on average.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:37.240
Kind of like that skydiver
who's right 98% of the time.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.390
It's not sufficient,
depending on how

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.810
you want to live your life,
to survive on average.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.840
We have to survive
on the bad days.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.610
So we have to be able to survive
the low spots in the stream.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:54.130
Your portfolio has to be set
up to survive on the bad days

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.740
so you won't be shaken
out of your investments.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.340
And then finally, being
too far ahead of your time

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.156
is indistinguishable
from being wrong.

00:45:03.156 --> 00:45:04.530
And yet, that's
a great challenge

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.090
because, as I said
before, the things

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.640
that are supposed to happen
will not necessarily happen.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.340
And they absolutely
will not happen on time.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.440
So you have to be able
to live until the wisdom

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.510
of your decisions is
proved, if at all.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.650
So all of these
things, I think, say

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:25.000
something about modesty
and humility of belief

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.530
rather than cock sureness, which
I think is the greatest risk.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.870
So with that, [INAUDIBLE],
I'll stop talking.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.390
And we have a little time left.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.040
And I'd love to
take your questions.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.910
That's what I'm here for.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.243
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Howard.

00:45:37.243 --> 00:45:38.190
This was fascinating.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:39.580
So we are open for questions.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.031
Please raise your hand, and
I'll bring the mic to you.

00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:44.406
AUDIENCE: The thing you said
about what the wise man does

00:45:44.406 --> 00:45:46.590
in the beginning the
fool does in the end,

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.575
you can come up
from a single stock.

00:45:48.575 --> 00:45:50.700
You can think about your
whole philosophy that way.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.250
So you've been focusing
here on avoiding losers.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:58.124
And maybe humans are, kind of,
generally focused on trying

00:45:58.124 --> 00:45:58.790
to find winners.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.510
Maybe that's what
we'll always do wrong.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.765
But if everybody in the world
is trying to avoid losers,

00:46:03.765 --> 00:46:05.890
maybe the wise investor
now shoots for the winners,

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:06.440
do you know what I mean?

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.040
Sort of self-balancing.

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.831
HOWARD MARKS: Sure.

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.710
Well, number one, I
don't think that we

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.150
have to worry about
everybody becoming to prudent

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.700
or to wise because we're
talking about human nature.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.270
Charlie Munger--
the boys went to see

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.320
Charlie Munger this week.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.110
One of the great
quotes that Charlie

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.750
gave me was from the
philosopher Demosthenes, who

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.820
said for that which a man
wishes that he will believe.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.850
What do most people
want more anything else?

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.380
They want to get rich.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.580
Very few people think that
the secret to their happiness

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.560
comes from prudence and caution.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.370
Most people think it comes from
that stroke of genius, which

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.880
will put them on easy street.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.730
But you're absolutely right.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:50.260
And there are times
when most people

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.010
behave in a prudent
and cautious manner.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.210
When is it?

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.080
It's in a crash when security
prices are down here.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.830
Right?

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.930
That's the time to turn
aggressive and buy.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.226
So Buffett says
the less prudence

00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:03.850
with which others
conduct their affairs

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.433
the greater the
prudence with which we

00:47:05.433 --> 00:47:07.020
must conduct our own affairs.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.610
And there are times when
we should turn aggressive.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.295
And that's when everything's
being given away.

00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:17.210
AUDIENCE: So you said hat
you did not make any macro

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.400
forecasts, right?

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:23.120
But actually the macros can
affect companies in other ways.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.600
Like if you have an
interest rate of, like, 30%.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.290
I mean, 99% of
the companies will

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.940
be gone or something like that.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.172
So how do you even
make an investment?

00:47:32.172 --> 00:47:32.880
HOWARD MARKS: OK.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.070
So now I know I'm not coming
back to Google anymore

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.790
because the people are too
intelligent because this

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.490
is one of the great traps.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:45.060
I say that we don't invest on
the basis of macro forecast.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:50.940
But you have to have an
economic framework in mind

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:56.150
when you predict the fortunes
of individual companies.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.100
And what I would
say is what we try

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:06.410
to do is it's one thing
to say that oil is at 50

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.390
and we're going to
invest in this company

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:11.190
because it will do
fine if oil's at 50,

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.450
survive if it goes to 30,
and thrive if it goes to 70.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.920
But it's another thing
to say oil is 50,

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.772
I think it's going
110, I'm going

00:48:18.772 --> 00:48:20.480
to invest in this
company, which is going

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.530
to be great if it goes to 110
but bankrupt if it stays at 50.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.370
So the question is, how
radical are your forecasts?

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:35.300
And we try to
anticipate a future that

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:41.870
looks pretty much like the
norm and make allowance

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.910
for the thing that things
other than the norm can happen.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:52.650
And I can't really be much
more concrete than that.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.995
By the way, all this
stuff is judgment.

00:48:54.995 --> 00:48:56.370
You know, there are no rules.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.890
There are no algorithms.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.510
There are no formulas
that always work.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.520
None of this is any good unless
the person making the decision

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.990
has superior judgment.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.820
And the first
chapter of the book

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.800
says the most important thing
is second level thinking.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.397
Most people think
on the first level.

00:49:13.397 --> 00:49:15.980
To be a superior investor, you
must think on the second level.

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.390
You have to think different
from everybody else.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:21.870
But in being different,
you have to be better.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:25.180
So the first level
thinker is naive.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.576
He says, this is a great
company, let's buy the stock.

00:49:27.576 --> 00:49:29.700
The second level thinker
says it's a great company,

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.700
but it's not as great as
everybody thinks it is.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.970
We better sell the stock.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.580
That's the difference
between being

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.520
an average person and a
person with superior insight.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:44.820
By the way, most people
are not above average.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.535
Yes, sir.

00:49:45.535 --> 00:49:48.050
AUDIENCE: Do you think
diversified index funds

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:51.490
adequately protect the
amateur investor from losers?

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.310
HOWARD MARKS: Well this
is a great question.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.660
The role of the index fund.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.550
A lot of people say, I'm going
to take a low risk approach.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.240
I'm going to invest
in an index fund.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.870
And they are confused.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.480
What an index fund does is
it guarantees you performance

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.860
in line with the index.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:20.050
So the point is because
of the operation of what's

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.687
called the efficient
market, not many people

00:50:22.687 --> 00:50:23.520
can beat the market.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.700
It's true.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.140
Most mutual funds do
not beat the market.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.990
Most mutual fund investors
would be better off just

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.460
to be in an index fund.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.730
And in fact, most active
investment schemes

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.180
impose fees that
they don't earn.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.030
And that is one of
the major reasons

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:46.810
that most active investment
schemes perform below average.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:51.160
So the index fund, which is
called passive investing,

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.910
yes it reduce,
eliminates, the likelihood

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.420
that you fail to keep
up with the index.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.600
It also, of course,
eliminates the possibility

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.210
that you outperformed the index.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:06.210
So you trade away the two sides
of the probability distribution

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:10.830
for surety that you
get index results.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.440
But it doesn't eliminate
the risk of the investment.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.460
It eliminates the risk of
deviating from the index.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.120
What you have to keep in mind
is that the index fund investor

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.710
loses money every time
the index goes down.

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:26.210
Why?

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:30.560
Because there's no value
added to keep it above.

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.160
And by the way, index
investing is a fine thing

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.330
for the average amateur
investor because

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.260
the average amateur
investor, number one,

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.410
can't beat the market
and, number two,

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.160
can't find anybody
or hire anybody

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.160
who can beat the market.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.640
But the only thing
is he shouldn't think

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.250
that it's a risk-less trade.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.720
You eliminate what we
call benchmark risk.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.150
But you retain the risk
of the underlying asset.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.930
AUDIENCE: So you've
been through one or two

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:09.440
of these business
cycles, I guess.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.716
HOWARD MARKS: Yes.

00:52:10.716 --> 00:52:13.480
AUDIENCE: And with
availability of information

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.910
and with a number of
books being written

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.245
about this subject about
value, and proper investing,

00:52:20.245 --> 00:52:22.890
and how many managers
don't beat the market,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.680
do you think the
average investor is

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.715
doing anything different
than they were 20 years ago?

00:52:28.715 --> 00:52:31.890
HOWARD MARKS:
Well, look, I think

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:35.080
there's a minor movement
toward indexation.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.080
It's not groundswell.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:42.000
There's still lots of money in
actively managed mutual funds

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.010
where there's 2% a year of fees
and costs or one and a half.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.400
But I think there's more
in indexation every year.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.260
And that's probably appropriate.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.000
But I'll just turn i around.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.320
I'll leave you with a question.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.770
Why can't people
beat the market?

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.060
Because the market's
pretty efficient.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.440
And market prices
most things right.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.000
And most people can't
find and identify

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.165
and act on the times when the
market prices things wrong.

00:53:10.165 --> 00:53:12.040
That's why most people
can't beat the market.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.050
That's what I learned at
University of Chicago.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.520
And I think it's pretty true.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.260
So the reason for the
inability to beat the market

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.520
is the markets efficiency.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.710
The markets efficiency comes
from the concerted efforts

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:26.130
of thousands of
investors who are

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.970
trying to find the bargains.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.530
What happens when
they stop trying?

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.850
So when the interest
in active investment

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.930
declines because
people give up on it

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.400
and turn to passive investing
and all the analysts

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.020
quick studying the
companies, then prices

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.910
resume their deviation
from intrinsic value.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:50.970
Then it becomes possible
to beat the market again.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:54.880
So it's really paradoxical and,
I would say, counter-intuitive.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.830
But I don't think we
are close to that day.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:01.150
But in theory, there comes a
day when so little attention

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:02.680
is being paid to
active investing

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.071
that active investing
starts working again.

00:54:06.071 --> 00:54:06.570
Yes, sir.

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.060
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Howard,
for coming for the talk.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.760
To talk about the difference
in value and the price,

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.320
the other dimension is time.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.060
So how do you estimate the time
taking to [INAUDIBLE] to close?

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.300
HOWARD MARKS: You never do.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.750
You never know.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:25.130
See, what he's saying-- again,
it's a very good question.

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:28.920
And what we want
to do is we want

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.480
to find things where the
intrinsic value is here

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.070
and the price is here.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.885
So his question is, how
do we estimate the time

00:54:35.885 --> 00:54:39.310
that it's going to take
for the gap to close?

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:42.130
And the answer is
there's no way to say.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.970
On occasion, there are
what we call catalysts.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:53.120
And one catalyst would be the
pending maturity of a bond.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.491
If a bond is going
to mature in 2012

00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:57.490
and it's selling at 60
because most people think

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.650
it's going to go
bankrupt but we think

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.500
it's going to pay
off at maturity,

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.800
then the existence
of the maturity date

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.460
is going to force the
convergence of price to value.

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:17.220
Another catalyst today is
all these activist investors.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.180
They find the company.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.670
It's selling.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.100
They think the
interesting value is here.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.225
It's selling here because
the management is sub par

00:55:22.225 --> 00:55:23.933
and they're not doing
the right strategy.

00:55:23.933 --> 00:55:24.540
So they go in.

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.682
They foment trouble.

00:55:25.682 --> 00:55:26.890
They try to get a board seat.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.910
They try to force the
management to do the right thing

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:34.900
to course, to cause, the price
to converge with the value.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.010
So there are a few
catalyst in the world.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:38.770
But generally speaking,
you buy a stock.

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.631
You hope-- you would
think it's worth here.

00:55:40.631 --> 00:55:41.380
The price is here.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.338
You hope it'll convert.

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:45.170
But there's no way
to estimate the time.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:49.670
And that's the reason why being
too far ahead of your time

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.890
is [INAUDIBLE] from
being wrong because it

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.215
can take a long time.

00:55:53.215 --> 00:55:55.590
AUDIENCE: Would you always
look for presence of catalyst

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:56.594
when you find a gap?

00:55:56.594 --> 00:55:58.010
HOWARD MARKS: There
aren't enough.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.290
I mean, it happens.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.580
Most of what we do is in
the fixed income world.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.390
And there are more catalysts
in the fixed income world

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.700
than in the equity world.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.170
You find a stock.

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.580
How many stocks you think
the activist investors

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:14.750
go after a year?

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.250
10?

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:15.670
20?

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:16.090
50?

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:16.590
100?

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:17.610
No more.

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:19.510
There are thousands of stocks.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.627
So most stocks are never
going to get catalyzed.

00:56:22.627 --> 00:56:24.210
AUDIENCE: Curious
if you could tell us

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.640
what it was like when you
were out raising money

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.270
for Oak Tree in the early days.

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:34.468
I would imagine that today
some clients are skeptical.

00:56:34.468 --> 00:56:35.842
But I would imagine
that it was--

00:56:35.842 --> 00:56:37.850
was it a lot different
for you back then?

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:41.480
HOWARD MARKS: Well by the
time we started Oak Tree,

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.530
it wasn't that hard because
we had a reputation.

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:49.810
But when I started raising
money for our strategies--

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:53.540
1978 junk bonds-- 90% of
investment organizations

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:59.070
like Google had a
rule, a concrete rule,

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.850
against any bond investing below
A or below investment grade,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:05.330
which is BBB.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.930
And of course, Moody said
it's an imprudent investment.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:12.040
So that was very,
very hard to overcome.

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.425
But what you have to do is
you have to find a few people.

00:57:15.425 --> 00:57:17.260
You see, you have to
find a few people.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.430
You have to go say to
them you should do this

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.810
because nobody else is.

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.144
Because nobody else is doing
it, it's languishing cheap.

00:57:25.144 --> 00:57:26.560
You make no money
doing the things

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.610
that everybody wants to do.

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.026
You make money by
doing the things

00:57:29.026 --> 00:57:33.040
that nobody wants to do who
then turn out to have value.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.020
And if you say that message to
100 investors in the beginning,

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.680
maybe 10 jump on board.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.740
After it works for a
while, then the rest

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.970
come on, like the screen says.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:46.970
But hopefully, not too extreme.

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:50.020
But the point is it was
very hard in the beginning.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.530
And in certain
foreign countries,

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:57.210
it was even harder because in
certain foreign countries where

00:57:57.210 --> 00:58:01.589
the thinking is a little more
narrow than American thinking

00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:03.755
I always thought that if I
go into somebody's office

00:58:03.755 --> 00:58:05.879
and I say you should do
this because nobody else is

00:58:05.879 --> 00:58:09.550
they'd call the man in the
white coat to take me away.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:10.962
They don't understand.

00:58:10.962 --> 00:58:14.680
You know, I think that
Americans semi intuitively

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.910
understand the value
of contrarianism

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.810
and of being a maverick.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:21.760
But in many countries,
they just don't get it.

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.940
So that's an
example, high yield.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:27.450
But then we started Oak
Tree in-- oh, no, no.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:28.690
That was at Citi.

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:32.530
In '85, I switched from Citi to
Trust Company of the West, TCW.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.910
And in '88, we brought out
the first distress debt fund.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:39.030
Now we're not
investing in companies

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:40.580
that have a risk of default.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.850
We're investing in bonds
that are either in default

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:46.025
or sure to be.

00:58:46.025 --> 00:58:47.650
And people would say,
well, how can you

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.990
possibly make money
investing in the bonds

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.410
of bankrupt companies?

00:58:52.410 --> 00:59:00.000
And we had to explain to them
that if a creditor of a company

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.280
doesn't get paid the interest
in principle as promised,

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.780
they have a claim against
the value of the company.

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.750
And they exert that claim in
a process called bankruptcy.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:12.160
And in bankruptcy,
to oversimplify

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.690
and over generalize, the
old owners are wiped out.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.420
And the old creditors
become the new owners.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.790
And if you bought an ownership
stake through the debt

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:24.910
for--what-- for less than it's
worth, then you make money.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:31.130
And we've made about 23% a
year for 28 years investing

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:37.160
in distressed debt before
fees without any leverage.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.240
So that's pretty astronomical.

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:39.740
Why?

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.420
Because from time to
time in distress debt

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.990
you get to buy things for
less than they're worth.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:47.630
And in fact because
other people are fleeing

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.070
from the bankruptcy,
maybe you get

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:53.620
them to buy them for a lot
less than they're worth.

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.760
So it's very challenging.

00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.250
But you can't
convince everybody.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.850
But if you can
explain the merits

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:10.407
and tell the story clearly,
and concisely, and persuasively

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:11.490
then you get some clients.

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:13.010
And then, if you
get good results,

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:16.205
then you get more clients.

01:00:16.205 --> 01:00:18.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Howard, for your talk.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.290
One question.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:23.300
Buffet, in '99, said that if he
was running very small amounts

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.310
of money he would be able
to find lots of bargains

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:28.460
and beat the market
by 50% and he

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.415
would use the word guaranteed.

01:00:30.415 --> 01:00:31.790
I presume he meant
that there are

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:36.630
a lot of inefficiencies in the
small capitalization stocks.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:40.910
One thing that kind of surprises
me is if someone, an analyst,

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:42.870
willing to work
hard on his own, not

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:46.330
in an institution, the word
of distress debt investing

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:50.002
is kind of shut out, even
for the value investor.

01:00:50.002 --> 01:00:51.960
[INAUDIBLE] with a lot
of technicalities and it

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.597
seems like the big institution
has a lot of advantage there.

01:00:55.597 --> 01:01:00.330
Are there such inefficiencies
that are kind of shut out

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:03.230
to the institutions but the
small investor willing to work

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:06.190
hard can find inefficiencies
in the debt world?

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:12.730
HOWARD MARKS: Well I think
that the small guy can even

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:15.050
be active in distressed debt.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:18.230
He can't get enough bonds to
get a seat at the creditors

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:20.190
committee table or have a voice.

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:24.080
But he can still
find superior values.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.240
You know, so what I was saying
in answer to your question

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.880
is that if you get some accounts
and you have good performance,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.550
you'll get more accounts.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:35.320
So that goes a little
further because what I really

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.340
say is that if you
have good performance,

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.900
you'll get more money.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.610
And eventually, if you let
that process become unchecked,

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:45.050
if you get more money,
you'll have bad performance.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:48.120
And this is one of the
conundrums in our business.

01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:55.310
So you have to halt that.

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:59.230
But the truth of the matter
is that the little guy

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:04.270
has an advantage as long as
he's willing to stay small.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:09.310
Many people are not because in
the short run, the more money

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:16.280
you manage when you get
fees, it's a great lure

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.250
to take on more money.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.030
But you have to
stop it at a point

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.610
before it starts running
your performance.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:25.970
Now, for the data
scientists among us,

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:35.860
I always like to point out that
if I worked at Firestone Tires

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.830
and I developed a new
tire, and I wanted

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:40.870
to know how far it would
go, I would put it on a car

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:42.760
and run it until
it blew up, right.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.250
That's called
destructive testing.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:48.460
But as an investor with clients
and a fiduciary responsibility,

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.890
I don't have the luxury of
doing destructive testing.

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:53.859
So I can't add more.

01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:55.400
People always say
to me, well, what's

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.740
the limit on how much
money you can invest well?

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.780
And I can't find out by
running into the wall.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.676
I have to stop this
side of the wall.

01:03:03.676 --> 01:03:05.050
One of the
interesting lessons is

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:06.790
that if you stop
this side of the wall

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:10.520
then you never find out
where the wall really is.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.800
But that's what we have to do.

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.140
So you have to stop.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.820
And I believe that
the person who

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:25.420
has a big brain, and a little
money, and a lot of time,

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:31.350
and exceptional insight
can find great bargains.

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:35.000
But that's a pretty
daunting list.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.815
And I don't think that Buffett's
guarantee necessarily extents

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.203
to everybody in this room.

01:03:51.346 --> 01:03:54.740
AUDIENCE: Do you see any
unhealthy trends in valuation

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.180
in the market today the
same way [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.430
was valued in the past?

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:10.400
HOWARD MARKS: Yes, I do
because the menu extends.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.920
What we call the
capital market line

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.940
extends from what's
called the risk free rate.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.820
The risk free rate is the
rate, generally speaking,

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.140
on the 30 day treasury bill.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.140
And of course, if you can
get 3% on the risk free rate,

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.104
then in order to tie up your
money for five years in a five

01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:28.270
year treasury you want four.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.140
And to get it 10
years, you want five.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.740
And if you can get 10 years on
a government security of 5%,

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.310
then in order to go into a
corporate security, which

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:39.230
has some credit risk,
you would demand six.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.380
And to go into a high
yield bond, you demand 12

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.620
and so forth.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.290
So there's a kind of a process
called equilibration, which

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.560
makes things line up in terms
of relative risk and return

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.880
but always pegged from
the risk free rate.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.030
Today, the risk
free rate is zero.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:59.350
So everything that I just
named, this capital market line,

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:01.900
has had a parallel
downward shift.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:08.250
So before the
crisis, [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:10.930
mentioned about the fact
that I turned bearish.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:14.380
All my money was in
was in treasuries.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.400
All the money that I had outside
of Oak Tree was in treasuries.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.082
And I was getting 6 1/2% for
one, two, three, four, five,

01:05:21.082 --> 01:05:22.870
six year maturities.

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:25.880
I was getting income and safety.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.100
Today, you have a choice.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.590
Income or safety because
the things today that

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:33.030
are highly safe pay no income.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.104
You know, and if
you go to Fidelity--

01:05:35.104 --> 01:05:36.020
conduct an experiment.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.220
Go to Fidelity or Vanguard
or a big mutual fund firm

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.820
and go online and look at
their menu of offerings

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:48.310
and what is the current net
yield after fees and expenses.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.680
And you'll see that for
money market and short term

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.640
treasuries, and maybe
intermediate treasury,

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.680
the yield is zero.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.930
So just think.

01:05:57.930 --> 01:06:01.810
The guy is watching the
Super Bowl in his undershirt.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.430
He gets a statement
from Fidelity.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:08.840
He opens it up, and it says the
yield on your fund is now zero.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.660
He grabs the phone.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.220
He calls the 800 number.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.300
He says get me out of that
fund that yields zero,

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.260
and put me in the
one that yields six.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.710
And he becomes a high
yield bond investor.

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:20.520
He has no idea why.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.340
He doesn't know what
a high yield bond is.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.575
He doesn't understand
what the dangers are.

01:06:24.575 --> 01:06:28.050
He doesn't understand how to
pick a high yield bond manager.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:32.340
But he's seduced by
that 6% versus zero.

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.100
And all around the
investment world

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.920
today, people are
chasing return.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.660
They don't like the
low returns that are

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.070
available on safe instruments.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.690
They're going for the gusto.

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:45.490
They're going for
riskier instruments.

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:49.020
And they're doing it mindlessly.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.510
And I promised you I'd
mention some memos.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.940
I forgot to do that.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.910
But if you go back, I wrote one
in March of '07 called The Race

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.480
To The Bottom.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.590
And I talked about
the fact that when

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:04.150
people are, number one,
eager to invest and, number

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:08.060
two, not sufficiently risk
conscious they do risky things.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.890
And when people do
risky things, the market

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:11.290
becomes a risky place.

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.230
And that's why Buffett
says, the less prudence

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:14.990
with which others
conduct their affairs,

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:16.448
the greater the
prudence with which

01:07:16.448 --> 01:07:17.980
we must conduct our own affairs.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.030
And that is going on
now to some extent

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:24.410
because people can't get a good
return from safe instruments.

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:27.300
They're going into the risky
ones, and they're bidding.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:31.760
You know, so there's
a race to the bottom.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.510
It's like an auction.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:37.022
Now if you want to buy a
painting at Sotheby's, there's

01:07:37.022 --> 01:07:38.980
an auction, and the
painting goes to the person

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.940
who pays the highest price.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.339
But in the investment world,
it's a reverse auction.

01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:46.880
Well sometimes you
pay highest price,

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.170
but sometimes you
bid in lowest return.

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:54.620
So there's a bond that's going
to be issued by a company.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.510
I say I demand 7% interest.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.970
And this fellow says,
no, I'll take six.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:02.910
And that guy says,
I'll take five.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.340
I say I want protective
covenants to make sure

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.800
that the company can't do
things that ruins its own credit

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.760
worthiness.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.520
He says I'll do it
with less covenants.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.960
And that guy says, I'll
do it with no covenants.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.149
What happens?

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:19.420
The bond is issued at
5% with no covenants.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.290
And that's the
race to the bottom.

01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.569
And anybody who
participates in that bond

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:26.370
probably could be
making a mistake.

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:27.870
And that's going on now.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:34.740
Not to the same terrible extent
that it was in '06 and '07.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.880
But you got to be careful today.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.080
Oak Tree's model for
the last 3 and 1/2 years

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.390
has been move forward
but with caution.

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.290
Caution has to be a
very important component

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.749
of everybody's actions today.

01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:51.540
Well thank you very
much for being with me.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:52.850
And I hope you enjoyed it.

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:56.244
And when I think of more
stuff, I'll come back.

01:08:56.244 --> 01:08:57.709
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:59.859
[APPLAUSE]
