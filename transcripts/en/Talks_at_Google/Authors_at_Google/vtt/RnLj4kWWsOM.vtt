[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:06.660
DAVID KWONG: Hi.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.390
Hello, Google.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.598
Thank you for having me back.

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.792
It's so great to be here.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:12.750
My name is David Kwong.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.830
I am a magician.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm also a puzzler.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.150
I write a lot of crosswords
for "The New York Times."

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.191
I've basically taken the
world's nerdiest hobbies

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.186
and combined them
right into one career.

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:23.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:25.950
But that's because I think
magic tricks are puzzles

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.230
I think they are ways
of challenging your mind

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.284
and testing you to figure out
the solution, which is why I

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:34.950
thought I'd start off with this,
the Rubik's Cube, which I think

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
is now 42 or 43 years old.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
I'm sure there are tons
of cubers here at Google.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.130
I kind of solve them
like a magician.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.720
You could see there's
a pretty good mix.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.671
I can just toss this up like
that I can solve the Cube.

00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:55.170
Don't worry.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.690
It'll get better.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.120
It'll get better.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.619
Don't worry.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.270
I am here to talk about
my new book and the way

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.099
a magician thinks.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.770
And this is a very
exciting for me.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.890
I've really just given
one presentation in LA.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.350
And this is my first coming
out party with "Spellbound."

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.630
A little bit about me--

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.870
I am part of a small group
of practitioners of magicians

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.660
that do not pretend in any way
whatsoever to have superpowers.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.600
I acknowledge right up
front that it's all science.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.390
It is all planning
and preparation

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.920
and the art of misdirection and
understanding human behavior.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.510
And most magicians
are not that way.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.842
But there are some
great examples

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.550
of people that have
had this approach are

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.470
like Penn and Teller, who
for decades have acknowledged

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.970
that it's all trickery and some
of the great sleight of hand

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.920
artists as well.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740
Which is why I wrote
this book, "The Seven

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.410
Principles of Illusion"

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.390
Don't call them
magic police on me.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.140
These are just principles,
fundamental principles.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.770
I've tried very hard not
to ruin anyone's magic show

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.060
with this book.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.570
I do want to take you through
a couple of the principles.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.260
And it starts with a
story out of Hollywood.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.060
I live in Los Angeles.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.230
And my good friend, Edgar
Wright, the film director--

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.860
"Shaun of the Dead," "Hot Fuzz,"
"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"--

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.259
can throw those
up on the screen.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.800
He asked me to come
over to his house

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.990
and teach him how
a magician thinks.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.460
And Edgar, as you can
imagine, is really

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.720
into con games and deception.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.710
And he has a movie
that's coming out

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.470
next month called
"Baby Driver," which

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.912
is about a getaway
driver for heists.

00:02:44.912 --> 00:02:47.120
So I was not surprised when
he called me up and asked

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.350
me to come over and teach him
how a magician and a con man

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.600
thinks.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.560
The afternoon did not
get off to a great start.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.256
I showed up about
15 minutes late.

00:02:58.256 --> 00:02:59.630
I was with my
friend, Blake Vogt,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.389
who's a fantastic magician
and trick creator.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.680
And we couldn't find the house.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.300
And we were
apologizing profusely.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.270
But everything was fine
once we started performing

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.990
tricks in the living room.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.180
Edgar was happy.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.560
We were happy.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.580
But then we finished.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.180
And Edgar said, show
me your best trick.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.030
And we're like, Edgar, we
just-- we just showed--

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.580
we just did our coolest stuff.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.950
But OK.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.152
We have an idea.

00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:27.110
Do you have a driveway?

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.069
Do you have an outdoor
space that we can go to?

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.735
And Edgar said, well,
I have a backyard.

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:32.160
Let's go to the
backyard instead.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.350
So we went out through the
kitchen to the veranda.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.310
And we stood in this
lovely backyard.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.420
And I said to Edgar,
name any playing card--

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.520
absolute free choice.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.530
He said five of hearts.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.510
And then we said, point
anywhere you want in the yard.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.090
And he pointed at a
bush at about 2 o'clock

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.654
from where we were standing.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:56.570
And I said, I want you
to go over to that bush

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.840
and get down in the dirt at the
mulch at the base of that bush

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.472
and dig.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:01.430
And that's what he did.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.620
And he found a folded
up playing card.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.830
And it was the five hearts.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.675
Edgar lost his shit.

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:11.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.710
Now, normally I keep the
method behind a secret

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.480
like this to myself.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.410
I do not share.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.790
I do not reveal the secrets.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.210
But because Edgar had asked
me to come over and teach him

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.980
how a magician thinks, Blake
and I pulled out an iPad

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.730
and we played him
this video here.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.640
This is Blake burying 52 playing
cards in Edgar's backyard

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.550
three hours before the meeting.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.530
And we memorized exactly
where they were going.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.360
Now this is how magic works.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.830
It's not smoke and mirrors.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.200
It's not dancing ladies.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.820
It's forethought.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.990
It's anticipation.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.590
It's planning.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.310
And as a puzzler
and a magician, I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.080
operate in that intersection
between preparation

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.720
and misdirection.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.480
Now, what this involved
was a principle called

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.520
"the illusion of free choice."

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.960
And here's what
that principle is.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.480
This is one of the meatier
chapters of my book,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.370
the Illusion of Free Choice.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.390
It basically states that if you
can get your audience believing

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.840
that they are dictating
how a trick goes,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.626
they will buy into
the illusion more.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.000
Blake and I did
not make this up.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.390
Think about this.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.920
When was the last time
that you had a project

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.470
that you were trying to
get your boss to approve

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.750
and in order to
get your approval,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.090
you convinced her it was
her idea to begin with.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.331
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:52.830
Right?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.288
That's the illusion
of free choice.

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:56.340
Or if you're in a sales
meeting, if you're

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.460
trying to sell your
product, you would probably

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.500
have more success if
you're able to convince

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.390
the person on the
other side of the table

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.720
that it's their idea rather
than strong arming them

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.250
with a hard sell.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.080
Now, I want to talk a little bit
about the social science of how

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.150
this works, of why the illusion
of free choice and choice

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.800
itself is so effective.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.700
And it involves a
experiment in the year 2000

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.570
by two French scientists,
Nicolas Gueguen

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.699
and Alexandre Pascual.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.740
Those are the names of
the two French scientists.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.780
And it involved a
theory called "you

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.960
are free to accept or refuse."

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.870
So here's the experiment
that they did.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.440
They took a young man and they
had him go into a bus station

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.480
and ask to one group
of people, may I

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.360
please have change for the bus?

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.849
And he was given a
certain amount of money.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:56.890
And then that young man
went into the bus station

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.170
and asked another
group of people,

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.300
may I please have
change for the bus?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.510
But you are free to
accept or refuse.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.030
Basically, reminding
people of their free will,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.780
which is so, so important to us.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.430
We, as human beings,
are wired to want to be

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.680
able to choose things freely.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.090
And the results were the first
group, 5% of the people--

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.810
I'm sorry.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.057
10% of the people gave
him money for the bus.

00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:24.640
And then the second group that
he reminded of their free will,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.170
47.5% of the people gave--
a nearly 5% increase.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.754
And what's more, is the
people that gave money--

00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:33.420
because they were
reminded of their free

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.380
will-- also gave more money.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.830
The denomination was higher.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.621
So when you are reminded
of your free will,

00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:42.460
you are more compliant and more
cooperative and more obliging.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.190
And magicians know this.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.640
Now there is something else
called the "choice-supportive

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.960
bias," which means that
when you choose something,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.350
when you discover something,
when you have your own idea,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.040
you will defend to
that idea to the death.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.020
You will defend it even
in the face of data

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.610
that says that you're wrong.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.430
You hold on to your
own ideas deeply.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.717
And magicians know this as well.

00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:13.300
And we take advantage
of this as well.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.710
We have something
that we like to do,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.090
which is called
a "leave behind,"

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.907
a "leave behind," which is--

00:08:22.907 --> 00:08:24.490
well, let me give
you an example that.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.120
It's as if I were doing the
magic coloring book, which

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.484
is something you probably
saw at a kids show

00:08:30.484 --> 00:08:31.400
when you were younger.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.940
The magic coloring book
is you flip through it,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.990
and it's blank.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.448
And then you flip
through it again,

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:37.940
and there are black
lined drawings.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.700
And then you flip
through it again,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.510
and those drawings
are now colored.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.220
And it's cut like
a fashion magazine.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.064
There are different ways that
you can flip through the book.

00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:47.230
I think it's OK that I'm
spoiling the magic coloring

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.940
book.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.810
But then after the show when
you're the magician, after you

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:59.880
leave, you, by accident, leave
behind an all-blank version

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.220
of the magic coloring
book that you can also

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.760
buy for $5 at hocuspocus.com.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.180
It's a great investment.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.900
And when you discover
that yourself when--

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.610
or maybe, I can't
tell you how many--

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.080
I've done a trick with an
object that's not quite fair.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.040
And then I will leave a
normal object in the trash

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.050
can on the way out.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.710
I can't tell you how many
people will go like, hmm.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.500
I'm going to go check that out
because I'm curious and clever.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.600
And when you discover that,
when you take your own freewill

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.320
and you discover
that, the illusion

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.480
becomes absolutely bulletproof.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.810
So there's a wonderful
example from history

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.880
of this being effective.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.910
And it's World War II.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.490
It's April 30, 1943.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.690
And a body is found
floating in the Atlantic

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.150
off the coast of Huelva, Spain--

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.520
found by a Spanish fisherman.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.140
The body is in military khakis
kept afloat by a life jacket.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.440
And chained to the dead man's
wrist was a locked briefcase.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.630
Now an inspection
of the man's wallet

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.040
revealed that his name was Major
William Martin of the British

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.420
Navy.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.900
Major Willie Martin, however,
was just an illusion.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:31.820
He was conjured by a hush-part
of the British Secret Service.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.520
I forget the name
of the actual--

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.540
it's like M-17 or
something like that, M-17.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.690
But it was part of the
British Secret Service.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.300
And they went through a
great number of details

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.700
to buttress this
illusion that became

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.730
known as Operation Mincemeat.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.990
That's what it was called.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.330
Have you heard of that
before, Operation Mincemeat?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.697
Here's what they did.

00:10:58.697 --> 00:10:59.280
I'll show you.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.920
This is a picture
of the actual body

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.630
that was found in the water.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.650
They took a cadaver.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.820
And put it in military garb.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.840
They took out an
obituary, a death notice

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.640
in the evening paper.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.170
And they also had in his wallet
a picture of his girlfriend.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.330
So all these details to
bolster this illusion.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.270
What the Allies were
banking on was that Spain--

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.930
which was technically
neutral but seemed

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:33.450
to have formed a slight
alliance with the Germans--

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.080
they were banking
that the Spanish would

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.459
give the briefcase over
to the Germans secretly

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.750
and that they would open the
contents of that briefcase

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.730
without anybody knowing.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.650
And inside was disinformation--

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.780
disinformation that said
where the Allies were going

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.210
to invade from North Africa.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.120
They were perched
in North Africa.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.250
They were gonna invade
across the Mediterranean.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.833
But the Germans
didn't know whether it

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.570
was going to be Greece or
Sardinia or the Balkans

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.710
or Sicily.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.560
But the disinformation
conveyed that it

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.780
was Greece and
Sardinia, which is

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.570
where the Germans
concentrated their defenses.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.140
And that allowed the Allies
to invade Sicily instead,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.750
which was undefended.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.400
Operation Mincemeat.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.050
The Allies were what
many sociologists

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.490
call a "choice architect."

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.670
They design the
choice environment

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.790
in which decisions are made.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.460
Cass Sunstein and Richard
Thaler in their book,

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.490
"Nudge," really define
this quite well.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.360
So nudging is the
idea for a leader

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.010
that you know what
decisions have

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.200
to be made for your employees.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.300
But you allow them
to arrive freely

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.740
at the best decision themselves.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.760
That's nudging.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.320
Probably the best
way to describe it

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.770
is you take the healthy
food in the cafeteria

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.470
and you put that at a eye level.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.160
I wonder if Google should take
advantage of this strategy.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.310
Do they?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.943
DAVID KWONG: That's great.

00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:01.650
So they nudge you here.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.757
But everybody knows where
the pizza is, right?

00:13:04.757 --> 00:13:05.590
You had pizza today.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.750
Let's see.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.280
A choice architect
will design ways

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.580
to help people make choices
that they themselves think

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.950
are better-- choice architect.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.980
Dwight D. Eisenhower has
a great quote that I love.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.720
And I'll put that up
on the screen, which

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.090
is "Leadership is the
art of getting people

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.900
to want what must be done,"
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.320
Now, here's a here's a cool
trick that you can try at home,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.850
how you can be a
choice architect

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.510
and alter the
choice environment.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.030
So if you have somebody choose
a playing card-- pick a card,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.950
any card--

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.480
let's say it's the
queen of hearts.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.056
And you figure out what it is.

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:46.930
We can talk afterward
about a variety of ways

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.221
that you can figure out what
the card is and shuffle it

00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:49.900
and control it.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.380
But the reveal should
be the following.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.974
You're going to layout four
cards for your audience.

00:13:57.974 --> 00:13:59.890
You're going to put one
card in front of them.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.410
The next card will be the chosen
card, the queen of hearts,

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.160
then a third card, and
then a fourth card.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.760
And you're going to say
to your audience member,

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.962
choose any card.

00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:10.420
And most of the
time, they're going

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.830
to go for the queen of hearts.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.910
Why?

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.500
Because the first card is
too obvious of a choice.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.810
And the third card
and the fourth card

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.780
you've placed just far
enough away on the table

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.230
that they have to uncomfortably
get up to touch the cards.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.630
So they'll go for
the second one there.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.580
That's being a choice architect.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:37.460
Now, you might be wondering
is illusion inherently

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.620
deceptive and manipulative?

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.590
Well, I am trying to
do something different

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.260
with this book.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.880
I believe that illusion,
there is a more positive way

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.460
that you can command your
life, and be in control,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.020
and be one, two, three steps
ahead of everybody else.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.990
So just think about
this the next time

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.500
you are in a negotiation.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.220
Think about how you can
be a choice architect

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.400
and empower the person on
the other side of the table

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.090
so that they can make decisions
that are good for themselves,

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.240
and good for both of
you, and everybody wins.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.740
Now I want to talk
a little bit more

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.620
about the backyard card
trick with Edgar Wright.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.120
Because there were
some ways that we

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.870
were able to enhance
that illusion with what

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.810
I like to call the
"illusion of spontaneity."

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.720
I mentioned that we showed up
three hours before the meeting

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.470
to bury cards.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.070
But we were able to sell
the illusion of spontaneity

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.210
by showing up for the meeting
15 minutes late on purpose

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.260
and saying, sorry.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.512
We couldn't find the house.

00:15:41.512 --> 00:15:42.720
We've never been here before.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.249
We're sorry that we're late.

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:47.290
And then we were in his
living room doing tricks.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.640
And we waited for him to
ask us to do one more trick.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.700
We did not offer to
do a final trick.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.450
We waited for him.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.570
It was his idea to see one more.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.320
And then I suggested, let's
go out to the driveway

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.700
to do a trick outside.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.440
And I let him upgrade us
to his lovely backyard.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440
Now of course, if he had
agreed to the driveway,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.932
we would have
pivoted and suggested

00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:10.890
the backyard ourselves.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.450
But we didn't need to.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.610
We put everything in his hands.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.900
Now, once we were
in the backyard,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.010
you're probably wondering, how
did we get him to point right

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.960
where the five hearts was?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.820
And I'm not going to tell you.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.500
No.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.360
We used a lot of
suggestion and influence

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.540
to get him to do that.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.440
But I will say that the
important technique that we use

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.740
is that we were able to be in
control of the narrative, which

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.140
is another big thing in magic,
which is controlling the story.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.440
And just after the
trick, we started

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.770
to reinforce right away, you
could have pointed anywhere

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.550
you wanted.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.060
And every time I run into
him at a cocktail party

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.309
or at a friend's party
and the story comes up,

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.350
hey, remember that trick
we did in your backyard?

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.240
You could've pointed
anywhere you wanted.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.220
You pointed right
where the card was.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.619
And I'm always, always
still working on this trick

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:00.660
and improving this trick.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:06.200
Magicians can manipulate
your memory of what happened.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.400
So I'm done with this.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.390
We can take that down.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.359
I'm going to demonstrate
some tricks for you.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:22.750
I didn't sneak in here yesterday
and bury 52 playing cards.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.880
But I can.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.852
Let's have a little fun
with the playing cards.

00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:28.890
Where did I put that?

00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:34.730
I had an open one.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.800
Oh, no?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.520
Am I crazy?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.020
OK.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.020
We'll open a new pack.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:39.520
Oh, no.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.630
Here we go.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.710
OK.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:48.610
So instead of one
card, let's try

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.917
for a number of playing cards.

00:17:51.917 --> 00:17:54.000
And we'll have a number
of playing cards selected.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.930
Actually, you know what?

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.560
Take that back.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.350
Let's start with one card.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.850
Let's start with
one signed card.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.780
I'll show you how a magician
can control a single playing

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.380
card in the deck.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.110
So I'm going to come right here.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.360
I'm going to come to you, sir.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.230
I'm gonna have you
choose any card you like.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.130
Oh, the top card.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.760
He's that guy.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.260
OK.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.842
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.842 --> 00:18:11.800
That's quite all right.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.050
You are going to sign it so
it's the only card like that.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.827
How do you know I didn't
want you to take that card?

00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:20.160
It's like-- no, not on the back.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.240
The back is too
easy for me to find.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.000
Right there on the face.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.620
It's OK if I see it.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.270
It's fine because
you are now making

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.750
it a unique card, the only
card with your signature.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.400
Thank you for your help.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.300
What is your name?

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.140
AUDIENCE: Matthew.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.500
DAVID KWONG: Matthew?

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:31.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.220
DAVID KWONG: Great.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.180
Thank you so much.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.170
OK.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.100
So we have Matthew's
six of clubs.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.252
This is how a magician
can track a single playing

00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:42.960
card in the deck.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.470
So these are called overhand
shuffle, as you know,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.440
overhand shuffles.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.440
This is a-- it's a
bit of a racist term.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.780
It's called the Hindu shuffle.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.810
And that's because that's how
many people shuffle in Asia.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.290
It's a 19th century term,
or maybe even earlier.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.700
My father from Hong
Kong shuffles this way.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.270
So I'm allowed to
make that joke.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.310
I think we still call
it the Hindu shuffle.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.260
These are, of course, overhand--

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.350
I mean riffle shuffles.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.870
Everyone can shuffle
this way, right?

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.740
And we have what's called
a faro shuffle, F-A-R-O,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.590
which is an old French
card game, F-A-R-O.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.010
And that's when you split
the cards in half like this.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.815
And they spring together
in such a fashion.

00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:31.620
F-A-R-O.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.780
So Matthew, you
chose a playing card.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.210
You chose the six of clubs.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.782
And my goal here is to control
it to the top of the pack.

00:19:40.782 --> 00:19:42.740
With a little snap my
fingers, I should be able

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.780
get one card, the six
of clubs, to come back

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.400
to the top of the pack, right?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.710
Now, this is where it gets
a little more complicated.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.210
I'll take the six of clubs.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.540
I'll place it about
halfway down, push it in,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.690
and if I stopped my fingers,
I should be able to get one--

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:02.650
oh-- one card to come back
to the top of the pack.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.730
All right.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.975
Let's try this again.

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:06.975
I'll give it a few cuts.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.675
And the six of clubs--

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:16.107
Oh yeah.

00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:18.199
That's a good one.

00:20:18.199 --> 00:20:19.990
The six of clubs-- as
I'll snap my fingers,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.610
I should be able to get
that card to come right up

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.929
back to the top of the pack.

00:20:22.929 --> 00:20:24.970
I'll give you a sporting
chance to follow the six

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.107
clubs this time.

00:20:26.107 --> 00:20:27.190
I'm going to take the six.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.990
And I'm going to
leave it sticking off

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.070
the top of the pack.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.190
So now, if I cut it down to
the bottom without touching it.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.561
And now it has to rise up
through about 50 other cards

00:20:36.561 --> 00:20:37.310
to get to the top.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.060
Now, I promise you it has
not gone to the top yet.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.274
That's the seven of diamonds.

00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.940
I'm going to take the
seven of diamonds.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.150
I'm going to push in
your card like this.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.850
It's going to rise to the top
and take the place of the seven

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.400
of diamonds on the top and then
hop over here to my right hand.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.250
OK.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.420
Let's try this.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.930
I'm going to give you a little
demonstration of misdirection--

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.410
misdirection--

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.661
misdirection.

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:07.160
Let's see.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.920
I'm gonna make this fair here.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.212
Can I show you this?

00:21:11.212 --> 00:21:11.920
What's your name?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.430
AUDIENCE: Anita.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.221
DAVID KWONG: Anita.

00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:14.710
So you see the six of clubs.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.210
I'm going to let you see it
til the last second because I

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.400
know it's been confusing
with the face down.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.170
So I'm going to let
you see it like that.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.376
And you're going to help me.

00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:23.750
We're going to
push into the fan.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.260
So would you take it
and push it flush?

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.430
Like knock it right in.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.030
Yeah, good.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:30.976 --> 00:21:33.922
[SHUFFLING CARDS]

00:21:46.432 --> 00:21:46.932
Here ya go.

00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:47.884
AUDIENCE: Hm?

00:21:47.884 --> 00:21:48.384
Ah!

00:21:48.384 --> 00:21:49.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.720
DAVID KWONG: All right.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.320
Everyone give her a
round of applause.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.230
That was not fair.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.840
But thank you for being
a good sport there.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.790
Yeah, thank you
for humiliating me

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.310
in front of these people, David.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.230
The six of clubs--

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.300
six of clubs-- I should be able
to get that back to the top.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.212
I'll let you watch it face up
into the middle of the pack.

00:22:13.212 --> 00:22:15.670
I'm going to put it actually
a little closer to the bottom.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.040
I'll leave it face up
this time, face up,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.260
as I put some other
cards on top it.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.560
I will take the second card,
which is the three of clubs.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.241
I'll cover it for just a
moment and snap my fingers just

00:22:26.241 --> 00:22:26.740
like that.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.090
And it should change the six.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.250
Did I get you on that one?

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.840
Yeah, that's good.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.580
Watch that six of clubs one
more time about 3/4 of the way

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.650
down, just like that.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.805
We should be able
to get one card.

00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:42.670
Oh, I forgot to snap.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.170
You have to snap
or it doesn't work.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.295
When you snap, then it
turns into the six of clubs.

00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:47.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:49.150
Now you're probably
wondering how this works.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.332
What if I told you I had more
than one six of clubs with--

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:55.790
Matthew, with your
signature on it?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.267
What if I told you that I
managed to replicate your card?

00:22:59.267 --> 00:23:00.600
And let me show you what I mean.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.099
Look.

00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:02.590
We have there's one there.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:10.104
That's one two, three,
four, five, six.

00:23:10.104 --> 00:23:11.020
Is anyone buying this?

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.720
Maybe not.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.370
I showed you six cards
with your signature on it.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.930
But here's the strange thing.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.510
There's only one card
that's been in this box

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.600
the entire time.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.940
And if you look in here, you
get one card out of there.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.392
That's a six of clubs.

00:23:24.392 --> 00:23:25.600
That's for you to hold on to.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.170
Thank you very much.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:26.410
All right.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:26.909
Now--

00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:28.924
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:28.924 --> 00:23:30.849
Let's make it a
little more difficult

00:23:30.849 --> 00:23:32.390
by having a number
of cards selected.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.540
And I'll show you I can
track multiple cards.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.400
And this is called a
multiple selection routine,

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.290
which was first
done by Professor

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:42.800
Hoffman in the 19th century.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.640
He's one of the great
card manipulators.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.447
So let's do this.

00:23:46.447 --> 00:23:48.530
I'm going to have a number
of people choose cards.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.810
Would you just take one out?

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.810
And you may share it with
the people around you.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.400
You may hold it up, so
more than one person--

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.483
would you take one for me?

00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:56.236
Yeah, great.

00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:58.229
That way, everyone's
invested in this trick.

00:23:58.229 --> 00:23:59.270
Take a look. take a look.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.161
Would you take a
card for me, please?

00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:01.660
Yeah.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.250
I want you to take a
card and hold it up

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.900
so all the people behind you
can-- you would like one?

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.860
AUDIENCE: I would.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.568
DAVID KWONG: Yes.

00:24:06.568 --> 00:24:07.517
OK.

00:24:07.517 --> 00:24:08.350
I will give you one.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.710
Oh!

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.860
I though you were
going for the top card.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.787
I thought you were gonna
compete with Matthew.

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:15.370
You've got it?

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:15.950
You're happy with that one?

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.480
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.270
DAVID KWONG: OK, cool.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.190
Would you take one for me?

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.815
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:18.815 --> 00:24:20.360
DAVID KWONG: Yeah right.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.551
AUDIENCE: That one.

00:24:21.551 --> 00:24:22.925
DAVID KWONG: Great,
great, great.

00:24:22.925 --> 00:24:23.674
Will you take one?

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.470
All right.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.969
Cool.

00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:30.550
Wanna take a card?

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.050
Excellent.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.080
Share it with the
people around you.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.585
So a number of cards selected.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.160
Good?

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.660
OK.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.960
I'm gonna take them
back one at the time.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.460
Thank you.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:40.760
Thank you.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.240
Take a look.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.115
Everyone take a look.

00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:43.790
Remember your card.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.051
Good.

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:46.551
Good.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.541
All right.

00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.040
Excellent.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.480
Now I'm gonna make it a
little more difficult.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.690
I'm mixing these up.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.096
And then I will complicate
them even further

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.470
by shuffling in
some other cards.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.610
Now if you chose a card, you
have one job and one job only.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.880
And that is to
remember your card.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.510
Are we good?

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.510
These guys are whispering
already because they--

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.740
did forget it already?

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.701
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:14.200
All right.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.500
I'm going to take this mix of
cards that I first shuffled up.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.570
And then I shuffled in
some other cards as well.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.490
And I'm going to very
cleanly, very fairly

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.990
toss them into the pack.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.450
And you can see, I'm not
marking where they're going.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.241
I'm not crimping the
corners that gamblers do.

00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:31.240
I'm putting some at the
top, some in the middle,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.031
some of the bottom.

00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:36.340
I'm no taking a pencil and
marking a dot on the corner.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:42.310
This is truly, as magicians
call it, "a mess" of cards.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.660
And let me square this up.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.400
And I'll stay honest with a good
old-fashioned American riffle

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.530
shuffle here, just like this.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.070
OK.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.570
So here's how this
is going to work.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.760
I'll ask you what
card that you chose.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.290
And tell me what it is.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.405
I'll try to locate it
in the pack of cards.

00:25:59.405 --> 00:26:00.740
Does that sound fair?

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.360
So I'm gonna start with you.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.050
I'll try to do it in order.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.091
What card did you choose?

00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:04.439
AUDIENCE: Five of diamonds.

00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:05.147
DAVID KWONG: The?

00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:06.272
AUDIENCE: Five of diamonds.

00:26:06.272 --> 00:26:07.688
DAVID KWONG: The
five of diamonds.

00:26:07.688 --> 00:26:08.230
Cool.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.600
Five of diamonds should
be about halfway down.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.700
I can cut-- this is
kind of a table cut--

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.259
one card on the middle should
be the five of diamonds.

00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:18.300
This is five of diamonds?

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:18.800
Yeah?

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.470
Cool All right.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.660
So far, so good.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.070
Who else did I give a card to?

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.620
Did I give you one?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:23.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.480
DAVID KWONG: What did you have?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.500
AUDIENCE: Six of hearts.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.070
DAVID KWONG: Six of hearts.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.820
OK.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.140
I'll find the six hearts
using a few swivel cuts.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.490
The swivel cut was made
famous by Nate Leipzig.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.586
Nate Leipzig was known
for his swivel cuts.

00:26:36.586 --> 00:26:38.210
And I'll swivel right
out of the middle

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.190
and get one card there,
which is the six of hearts.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:42.140
So that's good.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.050
So far, so good.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.000
Who else did I give a card to?

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.510
What did you have?

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.980
AUDIENCE: I had the
jack of diamonds.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.540
DAVID KWONG: Jack of diamonds.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.357
OK.

00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:49.190
Well, I'm going to take
the five of diamonds

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.970
and the six of hearts.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.678
And together, they're
going to go looking

00:26:51.678 --> 00:26:54.060
for the jack of diamonds.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.640
So let's see what they find.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.980
The six and the five
should get one card

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.810
right there in between them.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.880
And that should be
the jack of diamonds.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.470
And it is the jack of diamonds,
which is good news for me.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.459
And what did you have?

00:27:05.459 --> 00:27:06.500
AUDIENCE: Jack of hearts.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.666
DAVID KWONG: Jack of hearts.

00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:08.570
And did you have one?

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.390
Did you have one?

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.230
AUDIENCE: I had
the king of hearts.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.950
DAVID KWONG: Jack of
hearts, king of hearts.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:12.449
OK.

00:27:12.449 --> 00:27:14.085
That's a good pair
to get together.

00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:16.670
We'll find the jack of hearts
and the king of hearts--

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.030
two cards at once.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.960
Now this is something
that was invented

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.877
by Johan Nepomuk Hofzinser, who
is a great Viennese magician.

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:26.960
Yes, that's his real name.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.360
He's the father of
modern card magic.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.510
Johan Nepomuk Hofzinser, 19th
century Viennese magician.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.620
And he would find two cards
at once using a Hofzinser cut,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.582
which looks a little like that.

00:27:38.582 --> 00:27:39.790
So those are your two cards--

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.900
the jack of hearts and
the king of hearts.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.190
All right.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.140
Everyone chose red cards today.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.969
But you didn't.

00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:49.760
I can see on your--

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.740
AUDIENCE: Eight of spades.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.700
DAVID KWONG: Eight of spades?

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:52.325 --> 00:27:53.545
DAVID KWONG: Eight of spades.

00:27:53.545 --> 00:27:54.420
How many other cards?

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.211
Do you have a card?

00:27:55.211 --> 00:27:55.740
One more?

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.240
One more?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.740
OK.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.019
Eight of spades.

00:27:58.019 --> 00:27:58.685
Eight of spades.

00:27:58.685 --> 00:27:59.960
Let's see if I get that.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.940
Gosh.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.930
Where is that?

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.320
I lost it.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.270
Sometimes, I can get
one card to just pop up

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.917
like this off the
top of the pack.

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:11.000
That's the nine of hearts.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.600
That's not it.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.100
Sorry.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.980
It's not my day.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.480
OK.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.640
Eight of spades.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.720
Wait, hold on.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.120
Oh, that is the eight of spades.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.620
All right.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:17.890
Yeah.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:18.440
Yeah.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.940
That's good.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.110
Oh, now he's getting good.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.630
All right.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:26.365 --> 00:28:27.490
OK, what did you have, sir?

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.540
AUDIENCE: Nine of clubs.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.665
DAVID KWONG: Nine of clubs.

00:28:29.665 --> 00:28:31.570
The nine of clubs.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.810
In the early 1900s,
Dr. Elliot of Boston

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.242
came up with something
called a back palm of a card.

00:28:37.242 --> 00:28:39.450
I'm gonna show you what a
back palm is, Dr. Elliott's

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.840
back palm.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.570
So I'm going to take
the ace of clubs.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.440
And I will demonstrate
a back palm.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.190
I'll do it over here
so everybody can see.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.440
It looks a little like this.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.720
I take that ace of clubs.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.230
And I just wave my hand until
the card vanishes and then

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.140
reappears as the nine of clubs.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.720
So that was good.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.190
And then for the last card.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.940
What did you have?

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.750
AUDIENCE: Five of clubs.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.390
DAVID KWONG: Five of clubs.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:06.940
So the last card,
the five of clubs.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.820
Something a little more
acrobatic with the cards here.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:14.100
I will attempt to do a
one-handed swivel cut,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.690
get one card to fly out
of the middle of the deck,

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.820
rotate through the air
about 10 and 1/2 times.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.653
I'm going to catch it
here in my right hand.

00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:23.230
So here we go for
the five of clubs,

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:28.550
the top pivots to the bottom,
one card out of the middle.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.080
And just like that, that
should be in the five of clubs.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:33.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.413
Thank you very much.

00:29:34.413 --> 00:29:36.270
All right.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.570
Thank you.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.800
So let's see.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.740
I need to introduce
another element here.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:48.960
This is a kiwi that I
brought up from Los Angeles.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.110
Can I give this to
you to just inspect?

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.760
Inspect the furry fruit.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.730
No, don't eat it.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:55.890
Don't break it.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.960
That's a magical piece of fruit.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.220
That needs to stay intact.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.940
The other thing I'll need
is a single dollar bill

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.070
from someone.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.750
Can people fish out their--

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.090
give the magician your money.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.006
Do people have their--

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:10.680
you have dollar bills
[INAUDIBLE] to people?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.290
Who's got one?

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:11.880
AUDIENCE: Right here.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.400
DAVID KWONG: You've got one?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:12.900
OK.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.680
Thank you.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.990
OK.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.310
No, I'm gonna look at three.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.170
Thank you.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:19.980
All right.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.250
Look how much money I got.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.345
OK.

00:30:26.345 --> 00:30:26.845
OK.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.851
Yeah.

00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:31.350
OK.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.120
I'm going to give
this back to you, sir.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.017
What is your name?

00:30:34.017 --> 00:30:34.685
AUDIENCE: Alex.

00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:35.435
DAVID KWONG: Alex?

00:30:35.435 --> 00:30:36.167
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.000
DAVID KWONG: Would you
write your name right

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.540
over George Washington, please?

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.790
Now this is a federal offense.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.160
But we're going to
keep this to face them.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.327
I'm gonna give this back to you.

00:30:45.327 --> 00:30:46.910
And then flip it
over to the backside.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.350
Just flip it over.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.170
And draw your favorite
marsupial on the back

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.050
of that bill for me, please.

00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:57.290
Just quick.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.540
You know, real quick.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.275
Oh, a kangaroo.

00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:05.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.360
DAVID KWONG: Is it the best?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.640
All right.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.680
AUDIENCE: Oh, that's good.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.138
DAVID KWONG: Let's
see how you did.

00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:10.110
Let's see how you did.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.943
Ooh.

00:31:10.943 --> 00:31:14.650
Oh, there's a little
baby inside him!

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.430
That's funny.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.210
OK.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.480
So this is Alex's
favorite marsupial.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.020
OK, great.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.790
And we have an
Alex on the front.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.080
OK.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.250
I do this in every show.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.890
This is actually the
first trick I ever learned

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.000
when I was a little kid.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.640
So I do it in every
talk and every show.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.000
And it involves folding
the bill down a few times.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.760
And I would practice this
in front of the mirror

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.221
when I was a 7-year-old kid,
trying not to flash anything.

00:31:40.221 --> 00:31:41.470
And that's not what you think.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.800
Flashing is when you
expose part of the trick.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.160
So you have to check your
angles in front of the mirrors.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.600
And if I've done
this right, Alex,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.600
your bill starts to look
a little bit different.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.230
You can see it's
now a different hue.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.930
In fact, the entire
denomination is--

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.630
you have 100 Russian rubles.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.140
There we go.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.330
Yeah.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.610
You probably lost about 20--

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:05.110
no, no.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.400
You made $0.25 on
that transaction.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:07.900
OK.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:15.430
I'm going to try another thing
with a pack of playing cards

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.780
here.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.430
Who can I pick on?

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.650
You guys are such a
democratic company.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.940
Maybe you should all vote.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.290
Submit your votes to--

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:23.980
OK.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.896
I just looked at him--

00:32:24.896 --> 00:32:25.674
Thomas.

00:32:25.674 --> 00:32:26.590
I'm not a mind reader.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.590
I can see your name tag.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.330
Thomas, why don't
you join me on stage?

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.663
Everyone give Thomas a round
of applause for helping me.

00:32:34.663 --> 00:32:36.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.550
All right.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.120
OK.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.870
OK.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:44.245
So Thomas, Come forward here
so everybody can see you.

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:45.620
You saw the playing
cards before.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.054
I just want you to know
they're all different.

00:32:48.054 --> 00:32:49.470
You have such a
grin on your face.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.489
I love it.

00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:51.530
Choose any card you like.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.465
Take out a card.

00:32:52.465 --> 00:32:53.340
That one or that one?

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:53.640
That one.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:53.800
OK.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.633
Show everybody else.

00:32:54.633 --> 00:32:57.400
Don't show it to me.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.190
All right.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.690
Good.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.815
Keep it against your chest.

00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:02.450
So I can't see what it is.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.670
And I'm going to spread
these cards out here.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.892
And I want you to have
absolutely free choice,

00:33:06.892 --> 00:33:08.600
except maybe not on
the top or the bottom

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.430
because that's too easy for me.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.370
Go ahead and insert
that card anywhere else

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.340
you like in the deck.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:14.840
OK.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.560
Good?

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.304
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:19.304 --> 00:33:19.970
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.760
And then square up the
cards nice and slow.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.021
Square up the cards so I can't
see exactly where you put it.

00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:27.520
Cool?

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.100
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.766
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:33:34.714 --> 00:33:36.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.930
So where do you think it is?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.595
Where do you think it is?

00:33:40.595 --> 00:33:42.069
Where do you think it is?

00:33:42.069 --> 00:33:43.110
Where do you think it is?

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.480
Do you know the card is?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.760
Voldemort?

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.266
Hi.

00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:48.890
Do you want to?

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:49.390
OK.

00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:54.110
I was all ready to do
something with that dog.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:55.790
OK.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:58.790
So here we are.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.540
Voldemort the dog
interrupts a magic show.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.165
That's amazing.

00:34:01.165 --> 00:34:04.217
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.634
He who shall not be named.

00:34:07.634 --> 00:34:09.050
So you can't really
call your dog.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.060
OK.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.560
All right.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.000
Thomas, you picked
a playing card.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.530
You put it back
anywhere you wanted.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.550
I'm going to snap my fingers.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.110
And just like this, I'm
going to get it to come up

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.920
to the top like that.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.545
And I can tell by
your lack of reaction

00:34:23.545 --> 00:34:24.709
that that is not your card.

00:34:24.709 --> 00:34:25.510
That is not your card.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.010
OK.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.540
So what I'm going to do instead
is eliminate this card entirely

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:38.659
from the equation by tearing
it into quarters like this.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.620
OK.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.380
And give me your
hand, if you would.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.130
I'm going to give you--
kinda make a fist.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:43.610
Turn it over.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:44.568
Hold it just like that.

00:34:44.568 --> 00:34:47.270
Now tell me for the first
time, what was the actual card

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.194
that you chose?

00:34:48.194 --> 00:34:49.610
Not the jack, but
the actual card.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.764
AUDIENCE: Two of hearts.

00:34:50.764 --> 00:34:51.889
DAVID KWONG: Two of hearts.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.659
And did you put it in
the top, middle, bottom?

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:54.610
Do you remember about?

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.620
AUDIENCE: The top-ish.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.570
DAVID KWONG: Top-ish.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.120
Top-ish.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.210
So it's sort of up here.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.900
OK.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.483
Yeah, all right,
hasn't gone anywhere.

00:35:01.483 --> 00:35:04.100
So what I'm going to try to
do is get the two of hearts

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.450
and the jack of diamonds
to change places

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.160
without you opening your hand.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.941
Is that cool?

00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:12.440
All right.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.350
So let's try this.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.490
OK.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.640
Keep it nice and tight.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.350
Go down a little bit.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.264
Perfect.

00:35:20.264 --> 00:35:21.680
I'm gonna take
that two of hearts.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.270
And I'm going to touch
the back of your hand.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.550
I'm going to come underneath,
and they should just

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.740
change places like that.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.070
Because now I have
the jack of diamonds.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.670
So if I have the
jack of diamonds,

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.100
what do you have in
your hand there, Thomas?

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.945
Take a look.

00:35:34.945 --> 00:35:35.820
Hold up those pieces.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.787
Show everybody what you got.

00:35:37.787 --> 00:35:38.870
Is that the two of hearts?

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:39.890
Is that the two of hearts?

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:40.973
That is the two of hearts.

00:35:40.973 --> 00:35:44.330
Everyone give Thomas a round
of applause for helping me.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.110
Thank you.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.266
Oh, whoa, whoa.

00:35:46.266 --> 00:35:47.340
Don't go anywhere yet.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.590
Give me your hand.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:49.310
Make a fist.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.150
Turn it over.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.430
We're going to rewind the
clock about 30 seconds.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.490
We're going to go back in time.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:56.820
So you feel the pieces, right?

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.920
Let everybody know
they're in there.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.420
Good.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.810
OK.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:05.004
And you go back in time
and give it a good squeeze.

00:36:05.004 --> 00:36:07.170
And if you've truly gone
back in time, what have you

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.378
done to those pieces, Thomas?

00:36:08.378 --> 00:36:09.390
Open your hand.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.470
You have reconstituted the card.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.398
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.398 --> 00:36:17.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:21.664 --> 00:36:23.870
Did I pick the right
guy or what for this?

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.560
All right, now everyone give
Thomas a big round of applause.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.393
Thank you very much.

00:36:28.393 --> 00:36:31.081
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.296
Who's is holding
the magic fruit?

00:36:35.296 --> 00:36:36.420
AUDIENCE: That would be me.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.800
DAVID KWONG: You still got it?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.850
What is your name?

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.210
AUDIENCE: Monet.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:40.001
DAVID KWONG: Monet?

00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:40.784
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:40.784 --> 00:36:42.450
DAVID KWONG: Would
you help me on stage?

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.050
Is that OK?

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.197
You're not like deathly
afraid of anything are you?

00:36:45.197 --> 00:36:47.280
All right, everyone give
Monet a round of applause

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.120
for helping me on stage.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.510
I have a knife here.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.080
Inspect that.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.820
Make sure there's
nothing weird about it.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.350
No.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.060
Please, take your time.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.010
Make sure there's no
flaps or hinges or--

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.890
OK.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.460
We're good.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.090
We're good, right?

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:03.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.966
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:37:03.966 --> 00:37:06.671
I'm going to slice
into this fruit.

00:37:06.671 --> 00:37:08.270
Oh, it sprays.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:12.140
And you're gonna do
the difficult part.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.275
You're gonna break off
the top of that fruit.

00:37:14.275 --> 00:37:16.400
What do you see buried in
the middle of that fruit?

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.066
What do you see?

00:37:19.684 --> 00:37:20.350
AUDIENCE: Money.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:20.770
DAVID KWONG: Yeah.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:21.080
Take that.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.580
Pull it out.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.590
Pull it out.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.090
OK.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.380
Let's see if there is a little--

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:28.880
go ahead.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.140
Open it.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.640
Yeah.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.180
Open it.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.610
I'm hoping there's a
marsupial with a little baby

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.210
inside of it.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.609
Yeah.

00:37:36.609 --> 00:37:37.650
Is that your dollar bill?

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.910
Thank you for your health.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.160
I'm going to give that to you.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:48.300
I'm going to trade you
for my Russian rubles.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.770
All right so I'm going to talk
a little bit about Scrabble.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.260
Do people like Scrabble?

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.965
Are there Scrabble
fans in the house?

00:37:56.965 --> 00:37:58.590
Is this the white
board that I can use?

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.457
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:38:01.457 --> 00:38:02.040
This is great.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.760
It's good to go.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.720
And I think there's
a marker here.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.490
And then with what do I
erase this Scrabble board?

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.240
I'll turn it over.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.330
So you we have to Scrabble
fans in the house, people

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.080
who play Scrabble?

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.910
Yeah.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.770
Words With Friends,
Bananagrams, got any grammers

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.890
in the house-- grammers?

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.420
I play a lot of Scrabble.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.320
It's actually been an exciting
18 months for Scrabble.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.470
Because all these new words have
come out into the dictionary.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.470
You can now play selfie.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.110
Selfie is allowed in
the game is Scrabble,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:49.070
as is hashtag is good.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:51.580
Frenemy is now allowed
in the game of Scrabble.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.250
I'm going to give you
a definition of a word.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.920
Tell me what the word is.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.760
Because it's funny.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:09.600
It's a close, non-sexual
relationship between two men.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.500
AUDIENCE: Bromance.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.960
DAVID KWONG: Bromance is
now allowed in Scrabble.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.330
You can also play--

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.420
you know the kayak, like
the boat, the kayak?

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:25.241
You can now spell
that Q-A-J-A-Q.

00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:26.490
I know it's ridiculous, right?

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.620
Like who would ever use a
blank on their second Q?

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.100
Like who would ever do that?

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.360
But I want to talk to you.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.180
I'm gonna give you a little
bit of a Scrabble hack.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.960
There's a way that you
can score a lot of points.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.580
And that's called bingo-ing.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.285
Who knows what a bingo is?

00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:44.160
What is a bingo, sir?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.180
AUDIENCE: Using
all your letters.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.888
DAVID KWONG: Yes.

00:39:45.888 --> 00:39:47.700
When you use all
seven of your letters,

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.810
you get a 50 point bonus.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.810
And the professional
Scrabble players-- and yes,

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:52.920
they do exist--

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.770
they bingo like four
or five times a game.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.350
Now, I'm going to teach
you how to hack this.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:03.390
If you get the Z or the X or
the Q, these high point value

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.640
letters, you actually
want to get rid of them

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:11.067
right away with short X, Q,
Z words, like Q-I and Z-A,

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:11.900
which is ridiculous.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.300
Pizza, and now changed the
game the Scrabble forever.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.800
But anyway, you
get rid of those.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.540
So you end up with
the best letters

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.920
that you can anagram with.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.330
And those are T, I, S, A, N, E--

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.200
TISANE.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:25.957
OK.

00:40:25.957 --> 00:40:28.290
Those are the best six letters
you can get and Scrabble.

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:32.760
Because you can add almost
any seventh letter to this,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.710
rearrange them, and bingo.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.380
It does not work with a Q.
It does not work with a Y.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.719
But it works for the
other 24 letters.

00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:41.010
I'm gonna show you what I mean.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.551
Can I have a letter
from you, please?

00:40:42.551 --> 00:40:43.470
AUDIENCE: L.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.510
DAVID KWONG: So L
plus T, I, S, A, N, E,

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:52.770
you can spell elastin,
which I think is a protein.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.110
But you don't have to know
in Scrabble what it means.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:00.000
[LAUGHTER] You just have
to know that it is a word.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.380
Elastin.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.412
Can I have a letter
from you, please?

00:41:03.412 --> 00:41:04.560
AUDIENCE: T.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.850
DAVID KWONG: T you can spell--

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.010
I'm blanking all of a sudden.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.950
I think you can spell satinet.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.150
Yeah, that will get
your 50 point bonus.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:19.680
Can I have a letter
from you, please?

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.505
AUDIENCE: R.

00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:22.170
DAVID KWONG: R is
the best the letter

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.140
you can get because you don't
just have the TISANE list.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.990
But you create the
SATIRE list as well.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:38.830
So you can spell stainer and
retains and retinas and antsier

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.740
and get your 50 point bonus.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.680
So that's kind of how
you hack the bingo lists.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.620
These are called bingo lists.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.750
I'm going to try one
other thing for you all.

00:41:53.169 --> 00:41:54.380
Let's try this.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:58.880
OK.

00:42:02.397 --> 00:42:02.896
Raceways.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.620
Sabbaths.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.225
And sickbays.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.090
Now, I'm going to put in the
values for these letters.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.900
These values never change.

00:42:26.641 --> 00:42:27.680
Let's do this.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.380
Let's go 1, 1, 3,
1, 4, 1, 4, and 1.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.710
And 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, and 1.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:39.019
And 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4, and 1.

00:42:39.019 --> 00:42:40.060
I play a lot of Scrabble.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.560
OK.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:45.340
I'm going to add these three
eight-letter words, which I've

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.280
basically now converted to
three eight-digit numbers

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.280
into a new eight-digit number.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.130
So 1 plus 1 plus 1 is--

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.500
let's this nice and pretty.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.790
1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:58.990
And 1 plus 1 plus 1 is 3.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.650
Now, before I began this,
there were some puzzle pieces,

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.090
as I like to call them, in play.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.590
There was a kiwi,
which Monet, you

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.319
managed to find
what inside of it?

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:11.110
AUDIENCE: A dollar.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.943
DAVID KWONG: A dollar,
which came from Alex.

00:43:12.943 --> 00:43:15.470
And Alex, you have your
dollar there drying off.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.910
So take a look at the
side that you signed,

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.460
the George Washington side.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.460
And you'll notice in the
lower left hand corner,

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.510
there's an eight-digit
serial number.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.760
Does it start with a 3, 3?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.430
AUDIENCE: It sure does.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.513
DAVID KWONG: It sure does.

00:43:28.513 --> 00:43:29.805
What's to the right of the 3?

00:43:29.805 --> 00:43:30.430
AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:31.846
DAVID KWONG: Should
be a 9, right?

00:43:31.846 --> 00:43:32.819
3 plus 3 plus 3 is 9.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:34.360
What do we have to
the right of that?

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:34.690
AUDIENCE: 9.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.540
DAVID KWONG: Should
be another one, right?

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.415
1 plus 3 plus 5 is 9.

00:43:36.415 --> 00:43:37.956
What do we have to
the right of that?

00:43:37.956 --> 00:43:38.540
AUDIENCE: 8.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.623
DAVID KWONG: We have an 8.

00:43:39.623 --> 00:43:40.959
4 plus 1 plus 3 is 8.

00:43:40.959 --> 00:43:42.250
And what do we have after that?

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:42.550
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.675
DAVID KWONG: Should be a 4.

00:43:43.675 --> 00:43:45.790
Because here's where it
gets interesting, folks.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.090
4 plus 4 plus 4 is 12--

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.310
carry the 1, mind you.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.880
You get a 4.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.310
4 plus 2.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.640
And then we should
have a 3 at the end.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.506
And 33998423.

00:43:56.506 --> 00:43:57.880
Does that match
your dollar bill?

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.796
You're damn right it
matches your dollar bill.

00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:02.332
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.960
Any questions?

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.950
Now I will take questions.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.320
Five minutes?

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:13.820
OK.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.910
Five minutes for questions
more about the book

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.410
and less about this would be--

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.252
I'm going to give
you the microphone.

00:44:23.252 --> 00:44:25.610
AUDIENCE: So did you
have any formal training?

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.870
Or did you make all this up?

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.770
DAVID KWONG: Did I have
any formal training?

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.269
No.

00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:31.520
I started as a
seven-year-old kid.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.810
I started with magic sets.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.532
I started reading books.

00:44:34.532 --> 00:44:35.990
I learned from
books, which I think

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.080
is the best way to learn
magic because you can watch

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.540
everything now on YouTube.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.334
And you end up mimicking the
performer and his style when

00:44:45.334 --> 00:44:46.250
you watch it on video.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.810
But when you have
books and you're

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:48.980
trying to figure out
how to hold your hand,

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.010
you end up learning
it better that way.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.950
But the truth of
my career arc is

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:59.630
that I did not think it was a
profession until six years ago.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.370
So I've been doing
it my whole life.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.694
But I had a normal desk job.

00:45:03.694 --> 00:45:04.860
It was working in Hollywood.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.550
I was at DreamWorks Animation.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:11.300
And then all of a sudden,
it just kind of took off.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.181
The movie, "Now You
See Me" came along.

00:45:13.181 --> 00:45:14.930
They needed somebody
who understood movies

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.640
and understood magic.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.560
And I also figured
out at the same time--

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.060
the light bulb
turned on-- oh, I can

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.540
take my two passions,
puzzles and magic,

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.540
and cross-pollinate them
and make something new.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:32.007
And I really am a big
proponent of cross-pollination.

00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:33.590
You take something
you're an expert in

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.150
and you add it to
something else.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:39.431
And you produce a new product.

00:45:39.431 --> 00:45:39.930
Yes.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.120
Do we need to pass
the microphone over?

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.760
AUDIENCE: So who went back
and dug up all the cards

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.670
that he didn't choose
from the backyard trick?

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.570
DAVID KWONG: Great question.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:55.680
I have told you
2/3 of the trick.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:04.970
And at the end of chapter three,
you find out yet another twist.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:09.920
And the fun thing for me is
that my friend, Edgar Wright,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.320
will be finding out
for the first time

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.450
next week when he gets
his hands on the book.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.470
Yes, hi.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.800
AUDIENCE: So what
is the best book

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.960
you would suggest
for a child trying

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.780
to get into magic tricks?

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.470
DAVID KWONG: I started with
"The Klutz Book of Magic."

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.490
I hope they're still making it.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.380
It comes with a ring and a
little handkerchief and a--

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.570
I don't want to say--

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.640
it comes with a fake
body part that you

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.470
can attach to yourself.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.310
That's all I'll say.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.350
But that's a great
book to start with.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:51.364
Also Bill Tarr's,
"Now You See It,

00:46:51.364 --> 00:46:53.030
Now You Don't," is a
great starter book.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:57.050
And then Mark Wilson's,
"Complete Course in Magic,"

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.190
has everything in it.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:01.490
So yeah.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.070
Usually six or seven
years old is a good time

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.690
to start with that stuff.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.300
You can buy some self-working
tricks in a magic shop.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.410
That's also a great
way to get started is

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.330
you buy the self-working
stuff that doesn't

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.730
take sleight of hand ability.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.630
And that way your child gets
comfortable lying to people.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.509
Yeah.

00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:24.050
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.466
So how does writing
a book compare

00:47:25.466 --> 00:47:27.290
to writing a crossword puzzle?

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.000
DAVID KWONG: Oh.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.170
Writing a book was torture.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:34.520
That's how it compares.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.890
But I made it through.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.580
It was a year of
very, very hard work.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.050
A crossword puzzle,
for me, is different

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.540
because there's a couple
of things going on.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.830
When I come up with
a crossword theme,

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.530
I'm trying to figure out
how to fool you first.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.710
That's why I think there's
an intersection of magic

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:57.340
and puzzles.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.160
Because a good puzzle
will misdirect the solver

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.500
for a little bit of
what's going on and then

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.910
allowing them to
finally figure it out.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.830
But what I do think puzzles and
writing a book and magic tricks

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.950
all have in common
is it's storytelling.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:16.330
And a good puzzle takes
you through that arc where

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.450
you introduce the
material, and then there

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:23.980
are twists and turns, and then
there's that climactic "aha"

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.270
moment.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.070
And what is the "aha"
moment in a puzzle?

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:30.910
The "aha" moment is when you
figure out what is going on.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.820
And the great guru of
puzzles, Will Schwartz,

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.030
says that in that
"aha" moment, there

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.790
is a simultaneous
thing that happens.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.400
You feel smart for
having solved it.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.430
And you also respect
the constructor

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.150
for having come up with it.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.880
So that is what
happens in that moment.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.790
And yeah, I enjoyed
the process very

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.290
much of building a magic trick,
of having a arc to the book.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.750
AUDIENCE: So who is your
favorite magician of all time?

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:05.704
And also who is--

00:49:05.704 --> 00:49:07.870
DAVID KWONG: My least
favorite magician of all time.

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.078
AUDIENCE: Least favorite
magician, favorite magician,

00:49:10.078 --> 00:49:12.620
and the coolest person
you've ever performed for,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.120
or the coolest group.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.380
DAVID KWONG: OK.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.410
My favorite magicians
have been going

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.790
strong for decades and decades.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.850
And Penn and Teller are
my favorite magicians.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:29.210
I think there's a similar
sensibility in conveying

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.130
that we don't have superpowers.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.870
And I just love how
irreverent they are.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:33.830
And they're so clever.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:37.370
And they find twists and turns
to put on every magic trick.

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.220
The coolest person
I've done magic for--

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.810
well, it was a small party
in Hollywood for Kathleen

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.610
Kennedy's birthday.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:52.330
And she's now runs Lucasfilm
and produces all the Star Wars

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:52.830
movies.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.730
So there were maybe 15 chairs.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:59.240
And it was Kathy and Steven
Spielberg and J.J. Abrams.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.934
And to fool other magicians
is a great, great honor.

00:50:04.934 --> 00:50:06.725
AUDIENCE: And your
least favorite magician?

00:50:06.725 --> 00:50:09.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:11.965 --> 00:50:13.590
DAVID KWONG: We'll
talk after the show.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:14.997
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:14.997 --> 00:50:15.580
You know what?

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.290
I actually am going
to go with that

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:22.180
and say that magic is a
difficult, difficult trade

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:27.220
because of one
fundamental reason.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.430
There are no intellectual
property laws

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:33.020
that can protect a magic trick.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.440
So like a joke in
comedy, or a dance move,

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:43.150
or a director's shot in
film, these are expressions.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.990
So every magician,
like comedians,

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:49.820
we're kind of all frenemies,
if not straight up enemies.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.427
And that's because people,
especially the old guard

00:50:52.427 --> 00:50:55.010
versus the younger guard, feel
like they're being stolen from.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.390
And there are-- as I've
broken it down in this book.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.090
And another approach is
to break down magic tricks

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:08.510
into the finite number of
illusions that have been made.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.210
We dress them up in new ways.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:15.170
And the magic tricks evolve
because we put new costumes

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.550
and dressing on them.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.950
So a lot of the old
guard feel stolen from.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.770
A lot of your peers
feel stolen from.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.045
And that's why it's a
very tough, small field.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.490
Teller, actually,
of Penn and Teller

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:35.870
managed to make a great
gain a couple of years

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.300
ago in a lawsuit
against somebody that

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.719
had copied his trick
and was marketing it,

00:51:42.719 --> 00:51:43.760
was selling it for money.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.240
And he ended up
winning that case.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.690
AUDIENCE: So I assumed,
since things break down

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.630
into small pieces, when
you watch other magicians,

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.130
you probably know what's
going on most of the time.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:57.219
Have you ever been fooled?

00:51:57.219 --> 00:51:58.760
DAVID KWONG: I have
been fooled, yes.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.761
I do speak the language.

00:51:59.761 --> 00:52:01.468
And for the most part,
I can watch a show

00:52:01.468 --> 00:52:02.910
and know exactly
what's happening.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.510
And I appreciate it
for its execution.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.217
I can be fooled by
very good misdirection.

00:52:08.217 --> 00:52:09.800
I'm a human being
like everybody else.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.870
If somebody has a very
powerful misdirection,

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.579
I'll look where I'm
not supposed to look.

00:52:15.579 --> 00:52:18.078
But then I'll immediately be
like, oh, I know what happened.

00:52:18.078 --> 00:52:19.460
And I can piece
it back together.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:20.960
And then there are
other times where

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.110
there's a brand new
technical innovation

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.751
or a new move that will
completely fool me.

00:52:26.751 --> 00:52:28.250
And I'll call my
friends immediately

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.810
and be like, please, please,
tell me what happened.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.370
Please tell me what happened.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.354
And they may they
make me wait 24 hours.

00:52:33.354 --> 00:52:34.520
We call it the 24-hour rule.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.561
And then they'll tell me.

00:52:35.561 --> 00:52:39.170
But we have a term for when you
get fooled by another magician.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:40.960
And that's called
getting burned.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.660
You get burned.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.350
And that's because we
feel it right here.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.530
AUDIENCE: Does it detract
from your enjoyment

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.552
of watching magic shows that
you do see right through them?

00:52:51.552 --> 00:52:53.510
DAVID KWONG: You probably
can make the argument

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:55.871
that I don't have
the same enjoyment

00:52:55.871 --> 00:52:56.870
that everybody else has.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.020
But I watch it now
for different reason--

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.297
for execution and inspiration.

00:53:03.297 --> 00:53:04.880
AUDIENCE: How do you
think the book is

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.090
going to affect your
relationships with your friends

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.120
and coworkers now
that you're exposing

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.030
how you would manipulate
them into agreeing with you?

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.780
DAVID KWONG: Haha.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.279
I see.

00:53:15.279 --> 00:53:15.840
I see.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.290
I thought you were
going to ask me

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:19.373
how the magic community
is going to react to that,

00:53:19.373 --> 00:53:21.770
which we can also discuss.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.360
No, I think I'm going to be OK.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.360
I think that these
principles, you

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.050
can put them to use
in the right way.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.920
And usually, they
are in situations

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.130
that you're really in control
of and that you've planned for.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:42.650
And this is not a handbook
on how to walk into a bar

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.090
and be able to pick up anybody.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.030
So there was a book
called "The Game"

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.660
that came out that
was like that.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.734
And I really wanted this to be
different, completely different

00:53:51.734 --> 00:53:52.900
spirit that I wrote this in.

00:53:55.734 --> 00:53:57.150
AUDIENCE: Do you
have ideas on how

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.024
the things you talked
about at the beginning,

00:53:59.024 --> 00:54:02.580
like the illusion of choice
and how people pick a side

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.970
and they stick to it, can
be applied to politics

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.000
and the current
political environment

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.330
and what you would do about it?

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:13.190
Like if you were superhero
using your magician powers, what

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:15.650
are you going to do?

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.530
DAVID KWONG: Well, I
think you're right.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.370
It's very hard to sway people
when they stick to their ideas.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.740
And I don't want to
get too political.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.730
But I think we can
probably all agree

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:33.440
that there is a master of
misdirection in the White House

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:33.940
right now.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:42.140
Tommy Wonder, the
great Dutch magician,

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:47.030
said that misdirection is
giving people something

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:49.190
of greater interest to look at.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:52.380
So like bad misdirection
would be you're doing a show

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.750
and then somebody drops a tray
full of metal pots and pans,

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.200
and everyone's like [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.530
But good misdirection is
something of greater interest

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.960
that they can pay attention to.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.939
If I were to make a
bird appear, you're

00:55:04.939 --> 00:55:07.230
all going to-- that's like
the end of the trick, right?

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:08.813
I've showed you an
empty handkerchief.

00:55:08.813 --> 00:55:10.040
I make a bird appear.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.510
You're not going to want to
ignore that because it's cool.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:13.760
And it's the end of the trick.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.370
But in that moment, I'm already
reaching for my next thing

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:17.840
and setting up my next trick.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.100
And I think that he
who shall not be named

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:27.410
is a master at giving
us something else that

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:31.280
takes our attention that
we're interested in.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:34.880
Thank you.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.930
[APPLAUSE]
