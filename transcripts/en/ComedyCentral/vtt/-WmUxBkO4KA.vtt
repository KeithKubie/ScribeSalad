00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.670
I don't understand hunting.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.938
To me, I love animals so much

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.807
that the thought of
 shooting an animal,

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.509
I mean, it's a poor
 little innocent animal

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.578
just standing around thinking
 little deer thoughts, little,

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.779
"I wonder where
  the berries are?"

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.981
"What's this on my hoof?"

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.015
Whatever they're
 thinking, you know?

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.851
(audience laughs)

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.788
Always put their last expression

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.392
before being killed
 on their wall.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.827
This guy is proud of it.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.095
(laughs)

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:29.997
Shot it! (laughs)

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.498
Killed it!

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.767
No, wasn't doing anything to
 me, just standing there, why?

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:34.868
What's your point?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.137
(audience laughs)

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.306
I could see if it was
  something that you hated.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.075
Something that you're really
 proud that you killed,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.510
like a hunter, actually,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.379
now that I think about...
  (audience laughs)

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.149
I mean...
 (audience applauds)

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.186
(laughs)

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.021
Shot him.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.424
(audience laughs)

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.659
I don't know, I ask people why

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.927
they have deer heads
 on their walls,

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:02.663
they say because it's
such a beautiful animal.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.931
There you go.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.032
I think my mother's attractive,

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.533
but I have photographs of her.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.369
(audience laughs)

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.339
Wasn't mom pretty?

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:15.676
She had great legs too.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:16.877
They're in the
 next room, come on.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.880
(audience applauds)
