Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       just checking in on you. Just checking in on you. How are you? How's your week going? Oh, don't worry. It's almost over it stars day, right? Don't you get paid on Thursday? Back in the day it did. You get that fucking check, right? That'll piece of paper with the numbers on it. Then you go down to the bank, you fucking, you're right on the back of you stick it in the machine and then the numbers say you got this number

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       right. Just a bunch of numbers.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       That's all it is. It's all, it comes down to, um, I'm actually, I'm in a great mood. I got a great night's sleep last night. Uh, went out and visited some friends of mine and drove home about 80 miles an hour, 85, sometimes 90. Oh, I was cruising. And even when, you know, they fixed the highways at night, you know, which totally makes sense. You can't do it during the day, but she always get mad at night. You like j just fucking cry. He would have to Reggie traffic. They got it unfair to traffic jam. Right? And you get all fucking bad. Cause if fixing a highway and fuck at one 30 in the morning when you should be in bed, right? When the fuck else are they going to do it? That's why I just kept telling myself as I was getting mad, you know I'd be cruising along. This is fucking great. This is great. Look at this. Flying down the fucking highway. 90 fucking miles an hour. You should be able to do this all the time. 24 seven get the population down with whatever I fucking want. I can jump on the highway. Happy then five minutes. Oh Wow. Right over

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       And then all of a sudden you come over the hill and you see that Arrow and then you see the brake lights and he does go, ah yeah, fucking assholes. You know I had AC DC cranking cause I'm a middle aged, not even middle aged. I'm 47 times two is fucking 94 who's kidding? Who you guys think all red faces going to make 95 um, I'm an old fuck. I'm an all white guy who likes Facebook and I'm listening to ACDC and I'm rocking out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       My hybrid. Oh yeah. That's what I'm doing. I'm doing everything to wearing those Mervin shoes. Wear those fucking awful shoes that people a little bit older than me wear and they wear them with no socks and dead jeans. Those slip on fucking shoes that I think were cool for like two weeks in like 1993 they Mervin's right? Melvin's

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:42       What's a melon? I'm Melvin. Somebody fucking gives you a Wedgie. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       Who the fuck ever thought to do that? You realize how funny that is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       I got to say, well, nobody thought to do it until it was pants and then once it was pants, somebody just like I had God, Damn, these things are riding up on me and then it just rode up on the wrong sadistic guy's ass. And he was like, you know what? What if I did that a lot quicker to somebody else? A lot harder on purpose. Premeditated, riding up with the jeans and when he heard the scream of, of uncomfortableness, it warmed his heart. And then some other sadistic fuck sod or maybe just some fucking, uh, you know, like joke thief, except like a fucking bully. Like thief. One of bullies do that. Like they see a bully bullying somebody else and be like, you know, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to do something like that. I'm do my version of that. Then the bully calls him out on Twitter, then there's a big dust up, right. Then they got to go on a bully podcast and clear their name.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Anyways, um, who knows, who knows in this day and age of non controversies becoming controversies, who knows what could happen. Um, yeah, I'm in a great mood. Like I got home one 30 in the morning, I put on the Celtics. I still have even watched the Bruins beaten the Canadians. I know they beat the Canadians. I'm fucking trying to do the basketball and hockey thing and I'm, so I'm behind like two games. The Bruins and I know they got Vancouver tonight and I just checked the standings. What the fuck happened? Or the Canadians? My Boston Bruin heart was in my fucking throat when they started off at nine and Oh my God, oh no, they're going to end the drought this year. They're going to end the drought and then what am I going to say? I got nothing. I already have. The only thing I can say is how long it's been since they won their last one. Cause other than that they can go like, yeah, well we got like 52 of them. It's like, yeah, but you know, the first 12, you were beaten like, you know the fucking Montreal Marauders,

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       the Quebec conquistadores, you know, you one best fucking, uh, best five out of nine, whatever the fucking series was when you played on a pond, do you realize how fucked up it is? And the Stanley Cup was the size of a shot glass, you know, hurry up and finish this game so we can have world war one. Um, that's really, I mean, I don't give a fuck that they count those things. I just like teasing them about it. Um, even if just count the ones from the modern era were never going to catch him. I realized that as a fan. Um, but wasn't going to say it. The uh, I still for the life of me do not understand as we are now it's super bowl 50. Why NFL Championships do not count. Nobody has ever been able to give me a logical explanation to that. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:35       Is it because the two leaks combined rather than the NFL absorbed the AFL? You know, the way the NBA absorbed, you know, like four or five ABA teams. Is that what it is? But for the life of me, it's like those championships were one, they will wonder in those years like take like the Eagles Eagles like, oh, they never want to fucking know a Superbowl gives a fuck. I mean, that sucks. I mean, it's been a long fucking time, but they did win a championship in 1960. Okay. And the way, the way the NFL acts like that was caveman days. Like Mickey Mantle was in the prime of his career. Baseball still drops to their knees, you know, in honor of that guy. Okay. Forget about fucking Babe Ruth. You know who fucking, he's who's fucking Rehab was eating hot dogs and drinking beer and catching up to the fucking the team on the train by, by jumping in a biplane. If he wasn't too fucking fat with weight and balance, right. They could find a scarf long enough to wrap around his giant fucking elephant neck. Right. Why don't they count us that mood? Jim Brown's title doesn't count. What was it, 64 65 the last time the browns wanted slash. Ravens. Um, I dunno. I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about. I thought it was in a good mood. Marty going conti. Anyways. Yeah. I don't know what happened. The Canadians, like as of today, they at one point they are know the season ended today they wouldn't make the playoffs. So I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Canadians team, I'll tell you those, those Montreal Canadians, they're very streaky.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:16       I'll tell you right now, if they're not looking unbeatable, they are looking a unwinnable I, whatever the fuck you'd say. Anyways, let me plow ahead here. So, um, I got to watch that game at some point, but I'm, uh, I'm getting ready to do the, uh, the Patrice O'Neal benefit, the wonderful Patrice O'Neil, the best comic I ever fucking saw. Um, you know, from my generation, it's just, it, it's just a fact. He's the best and a wonderful positive night of, uh, of hilarity supporting, uh, the people that, uh, Patrice was taking care of all his is his loved ones. Uh, that is Tuesday. And uh, from what I hear, it's all sold out, but we will be releasing it the last second, uh, a few tickets, um, here or there, which I guess is what they do at all conscious people. We say that going like, you know, oh I wanted to see fucking whatever, whatever band, you know, and a dude you just like an hour before you just walk up and they release tickets.

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       That's like a some sick fucking level of being able to get tickets, you know, cause I'd be the asshole. I just got a fucking stubhub speaking of which I wanted to go see Bob Newhart. Bob Newhart is doing a show out in the desert at some casino. Right. When I say on the desert, I mean the 10 east to like lucky, right. He's out there cause a, you know that's a, that's a, I think that's his generation. That's where they fucking, that's where they retired. You know that place was like, that place was like a what Brooklyn is now. Oh, like silver lake out here. Like where all the hipsters are. That's what that was to his generation, I think way back in the day. And those stayed out there and they were retired. So I fucking go on. I go on the inner web, there is Richard Rolling says on gas monkey. I go on the inner web and he and I, I try to get tickets, sold the fuck out.

Speaker 2:          00:09:09       I was so upset that I couldn't get a fucking ticket. But on the other level, I'm like, this guy is 83 years old and he's still selling out the big room in a casino, you know, fucking awesome that is credible. You now ridiculous is that he's worked clean his whole career and I'm sitting here cursing up a storm, giving them compliments. I'm going to figure out a way, I'm going to get to that show. It's all not January 29th. I'm going to figure out a way to get in there. I don't know what I gotta do. You know, maybe I'll fucking drive all the way out to the desert and I'll stand around, you know, hoping that maybe a couple audience members died. The tickets got freed up. Um, I'll come on bill, let's, let's, let's, let's not take it to a negative place. Disclose to the AFC and NFC championship games. How could you do that? You know, speaking it dying. By the way, speaking of death, um, you know, I went on the Internet today and I was looking up, uh, a with a fuck. Is it? Oh, here it is. Here it is installed later. Get out a beat. It trying an hour try tonight. Jesus hugging me more fucking needy. All right. Where is it? New York City.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       Discuss is world's largest tax funded mass grave might be turned into a park and I lived in New York. What bad debt? Start spreading the news. I'm wearing sweat pants. I'm gonna go down to Tad stakes Eddie some shit and I'll feel like I'm making it the air, you know, successful New Yorkers thing just cause they're in Manhattan. You know what I mean? Everybody looks at themselves like they're the star, you know? No one sees themselves as background, you know what I mean? You're the ones waving up at the Beatles. You're not in the Beatles. You understand? You're the one in the crowd screaming, you know, fainting and security takes you out as you're looking at somebody successful. Right. That's who you are. Yeah. Those people already on the subway as they try to jam another person in there and the world needs you. The world needs you.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       Okay. If I can go to white castle and a boat Odo 18 or those burgers, I'll be a fat tated fuck in the upper deck. I'm sorry. All right. World's largest tax funded mass graves. So there's an island out there, which I had no idea. Uh, I mean, I knew of Ellis Island and then as the island at the Statue of Liberty is on, then I knew there was one that the navy owned or some shit, but there's this other island out there that, um, they just bury people that don't have any money or nobody knows who the fuck they, it's called Hart Island. Or is it towards some Boston would say, fucking had island.

Speaker 4:          00:11:59       Let's go out to Highland Joe, and maybe we can find a fucking goal.

Speaker 2:          00:12:04       Got In trouble with the bookie. Um, Hart Island, New York, Rosalie Grable looks down over rows of white pipes, some broken or covered in mud, sticking out of the dirt. Each tube marks the grave of 150 adults, uh, dash homeless poor veterans and unclaimed individuals who couldn't afford anything but a spot in what's widely to believe to be the world's largest tax funded mass grave, you know, tax funded mass grave, not mass grave. Cause believe me, I think the isn't there one underneath the,

Speaker 5:          00:12:39       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:12:41       isn't there one underneath like Wall Street, these mass security, a bunch of native Americans as some shit and then they just bury them all isn't what they used to do back then. All right, that takes care of that. Who wants to build a log cabin? Right? Lunatics. Um, so whatever Grable, a 64 year old resident of the upper, upper west side wants grass and wild flowers to hide the dirty white plastic. She's come here to honor her mother who died in a hospital bed with no savings to leave to her daughter. She said, I'm still getting used to the idea that my mommy wound still calls her mommy. That's creepy. A wound up in a potter's grave. I know. That's my mother. I know that my mother was expecting something more true, much more traditional. I don't understand people who like when they die, they want to have one of those above ground fucking like tombs. You know like the above. It's like the above ground swimming pool of grave sites. You know? It's like how fucking special do you think you are? Cause it you're dead.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       They should just have mass graves. They should have a giant pit. You just fucking, you know the family doesn't need to see it but yet his fucking throat in there though. It in there and then you, your dissolve, you become the next fossil fuel. Right? Think about all the fucking people that have lived in the world. If we had in one giant fucking massive grave and each country and you use whatever fucking whenever you, I don't know how the fuck he end up turning into motor oil whenever Deli. That's what happens. I know if you jump off a building you explode like a water balloon because you're mostly water and a, I don't know if you eat a lot of Italian food, you know like I do. You got a lot of olive oil in you. Who knows, maybe you even help out somebody who's fucking lawnmower in the future. That's what they should do. Holy Shit. That I just solve global warming. Or maybe I solved the Middle East crisis

Speaker 4:          00:14:30       and if elected, I will begin burying all dead Americans in the same hall.

Speaker 2:          00:14:36       All

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       in a hundred years from now, we will use the fossil fuel that, that is created to free ourselves from the Saudi Arabians.

Speaker 5:          00:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:47       I am so sick of seeing world leaders go to the UN and act like we have a friend

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       of some sort of a friendship. Um, I dunno if there's, that's something you could do. But anyways, I became fascinated with that expression. I was saying, right. Potter's grave. So I looked it up and of course, you know, my research on the Internet in the Internet never goes past Wikipedia. Never goes past it, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:15:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       Uh, all right. A Potter's Field Comma poppers field or a common grave is a term for a place for the burial of unknown or indigent people or is that indigent? All right. So I clicked on indigent or ended. I don't, isn't it astounding how fucking dumb. I only mostly astounding about how stupid I am is the fact that you guys fucking listen to this. I actually thought it was halfway smart until I started reading out loud here. I, N D I, g e n, t indigent. Indigent. You say tomato. I say indigent. What? And digit indigent.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       I'm just going to stop saying, I just, I'm just, I feel like every time I say it, I'm like, fucking, I'm like that guy. I played blackjack. Want to hit me, hit me, hit me over. Over. Your fucking IQ is just going down. All right, so I looked up a, that word that I'm not gonna say anymore. Oh God. Is it possible to get embarrassed on a podcast that only you are doing, you know? Yep. It's possible. I'm doing it. All right. Park and I, and when the ends up coming up is poverty. Poverty is a general scarcity dearth or the slate of one's money. Well, what the F, how did this come to a FTE industrial revolution? Mass production in factories made product production goods increasingly less expensive and more accessible of. More important is the modernization of the agriculture. Said fertilize it dented at debit, but the poverty reduction is a major goal. Oh, give me a fee. Is it really, is it really a major goal when the fucking CEO takes 80% of the profits?

Speaker 5:          00:16:54       Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       One of the guys who's fucking working the line, his daughter's already hooking his up in the CEO's office, blowing them, you know, cause she can't go to fucking call her. Then the circle is complete. Oh, that was a little poetry there. All right. The u s expression, let me get back to the Potter's field. The u s expression, Potter's field derives from the Bible. Oh, GJ page. Referring to a field used for the extraction of Potter's clay. Such land used for agriculture could be used as a burial site. So after they dug out all the clay, they just threw people in there. Well, there you go. That's a good use of space.

Speaker 5:          00:17:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       All right. The term comes to all, let's, let's read some Bible. Oh my God. I know. I've done this. Read some Bible Brits read from the Bible. The term comes from Matthew 27 Semi-colon oh colon, three dash two seven colon, eight in the new testament of the Bible in which Jewish priests take it's 30 pieces of silver returned by remorseful Judas Colon. Oh Jesus. It'd be some antisemitic shit. Okay. And then so it says then Judas, who portrayed him? I think that's Jay Star. He betrayed Jay star. They're seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the 30 pieces of silvers to the chief priests and ancient saying, I have sent in betraying innocent blood. But they said, what does that to us? Look out to it. Yeah, there you go. There's the antisemitism right there. Hey, what do we give a shit? Just give us the silver pieces there. Rod Judy.

Speaker 5:          00:18:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed and went and hanged himself with a halter. Definitely a halter top. They had those backs there, but he hung himself with a little fucking sports bra. Uh, but the chief priests having taking the pieces of silver said it's not lawful to put them into the core. Bona didn't Chrysler used to make those, the Chrysler core Bono with orientee and later the term Mike box. What the f I'm Mike Box. Isn't that a bug also arms box or poor box refers to a box that is used to save coin or a piggy bank is what you should say to save coins for charitable purposes or for charitable purposes. Oh, so then, okay, I get it. So then they say, wait a minute, this guy killed the king of the Jews and was sitting here with the fucking loot from the caper.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       We'll go stick it in the fucking donation box and nobody says a word. You got me. All right. And then they, after that they had consulted to get, you know what? This might be a new section. You want me to guys, I'll start reading the fucking Bible and I'll give you my interpretation of it. Gradually I'll start my own church, right. And I'll say that I have a direct link to he that is the one if, and then gradually I'll slide my direct link over into just saying, hey am maybe I'm that guy. I am that guy. I am him a blow me. I'm fucking all the women here. A you guys get out in the field and grow some more apples. It's basically fast forwarding through running a cult. Oh does the FBI here, everybody drank this over the lips and over the gums. Suck it down. Here they come. All right, throw the site. Refer to these verses known as the bookbub up above.

Speaker 5:          00:20:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       That's really interesting and fucking said there is something sad about that. Right? Is anybody ever had like a fucking marquis on their head site? You know, like a big gravestone and then just have like, you know like the Chicago theater but like to scale to a headstone performing for Aternity

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       or some hacky fucking former show business a Christ. Now I gotta look this shit up. Now I've gotta look this shit up. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       those people who have wacky headstone saying, here we go. Funny headstones.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       All right, here we go. What do we got here? What do we got here? Images for funny headstones. No. What are the odds? Any of these are going to be funny. All right, Charlie. All these are just funny. Named Charlie loser. Born in 1887 and John Loser. Jesus Christ is such losers. They're buried in the same fucking place. Joke's over. Let me out now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:21:33       oh, Leslie Nielsen. He's got a joke on his, what does it say? Let her rip. I don't know what the fuck that means. Well, these are just funny names. Stiff Tipman boogers spanks. Who put this up here? Fucking Beavis and buffet. Butthead ones by, I mean, funny sangs. Jesus Christ, the Internet. Funny sayings. Headstones. There we go. Oh my God.

Jesus. Oh Jesus. It's such an NPR joke. Uh, Jack Lemmon in, oh, it's like a movie headstone. Jack Lemmon was one hell of an actor. And a funny one to boot. Here's his Harry stars in his final row. Well in the ground. Uh, that's a good one. Uh, this one gets to the point. Well this sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:43       It was another one. All right. This one. This ain't bad. Once you get used to it, that's not bad. I was supposed to live to be 102 and be shot by a jealous husband.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       Near this spot. You know something to actually, if they are all interesting, I think people would go to fucking graveyards more rather than, than getting creeped out by it. Um, near this spot. Samuel Whitmore, then 80 years old killed three British soldiers. He was shot. He was shot. Bayonetted beaten and left for dead, but recovered and live to be 90 years of age. This guy's talking shit here. I lie, but don't you cry for one day to you will die. Ah, what? I can't Lindsey Nielsen let her rip Merv Griffin. I will not be right back after this message. That's a winner right there. I like that somebody wrote high, get it. Such a comedian. You can't make anybody happy. On the Internet. All right, Bill Kugel. He voted for Republicans and had little to do with them. If that was bad. Here's one. Said I told you I was sick. That's, that's funny.

Speaker 5:          00:23:57       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       The other one, I knew this would happen. Some of these are pretty good. Rodney Dangerfield. There goes the neighborhood here lies something, something hanging by mistake in 1882 he was right. We was wrong, but we stand him up and now he's gone. Oh Dude, you can't go with poetry. I guess that's it. Well there you go guys. That's about as good as it gets and either, you know you can do better.

Speaker 5:          00:24:26       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       well she just said, what the fuck are you looking at? I don't know. Let's, let's read the advertising. Shall We? Lot of death. A lot of debt this week. A lot of death on the podcast. Um, all right. Ah, here we go. The reeds for this week club. Debbie, you club Daddy. My daddy went to Yale. Uh, we've been, we've all been there. You come home after a long exhausting, exhausting day, right? You want to get shit faced and all you want is to sip. You want to sit, you want to sip a glass of wine and relax.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       We things to do during a quarter life crisis,

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       a quarter life crisis. Don't you love our advertising? Could just come up with a fucking phobia you never had. Who is a quarter life crisis? Oh my God, I'm 25. What am I going to do? Was the volume this far down? Did I accidentally kicked the volume of shit? Yeah, Christ. Um, don't worry. Don't worry. I'm, I'm still working on the garage and uh, I'll, I'm going to, I'm going to figure out how to make this fucking work. Okay. It's becoming, once again, everything in this house is, is a mother fucker. And when I finally learned to do is I'm not fighting the house, I'm not fighting the house anymore. I will adapt to it. All right. Everything has to be some sort of a geometric shape that doesn't exist yet. That has no definition than God. Dammit. That will be the shape of the fucking room.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       All right. Is there anything else I wanted to talk about? Um, oh man, this lady fucking cut me off when I was driving and just the fucking thoughts I had and everyone that you have be like, I can't do that and go to jail. I can't do that. I put her eye up. You know, I was thinking about pulling up next to if I had a paint gun and her sticking the, when her face out the window to give me the finger like, like they all do and just fucking blast and are right in the face. And I immediately, I was thinking about her eyes. So that's where the paint ball went and put her eye out. And I got, I don't Dunno, back the fantasy up. Okay. Take it down a notch. Right in the middle of her forehead. Hit her right in the forehead and watched the botox shoot out on either side.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       Nah, but then you know, people behind me would take down my plate and I just was sitting at the red light behind her. All of these fantasies of the shit I wanted to do. Follow her, find out where she fucking works slash all of her tires and then take the knife, stick it right into the head, rest of her driver's side seat, you know, with something fucking written in newspaper writing. So you know when you take the fucking letters from the newspapers, so it looks totally even more creepy. And I was like, well why would you do that? There's going to be cameras in the parking lot. You can't do that. And then the light turned green and she made a right. And I kept going straight and I just never thought about her again until right now.

Speaker 2:          00:32:34       And with that, that is the, uh, you guys have any yummy hears some, uh, once you write in the murderer is fantasies that you have when somebody cuts you off and fucking traffic, all this shit that you think about doing but you don't do because that's the difference between you and a psycho. All you do is think it, but you don't fuck it. You don't carry it out, you know all, at least I hope you do or else I probably just got put on some sort of watch list, you know? No, it gives a fuck. I'd love to be put on a watch list and I would love to be watching them. Watch me and see how long they could watch me before they fucking nodded off. See watching another hockey game. Oh my God, this is the worst assignment ever. Jesus Christ. Um, all right, that's the Thursday afternoon.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       Just before Monday for, uh, just for Friday, Monday morning podcast. Uh, have a great weekend. You can, uh, let's go patriots. I think this is going to be as always, it's going to be a very tough game. Going to be a very tough game. Oh, by the way, I finally watched the a Carolina Seattle game and um, this is what I have to say. You know, I, I find it amazing that the Carolina Panthers, when they had two weeks before that game even came, right, they had a week off, so they had two weeks and millions of dollars at their disposal to get that field into a better, like into much better shape for that great Seattle defense. It's amazing how they just for some reason couldn't get that together. Now it's not illegal. All you really have to do is just have a feel and paint some lines and put some numbers on it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       You're not required to have it in the greatest shape, but that was just one of those things as a patriots fan, you just look at and go, isn't that funny? I wonder what would happen if we were to do something like that, even though it's not illegal. That'd be a nice fucking five days. Other patriots up to it. Again. Um, anyway, so we're going into a Denver, we're going into Denver. It should be a, a tough game. And, um, I have a melancholy feeling about this. Like this might be the last, uh, Brady Peyton manning matchup, you know, and if Peyton Manning's retires after this year, and then there's just one, right, Tom, terrific. And then some day he'll be gone. It'll be retired. And it's just, it's going to be like Jesus fucking Christ. I remember when they came in the front and when those guys came in the league, I was already in my thirties, wasn't I? When Peyton come in 97, I turned 30 and 98. So 30. Yeah, 29, 30 years old on fucking believable. And they're considered old.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       I'll be in my fifties. When Tom Brady retires. God willing, God fucking well, God willing. He plays that long and God willing, I fucking make it that I am making into my fifties and don't end up in a fucking potter's grave. You know, I wouldn't give a shit. I think that's the most arrogant fucking thing you could possibly do is, um, give a fuck. I get dead bodies presented for the rest of fucking time. That's just the fucking needs. Just like dude, just Frisbee, Frisbee my body off the back of a pickup truck down a cliff. I don't give a shit. Um, oh by the way, with that just reminds me of something. The fuck was I going to say? Christ. It left me. It left me like all thoughts do. Um, all right, so that's the podcast. Have a great weekend. Your con, uh, should be a great game out in Denver. I love their defense. Um, of course. I don't think it's going to be an easy game and uh, I am surprised that we have favorites because we have historically not done well out in Denver and it always fucking snows. All right,

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       I'll talk to you a 20 cons on Monday. Oh No. Why Shit about the fucking guy who's

Speaker 2:          00:36:57       got that? You know, he went over to, he went over to Uganda, that Guy Kony Kony 2012. You see that? You see how quickly they brought that guy down. This guy shines the light on the a, on himself first and foremost. And how he and his child are dealing with it, which is really bizarre. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but it was enough for me to see the boy soldier crying because he saw his brother have his neck sliced right in front of them, you know? And he goes from that to be a, now I'm going to sit my son down and tell them about the, it's like, Whoa, I didn't even get it. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       So anyways, this guy shines a light on this bullshit that's going on over there and all of a sudden everybody's in an uproar. Obvious. And everybody gives a fuck about Uganda and these boys soldiers, you know? Then all of a sudden the United States government is going, dude, we're fighting to boards. We can't even afford to fight one now. This guy's bringing this shit up. Gee, wouldn't it be nice if something fucking happened that would discredit him? Next thing you know, a couple of days later, a, this guy connected with the film for debt. Kony 2012 gets caught jerking off in public. Was that the only guy who found that unbelievably fucking convenient. I didn't buy it for a second. In fact, I tweeted, you know, back in the day, they used to assassinate you. Now they just do this. You know what I mean? If they can make it look like we landed on the moon in 1969, you don't think that they can make you anybody they want make it look like you're rubbing one out in the fucking parking lot. I don't buy it. What that fucking Douche bag was doing, not douchebag that fucking self-serving. Cont there we go. That's what I was trying to say. What he was doing with that film was he was putting pressure on the United States to go over there and fucking somehow insert themselves into that situation, which would have cost a ton of fucking money,

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       you know?

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       But there's no way to be like, hey, fuck those boys soldiers, you know, because of, of, uh, the way the cu, because of what it says in our pamphlet, you know, give a shit or you're weak. Give us your pour and we'll exploit the shit out of them. And, uh, let them die of tuberculosis in a damp apartment. And then years later, whoever made the most amount of money gets a statue made out of them. That's all in our thing. So we can't look the other way with these fucking boy soldiers. So what's easiest thing to do? Just just make that guy look like a freak show. First of all, who hasn't jerked off in a parking lot? Honestly? You know who hasn't done that? You know, your, you fucking girl goes in to exchange something. You sit in there, you bored, you can't get any radio reception because you know, it's back in the day. You just say, ah, I'm bored. Right? You've got a girl in your life. So you know, there's gonna be some sort of Napkins in the car. What are you gonna Dope, right? You got the captain's chairs. No one could see you.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Oh, this is taking forever. Eh, what am I rub one out right yet that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah Webinar. Everybody's got a fucking camera. You know? You know, what's amazing is that everybody hasn't got caught jerking off in public at this point. Everybody's got a camera in their raw, their cell phone. When I'm trying to say people is I don't buy it and it doesn't matter. I don't give a fuck whether the guy from Coney was jerking off in a parking lot or not. That doesn't change whether or not this boy soldiers in Uganda. But what's great is, is then the conversation switches from what's going on over there to low let's this guy doing easy rubbing his dick like we all do. And then everybody would be like, yeah, but we don't do it in public as to what that makes you better doesn't make you better. It just makes you more considerate, doesn't it? I mean, if he had two people and they were both shooting heroin and one person had the decency to do it in their house and the other person does it out in public, at the end of the day, you're both drug addicts. So if you really gonna sit there and shit on this guy for jerking off, then you would have to basically be not jerking off

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       at all. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm asking you to look into your hearts. If you have not rubbed one out, let he who is not rubbed worn out in some sort of pop. No, you'd never jerked off at work. God, I'm fucking bored. Excuse me, let me go to the bathroom. Maybe they think I'm taking a shit standing up, right? Come on. If you're a guy in your arms along enough, at some point you've jerked off in someplace where you shouldn't have. You jerked off to somebody you shouldn't have. You've done it. We've all been there. Who gives a fuck? There's still boys fighting and wars over this. So you know, if you want to help out, help out. If you don't, don't, but don't let some guy rub one out in a parking lot. Change your mind either way. You know what they're doing right now that doing what women do when they argue when they start to lose is they bring up other shit and they spin it into a different room and next thing you know, you're arguing a whole different argument and argument that they wanted you to fucking argue so they knew that they could win rather than keeping the argument on fucking track of saying, listen sweetheart, I don't like the way you fucking been dressing lately.

Speaker 2:          00:42:36       Okay? I got in this relationship to treat you like a piece of fucking meat. All right, and lately you've been slacking off. People are still boy soldiers and Uganda. Whether or not that guys rubbing one out are open in his ass for the world to see. Don't ever forget that. Don't lose sight of what the real story is. Okay? That is all good night and God bless the United States.

Speaker 3:          00:43:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       all right. All right. Chicken Vice. Hey Bill, I'm 25 and I've been listening to your podcast for a year now and I really enjoy it. I want to get your advice on my current situation. Yup. I could have assumed all of that. Um, because I'm arrogant. And why else would you write in? Okay. After a lot of failed relationships, I wanted to try a new approach of meeting women. I met a 21 year old girl through my sister in law and figured she was interesting and pretty enough to consider for a serious girlfriend. We started hanging out as friends so I could be sure that I was in fact able to be friends with her before I made a move to something more seriously. More serious, sorry. Things have been going well for the last two months and we get together a couple times a week to hang out and do stuff. Wow. [inaudible] last week I finally decided that I wanted to make my move on her. I was saying goodbye to her up to hanging out, and I finally moved in for a kiss and she backed away.

Speaker 5:          00:44:38       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:38       It got really awkward after that and she kind of said, oh, I have to go. About 10 minutes later I got a text from her saying, sorry for backing away, but I don't want to ruin our friendship. Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       AH, dude, you fucking waited too long car. I would go, go watch that Chris Rock special where he still does the friend zone. Um, anyways, he says, what the hell do I do now? She has always been very flirty with me the entire time we've been hanging out. Oh wait, she's been flirting with you now. Fuck her. She works at an all girls camp during the summer and she always hangs out with me on her days off. So I know there isn't anyone else she is seeing. All right. First of all, scratch that. All right. You have no idea what, what, how does that expression go?

Speaker 5:          00:45:29       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       You know, only the devil knows the secrets in a woman's heart. Isn't that how it goes? Something like that. Don't ever fucking, you have no foul. I don't give a fuck. Okay. You could have a woman in a Goddamn cell. You still have no idea what the fuck they're doing.

Speaker 5:          00:45:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       Um, the sorceress um, anyways, am I to believe she is so naive to think that we were just hanging out as total platonic friends. The only reason I could think why she would do that is because I am agnostics and she is a semi-religious girl. What do you think I should do? You know what you should do fucking walk Robert Deniro in heat. Just walk away. All right. Just walk away. This is what you do. All right. This girl's being all flirted with you and all that type of shit. She gets your Dick hard. You're trying to be a gentleman. You don't try to fucking finger blast her on the first day cause you think she's special. All right, so three days after flying kites and going on picnics, you go in for a kiss. She pulls up, Eh, Eh, didn't want to ruin the friendship.

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       Give me a fucking break. She knows what the fuck she's doing. All right? She's toying with you. So this is what you do. This is the best thing that you can do. When a woman does something like that that makes you want to go out and eat fucking sheet metal is you don't, you don't give them the emotion that they want, which is she, they want you to be upset. And, uh, I don't know. I don't know why I have no, I don't know fucking why, but she wants you to be upset. So this is what you do. Okay? He just say, Oh yeah, hey, I didn't know what I was doing. That's cool. That's cool. Whatever. All right. And then she had very few any fans and be like, yeah, absolutely, we can totally be friends.

Speaker 2:          00:47:16       Alright, so don't try to fucking bang her anymore. Don't blow her off. So she has no idea what you're doing. Just keep hanging out with or whatever, doing this and that. And then we do just start fucking working out. You get jacked, right? And then on the side you start talking to other broads and then one day you show up with a fucking Goddamn Hickey on the side of your neck. You know? And then you fucking just don't even address it. What said I, you know, I was hanging out with some girl last night. So what are you doing today? And you just, you just, you mind fucker. Right back. You fight fire with fire. That's what you do. Get on with your life, sir. Fuck her. That's it. All right. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:56       That's, that's what I feel my solution is always the same. Okay. Is when whenever a girl does some shit like that. All right? Or if a girl breaks up with you or anything like that and, and uh, if a girl still wants to be friends with you after she broke up with you, don't, all right? You get the fuck away from her hurt locker. Okay. Put on your bomb suit and fucking walk away. Don't be the, don't be the hero. You fucking walk away because they just want to keep you in their life as they slowly get over you and just constantly be taking a state knife and shoving it into your heart. Fuck that. All right? You get away from him.

Speaker 2:          00:48:38       This, there's no point being around this girl. So right now this girl just tried to mind. Fuck you. So if you do the automatically just cut off being around her, she's going to win on some level and she'll actually get some sort of level of satisfaction that you reacted that way. Because because even though you think you're saying fuck you, what you're really saying is I actually cared about you and that's gonna feed her Goddamn Ego. So don't do that. So just be like, yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. You know? Uh, yeah. You can't. Yeah, you can't. You can't blame a guy for try. And that'll annoy her like she's just some piece of meat you took a swing at.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       This is such terrible fucking advice, but you know what? I believe in it. This is how I've lived my life. If you want to end up like me, 43 not married, no kids, that's how you do it. I Dunno. Yeah. Just whatever she wants to hang out. Yay. Let's hang out and don't be weird around her. Don't be weird. Hey, sorry about that. I don't know I was an idiot or whatever. Now that's what you do. That's what you do. All right. And then what you do is start talking about some other girl, wait a couple of weeks and just say, hey, you know, I Kinda met this girl. I kind of like her and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, this is, this is a fucking, this is the old hook and lateral play. I don't know if this'll work. This is definitely a hail Mary.

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       But maybe if you fucking start saying, hey, and I met this girl, hey know I kinda fucking like, or you show up at the Hickey on your neck. I don't know what happens. The spinal cord muscles, the spinal cord muscles, the muscles around this spinal cord get fucking eye. They get weak, you know, and all of a sudden they just fall face first and the elap, sometimes that happens, you know, but you're not going to know when they should try it. All right? Don't be Chris Webber and be looking to pass the fucking ball here. You want to take the shot? You understand me? So what you do,

Speaker 6:          00:50:29       sometimes I say this shit and I, and I step outside of myself and I just realized what a fucking moron I sound like. But I don't know. For some reason you guys listen to this shit, so whatever. Good luck to you. I just

Speaker 3:          00:50:41       home green [inaudible] spray and the boat safe. What's different? They hard to get all those time. [inaudible] do some little differences this week

Speaker 6:          00:51:17       rather than me just sitting here in my pajamas ranting, ranting and raving. I decided that I would get closed this week and have a friend of mine come by. Um, the one and only dom. I rera everybody. Thank you everybody. Do you mind if I get undressed? Huh? I would feel more comfortable doing the show I like in the nude and the nude in the nude, not just in the nude. I realized now, you know, look, look how much weight I've gained right now. You know, I've gained since I've known you, but 30 pounds. Right. And I know that. I can tell. Well, you don't really look, you don't really check me out. It is. Oh, duck my head. My head is bigger. What are you wearing? That slimming black tee shirt. I've got Barry bonds head, but it's interesting because now I don't even know if this is a bit yet built, but I think there's something minute.

Speaker 6:          00:52:10       I have to look. I don't like women my own age. Right. I mean, I can't, I can't fake that. I get aroused by them. I always wondered that. No, I always wanted to lean it. I wish I had that kind of love or something that I need like a hot young chick, but the only hot young chick I'm going to get has to be flawed. Right. She gotta be as daddy issue inside or outside. Yeah. You just gotta be messed up in some way. But that's what I'm looking for. How many, uh, how many strippers have you, have you dated, dated? Uh, only a couple. I was in love with one. How old? How old were you when you did, when you made that move? Uh, two years ago. You fell in love with the stress lower yet. First of all, it's just a country song.

Speaker 6:          00:52:50       She was filling low. Um, she was not stripping at the time. She was bartending and just give him the occasional lap dance and really beautiful girl. Been to that bar. Fun. But I'll tell you, oxycontin and alcohol really mess you up. Yeah. I don't know if you knew that. Yeah, I got some, but I still love the girl, but she's a don't, I don't think we're getting back together cause that oxy, her husband and her two kids keep blocking us. Oh Jesus. Dom, you're making me feel good. Making me feel good. Some of the choices I made back in the day, dude, oxy is a, that's a terrible one, right? Yeah. That's one

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       of those things like even when you get off at your, I don't know that you're ever a, depending on how long you do it, the same. I lost a buddy of mine to that. Oh really? I got another one. Uh, he's not doing so well. Did you grow up in a neighborhood that was a lot of drugs? Um, not like that. Not like that. It was a, I grew up, you know it was called the sec bullshit. It was weed. There was the weed guy, there was the bookie and then w and then there was, you know blues obviously, but you know when some coke when you got older, but uh, like nobody was doing like heroin and crack was like you're out of your fucking mind. Cause everybody thought if you smoked crack, that was it. You had done well the, they say you get addicted the first time.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       That's what they said. But I got friends of mine who dead and they're like, yeah, maybe they're addicted to other things they didn't have time to be. Maybe they're just better people and better, stronger. You have good friends. Let me ask you this. If you had one drug that you think you would like, what would it be? I know what mine is. If you, if I could do a drug that I've never tried and I tried and you think that they like, it's not gonna have any repercussions. Just want to the feeling. What feeling would it be? Tai, I have a tie. Well is I want to know, I want to know what it feels like. Like that train spotting where you sink into the rug the first time you do heroin. That's exactly, that's exactly what I want that. But I got to admit the hallucinating thing tripping, but I'll put that says that somebody told me, like you said, awake when you're tripping.

Speaker 2:          00:54:54       It's not like you don't know. The trepanned you see the door fucking melting. You're like, oh, it's because I'm on acid. It's not like those high school films where you'd be like, you thought you could fly and shit like that jumped out the window. No, I uh, what was that movie with that old guy? Was it something funny to me? Larry Alan Arkin did a part where he played an old guy and he fucking, uh, he just, he got addicted to heroin like his seventies and he's just like, what the fuck? I'm 70. That's a good, actually a good idea just to try it. It's 70. I mean, I'd rather go out shooting drugs and go out taking, you know, Dick in the ass. That must hurt, man. That's the thing. You ever think about that seriously? Bill taken one? Yeah, excepting one. I think taking one for the tee and taking one for the team.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       All tell him your number came up. Sorry. You're not going to like this like this. I don't think so. We worked this out. No, I've actually thought you, you only a priest. How I, how I want to go out and buy wolves eating shredded by animals. Yeah. I either want to live to be like 105 like you live so long that there's like nobody at your funeral because you outlived everyone who gives a shit or the, you know, because cause that is what funny image cause that's one of the things, if you live long enough, this, I'm pretty sure he had people that cared about like people doing the eulogy. Like, I mean, you know, he says I met him when he was 87 and uh, you know, he was all like, he like playing cards, which those slippers, I always wore those slippers.

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       But if you die, like,

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       you know, like all my friends, you know, who have died tragically fucking young, it seems, I mean you pack the house and everybody's up there flying. That's the only good thing about Diane Young is everybody gives a fuck. If there's articles written about you, there's nothing worse with, I mean, there's nothing worse than dying yet, but Diane old also is, you know, you sit in there, you got that fucking old terrified picture. Know

Speaker 6:          00:56:52       my uncle Tony when he died, he really was very prejudiced and very angry, but he also loved his children. He loved God. He loved mountains. And then when he died, it was so funny that make up for the racist. Yeah, but I'm saying he was that balanced crosses on people in the nature love birds. It's true though. He was like all that. And he's, and what were standing around the coffin? You see that mountain? It's for us. It's for us. Not these other people. This is God's country. But when we're around the courtroom, we're standing, you know, people lie about people after they died, and this guy leave for Deli, who was the first Italian character ever did? Like I got down a little, uh, he said, we're staying there. Me and a friend of mine is a priest and like a couple of my cousins and we're standing there over the body and he goes, he never had a bad word to say about anybody.

Speaker 6:          00:57:38       And we went from crying to fucking laugh. And I'm thinking, like I said, all he did was have bad words said, but everybody, and then he goes, listen to this, this is a really old reference. He goes, he never hated anybody except Larry Bowa, right? Larry Bo, the old for the Phillies. And he goes and he looks up, he goes, he hated that mother fucker would of vengeance. Was he a gambler? No, he didn't gamble. He just hated him. He hated the Larry Book cause he hit one 75 but he was a great fielder. But I mean hell, what a, what an obscure reference to make at a funeral.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       Right. So in general, back in the day, he probably just didn't like second basements right. Straight in front of the board. But I love that everybody laughed. I've had a couple of those that like funerals.

Speaker 6:          00:58:17       Oh, we're crying, losing from crying, crying, crying, laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       I did that one time, a buddy of mine, his dad died and it was just one of those fucking, you know, tragic. You know, we were young and he died on to nowhere and the kid had already lost, his mom was fucking horrible. And uh, so it was pouring, raining to make it even worse. Fucking like the, remember the movie seven? It was raining like that. Okay. Yeah. So we, we, you know, go, you know, we'll go through the surface and now they're gonna, you know, put the guy on the ground and the guy was so popular. I mean, it was just a zillion people there. So they had like one of these, you know, one of those pop tents with no sides to it. So there's so many fucking people, everybody's jamming in there. Me and my buddy can't get in, you know, we're on the outer ring, we're just getting rained on and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       And my other asshole friend is just inside the tent and he's sitting there and we're all crying and stuff and bringing the body down. And all of a sudden, just from the weight of the rain, like this little like canal started pouring down and just missing my friend and my buddy in the middle of crimes, we're standing rain just reached up and adjusted it. So it went all his coat. But he had like this wool kind of coat on so he couldn't feel it at first. And Dude, I'm talking, crying, laughing, just crying because it was so sad. And that's the thing too that I never thought people ever understand about comics when they have a distasteful joke, like of a boat sinks as a plane crash and you have a joke. They always think it's cause you're insensitive and they'd sometimes don't understand that it's, it's a defense mechanism where it's sitting the pain. Yeah, I'm feeling something bad. I don't want to feel it. And then you, you, you make a fucking joke and then you're laughing. Cause you don't want to feel that. So you're actually doing it because you get, it's kind of, I think, I think it's like a dysfunction. It's kind of a form of dysfunction. Well, I couldn't file jokes. We all know how terrible that is. And yet when you give a 20 incidences, but you could, you can twist them around. I usually bring up

Speaker 6:          01:00:10       back on myself, you know, like, uh, one joke that says, you know what about me, father, I wasn't hot enough for you. You know what I mean? Like that kind of thing to make it me. I wouldn't want to hurt a kid, but there's a good example of something that's cause so many people, so much pain. And I'm not just talking about the physical pain. Yeah. But, um, you know, we do.

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       Oh No, you, you end somebody's life when you, that's why that, that said Dusky guy, you know, like they shouldn't put those good. They, they should automatically get the death penalty just immediately. They take them out. Dude, if you've got a rabid dog in your neighborhood, you fucking put it down. Those sex offender guys, that's it. Because all those people that that dude fucked with, it's like that's gonna now affect. You want to talk about dating strippers? Like how that's going to affect who they pick. You know who they pick as a, uh, a wife, how they treat their kids. They make, they, there's a chance that they could, you know, sometimes, I don't know if it happened. I'm going to go beyond my intelligence on this shit, which isn't too hard to do, but I, all I know is that that's generations of therapy because of the abuse of the, they repeat the whoever.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       Then those guys don't get the, you can't put that guy in jail and like, I mean, how long, like you're attracted to what you're attracted to no amount on a cell. Well, especially that time. If they suck you in a cell, how long before you wouldn't like big ticket strippers, you'd come out eight years later, I'm dumb. I wait, get, bring me to some pick tickets for those guys. Like eight year olds, you stick him in a cell and you talk to them. You try to undo it and show them an adult that they're wired that way. That's it. I'm just fucking sick putting, put them down. It's your ethic. It's why I don't believe in a higher power that gives a fuck.

Speaker 6:          01:01:53       Well, that's a whole different subject, but I understand that. But did you hear that pedophile joke about a, you might have to tell joke joke. No, not at all. It's a two guys sitting on a bench and see an 11 year old boy walked by one guy, pedophiles. It says to the other one, he goes, boy, he must've been hot back in the [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       It must have been something back in the day. Oh, that's fucking twisted. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:02:43       [inaudible] [inaudible].
