00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.110
They print 39. The cursor starts right here. And then, we print 3. But since

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.210
it's just print and not print line, it doesn't go down to the next line. So

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.818
then, the cursor is right here. And then, it takes the 4 plus 5. And since

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:17.624
there aren't any quotes, it adds them together and gets 9 and prints right

00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:22.115
here. And then, since its print line our cursor would go down to the next line.

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:28.968
But then, we don't print anymore, so we don't notice that. We can see that if

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:32.792
we make a program. So, we add all these pieces that we need to make the

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:37.184
computer happy, And then, we add our own code then we close it all up and run

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:41.084
it, and it prints out 39.
