00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.354
Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away,

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:16.854
and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.374
He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you,

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:24.805
but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever.

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:27.062
So he is banking on the fact

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:32.660
that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.558
Your uncle left the following 
note in his will:

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:37.777
"I have created a puzzle.

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:42.028
If all 100 of you answer it together,
you will share the money evenly.

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:46.185
However, if you are the first to find
the pattern and solve the problem

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.721
without going through all of the leg work,

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:52.521
you will get the entire inheritance 
all to yourself.

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.098
Good luck."

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:58.929
The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives
to a secret room in the mansion

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.795
that contains 100 lockers,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.270
each hiding a single word.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.440
He explains:

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.805
Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.705
Heir 1 will open every locker.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.702
Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:20.879
Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.775
specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it,

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.580
but if it's closed, she'll open it.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.179
This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.462
The words in the lockers that remain
open at the end

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:38.037
will help you crack the code for the safe.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:42.644
Before cousin Thaddeus can even start
down the line,

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:49.012
you step forward and tell the lawyer
you know which lockers will remain open.

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:51.366
But how?

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.332
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:55.421
Answer in: 3

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:56.577
Answer in: 2

00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:58.248
Answer in: 1

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.151
The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.427
is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.064
For example, in locker #6,

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:10.708
Person 1 will open it,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:12.602
Person 2 will close it,

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.316
Person 3 will open it,

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:17.212
and Person 6 will close it.

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:22.332
The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6.

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:25.165
So when a locker has an even number
of factors

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.812
it will remain closed,

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.833
and when it has an odd number of factors,

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.962
it will remain open.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:33.953
Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors,

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:37.713
which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up.

00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:41.475
In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.774
are perfect squares

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:48.952
because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number.

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:51.334
For Locker 9, 1 will open it,

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:52.818
3 will close,

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:54.934
and 9 will open it.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.094
3 x 3 = 9,

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.379
but the 3 can only be counted once.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.529
Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open.

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.426
You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution,

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:11.285
so you open them immediately
and read the words inside:

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:17.043
"The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice."

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:21.881
You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.454
since each only has two factors:

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.508
1 and itself.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.835
So the code is 2-3-5-7-11.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.209
The lawyer brings you to the safe,

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.045
and you claim your inheritance.

00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:38.527
Too bad your relatives were always
too busy being nasty to each other

00:03:38.527 --> 00:03:41.344
to pay attention 
to your eccentric uncle's riddles.
