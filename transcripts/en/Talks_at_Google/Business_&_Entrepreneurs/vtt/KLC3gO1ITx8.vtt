BILL CRAWFORD: Please welcome
to Google Ann Arbor Senior Vice

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.499
President of Marketing,
Tony Ambroza.

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.650
TONY AMBROZA: Thank you for
the warm welcome, everyone.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.080
I mean, I do know why
you really are here.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.590
We had to bring the
A18s, our famous beanies.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.130
So we're excited to see
all of you sporting it.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.159
I live around Ann Arbor, so I'll
be looking for those beanies

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.880
throughout town.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.710
So thank you again for coming.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160
Before I kick off with
the whole presentation,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.910
I have strategically
placed videos in here

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
to make sure you all stay
awake, because it is that 1 to 2

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.850
o'clock witching
hour after lunch.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.830
But the first one is
really to bring the life,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.190
hopefully for many of you,
the true spirit and essence

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.430
of what we're all about.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.760
It's a recent film that
we produced in partnership

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.350
with Jason Momoa.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.380
So a few of you may
know who he is--

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.290
pretty famous for different
roles and leading parts

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.880
he's been able to secure.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.320
And we've been very fortunate
to become close friends with him

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.150
over the last 3 and 1/2 years.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.870
He's directed and produced
four of our last commercials,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.080
and he grew up an Iowa kid
and the son of a single mom

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.450
and raised by his grandfathers
who were farmers and carpenters

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.290
as well.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.300
So I'm going to kick
things off with the film

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.480
that we did in partnership
with Jason that really speaks

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.640
to the power of
building a legacy

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.690
for that next generation.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.166
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.134
- We're on stage, buddy.

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.118
Ah!

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:36.102
- Yeah!

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.578
[GRUNTING]

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:42.990
- Ben Affleck!

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.450
Gal Gadot!

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.910
Ray Fisher!

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.878
Ezra Miller!

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:52.338
And Jason Momoa!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.630
- Ever since I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a father,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.640
but never in my life did I ever
think that I would be an actor.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.440
I was raised in small
town America, surrounded

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.820
by hard work,
cornfields, and pigs.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.970
My uncles and grandfather
were the hunters and builders

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.920
of the Midwest.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.070
I was raised by a
strong single mother.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.660
My mom's an artist in every way.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.200
She's a painter, a photographer.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.720
She's a wanderer, always
searching, always seeing.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.730
I guess you could say
my mom gave me her eyes.

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:51.680
My mom introduced me to
skateboarding and rock

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.740
climbing, and I absolutely
love her for that.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.026
Skateboarding-- it gave
birth to a style for me.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:03.150
It wasn't just the skating.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.500
It was the music.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.770
It was the crew,
the underground.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.240
Architecture was
forever changed.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.520
You wouldn't believe how much
fun you could have on a curve.

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:22.300
And climbing-- it made me
face my fears, my doubts,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.860
explore the impossibles,
problem solve through movement.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.510
I learned to trust my
hands, find my feet.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.075
I found balance and
I found my passion.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.530
I wanted to see
the world climbing.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.320
I craved the road to the wild.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.060
I wanted to get
out, explore it all.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.670
Camping, fires, playing
music, telling stories,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.921
living in the dirt, eating
crackers and sardines.

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.276
I was a dirt bag.

00:03:57.276 --> 00:03:59.168
There was not a
care in the world.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.780
I packed up my life.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.520
I put it on my back,
free to wander everywhere

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.945
from Tibet, France, Italy,
Japan, everywhere USA.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.709
My travels made me
a student of life.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.120
Somehow that path led
me to a crossroads,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.900
and at the end of that
road acting cornered me.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.180
She seduced me.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.844
For an anxious young
man, it finally

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:37.760
allowed me to be anything
that I wanted to be.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.510
The wanderlust gave way
to direction and purpose.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.646
I could be a barbarian
or a bartender.

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:54.250
I could be a savage [INAUDIBLE]
or the King of Atlantis.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.742
19 years I've been doing this.

00:04:57.742 --> 00:04:58.610
I'm an actor.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.750
I'm a director.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.184
I write and I produce.

00:05:04.184 --> 00:05:07.551
I found my path.

00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:08.994
I'm a craftsman.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.270
My craft is storytelling.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.950
And then it happened.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:24.630
She came, my muse, the love of
my life, my partner in crime.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.720
I fell stupid, crazy,
madly in love with her.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.720
My wife gave me three
beautiful, feral kids--

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.050
Zozo-Bear, Lola-Bear,
my lovey, and the Wolf.

00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:44.511
And with them, my dreams
finally came true.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.280
I'm a father.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.703
I found my place, my home.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.842
And like any father,
we want our children

00:05:56.842 --> 00:05:58.050
to see us doing what we love.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.690
But now, my passion
for storytelling

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.800
pulls me away for
long periods of time.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.900
And that scares me.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.050
The nomadic lifestyle
that once inspired me now

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.065
takes me away from the
things that I love most.

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:19.021
My [INAUDIBLE], my family.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.970
I'm afraid of what
I'm going to miss--

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.896
the laughs, the cries, being
able to help them, teach them.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.980
I don't want to
miss those moments.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.056
If I think about it, I only have
five more years, five summers,

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:43.920
and I'm not the center
of their universe.

00:06:50.596 --> 00:06:51.970
I decided to
surround my children

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.770
with who I am, with music,
painting, all my art forms.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.490
Because if I teach
them to skate,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.090
then they can surf or snowboard.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.565
Ultimate balance, bold
and brave in any terrain.

00:07:09.565 --> 00:07:12.848
And if I teach
them to climb, then

00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:15.470
they can push themselves
to the limits,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:25.260
gracefully move
through fear and doubt,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.190
to learn respect for
our natural resources.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.850
Because if they can admire
nature's truest colors,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.790
they can begin to see
the beauty in all things,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.260
to be aware of
those inconspicuous

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.890
and overlooked details of life.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.960
I want to give them my eyes.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.697
They will know art.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.280
They'll paint.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.430
They'll sculpt.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.293
They'll understand light and
darkness and composition,

00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:54.716
find their soul, and that's
where the music lies, the soul.

00:07:54.716 --> 00:07:58.250
I teach them to play because if
they can play, they can sing.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.475
And if they can sing,
then they can dance.

00:08:00.475 --> 00:08:03.385
And when you dance,
you celebrate.

00:08:03.385 --> 00:08:07.265
It is all connected.

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:13.085
And these lessons will teach
them expression of self.

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:16.410
And if I build it,
then I can teach them

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:23.760
hard work, dedication,
integrity, and moral code.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.690
Now every time my
children play, they

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.616
can feel that their papa
is always with them.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.039
Since the moment I left my
mother's house to the moment

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.679
that I built a
home with my wife,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.650
from the ultimate highs to
the lows that brought me

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:51.420
to my knees, there has been one
constant, something that stayed

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.430
with me through all of this.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:01.270
Like a home on the road, a
comfort disguised as armor.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.770
I see it every time
that I look down

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:10.490
at these tattered, old
pants in my battlefield.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:17.330
From the paint to the stitches,
every scratch, ding, laugh,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.200
and cry is recorded
in these pants.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.150
Every mark is a memory.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.560
Every tear adds up to the
life I always wanted to live.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.750
Everything I am
is in these pants,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.458
and there will come a
day when I'll be gone.

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:43.745
And my children and
my grandchildren,

00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:47.560
they will find these beat up
old Carhartts in a dusty corner

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.140
somewhere.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.830
And they will know this
is the canvas of my life.

00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:02.080
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.300
TONY AMBROZA: That's a
story that was authentically

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.280
inspired by the fact
that he absolutely

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.940
lives in those pants.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.050
And all the time, he's wanted
to tell a story about them,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.240
and it morphed through the
relationship we had with him

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.220
into being really a story
about the legacy he wants

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.620
to leave for his kids,
the idea that he doesn't

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.040
want his kids to just know
him as this crazy actor

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.300
and superhero.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.415
He wants to teach them
the responsibility.

00:10:30.415 --> 00:10:33.449
He wants to teach them to
enjoy making and creating.

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:35.740
He doesn't want them to grow
up in this crazy Hollywood

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.100
bubble, where they're out
of touch with reality.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.874
And the coolest part
of all was he gave us

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:43.540
the opportunity and
the platform to tell

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.970
a story that our
consumer has been sending

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.940
to Carhartt for over 100 years.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.920
We have pants, bibs,
coats framed on our walls

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.140
with letters written
by the people

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.680
who say often that they had
to return it to the maker

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.920
because they couldn't
dare to throw it away.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.930
And usually it's
because the wife

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.770
forced them to get rid of
it along the way as well.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.550
And so it was awesome to have
a partner in Jason Momoa, who

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.980
could authentically
tell the story, which

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.790
is a story that our hardworking
consumers have been telling

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.380
for generations.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.350
And being that we're
a family-run business,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.465
founded by a person by the name
of Hamilton Carhartt in 1889

00:11:28.465 --> 00:11:30.590
here in Michigan-- for
those of you who don't know,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.070
we are local--

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.095
it's a pretty
powerful opportunity

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:38.470
to be a part of a company
that's still owned and operated

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.420
by the founding family.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.230
And we still are guided
by this man's principles

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.680
and his vision and his beliefs.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.410
Long before anybody
ever really focused

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.190
on the story behind the
garment, he was telling it.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.110
Now it's commonplace.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.180
Everybody wants to
know the deeper story.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.000
They want to see the whole
story behind the brand

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.290
they believe in.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.230
While he was communicating and
sharing this point of view,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.920
when, for instance, child labor
was a big issue in the clothing

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.410
industry, he was taking
a stand against it.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.260
He was making product
up to a standard

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.590
for people who did blue
collar trades and work, who

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:22.180
traditionally wore rags that
were stitched together and sewn

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.130
by wives or mothers.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.950
He said, there's got
to be a better garment.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.170
There has to be a
better way to make it.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.870
These people should have
hard, rugged clothing

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.740
that works for the job.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.550
So long before we had
this cool athleisure trend

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.370
where everybody's
running around in Nike

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.100
or Under Armour or Lululemon
or any other brand,

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.910
he was making purpose-built
product for folks

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.780
that most people have
ignored for decades.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.180
He cared when others didn't.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.080
And these are still the
values that we live by today.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.590
A lot of these values,
people are like, well,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.400
sounds like a
millennial mindset study

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.620
that somebody had to
come up with, right?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.050
And I just laugh about
it, because whenever I'm

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.180
in those meetings I'm like--

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.210
because I'm an X'er.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.640
I don't know if there
are any X'ers in here.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.140
Probably most folks
are millennials.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.640
Oh, a few.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.290
Thank you.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.140
It's good to see a few
X'ers, because we're

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.920
the forgotten generation
or the skipped over one.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.040
You've got the big boomers
and the big millennials.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.860
But I always am like--

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.600
I'm kind of mad.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.050
They are like,
well, millennials,

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.133
they love authentic brand.

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:32.350
I'm like, did X'ers-- were
we all about fake ones?

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.260
Like, why is this
such a big insight?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.570
I don't get it.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.440
But this is our founder,
Hamilton Carhartt.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.210
And we still see it now today.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.950
I mean, these are pictures
people send to us.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.672
I have had the great
pleasure to learn and work

00:13:48.672 --> 00:13:51.130
with really smart people at
big brands that a lot of people

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.150
really want to talk about
all the time on the news.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.600
I didn't get things like this--

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.580
never.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.960
I mean, never.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.970
I can guarantee you.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.280
And when their sneakers wore
out or their base layers started

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.060
get stinky, like everybody knows
that polyester stuff can do,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.950
they didn't mail it
back to us unless they

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.780
wanted a replacement.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.700
And that's what we have
here, which is incredible.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.940
In building off of what you
just saw from Jason Momoa--

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.650
I mean, this is
one of the letters.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.300
I always like to bring this one
out, because those overalls--

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.790
I mean, this is
one stingy farmer.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.010
But if any of you ever grew
up in a farming family,

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.650
you recognize the value
of money and their ability

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.930
to make something last.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.062
And if you can't
read the fine print,

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:36.520
the simple story
here is these bibs

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.050
outlived his wife, who
mended them for years.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.890
They outlived his
neighbor who decided

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.559
to start mending them for him.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:45.100
So he finally was
like, well, I guess

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.190
I got to send them back and
get some new ones finally.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.130
But it's just that
incredible relationship

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.740
that happens with
people and the product

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.990
that they wear because of
all the things they do in it.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.060
And this has guided
us on a mission

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.430
that that really is still a
continuation of our founder

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.720
Hamilton, with
Mark Valade, who's

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.740
the fourth generation family
member and CEO still today.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.240
And that is, "We exist to create
and build enduring products

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.210
to serve and protect
hardworking people."

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.970
Now, probably a
few people, though,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.680
like Simon Sinek readers
or viewers or protagonists,

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.780
antagonists, I'm sure,
somewhere along the line--

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.530
but if you think
about it, it is rooted

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.300
in a simple why
for Carhartt that

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.944
was started with Hamilton, which
is the belief in hard work.

00:15:34.944 --> 00:15:37.690
Hamilton Carhartt had
a quote, and I have

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.820
to read it from my notes here.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.410
"Work is a thing--
good, earnest,

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.300
honest hard work in
the right direction,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.990
everlastingly, persistently,
continuously work.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.932
Making good is merely a matter
of exerting sufficient energy."

00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:53.140
Certainly the prose of the
day was a little different

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.800
than what we have today,
but the simple fact is this.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.670
He appreciated hard work, and
that's what we still do today.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.630
And it doesn't have to be
in the form of somebody

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.420
swinging a giant pick axe
or sledge hammer for us

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.380
to appreciate it as well.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.820
We appreciate the hard
work of a Jason Momoa

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.840
and the lifestyle he leads.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.950
And that's who we invite into
this brand for the values

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.150
we stand for.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.680
So I often hear
how this brand is

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.470
being embraced by
folks who typically

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.440
wouldn't be seen wearing it
over the last five or six years.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.460
That's great.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.220
That's really good, but
we're not changing our values

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.690
and we're not changing
who we are all about.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.890
But we're certainly willing
to open up the umbrella

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.600
as we share the story of
what Carhartt stands for.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.671
Now, why has all this happened?

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.920
I mean, some folks have asked
over the last few years.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.600
You start to see
Carhartt more and more.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.016
Well, some of it is we have
great partners like, downtown,

00:16:49.016 --> 00:16:51.220
Home and garden who sold
a beautiful dog chore

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.280
coat down there that's
probably being worn.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.650
It's nice to have partners,
because your retailers are

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.170
a big part of this story.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.270
When I had the opportunity
to come back home--

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.040
I grew up in the Midwest.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.920
I grew up in Ohio,
two hours away.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.950
Big fan of the Lions, the
Tigers, and the Red Wings.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.400
And my grandfathers
were blue collar.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.760
They worked in
industry, machine shops.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.480
They wore bibs.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.920
They had the metal lunch pails.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.150
I'll never forget that.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.700
My parents were the first
generation in their family

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.349
to actually get
a college degree,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.387
and like most families of the
day, they went into teaching.

00:17:26.387 --> 00:17:27.970
Because that was
really the profession

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.850
that they knew to
pursue afterwards.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.200
And I grew up with this.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.314
I did construction jobs.

00:17:33.314 --> 00:17:35.230
And so the opportunity
to be a part of a brand

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.390
like this was amazing.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.580
But the first
thing we did was we

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.250
were like, we have to spend
time with our consumer.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.420
Who are these people?

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.732
What makes them special?

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.190
Because I went from having an
opportunity to sell something

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.320
that more people seemed
to want to fight about--

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.710
outside of politics, but
I'm not touching that now--

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.650
and that is your
favorite sports team.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.780
Living in Ann
Arbor, there's a lot

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.840
of conversation around
that at the college level.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.390
If you're in Europe,
try arguing over

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.890
your favorite football club or
soccer club, as you may know.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.740
There are families that
are divided and never

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.860
talk to each other again
because of these feuds.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.730
That's a passion.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.100
For work, that's a four letter
word that most people are

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.910
happy to forget about the
moment they're done with it.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.090
So it's hard to
market and inspire

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.499
through that, unless you really
understand why they do it.

00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:31.040
And that's what we found was,
wow, they have stories to tell.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.531
They have a lot of stories to
tell-- really interesting ones.

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.280
And what we started
to learn more and more

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.250
is they believe in this
notion that by working,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.650
you earn the ability
to build a better life.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.160
They believe that making
something with your hands

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.710
is far greater than
sitting in a room,

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.820
like I'm sitting in today.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.030
Because what I get to say I made
today was a really neat keynote

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.870
presentation that hopefully
kept you awake for an hour.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.660
So that's what I'll
tell my kids today

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.080
when I see them this evening.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.490
What did you do today, dad?

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:01.870
Well, that's what I did today.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.850
What they value is the ability
to say at the end of their day,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.660
they made something or
they made many things.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.940
Or they built a building,
and that building

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.120
will forever be something
they can identify with.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.212
And we heard that
over and over again.

00:19:15.212 --> 00:19:16.170
They like to make beer.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.920
Thank God they do.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.570
I love craft beer, and I
love being in Michigan.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.520
But that's somebody
who's a maker,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.670
and we appreciate those folks.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.200
And we recognize
something early on, too.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.540
They said something
that I immediately

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.150
just kind of jumped out of
my seat when I heard that.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.640
They think with their hands.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.290
So in a company
like Google, it's

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.180
interesting to share
that perspective,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.460
because some of the
brightest minds on the planet

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.677
all work at Google.

00:19:40.677 --> 00:19:42.010
I hear about it from my friends.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.810
I went to college
in New York City.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.840
Investment banks were scooping
up all the mines then.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.120
Now my buddy who is a
partner at B of A says,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.090
yeah, Google takes
all the best ones now.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.710
And it's true.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.360
But imagine, though,
how good are your hands?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.970
Mine aren't that good.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.890
My hands can't really
make very much.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.200
They know how to type.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.000
They're pretty good at that.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.680
My wife will remind
you of all the jobs

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.424
that I try to take on at home
and how poorly I do with those.

00:20:08.424 --> 00:20:10.840
And then I give up, and I hire
somebody who actually knows

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.490
how to think with their hands.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.740
But it's an appreciation
for that fact,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.800
and that's a powerful
appreciation.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.600
And we spent a lot
of time with them.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.150
We have a team right now
who's been on the road,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.730
God bless them,
for over 25 days,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.170
shooting and capturing film
and photography and story

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.540
after story that
we're going to bring

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.730
to life this fall in "Holiday."

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.620
They were just in
the upper peninsula

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.940
with "Outside" magazine.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.560
Because what we
found is if you're

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.500
a brand that actually tells
really interesting stories,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.960
you don't have to
pay to tell them.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.960
That was the whole
Jason Momoa film.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.120
We're over 70 million
impressions and growing,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.460
and that 8 and 1/2 minute
film blew away all the rules.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.640
But let me tell you, he
was not going to change it.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.231
You can negotiate with
Khal Drago all you want.

00:20:57.231 --> 00:20:57.730
We didn't.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.900
And the view rate is crazy.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.900
Full view rate is crazy.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.316
And you guys, I know, can run
all of the stats on YouTube,

00:21:05.316 --> 00:21:07.450
but we ran it across
all platforms, too.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.730
But you would see
it's breaking rules.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.000
When you have an interesting,
real, meaningful story,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.320
people want to cover it.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.000
Editors want to write about it.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.450
So we're up there with
"Outside" magazine in the U.P.,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:26.770
telling stories about some of
the ski mountains up in that--

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:32.110
what is it-- the horn of
the U.P. Pretty amazing

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.430
when you can do that.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.680
But it's how you break
through, because we

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.410
don't have a Ford Motor
Company budget when

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.390
it comes to advertising.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.630
So our goal is we need to
tell stories that are actually

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.670
interesting and inspiring--
not that they don't.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.270
But we really have
to break through.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.890
So we spent a lot
of time with them.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.840
We start to understand
their personas.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.180
And we've understood one
thing loud and clear,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.230
that the Carhartt isn't just
an outdoor outerwear brand

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.270
that you wear when it's cold.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.230
It epitomizes an outdoor
orientation towards life

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.685
that's year round.

00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:07.810
They don't just go outside.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.370
We don't just go outside when
it's cold out with Carhartt.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.960
We go outside all year long.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.420
And it's not just for men,
contrary to popular belief.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.640
But we have a long
way to go, because we

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.590
have hundred and some
years being for men,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.340
even though through the years we
outfitted Rosie the Riveter, lo

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.820
and behold.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.930
And we've done things
with women historically.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.079
We've had a women's
line now for about--

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:32.620
I've got a few folks
here from work--

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.411
10 years?

00:22:33.411 --> 00:22:33.910
Lindy?

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.589
AUDIENCE: 2007.

00:22:34.589 --> 00:22:35.380
TONY AMBROZA: 2007.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.480
So 10 years.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.146
10 years.

00:22:37.146 --> 00:22:38.770
And we're going to
be celebrating women

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.140
in a slightly bigger
way this year.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.930
We've got a few interesting
stories we want to tell,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.730
and we're going to
bring those to life.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.520
Because we always hear after
every video or commercial we

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.230
run or piece of advertising
from a lot of women who say,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.600
hey, I'm a welder.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.030
Why won't you tell my story?

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:03.620
I work just as hard,
and I do a better job.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.430
And we're like, we're not
here to say you don't.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.360
Our problem is, first and
foremost with women's product,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.480
it's not readily available
outside of a few destinations

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.460
online and a few stores
brick and mortar.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.140
So thank God for Google, because
you can help them find us now.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.110
And that's one of the
big opportunities.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.700
A lot of people
keep saying, too,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.908
what are you doing around
the millennial, millennial,

00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:28.210
millennials?

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.060
What are we doing?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.270
We're just being who
we are, and we're

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.150
celebrating craft
and making and doing,

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.050
which just happens to coincide
with what that mindset cares

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.240
about.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.580
And that's what we're doing,
but we're being who we are.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.190
We're not trying to
be a different company

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.250
by any stretch.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.130
We also have a fantastically
growing opportunity

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.730
with the Hispanic
consumer and their growing

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.030
presence in America
and how that's

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.829
changing the face of hard work.

00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:02.120
We're not here to be exclusive.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.750
Hard work is hard
work, and that's

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.532
what we're for, no matter what
the rules of engagement are.

00:24:07.532 --> 00:24:09.240
And that's something
that we are spending

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.480
more and more time, better
understanding, and building

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.490
upon as well.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.230
But we also know it can't be
just about work all the time.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.400
If there's one thing that
we like to joke about,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.830
it is beer, barbecues,
beef, and buddies--

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.470
the four B's, the
post-work activities--

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.850
and really capturing
that in their lives.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.170
So we spent a lot of time,
and we've got personas.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.250
We can sit down with your team,
but I know your team has them.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.440
We have four personas
that we really

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.870
focus on and build around,
and those are the four

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.500
we think about all the time.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.600
Because like our
founder, we believe

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.040
in a legacy of hard work.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.050
And really, we're embracing
this to get people to recognize

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.230
that we're not just
for the person who

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.550
swings the sledgehammer.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.340
So all of you are going
to have a nice A18.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.830
But the idea here is
you shouldn't feel, oh,

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.350
I'm not really like--

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.090
I'm not the Carhartt
guy or girl.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.520
Well, you can be.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.440
Depends on your mindset.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.660
Quite honestly, it really does.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:23.130
And that's what we're shifting
a little bit, not just

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.680
that brand that makes workwear.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.320
It's the brand that
stands for hard work

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.910
and hardworking people.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.510
It's a little shift,
not a big one.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.020
And then how do you make work
interesting and cool and fun?

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.260
We go to really interesting
places, rugged corners

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.300
of the earth, we
call them, where

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.910
folks rely on Carhartt
to get the job done

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.770
and sometimes survive.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.620
Makes work a little more
heroic, more interesting,

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.110
but we also spent a lot of time
with them camping, fishing,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.760
and hiking and hunting.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.880
Because we know that that
is an absolute passion

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.149
place for them
throughout the year.

00:25:59.149 --> 00:26:01.440
But when we think about these
activities, like hunting,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.547
for instance, it's not about--

00:26:04.547 --> 00:26:06.630
a lot of people, it's like
the trophy on the wall.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.670
That's not what we
hear all the time.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.840
It's not it at all.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.310
It's the time you get to
spend with family and friends

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.770
and the traditions
that are created,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.130
and that's what makes
it so meaningful.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.930
And that's what makes it
exciting for folks, who really

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.730
understand that, again,
it's not about the trophy;

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.920
it's about the experience.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.562
And there's another buzz word.

00:26:33.562 --> 00:26:35.520
We're in the experience
economy, and everyone's

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.179
spending money on experiences.

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:38.220
And you see all of these.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.340
It's like, ding, ding, ding,
business buzzword bingo.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.682
But in the end, we're
experience-based brand,

00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:47.640
because our product is
purpose-built for people

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.165
who do things.

00:26:49.165 --> 00:26:51.540
They don't sit on couches and
watch the Discovery Channel

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.150
to dream about a lifestyle.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.932
They live that lifestyle.

00:26:55.932 --> 00:26:57.390
And I guess the
goal is, how can we

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.376
inspire others to do the same?

00:26:59.376 --> 00:27:00.750
You may be a
weekend warrior now.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.650
Great.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:02.910
Pick up a hobby.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.800
Pick up a craft.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.560
That would be success
for us if we're

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.920
able to do that as a brand.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.530
Because we know, too,
that sometimes the best

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.990
meals aren't in a restaurant.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.100
Get outside.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.690
Enjoy it.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.810
This is actually a guy from--
he's the chef and owner

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:25.260
of the Grange restaurant, if
you know Brandon here locally.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.997
Great guy, great
partner, farm to table.

00:27:27.997 --> 00:27:29.830
We love to work with
him on a lot of things.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.160
We do a lot of things
locally with friends

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.320
that we've built up and
developed relationships

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.680
with through work
and gotten to know.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.650
So how do we outwork them all?

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.720
In a simple sense,
we start with you've

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.300
got to have empathy
for one key area.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.720
You have to remember.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.190
Typical household income
of that core demographic,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.870
not the broader
sense but the core,

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.900
is about $55,000 to $60,000.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.687
So credit card limits?
$1,000, maybe $2,000.

00:28:01.687 --> 00:28:03.270
So one of the things
that we focus on,

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.770
because I'm responsible for our
direct to consumer business,

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.170
too--

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.670
my gosh, if they
have a return, they

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.070
need that return
credited quickly.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:17.340
$150 order is a lot, and it
matters and they value it.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.660
They value those dollars.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.745
To get them to spend
$150 on Carhartt

00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:23.370
traditionally ends
up being a Christmas

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.210
purchase or a birthday purchase
or something else significant.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.300
You have to empathize with that.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.050
You have to remember
that farmer we talked

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.530
about and the frugality
of it and really, really

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.730
understand, then, that if
they're going to do it,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.940
you live up to it and you
deliver on that promise.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.040
And if we fail for some
reason with our product,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.970
we always, always take
it back, and we always

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.030
make good on that promise.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.550
We absolutely believe in
inspiring a way of life.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.340
It's what we live for.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.070
That's one of the things that
makes this job so awesome,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.591
is because we can do that.

00:28:57.591 --> 00:28:59.840
And we have an owner who
believes in that way of life.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.200
His family's believed
in it since the founder.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.210
And we look at it
through their passions

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.370
and live it through
their passions

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.560
all the time with emotional,
authentic, original stories.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.170
And people always go, why?

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.820
Well, there's a
part of your brain

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.720
that causes people
to love people.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.190
It also causes you to love
that dog and love brands,

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.810
and the best brands get that.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.920
You can't explain that, though,
with a spreadsheet sometimes

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.900
in meetings, outside
of some studies that

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.620
talk about people and
their connectedness

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.940
or their love of brand.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.829
So you can do that.

00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:34.370
And what they found
through the years

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.710
is that that has the
closest correlation

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.320
to revenue over loyalty.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.300
Your love of a brand
has a higher correlation

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.900
to revenue than loyalty,
and it means something.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.110
And it's important
in this day and age.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.860
And so that's one of
the reasons we really

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.224
focus on that, because we
also want to be top of mind.

00:29:52.224 --> 00:29:53.390
How do I remain top of mind?

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.980
Because I've seen
all your stats.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.120
It drives me nuts.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.640
Most Google searches don't
start with a brand in mind.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.650
It's like, oh, God.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.354
So they just do coats?

00:30:02.354 --> 00:30:03.020
That's horrible.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.075
I want you to do Carhartt coats.

00:30:07.075 --> 00:30:08.450
Because if you
look at coats, you

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.780
might see a better deal
from somebody else,

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.040
but that happens.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.010
So you have to be emotionally
engaged and connected,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.790
and we have to broaden our
reach in order to do that.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.380
So build trust and loyalty.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.470
These are our three
newest consumer profiles

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.490
we've identified today--

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.690
Chris, who has that millennial
mindset, working in the trades,

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.850
typically learning
their way through;

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.950
Samantha, more of an X'er on
the female end of the spectrum;

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.810
and then David Garcia,
Hispanic profile,

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.930
English-speaking, second
generation, living basically

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.560
an All-American style of
life, but certainly very,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.210
very tied to the traditions
of where he and his family

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.080
come from.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.430
So those are the three new ones.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.880
Then we have a Mike consumer
that we identify with,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.000
and he's the
traditional over-45 guy

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.164
that most people
recognize with Carhartt.

00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:03.830
So along the way,
we're not saying we're

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.270
ignoring him by any stretch.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.311
He's the most loyal,
spending the most right now,

00:31:07.311 --> 00:31:08.960
because he has the
most money to spend.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.940
But what we are seeing is as
we shift our messaging in reach

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.020
and target, we're going after
these folks first and foremost.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.730
Mike continues to overhear it,
and he's not seeing anything

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.610
with this brand that would freak
him out, until, wait a minute,

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.818
what happened to my Carhartt?

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.020
You guys really
help us with this.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.280
We have a saying, "Are
we doing everything

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.120
possible to make it easy
for hardworking people

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.640
to choose Carhartt?"

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.830
So that's what
guides our actions.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.010
That's what guides our
effort, and our goal

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.450
is to do that all year long.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.280
We have a big challenge, though.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.470
We do not sell our
product in the number

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.110
one places they like to
shop, outside of one,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.290
which is a competitor of
yours, Amazon, slightly.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.600
That is the only place we are.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.930
That is a dominant destination
for shoppers today,

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.760
and they're just
building apparel

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.860
as a destination
choice for them.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.820
We're not in Wal-Mart.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.850
We're not in Target.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.250
We're not in Kohl's.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.120
We're not JC Penney
and Sears, thank God.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.310
You can delete that later.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.460
But we're not in these places
where the bulk of our clothing

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.300
is bought.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.830
All the studies tell us that.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.080
Those are purposeful
choices that we make--

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.670
not because we want
to make our life

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.366
difficult for the consumer,
but because of the way

00:32:28.366 --> 00:32:30.740
we believe in running our
business and running the brand.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.340
And they just don't match
up with our beliefs today.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.040
So what that means is we're
not always easy and accessible.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.520
And in a
convenience-driven world--

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.870
I was just saying
this the other day,

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.530
and I mentioned it at lunch.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.400
We're in an age of
brands, because retailers

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.477
are going through an
incredibly difficult time.

00:32:49.477 --> 00:32:51.560
For those of you working
with retailers right now,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.300
they are really challenged.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.079
If you have not invested
in the web, it's too late.

00:32:57.079 --> 00:32:59.120
And you probably don't
have the capital to do it,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.650
because it's all sunk
in a bunch of stores

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:01.880
that are underperforming.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.214
And so you have to figure out
how to get out of those stores.

00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:07.130
And we've had meetings
with some retailers who

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.117
will go unnamed who
are very longstanding

00:33:10.117 --> 00:33:11.825
partners of ours, who
have been like, you

00:33:11.825 --> 00:33:14.140
know this internet thing?

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.770
I just still can't
figure it out.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.107
And literally that's what's
come out of their mouth.

00:33:18.107 --> 00:33:19.190
And you just look at them.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.910
You go, oh, God.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.360
I don't know what to tell
you other than you are not

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.670
on the radar of the
next generation.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.400
You may have your current,
but the next generation

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.460
doesn't even know you exist.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.310
Because you're not a
part of that journey.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.520
And unfortunately, it's
too many retailers,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.444
and they don't even
know where to start.

00:33:42.444 --> 00:33:44.360
So if there's ever an
opportunity for business

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.520
for you guys, it's
figuring that out for them,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.190
because they can't do it.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:49.370
They flat out can't.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.260
And we need them to by and
large, because ultimately it

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.570
will define how many
square feet per person

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.150
we have from a
retail perspective

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.590
and whether or not the 20--

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.620
I think we're at, like, 20 and
the UK and Europe is at, like,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.520
five.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.480
So we forex every
other country when

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.610
it comes to how much retail
we have dedicated per person.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.460
We've over-retailed
this country,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.067
so it's going to decline.

00:34:17.067 --> 00:34:19.650
But we would still like there
to be some retail stores around,

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.270
please.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.059
70% of people still say they'd
rather buy clothing in a store,

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:25.350
because they like to try it on.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.699
They like to feel it.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.949
They like to make sure that
fit is what it says it is.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.073
They don't want to deal
with the hassle of returns.

00:34:31.073 --> 00:34:33.210
Number one complaint
still with our consumer--

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:33.921
what a nightmare.

00:34:33.921 --> 00:34:36.420
And what's odd is rather than
return it to us, a lot of them

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.753
say they'd rather just sell
it on Craigslist or on eBay.

00:34:38.753 --> 00:34:41.020
And I'm like, you
still have to ship it.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:41.940
You know?

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.080
But that's what they say.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.460
I don't know why.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.500
So that's one of our
key areas of focus,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.210
because we really
believe in this idea

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.060
that we are out of the
disruptor phase of marketing.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.500
It is not about disrupting.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.324
It's about enabling.

00:34:57.324 --> 00:34:58.740
How are we enabling
and empowering

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.930
that path to purchase?

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.230
And again, you guys play
a big, big part in this.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.110
And that's the focus
all the time as a team,

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.450
over and over again.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.520
Because it's a challenge
inside our walls.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.675
We have too many silos.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.800
Every single day within
marketing and other worlds,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.080
it's like, guys, this is not
about us; this is about them.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.610
And we are in service
to their journey.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.114
We're in service to their
ability to choose us,

00:35:23.114 --> 00:35:25.530
because that's what's going
to keep the lights on and keep

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.250
the legacy alive for the fifth
generation of Carhartt that's

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.564
already in the business,
learning the business today.

00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:33.480
We have all three kids
working in the business

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.222
right now, which is awesome.

00:35:36.222 --> 00:35:38.430
And we're always measuring
and we're always learning,

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.020
and we're always looking
at it again and again

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.440
and say, how can we get better.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.150
What else can we get
out of their way?

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.090
What else is getting
in there blocking them

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.950
from making the right choice?

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.960
And you guys, again, provide a
lot of great metrics on this.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.460
Traditionally, I've
always enjoyed--

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.420
and I'm just going
to make one plug--

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.430
I haven't seen the Q4 results.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.360
Are those in yet?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.300
Because I always love the
Q4 graph that shows search

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.270
and how we did and what's
going on, because that

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.750
gives us an idea.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.780
AUDIENCE: They do.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.890
TONY AMBROZA: Beautiful.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.990
So we're always measuring.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.904
So another video to kind of wrap
this all up for you guys here,

00:36:13.904 --> 00:36:15.570
and then I've got
just a quick breakdown

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.190
of how we look at things from
a media perspective as well.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.684
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:19.684 --> 00:36:23.170
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:54.802 --> 00:37:56.935
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:56.935 --> 00:37:57.560
Quick overview.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.268
So just to let you
know what we're up to,

00:37:59.268 --> 00:38:01.820
we're going to continue a
story we started last year,

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.940
which is celebrating the
future through our heritage

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.790
and our founder and
his guiding principles.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:07.790
We're in it a long time.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.950
We've been making new
products, introducing

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.049
a lot more products.

00:38:11.049 --> 00:38:12.590
We're overcoming
the stigma that used

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.380
to be that a new product from
Carhartt was a new color.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.290
So, no, we're launching
a lot of new products,

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.480
because we really want to
be around and relevant.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.130
And we're committed
and dedicated

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.650
to making that happen,
so that folks just

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.950
don't reach for their Carhartt
when the mercury drops.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.960
We want to be that
year-round brand.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.860
And I'm just showing this to say
we are dedicated from a brand

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.660
calendar.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.420
We're constantly executing
content, storytelling,

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.380
and messaging to be relevant
and top of mind as often

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:48.350
as our dollar will allow us to
be across multiple channels.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.020
And we break it
down in three ways,

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.510
and we do this because my
paid bucket is not big enough

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.520
to do it any other way.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.410
My owned and earned are just
as important to us as our paid,

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.330
and so that's how we
think about things.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.140
Because I cannot beat the
competition by just outspending

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.730
the competition.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.510
And really, the team is
really focused on this.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.260
So in the own bucket,
just a few examples.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.277
Our website-- we look at this
as the front door to the brand.

00:39:15.277 --> 00:39:16.860
And we have a lot
of work to do still,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.220
but we've made tremendous
progress over the last three

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.030
years.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.170
I see the doggone Google
speed analysis you send to us.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.960
I know it.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.380
We're meeting with our agencies.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.130
We want to make it
faster for mobile.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.640
We know for 3G it's too slow.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.110
So we get it.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.910
An my CIO, though, says,
we just need an app.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.030
I'm like, OK, we
need an app, but what

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.910
about for all the other people
who don't want to have the app?

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.920
So we're working on it.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.170
We launched our store, our
flagship store, in Detroit.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.961
Everyone said, what on
earth were you doing

00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:48.810
putting a store in Midtown?

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.440
We look kind of
smart now, thank God.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.510
I mean, it's doing
really, really well.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.610
We have a nice billboard
there on the side,

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.290
and it does a great
job of letting

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.870
people know that we're there
in Detroit and a lot of pride.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.060
And it's been in
a lot of videos,

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.390
really commemorating their
pride and return of Detroit.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.925
And that's the interior
as you walk in.

00:40:06.925 --> 00:40:08.750
We view that as own, though.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.850
Every person who walks
in the retail stores we

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.460
own and operate is having
a Carhartt experience

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.200
we directly deliver.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.690
That is a powerful
owned opportunity just

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.192
from a marketing standpoint,
let alone a selling standpoint.

00:40:20.192 --> 00:40:22.400
If we leave them with a
great experience of the brand

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.822
and the types of people that
work there, that's a win.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.780
Now, granted, we'd like
them to buy stuff, too,

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.400
because we need
to pay the bills.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.140
But every person
who walks through

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.420
gets a better sense
of who we are.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.720
They recognize that we're not
just brown duck bibs and coats.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.860
They're like, oh, my God,
we hear it all the time.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.350
Wow, this is Carhartt?

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.510
You make all this stuff?

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.760
We're like, yeah, we do.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.834
Men's Journal.

00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:48.250
And really what
we're looking at--

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.027
I think I skipped a slide.

00:40:50.027 --> 00:40:51.360
Well, I'm going to skip forward.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.500
Earned.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.280
There we go.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.720
I'll go back and forth.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.260
We launched a beer to celebrate
our 125th with New Holland

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.834
on the west side of the state.

00:40:59.834 --> 00:41:01.750
Men's Journal said,
that's a really cool idea,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.779
we'd like to cover it.

00:41:02.779 --> 00:41:05.070
So we did a tour all the way
to the Great American Beer

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.100
Festival in Denver, and we
had a pint with consumers

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.707
in every town along the way and
brought their stories to life.

00:41:11.707 --> 00:41:13.290
And this is really
just a celebration.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:15.740
Hey, what do you do
when you celebrate?

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.500
You drink a beer.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.730
You raise a toast.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.590
Well, that's what
this was meant to do,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.130
and it led to tons and tons of
earned media and impressions

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.380
and storytelling.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.020
I heard there was a sneaker
head in here, maybe one or two.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.200
We did this in collaboration
with Eminem and brand Jordan.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.082
Why did we do it?

00:41:32.082 --> 00:41:33.540
Well, first and
foremost, we did it

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.400
to raise funds for
the Verses project

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.220
that's run by Michigan
State in inner city Detroit,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.780
100% dedicated to
one thing, which

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.840
is what Eminem talked about that
he cares the most about, which

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.940
is the reason he is
where he is today

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.160
is because he actually
went back to school

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.470
and he learned how
to read and write.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:53.530
If he couldn't read and write,
he wouldn't be who he is today.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:57.870
And unfortunately, the
illiteracy rate in Detroit

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.250
is astoundingly high.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.490
And if you can't
read and write, you

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.420
can't get a trades job, which
is what we're focused on, too.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:12.040
So we raised a crazy amount of
money auctioning off 10 pairs.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.220
And it's still one of the
most sought-after sneakers

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.165
right now.

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:17.040
The Jordan brand, we
stay in touch with them.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.456
They're getting
calls all the time

00:42:18.456 --> 00:42:21.410
from famous people who
are dying to get them,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.490
and it just
continues to live on.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.250
But the purpose was,
first and foremost,

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.200
to do a good thing
in our backyard.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.950
And it allowed us to do it
and crazy amounts of coverage.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.400
Another backyard partner, Chevy
Trucks, came to us and said,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.870
you know, we don't know
why we didn't do this,

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.930
like, 25 years ago, but it
would make a lot of sense

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.640
for us to do a
truck with you guys

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.440
and make it the
ultimate work truck.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.952
So this was a showcase truck.

00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:49.410
It was at the auto
show in Detroit.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:50.587
It was in LA.

00:42:50.587 --> 00:42:52.170
It was at a couple
of other big shows,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.840
and it's been a really, really,
really well-received concept

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.565
and idea.

00:42:55.565 --> 00:42:57.690
So we're going to continue
to talk with one another

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.630
and see if we can actually
figure out if this makes sense

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:06.150
for a production run as well to
make the ultimate work truck.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.680
You guys saw this
on the earned side--

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.490
again, collaborations
and partnerships

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.310
to tell meaningful stories.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.480
We're also very
active in movies.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.500
We love it.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.770
This jacket-- the year this
movie came out, sold it out.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.960
Sold that in the
US and in Europe.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.970
Swear to God, that jacket.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:28.140
That jacket hadn't moved
beyond its normal trajectory

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.490
for decades.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.480
This movie comes out?

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.860
Bam.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.920
It's unbelievable.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.370
Just won an Oscar for
"Manchester by the Sea,"

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:43.770
again wearing our jacket
throughout that film.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.220
And then we have a superhero
now, our first superhero.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.560
Everyone know who this is?

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.820
Luke Cage.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.020
Do you know what happened when
this show debuted on Netflix?

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.360
You guys had to laugh about
this, given who you are.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.730
It crashed Netflix.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.021
When this show debuted,
it crashed Netflix.

00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:04.770
We're super excited
about the next season.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:08.640
I guess they're pulling them all
together and some other cast.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.240
My son would tell me what it is.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.260
But he's going to be
wearing our new coat, which

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.660
is called Full Swing,
and he continues

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.420
to wear the Carhartt brand.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.026
And then on the
paid front, I had

00:44:20.026 --> 00:44:21.570
to put a plug-in for you guys.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.660
This is from this morning.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.160
Thankfully, Emily,
we're at the top.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.743
That was good.

00:44:26.743 --> 00:44:27.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.310
And I did not click on the ad.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.360
I never do.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.460
Please don't.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.320
I know you guys want
us to, but I don't.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.220
I always tell people at work,
don't click on the top one.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.350
Go down to the one that's free.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.279
Sorry.

00:44:43.279 --> 00:44:45.570
We have enough people that
are clicking on the top one.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.700
It's working really well.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.680
But this is search
and discovery mode.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.930
And for us, this is
one of those signals

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.570
that we love to look
at to see how people

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:56.310
are reacting to our work.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.410
We see that people
will start searching

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.830
us more aggressively if our
work is really resonating.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.450
And let me tell you, I've
got a lot of right brain.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.360
I've got just enough
left brain to survive.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.860
But there are a lot
of left-brainers

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.110
who want to see numbers
when we do stuff

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.170
and go, well, what do they do.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:14.970
I love it when you guys can give
us that kind of information.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.460
Like, oh my God, look
at all the search.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.450
This happened and then
within a week or so--

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.820
it's powerful, so thank you.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.706
Retail-- I talked
about where we are.

00:45:25.706 --> 00:45:26.580
This is where we are.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.220
For example, Field &amp; Stream is
a Dick's Sporting Goods concept

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.380
in the outdoor industry.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.700
I look at this as paid,
and the reason I do is--

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.216
see all that beautiful imagery?

00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:38.340
And this is first and main.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.350
This is right when you
walk in their store.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.789
That's a billboard at
the point of decision.

00:45:42.789 --> 00:45:44.580
So I look at those as
one the most valuable

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.370
spends we can make, because
I'm putting front and center

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.840
at that point of decision,
that zero moment of truth

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.440
that you guys
coined a while ago.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.430
This is Boot Barn.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.500
Have you ever heard
of a Boot Barn?

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.070
Anyone?

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.910
Anyone?

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.480
Oh, my God.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.527
Somebody has.

00:45:58.527 --> 00:46:00.360
But they're now publicly
traded, and they're

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.350
chasing the Western fashion
trend all over the country,

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.220
as well out of Southern
California, believe it or not,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.550
not Texas.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.710
And they are growing rapidly.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.450
Tractor Supply.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.400
Anyone know Tractor Supply?

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.640
Yeah, there we go.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.235
So before I worked
at Carhartt, I

00:46:16.235 --> 00:46:20.400
thought Tractor Supply was where
tractor supplies were sold,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400
I think.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.640
And they still have
to overcome that name,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.250
and they are an invaluable
partner, a great partner.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.630
1,200 or 1,500 doors I
think they're up to now?

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.980
And we're bringing our
brand to life with them

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.806
in new ways, which is awesome.

00:46:34.806 --> 00:46:36.930
Orchard Supply, a hardware
store on the West Coast,

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.280
owned by Lowe's.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.320
They are beautiful.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.240
You'd compare them to
downtown Home and Garden

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.420
if you recognize that local
retailer here as well.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.212
And this is just an
example of how crazy it

00:46:48.212 --> 00:46:49.795
can be with our mom
and pops, and this

00:46:49.795 --> 00:46:51.106
is why they're important to us.

00:46:51.106 --> 00:46:52.230
This is Hartville Hardware.

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.150
It's in central Ohio.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.150
We have somewhere in the
neighborhood of, like, 10,000

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.590
square feet, which is bigger
than some of our retail stores.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.600
We give millions of dollars
to this one hardware store.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.440
We really need them to
figure out the internet.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.330
Again, that's how
important it can be

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.490
for us as we think about this.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.200
And then the trips
to those stores

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.030
have led to this
chain in Europe.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.980
So in Ireland, there's
a hardware chain

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.330
called Woodie's, and we are
scaling shops all over Ireland

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.720
with this hardware chain,
where our brand is really

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.810
new in the workforce space.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:32.120
So that is Carhartt.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.382
So thank you for
staying through it all.

00:47:34.382 --> 00:47:35.366
Appreciate it.

00:47:35.366 --> 00:47:38.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:41.140
BILL CRAWFORD: Thank you.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.690
That was awesome.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.440
I know just being in
Michigan and personally

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.630
living just outside
of Detroit, Carhartt's

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:53.500
been one of those brands that
really in the last-- call it

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.880
five to six years
has kind of come

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.760
into the millennial zeitgeist,
which is kind of a benefit.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.770
But to hear you talk
about the authenticity

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.050
that you're not
necessarily trying

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.380
to do that-- it just
works out because you're

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.849
authentic without having to try.

00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:12.640
TONY AMBROZA: Usually
you're only authentic

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.350
when you're not trying.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.180
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah, that's
a good way to put it.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:15.679
Yeah.

00:48:15.679 --> 00:48:19.070
TONY AMBROZA: No, but we have
an amazing story to tell.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:22.510
We just needed to tell
it, quite honestly,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:24.340
and that's what
we're all focused on.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.173
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah.

00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:27.010
And so you touched
on this a little bit,

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.347
but the decision to put the
store in Midtown Detroit.

00:48:30.347 --> 00:48:31.930
Can you tell me a
little bit about it?

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.960
Sounds like maybe there was
a backstory of some debate.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.130
TONY AMBROZA: Well, there
was definitely debate.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.338
I mean, you got a lot of
Detroiters, proud Detroiters

00:48:38.338 --> 00:48:39.192
in the office.

00:48:39.192 --> 00:48:40.900
People have been there
far longer than I.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.114
And [INAUDIBLE],, who
runs our retail division,

00:48:44.114 --> 00:48:46.030
has been with us now
for, I think, five years,

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.170
and he's been with great retail
brands throughout his career.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.150
He found the space and he
really had the vision for it,

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.840
and he championed
it inside the halls.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.590
Because Midtown-- what was
it, three plus years ago

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:00.969
when we signed the lease?

00:49:00.969 --> 00:49:02.260
Somewhere in that neighborhood.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.070
Midtown was still
kind of emerging.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.380
And now, I mean, we're
seeing more and more

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:13.179
retail brands pop up all around
us, so it's been exciting.

00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:15.720
We couldn't believe how people
really turned out for it, too.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.010
It's doing really well,
far exceeding expectations.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.690
BILL CRAWFORD: No, it's great.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:24.310
My children destroyed it this
weekend, so sorry about that.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.430
So I want to talk a little
bit about your career path.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:28.264
It's been very cool.

00:49:28.264 --> 00:49:29.888
I mean, there's a
lot of people in here

00:49:29.888 --> 00:49:32.170
that work with all
different types of clients,

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.331
but I personally work with a
lot of retailers in the apparel

00:49:35.331 --> 00:49:35.830
space.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.302
So can you take us
through just your career?

00:49:38.302 --> 00:49:39.760
I mean, we covered
it a little bit,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.619
but I'd love to hear about the
path that led you to Carhartt.

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:44.410
TONY AMBROZA: Sure.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.720
I mean, I'll try to be brief.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.270
I can be pretty
boring really quickly.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.000
I just knew that I wanted
to be a part of things

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.934
that people were
passionate about.

00:49:53.934 --> 00:49:55.600
I wanted to work in
the marketing space.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.742
I was an econ, poli
sci double major.

00:49:57.742 --> 00:49:59.700
Most people in my space
didn't go to marketing.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.050
They went and got
investment banking or law.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.300
And I just knew I
wanted to be in a space

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.340
that people really cared about.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.320
My worst nightmare
was trying to convince

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.080
people to buy a
brand or a product

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.580
that you really
didn't care about.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.142
And I have always used
the example of-- not

00:50:14.142 --> 00:50:15.850
to be negative on the
people who do that,

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:20.210
but I would never want to be
the head of a toilet paper brand

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.407
or something like that.

00:50:22.407 --> 00:50:24.490
I always said I wanted to
be something that people

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:25.450
were passionate about.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:30.820
And really, the key insight
for me was, and still is--

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.220
I mean, I'm really
passionate about things

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.690
that are related to the
life I grew up with.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.350
And I grew up very
connected to sport

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.720
and very connected to a
blue collar way of life.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.390
And that's really led my path.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.480
And I had a really great
person, Al Rosenschein,

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.610
who was an alum of
the university college

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:49.810
I went to as an undergrad.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.270
Basically, he gave
me that advice

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:52.510
while I was trying to
figure out what in the heck

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.346
I wanted to do.

00:50:53.346 --> 00:50:55.720
And he said, just follow your
heart, follow your passion.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.000
And that's what I've done
every step of the way,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.220
and I've had a chance to
work for a sports agency,

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.990
representing Bulls
players when they

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.544
made their second run of three.

00:51:03.544 --> 00:51:04.960
I worked for Planet
Hollywood when

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.585
everyone said that
that was going to be

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:08.800
the next concept of experience.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.412
And then I went to
Nike and Under Armour.

00:51:11.412 --> 00:51:13.120
And what I've found
every step of the way

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.890
is it's a heck of
a lot of fun when

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.640
you work for brands people
care a great deal about.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.849
And that's what I have
with Carhartt as well.

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:21.890
BILL CRAWFORD: Very cool.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:27.790
So Nike, Under Armour you've
been to a lot of big cities.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.880
And then obviously, you're in
proximity to your hometown,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.950
but you wind up in Dearborn,
in Carhartt, in Detroit.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.411
How have you found
the fair cities?

00:51:37.411 --> 00:51:38.410
TONY AMBROZA: Oh, great.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.380
I mean, really, it's funny.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.090
So when I moved to
Portland in '99,

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.070
Portland was not the
Portland you see today.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.750
It's unbelievable
how that has changed.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.610
It was pretty rough and rugged.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:53.920
I lived off of Burnside,
and it was just a really,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.220
really kind of-- it was turning,
but it was far from turning.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.887
The Pearl District--
anybody been there?

00:51:58.887 --> 00:52:00.678
You know where the
Pearl District is today?

00:52:00.678 --> 00:52:02.140
It's basically
taken over Portland.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.850
Anyway, so Portland
now is a shining star

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.640
example of a city
reborn, and Baltimore

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.154
was doing the same thing.

00:52:08.154 --> 00:52:09.820
And then I moved here,
and now Detroit--

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.653
I mean, when I moved
here, I'll never forget

00:52:11.653 --> 00:52:12.880
buying a place in Ann Arbor.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.300
And the person we
were getting the loan

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.610
from at the bank was like,
everyone else is leaving;

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.507
why are you moving here?

00:52:20.507 --> 00:52:21.340
And I looked at him.

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.520
I go, well, my
wife's right here.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.353
Thanks a lot, buddy.

00:52:23.353 --> 00:52:24.730
You know what I mean?

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.980
But I mean, it was
just that time.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.680
There was a lot of
unsettled feelings.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.930
And now you walk around,
and there's confidence,

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:35.560
there's pride, there's belief.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.775
And there should be.

00:52:36.775 --> 00:52:37.900
It's a great place to live.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.210
Michigan is one of
the best kept secrets.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.970
If it had a mountain,
we'd be overpopulated

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.230
because of the Great Lakes.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.450
If we had a mountain to
go with those Great Lakes,

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:48.290
it would be over.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.005
It would be over.

00:52:49.005 --> 00:52:50.130
BILL CRAWFORD: That's fair.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:51.629
So what you're
saying is, basically,

00:52:51.629 --> 00:52:54.647
the next city you move to we
should start investing in,

00:52:54.647 --> 00:52:55.730
because that's the better.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:56.150
Got it.

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.275
TONY AMBROZA: There you go.

00:52:57.275 --> 00:52:59.270
BILL CRAWFORD: So we
are almost out of time.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:00.810
I've got one last question.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.610
I know there's a lot of
folks in the audience

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.900
that, as we mentioned,
looked at your career path.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.941
And it's very impressive.

00:53:06.941 --> 00:53:10.580
If you had one piece of
advice to somebody aspiring

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.539
to follow a similar
path to yourself--

00:53:14.539 --> 00:53:16.580
TONY AMBROZA: Well, like
I said at the beginning,

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.790
follow your passion, because
it will never be work.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:20.780
And it hasn't.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.170
And the number two thing
really is find people,

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.330
whether you work
for them or not,

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:29.030
who you can really,
really learn from.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.640
And spend as much time
as you can soaking up

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.900
as much as you can
from those folks,

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.950
because I've had the great,
great fortune of having

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.670
some incredibly smart mentors
from the companies where I've

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:42.740
worked who've taught me a ton.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.320
And I definitely wouldn't
be sitting here right

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.300
now talking to you guys this
way if it weren't for them.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.160
And those are really the
two difference makers for me

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.190
along the way.

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:53.720
Lastly, I shouldn't
leave her out.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.910
My wife has played a pretty
big role in this, too--

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.360
so an incredible
partner in crime

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.300
and being willing to
move the way we have.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:01.455
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah.

00:54:01.455 --> 00:54:03.020
It's funny how that happens.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.869
TONY AMBROZA: Yeah.

00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:04.910
BILL CRAWFORD: Very cool.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:05.993
Thank you very much, Tony.

00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:07.650
I appreciate it.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.490
A big round of applause
for Tony Ambroza.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:10.490
TONY AMBROZA: Thank you.

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.340
BILL CRAWFORD:
Thanks, everybody.
