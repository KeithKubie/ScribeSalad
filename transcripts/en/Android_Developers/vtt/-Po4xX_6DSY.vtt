BRUCE KERR-PETERSON: Hello, my
name is Bruce Kerr-Peterson.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.250
I'm the EMEA lead for
the AdWords platform.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.600
My team and I work with actually
quite a few of you already.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.010
But we work with you on user
acquisition and engagement

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.040
campaigns through AdWords.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.560
So this is all the
paid advertising,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.670
which I'm sure you're
all looking forward to.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.380
So to kick us off, this
is a lightning session.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.950
So I'm going to be covering
a few topics-- maximizing

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.690
your user engagement through our
different channels, retention

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.610
and lifetime value, as well as
data insights and management.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.200
So we did a brief
study of some users

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.550
to ask them what ads prompted
them to download an app.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.360
And not too surprisingly,
50% of the users

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.140
were prompted to download
an app from a search ad.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.940
This is followed by the
middle two, which is basically

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.000
running campaigns on our AdMob
and mobile web channels, so

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.640
display network,
and lastly video ads

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.024
through channels
such as YouTube.

00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:05.940
We know that video has
been traditionally more

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.707
of an awareness
type of campaign.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:09.290
We expect this to
change going forward

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.280
with a few new releases
coming out hopefully

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.970
towards the end of this year.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.320
So let's kick it off.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.480
We're absolutely
delighted with the launch

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.130
of search ads in Play.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.170
We have seen fantastic
results-- although it's

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.910
very early days-- with
increased volume, low CPIs.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.980
And the user quality is
absolutely fantastic.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.920
The campaigns are really
easy to set up as well.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.700
All you have to do is go
into the AdWords interface,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
create a search campaign,
set up with a few keywords--

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840
and if you're stuck for keywords
there's a keyword suggestion

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.420
tool-- and run
Conversion Optimizer.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.270
Conversion Optimizer optimizes
toward the target CPI

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.740
that you choose.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.470
Your ads will then show across
google.com and the Play store,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.512
driving people to
actually install your ads.

00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:56.095
It's a very simple
campaign structure.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:00.270
And the performance, once
again, has been fantastic.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.130
One of our bread
and butter channels

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.610
is acquiring users through
AdMob and mobile web.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.490
We know this has
been performing well.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.660
It's two channels
that really drive

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.520
a lot of volume and reach.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.290
Once again, the set-up is easy.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.530
You upload a few text ads.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.974
We would encourage
you to use video.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:20.223
Video interstitials have a
far higher conversion rate.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:24.540
You target run of network and
allow Conversion Optimizer

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.860
to find the best uses for
you at your target CPI.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.490
And finally, YouTube-- as I
mentioned a few slides back,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.410
YouTube has traditionally been
an awareness type of channel.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.560
However, what we've
seen is that you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.562
can get phenomenal results
and highly engaged users.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.770
And hopefully with the launch
of Conversion Optimizer

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.290
towards the end of
this year, we'll

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.300
be able to scale user
acquisition at a target CPI

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.330
across YouTube,
qualifying the users

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.800
before they download your app.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.910
So if you had to run each of
these channels individually,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.380
this is the standard
campaign structure and set-up

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.640
we would recommend to
be able to maximize

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.260
each one of these channels.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.810
So we would suggest,
firstly, making sure

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.610
your measurement was all set up,
whether that be with an AdWords

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.330
SDK or third party
tracking, and then

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.880
starting off with our two main
networks and channels-- display

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.760
and search.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.040
These two have
performed considerably

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.940
over the past couple of months.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.550
And we're very confident
that they work very well.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.920
So you would start off
with those two campaigns.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.460
You can optimize your
search campaigns in week two

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.500
by adding a few more keywords
once you've got performance.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.240
And once those two
are up and running,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.829
then you can experiment by
running YouTube campaigns,

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.620
trying to get a bit
more incremental reach,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.540
starting with similar
lists to make sure

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.350
that your targeting is tight.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.350
So we understand that
traditional performance

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.830
marketing has been focused
on optimizing each one

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.160
of these channels individually.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.505
And for some companies,
that's the right way to go.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.380
And for a lot of others,
it's incredibly time

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.580
consuming and very,
very difficult to do.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.690
So I'm absolutely
delighted as well

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.150
with the launch of
Universal App Campaigns.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.020
It actually fully
rolls out today.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.434
There will be a press release
later on this afternoon.

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:10.600
And what it enables you to
do, as Miles pointed out,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.630
is to target across all the
different networks through one

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.089
simple campaign flow.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.750
The campaign flows
as easy as this.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.149
There are three steps to it.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.010
Firstly, you have to
upload a few lines of text,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.530
a few different variations
of text, and a video.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.460
And if you have
image ads, you can

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.370
import your locations,
language, budget,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.317
and target cost per install.

00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:36.650
And then ultimately you have
to just enable the campaign

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.610
and it will run across
all of Google's channels,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.260
targeting app install imagery.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.209
This is what the
interface will look like.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:47.750
As you can see on
the left hand side,

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.680
there are four different
variations of text,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.070
allowing Conversion Optimizer
to optimize and choose

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.270
the best one.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.660
You can input a YouTube URL, and
it'll pull your YouTube video

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.872
in directly.

00:04:58.872 --> 00:05:00.330
And on the right
hand side, you can

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.250
see that your app icon and
images are automatically

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.500
pulled in through Google Play.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.660
So optimizing those is
obviously very important.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.790
Once you enable those campaigns,
it's really straightforward.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.790
Your ads, your bids,
your banner distribution,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.980
and your targeting are all
optimized automatically.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.120
We aim to get you the maximum
volume at your target CPI.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.780
The initial beta testing
of this has been fantastic,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.926
and we're delighted that
it's rolling out today.

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:31.050
It will hopefully make your
lives a lot easier when

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.090
it comes to user acquisition.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.830
Underlying all of
this, as I said before,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.016
is data and insights.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.880
You can use some of
Google's solutions,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.390
such as integrating the AdWords
SDK to track your conversions

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.470
and measure them, and Analytics
for measuring in-app activity.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.120
Or alternatively, as many of
you do work with a third party,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.150
let us know, as we have
close relationships

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.395
with most of the third
party tracking companies.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.720
Why do we measure?

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.830
Of course, this is
paid advertising.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.440
So you've got to make sure
that your average LTV is

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.900
greater than your average CPI.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.650
We know that one
out of six users

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.150
don't make a purchase
within an app.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.430
And we know that 80% of
users only use an app once

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.080
after installing it.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.670
So app economics
works when you know

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.110
the lifetime value of your app.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.330
And then you work
with the channel

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.209
to acquire users
that are low value.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.750
So when we talk
about lifetime value,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.230
this is a very,
very simple example.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.170
But this is something that,
as an advertising channel,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.320
we need to understand from you.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.080
What actual values are
users bringing to you?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.850
So if we look at a very basic
case of a user over one year,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.860
or a set of users
over a year, we

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.430
can see that a user might
have paid $5 on average

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.284
within your app
to purchase items.

00:06:56.284 --> 00:06:57.700
Perhaps you have
an offline store,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.660
and they made an
additional $5 purchase

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.160
throughout the year
in that offline store.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.010
And we know that those users,
through reviews and ratings

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.610
and messaging apps,
spread your app to others.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.430
So there's an uplift
from word of mouth.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.060
So if we estimate that
on average your users are

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.030
worth $11 to you a
year, then we know

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.610
that we have to pay less than
that to acquire them for you

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.430
to be ROI positive.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.630
So once we have
identified what we're

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.430
willing to pay for
a user, we have

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.790
to figure out how we can
maximize their lifetime value

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.370
and drive engagement.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.920
The clicker seems to
be very stubborn today.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.210
There we go.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.000
So we surveyed
another set of users

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.110
to understand why
they like using apps

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.470
and what key commercial
activities they use apps for.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.970
And you can see there
that, across the funnel,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.280
they like using apps for
multiple different things,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.620
everything from reading
reviews by others

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.650
all the way through
to royalty programs

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.000
at the end of the funnel.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.530
So if you know by
speaking to your users

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.870
and by looking at your analytics
what users do within your app,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.060
you're able to then create
engagement campaigns to try

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.090
and drive them into
that part of the funnel

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.330
that they enjoy most.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.217
There are two ways in which you
can create engagement campaigns

00:08:18.217 --> 00:08:18.800
at the moment.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.930
The simplest and easiest
is auto-created lists.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.820
So all you have to do here is
link your Google Play account

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.250
to you AdWords account.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.220
And there are a number
of auto-generated lists

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.160
that you can re-market to
with specific messaging.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.159
This is the best and
easiest way to try this out

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.799
to see if you can
generate value.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.700
If you get that
right, then you can

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.970
start looking at custom
lists where you can either

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.731
import lists from Google
Analytics, Service Server,

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.855
or third party integration.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.925
So once you've
created your list,

00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:52.970
you understand what
your users like,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.730
the last piece is tailoring
messaging to them.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.825
So three examples of messages
that you can tailor to them--

00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:03.450
if you're trying to
get users to engage

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.170
with your app, the
first thing to do

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.080
is to deliver to
all of them content

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.582
that can only be accessed
or engaged with in the app.

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:13.520
The second messaging
is for users

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.256
who may have lapsed and
stopped using your app,

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.630
and you want to
get them back in.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.252
The best way to
do this is to let

00:09:19.252 --> 00:09:21.460
them know that there are
new features within your app

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.520
that they can take
advantage if they reengage.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.460
And finally what
we see often, is

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.380
people start purchasing
items, get to their cart,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.070
and then abandon the cart.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.317
You can target those
users specifically

00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:35.900
by offering them a
discount that might

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.843
be only applicable
on that day to get

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.134
them to complete that purchase.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.700
So as you can see, we've got
two main takeaways today.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.450
First, search ads in Play--
fantastic results initially.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.830
And as of today will be
the launch of universal app

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.460
campaigns, which will
hopefully streamline and make

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.362
your user acquisition
campaigns far easier.

00:09:59.362 --> 00:10:01.320
So if you want to chat
about this, let me know.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.140
I'll be around.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.040
And enjoy the rest of your day.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.940
Thank you.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.990
