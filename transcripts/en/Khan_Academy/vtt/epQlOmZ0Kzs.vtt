00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.678
Voiceover: I have a set of questions
here from school leadership briefing.

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:09.342
The first question is, "The Khan Academy
uses a unique system of teaching,

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:13.189
"where most of the taking in of
information, concrete learning,

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.855
"occurs outside the classroom.
And inside the classroom,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.997
"time is spent solving
problems in other pursuits.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:20.129
"Can you briefly explain how this works?"

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.389
So, on a very high level
this is exactly right.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.335
We believe, or the overarching idea here,

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:28.590
is that when people
are in a room together,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.998
students with each other
and students with teachers,

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.256
we think the best use of that
time and that scarce time,

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:36.995
is for them to interact with
each other as much as possible.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.335
Leverage the fact that you
have other humans in the room.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:43.599
We want that time to be spent with
the students teaching each other,

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.989
the teachers doing much smaller
group interactions with the students.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.393
As opposed to a traditional kind
of lecture for all of the students,

00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:53.564
at the same pace.

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:56.933
And doing things that
there's often not time for.

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.319
In a traditional classroom there's
a lot of time spent on lecture.

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.521
We like to see teachers
doing more projects,

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:08.855
doing more peer to peer tutoring,
leading to deeper simulations,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.725
and types of experiments.

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:13.724
In terms of how it works,
the simple answer is,

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:20.392
the details we're still learning
what the best way to do it is.

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:23.259
We've done pilots and even in the
pilots that we've been running,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:26.927
every teacher does it a
different way and we're trying,

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:28.267
to share best practices.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:32.391
The general idea is, exactly
as this question phrased,

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.939
students spent a good amount of
their time so I guess their homework,

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.864
is they're watching videos and they're
doing exercises at their own pace.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.864
So they are doing exercises as well.

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.262
The teacher gets data on it.

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:44.247
They get a dashboard on it.

00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:47.590
They know when and where and what
the students have been working on.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.500
They also get flagged on
what students are stuck on.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
When students go into the
classroom they are able,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.202
to continue working at their own
pace on the exercise and the videos.

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.453
For maybe 15 to 20 minutes of class time.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.846
While that's occurring, since all the
students are working at their own pace,

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:06.717
the teacher can look at
the dashboard and say,

00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:08.697
"Hey look. Billy is stuck
on negative numbers.

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:11.454
"Let me get Susie who's already
mastered that concept to help Billy.

00:02:11.454 --> 00:02:15.451
"Or let me go sit next to Billy and see
if I can tutor him on negative numbers."

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.515
Or maybe it's something different
because the teacher will also see,

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:22.447
in his or her dashboard that hey
look, Billy has been working,

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.029
on Khan Academy at 2 in the morning
maybe he's just not sleeping right.

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.941
Maybe something else is going on at home.

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.618
To do that very, kind of,
close human interaction,

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:34.402
I think is the most valuable
thing we've been seeing.

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:37.667
The rest of class time, outside
of that Khan Academy experience,

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.611
where the students are working with
each other and teaching with each other,

00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:45.866
we like to see teachers do as many
projects as they can and simulations.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.949
One thing that we hope to add to Khan
Academy is to actually tell teachers,

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.529
"Look these 5 students have
mastered these 5 concepts,

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.204
"or these 20 concepts. We think
here's a good example of a project,

00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:00.360
"that will stimulate them. That
will let them learn that concept,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.282
"even a little bit deeper."

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.738
Other things we've been seeing in classes.

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:06.276
We've seen almost automatic
self-organization take place,

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:09.108
with the students where students
start writing on a wipe board,

00:03:09.108 --> 00:03:11.614
what problems or what concepts
they're having trouble with,

00:03:11.614 --> 00:03:14.863
and other students are saying what
concepts they're comfortable teaching.

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:17.613
Then they start to kind of
sort it out between them.

00:03:17.613 --> 00:03:21.615
With that said, we've been
doing it at Los Altos,

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:26.203
which is an upper middle class to
affluent public school district.

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:31.181
Although one of the classes that
we've been doing a pilot with,

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:31.856
is for their algebra readiness course.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:36.418
Which is less affluent students,
many English as a second language,

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:38.407
who are having trouble in mathematics.

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.148
The results have been
really tremendous there.

00:03:40.148 --> 00:03:45.253
We're also doing pilots in East Palo
Alto which is an underserved community.

00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:48.261
We're doing one at a charter
school in Redwood City.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:52.328
We're talking to some other
pretty prominent charter networks,

00:03:52.328 --> 00:03:53.518
of experiments with them.

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.450
Also in Oakland and in other places.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.724
In all of these pilots,
our goal isn't to say,

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:02.450
"This is how you use Khan Academy, go
use it and let's see what happens."

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.926
Our goal is to say we want to
collaborate with these teachers.

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:08.118
The main reason we want to do these
pilots is because we want to explore,

00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:09.984
what is the best way to use this tool?

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:15.753
How can we best make class time as
rich of an experience as possible?

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:18.426
And how can we, with the
teachers, the physical experience,

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:21.851
and the Khan Academy experience make
the overall learning experience,

00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.721
as deep and as long lasting as possible?

00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:28.214
Question number two.

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:31.544
"You often talk about using
technology to humanize the classroom.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:33.807
"How can it do that? How do
you build community around,

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:36.201
"the use of technology in
a classroom or school?"

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:40.264
This kind of goes right
off of the first answer.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:46.060
I think the mistake with technology
in the classroom in the past is that,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.196
they've been using technology,
frankly, to dehumanize the classroom.

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:52.585
Before, in a traditional classroom
where there's no computer,

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:54.262
you have at least some interaction.

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:57.528
The teacher might lecture for some
time but you do have some opportunity,

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.191
to ask the teacher a question or
you might have some opportunity,

00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.858
to work on some projects together.

00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:03.864
Then when you introduce
the computer in that,

00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:06.595
where students are spending all of
class time working on computers,

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:08.920
by themselves then all of
a sudden you crowd out,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.659
whatever interaction was there before.

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:11.757
So you're dehumanizing it.

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.193
We're seeing it do the opposite.

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.336
Let's take to computer,
let's use the computer,

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:19.536
so that the teacher no longer has to
give that one pace fits all lecture.

00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:23.331
So that kids don't have to sit
passively for an hour in math class,

00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:24.334
or whatever class.

00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:25.674
We're going to have physics content.

00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:28.671
Physics, chemistry,
biology, and other topics.

00:05:29.717 --> 00:05:31.590
When you have every student
working at their own pace,

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.261
one it's catering to them so
that's one level of humanity.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.587
Then also, since you freed
up all of this class time,

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:38.254
and you have students
interacting with each other,

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.497
and actually interacting with
the teacher in a deeper way,

00:05:41.497 --> 00:05:45.160
that's kind of the second order
of humanizing the classroom.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.589
When some people think about
something like Khan Academy,

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.591
the knee-jerk reaction is, "Well
how can someone ask a question?

00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:54.464
"These are videos. You can't
ask a question on a video."

00:05:54.464 --> 00:05:56.450
What we say is that they're exactly right.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.870
We also think that's true
of a lot of lectures.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.521
If you're in a room of 30 kids,
some kids might have the guts,

00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:04.928
to raise their hand and ask a question.

00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:07.521
It's still not even clear
if that's a good thing,

00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.118
because it might not be appropriate
question for all of the students.

00:06:10.118 --> 00:06:12.858
It might be a question
that's better served offline.

00:06:12.858 --> 00:06:14.584
We think a lot of students
aren't asking questions,

00:06:14.584 --> 00:06:15.918
in the current form factor.

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.117
Maybe just because they're a little lost,

00:06:17.117 --> 00:06:19.401
they're not even engaged
in the content enough,

00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.492
that they can even think of questions.

00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:24.491
What we say is, let the kids
do exercises, watch videos,

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:26.653
at their own time, at their own pace.

00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:30.593
Let them watch the same video 30
times if that's what it takes.

00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:33.929
We've seen examples of that is
what students sometimes need,

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:36.196
to really understand something.

00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:38.417
Let the teacher have as much
information as they need,

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:41.820
to make really powerful
judgements about what's going on,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.184
in a student's mind.

00:06:44.464 --> 00:06:46.787
Then free up not just a
small fraction of class time,

00:06:46.787 --> 00:06:49.071
to ask a teacher question.

00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:50.661
Free up all of class time.

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.866
So all of class time is
nothing but interactions.

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:55.604
And nothing but questions.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:57.722
In terms of how do you
build a community around,

00:06:57.722 --> 00:06:59.995
the use of technology in
a classroom or school?

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:02.998
Once again, what we're doing in
our pilots is we're observing.

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:04.394
We have ideas.

00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:06.988
Some of the amazing teachers
and principals and students,

00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:08.933
we've been working with have ideas.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:10.197
We're essentially trying them out,

00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:11.699
and we're seeing what
works and what doesn't.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.456
What you can expect from us over
the course of the next year,

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:17.058
is us sharing what we think
are the best practices,

00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:19.732
or us encouraging some of these
awesome teachers and principals,

00:07:19.732 --> 00:07:22.037
to share what are the best practices.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.854
They've already had a
ton of really good ideas,

00:07:24.854 --> 00:07:26.649
for building that
community in the classroom.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.130
What we're going to do on our end, is
try to build as many technology tools,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.654
that also facilitate it.

00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:34.138
Right now kids are writing on the
wipe board what they need help with,

00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:35.131
or what they can help.

00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:37.060
Well, we could probably build a
little tool to facilitate that,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.133
within the classroom.

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:39.715
It's all on the table though.

00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:42.532
We're always exploring
and always open to ideas.

00:07:43.742 --> 00:07:44.935
The third question.

00:07:44.935 --> 00:07:48.371
"One of your most talked about ideas
concerns flipping the classroom.

00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:50.683
"Can you describe how and why that works?"

00:07:50.683 --> 00:07:54.887
This is interesting because
I gave a Ted Talk in April,

00:07:54.887 --> 00:07:56.780
and I talk about flipping
the class room where,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.679
early on in Khan Academy I had made these
videos and I got letters from teachers,

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:05.543
saying, "Hey look you already gave a
video on finding a limit of a function,

00:08:05.543 --> 00:08:09.338
"or adding and subtracting
negative numbers."

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:11.602
So those teachers said, hey they don't
have to give that lecture anymore,

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:14.150
so they're having those students
watch those lectures at home.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.404
Then they were freeing up
class time to do more problems,

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:19.145
essentially what used to be homework.

00:08:19.145 --> 00:08:22.390
That is kind of a traditional pure flip.

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:26.422
That by itself, I think,
is a very powerful thing.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.465
You're using class time,
once again, to interact.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:33.879
Just even that flip, by itself, even
before we talk about any other technology,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.830
some people say, "Well,
unmotivated students right now,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.733
"aren't doing their homework.
What makes you think,

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:40.875
"that they're going to watch videos?"

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:43.936
A partial answer is,
well we have technology,

00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:45.827
that the teachers can track
that and all the rest.

00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:48.827
But the more important
answer is, they might not.

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:52.878
Although, I suspect they will
because it's easier to watch a video,

00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:55.502
than to do a problem that
you don't know how to do.

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:58.673
That's most of the reason why I think
a lot of kids don't do their homework.

00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:00.824
Because they start and they
get frustrated and they stop.

00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:05.002
Even if you assume that the same
kid who didn't do homework before,

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.862
isn't going to watch a
video now, what I say is,

00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:10.344
"Well, if you're going to skip out
on anything, it's better to skip out,

00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:13.868
"on the lecture than to
skip out on the exercises."

00:09:13.868 --> 00:09:15.204
What happens is with
the flipped classroom,

00:09:15.204 --> 00:09:17.080
at least when you're in
the room with the teacher,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.545
you're able to do exercises.

00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:20.344
You're able to do it with
the help of your friends,

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:21.831
and whoever else is there.

00:09:21.831 --> 00:09:23.402
The real way that you're learning things,

00:09:23.402 --> 00:09:25.497
the exercises are what really
get you to the next level.

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:28.661
The opposite, where you're using class
time to passively listen to a lecture,

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:30.267
and then you don't do homework.

00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:31.935
That's the worst of everything.

00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:34.873
You're probably not paying attention to
the lecture so you're zoned out there.

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:37.002
And you're also not doing the exercises.

00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:38.877
The ideal is obviously,
students watch the videos.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:40.907
We think they're much more
likely to watch videos,

00:09:40.907 --> 00:09:43.753
and everything we've observed
seems to verify that,

00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:47.442
that students want to learn it's
just that traditional homework,

00:09:47.442 --> 00:09:49.476
they often get frustrated because
they don't know how to do it,

00:09:49.476 --> 00:09:51.630
and there's no one there to help them.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.441
So you can flip it that way.

00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.065
With all of that said we want to be clear,

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:56.803
that we're not just about
flipping the classroom anymore.

00:09:56.803 --> 00:09:58.938
I kind of mentioned the word
halfway into my Ted Talk,

00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:02.690
and I think the media and the
press love a very simple word,

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.739
like flip the classroom
and homework at school,

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:07.332
and schoolwork at home and
all of that type of thing.

00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:11.290
We're not actually saying that
this is the 100 percent ideal.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.738
What we're saying is, 100 percent
ideal is doing everything,

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.522
to allow every student to work at
their own pace, at their own time.

00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:18.361
For every student to master concepts,

00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.196
so that they don't have
gaps in their knowledge,

00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:22.363
so they don't move on with
just C level of understanding,

00:10:22.363 --> 00:10:24.102
or B level of understanding.

00:10:24.102 --> 00:10:27.690
And to humanize the classroom
as much as possible.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.129
The flip is the start to do this,
but we think you can go even further,

00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:34.782
if you have self-paced
exercises and you have feedback,

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:37.661
and you have dashboards, and you
have dashboards for teachers.

00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:39.078
I want to make it very clear.

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:41.861
This is something that the
media has grabbed on to.

00:10:41.861 --> 00:10:46.659
That we kind of view as
a intermediary solution.

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:49.457
But we think the ideal solution,
and we're still exploring,

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:51.058
what that ideal solution is.

00:10:51.058 --> 00:10:52.938
But we think that the right answer is,

00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:55.396
don't just flip for the sake of flipping,

00:10:55.396 --> 00:10:57.615
or just because the word
flip is a nice buzz word,

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.127
that people are excited about.

00:10:59.127 --> 00:11:01.664
Do everything in your power to
make class time as interactive,

00:11:01.664 --> 00:11:04.334
and as deep, and as
exploratory as possible.

00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:08.274
And use technology in ways to empower
kids to work at their own pace,

00:11:08.274 --> 00:11:10.521
at their own time, and
get as much data possible,

00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:14.521
to teachers and parents, and
frankly to the students themselves.
