00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.680
To provide a useful service,
businesses need to react

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.020
quickly to changing patterns
in user behavior.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.650
Identifying these patterns
involves

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.400
processing customer data.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.620
Lots of it.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.070
But as you collect data, more
and more time is spent on

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.270
repetitive tasks to
make predictions.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.860
Machine learning may be used
to sort through huge data

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.211
sets, but can be very
difficult to set up.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.450
Google's Predictive API employs
our classifiers to do

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.970
the heavy lifting for you,
letting you focus on your

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.680
project, not algorithmic
nuts and bolts.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.940
Its predictions help you
understand how your market is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910
trending over time,
allowing you to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.830
tailor your future strategy.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.000
Here's how it works.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.900
Structure your training
data and upload

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.120
it to Google Storage.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.360
Train one of our models
on your data set,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.870
using one of our APIs.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.890
Apply the trained model to make
predictions and profit

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.250
from the newly-built model to
interpret data as it comes in,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.740
improving results over
time, using our

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.250
continually-improving algorithms
to predict your

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.810
customers' future
wants and needs.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.670
Or, use one of our hosted
models, built by experts with

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.480
data already gathered
and labeled.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.690
If you crave insight into what
your customers may look to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.230
buy, want to interpret
feedback, or wish to

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.320
categorize online data, Google's
Predictive API helps

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.840
you quickly see data patterns,
and can help you profit from

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.770
knowing what customers want
before they even think to ask.
