00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
I think it's sort of like going to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
I think it's sort of like going to
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.940
I think it's sort of like going to
America back in the 1400s it's it's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
America back in the 1400s it's it's
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.210
America back in the 1400s it's it's
totally crazy but I think it will happen

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
totally crazy but I think it will happen
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.099
totally crazy but I think it will happen
and if you recall those first trips to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
and if you recall those first trips to
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929
and if you recall those first trips to
America were commercial voyages people

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
America were commercial voyages people
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.670
America were commercial voyages people
are looking for gold in India and stuff

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
are looking for gold in India and stuff
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.650
are looking for gold in India and stuff
like gold and spices perhaps one of the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
like gold and spices perhaps one of the
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359
like gold and spices perhaps one of the
big commercial drivers is going to be

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
big commercial drivers is going to be
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.420
big commercial drivers is going to be
all the minerals in the asteroids and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430
 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.729
whether it's Christopher Columbus or the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
whether it's Christopher Columbus or the
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.580
whether it's Christopher Columbus or the
internet or all these things they're

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
internet or all these things they're
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959
internet or all these things they're
driven commercially and then they have a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
driven commercially and then they have a
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700
driven commercially and then they have a
huge impact way beyond with that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
huge impact way beyond with that
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.240
huge impact way beyond with that
original commercial into this way

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250
 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.220
I think we'll turn outer space into

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230
I think we'll turn outer space into
 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.000
I think we'll turn outer space into
inner space but yeah we we are probably

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010
inner space but yeah we we are probably
 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.719
inner space but yeah we we are probably
going to well there's a reasonable

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729
going to well there's a reasonable
 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.280
going to well there's a reasonable
argument that we're going to create a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
argument that we're going to create a
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.750
argument that we're going to create a
clean useful life supporting atmosphere

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760
clean useful life supporting atmosphere
 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.280
clean useful life supporting atmosphere
on Mars sooner than we will on earth

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
on Mars sooner than we will on earth
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.440
on Mars sooner than we will on earth
because on Mars we have no politics and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450
because on Mars we have no politics and
 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.380
because on Mars we have no politics and
we have no incumbent establishment so

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390
we have no incumbent establishment so
 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.000
we have no incumbent establishment so
it's easier to experiment there and get

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010
it's easier to experiment there and get
 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.460
it's easier to experiment there and get
it right on earth the moment you start

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470
it right on earth the moment you start
 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.210
it right on earth the moment you start
changing things around you you run into

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
changing things around you you run into
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.530
changing things around you you run into
people who liked it better the way it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540
people who liked it better the way it
 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:40.210
people who liked it better the way it
was or what have you probably this this

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220
was or what have you probably this this
 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.800
was or what have you probably this this
century it would take 30 or 40 years to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
century it would take 30 or 40 years to
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.320
century it would take 30 or 40 years to
terraform Mars get a couple of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330
terraform Mars get a couple of
 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.550
terraform Mars get a couple of
billionaires to fund it because the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
billionaires to fund it because the
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.969
billionaires to fund it because the
government won't and then it's going to

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979
government won't and then it's going to
 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.930
government won't and then it's going to
end up being more biology then we're not

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940
end up being more biology then we're not
 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.920
end up being more biology then we're not
going to go put giant air blowers on

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930
going to go put giant air blowers on
 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.510
going to go put giant air blowers on
Mars we're what you need to do is

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520
Mars we're what you need to do is
 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.250
Mars we're what you need to do is
genetically engineer plants of various

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260
genetically engineer plants of various
 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.789
genetically engineer plants of various
kinds that will take the minerals on

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799
kinds that will take the minerals on
 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.500
kinds that will take the minerals on
Mars and it take the oxygen out of the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
Mars and it take the oxygen out of the
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.720
Mars and it take the oxygen out of the
the compounds the oxidized compounds and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
the compounds the oxidized compounds and
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.210
the compounds the oxidized compounds and
stick it into the atmosphere and figure

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220
stick it into the atmosphere and figure
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.509
stick it into the atmosphere and figure
out what level of different kinds of

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519
out what level of different kinds of
 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.100
out what level of different kinds of
gases you need to make it breathable to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110
gases you need to make it breathable to
 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.910
gases you need to make it breathable to
humans and to have the right it's sort

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
humans and to have the right it's sort
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.890
humans and to have the right it's sort
of light sensitivity that you will

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
of light sensitivity that you will
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.199
of light sensitivity that you will
capture the right amount of solar energy

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209
capture the right amount of solar energy
 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.509
capture the right amount of solar energy
to make the temperature habitable and so

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519
to make the temperature habitable and so
 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.760
to make the temperature habitable and so
forth
