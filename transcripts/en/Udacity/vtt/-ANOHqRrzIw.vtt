00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.940
So, my name is Ryan. I'm, live in Palo

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.570
Alto but I'm from Maryland and I'm lactose intolerant.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; For everybody out there who doesn't know what lactose

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.090
intolerance is, tell us briefly what being lactose intolerant means.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.260
&gt;&gt; in briefly, it means I can't have

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.460
milk or other dairy products without experiencing some Discomfort.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.960
&gt;&gt; I see discomfort. And, can you elaborate a little bit on discomfort?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.370
&gt;&gt; Sure. discomfort typically means

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.910
it's digestive discomfort. So it's gas, bloating, diarrhea, that sort of thing.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.570
&gt;&gt; is anyone else in your family lactose intolerant?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. My younger sister is. But I have

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.970
a brother who is not. And my parents are not.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.100
&gt;&gt; Okay. so do you, do you have any experience with this being a genetic

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.880
trait, like do, do, does this run in your family, being lactose intolerant?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.450
&gt;&gt; I actually don't know, because most

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.390
of my family lives in the Philippines, and they don't drink cow

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.275
milk. They have the, they drink powdered milk, and all those, and

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.540
non-dairy products. Because it's not as popular there, so it wasn't until

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.050
I discovered I was lactose intolerant that I learned anything about it.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.600
&gt;&gt; And when did you discover that you were lactose intolerant?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.290
&gt;&gt; I would say that would be about two or three years ago so.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960
&gt;&gt; Really? That late in life?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.550
&gt;&gt; Yes. But when I found out I was lactose intolerant, it kind

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.764
of explained some things from when I was younger.

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.800
because there were times like when I would have

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.710
dairy products and I'd be fine, but then there

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020
would be times that if I had too much

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.150
I felt, I felt a little gassy, but when

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.750
I discovered I was lactose intolerant it kind of

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.374
made sense that if I was young and overloaded

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:33.760
on it made sense that, that I would feel discomfort.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.520
&gt;&gt; I see so when you were young

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.620
though, you felt like you could have normal amounts.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.440
&gt;&gt; And you were okay.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.550
&gt;&gt; Right. It wasn't until graduate school,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.540
until yeah about two years ago that I discovered I was lactose intolerant. And I

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.990
think it's because that's when it kind of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.360
just. When really, it kind of shut off.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.400
&gt;&gt; Right, right. How'd that make you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.480
feel to sort of discover this about yourself?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.490
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess that it kind of made sense to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.520
me because it explained a lot of things about why I'd

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.800
randomly feel sick some days and why I wouldn't other days

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.080
and just depending on my breakfast. But it was kind of annoying

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080
&gt;&gt;

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.270
[LAUGH]

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.280
&gt;&gt; To find out, mostly, because I knew I'd have to either change my diet or.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.699
&gt;&gt; Other things.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.212
&gt;&gt; So what are the kinds of foods you

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:15.382
actually have to avoid if you are lactose intolerant person.

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:17.380
&gt;&gt; I you are lactose intolerant and you are

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.310
not taking any type of supplement then you basically have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880
to avoid anything that has an appreciable amount of dairy

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.692
products and so of, obviously I'm not going to be drinking

00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:28.729
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.519
milk, ice cream, pizzas with a lot of cheese on it.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.790
taco, taco, American style tacos, doritos, all those things, cake, cheesecake.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.560
&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is that there's a lot of food restrictions?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.950
&gt;&gt; Yes. It is a, there's a lot, a huge part of the diet that is, has dairy

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.020
products in it. And so discovering lactose intolerant kind

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.117
of makes it more difficult to Get that sort of.

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.881
&gt;&gt; So do you find yourself in situations I

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:57.890
guess social situations where you see a food come

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.948
out and you're like oh,gosh, I really want that

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:02.310
and then you're like oh, gosh, I can't eat it?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.350
&gt;&gt; Yes, especially, I do try to carry around

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.900
lactase pills lactase enzyme pills, but if I don't have

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.440
them then yes, if someone's like let's go out for

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.080
ice cream! I go, oh, I guess I can't. Or.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.180
&gt;&gt; If there's pizza. Especially if people, you know, at the last

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.510
minute want to get pizza, or certain, go out for

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.600
dinner and we haven't decided, if they suggest pizza,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.717
I kind, I have to go, I don't I

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.910
can't really eat that. Are people receptive to this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.170
when you tell them, like if you tell a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.980
group of friends, or even new people, hey I'm

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.000
lactose intolerant, you know, can we do something else.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.180
Or can we go somewhere else? Are people normally receptive?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.980
&gt;&gt; Yes. especially in California actually. Because in California a lot

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.190
of people are, know people with various dietary restrictions or are on

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.203
different diets. And so it's definitely it hasn't really affected

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:50.860
my social life. It just means that we do something else.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.190
&gt;&gt; You mentioned lactase pills. What exactly is a lactase pill,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.000
and where do you get it? How much does it cost?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.050
&gt;&gt; A lactase pill is just a little pill,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.430
about an, a little less than an inch big, by

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.530
a quarter inch, that is just, a number of units

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.200
of lactase enzyme. So lactose intolerance means, my body doesn't

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.540
produce lactase anymore, which is the enzyme that breaks down

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.820
the lactose sugar into two different sugars. So, this pill, I

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.260
eat it, I always buy the fast act pill so

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.089
I can just eat it, with my first bite of food

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.560
and it kind of dissolves and tries to break down

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.960
all the sugars in my stomach. And so I take that

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.510
with my first bite of dairy. And then I'm usually good

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.730
for about 45 minutes before I have to take another one.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.730
&gt;&gt; Well how much do they cost?

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.800
&gt;&gt; I would say it's about ten cents a pill, so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.140
120 would be about 12 to $13 at Safeway, for example.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.750
&gt;&gt; Wow, so it's over the counter.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.585
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:44.580
&gt;&gt; And you think it's a good deal?

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.440
&gt;&gt; I think it's a good deal, because You know especially since I'm

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.080
lactose intolerant, I've cut down on the amount of dairy I have incidentally.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.873
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:56.250
&gt;&gt; So it means that if I am controlling

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.820
it one box 128, that's 120 servings of dairy products.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.272
&gt;&gt; Right. That's a lot of dairy. Yeah and, you know,

00:05:03.272 --> 00:05:06.296
I switched out the milk I buy for the one that

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:09.630
already is lactose free. So that means I don't have to

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.470
take a pill every time I drink a glass of milk.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.050
&gt;&gt; is this a trait you would ever want to change about yourself at all?

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.110
&gt;&gt; Definitely. I just feel, I mean being lactose

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.630
intolerant just means I can't live my same life.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.090
And eat the same amount of, eat the same foods and do the same things I want to.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.330
But I just have to spend more money. To do it because I buy

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.190
the lactase lactose free milk and I

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.270
buy the lactase pills to supplement other meals.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.120
&gt;&gt; Are there any advantages to being a lactose intolerant?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.570
&gt;&gt; The only advantage, I would think, is if you're trying

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.650
to diet. Like if you're trying to lose weight, you're not going to

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.820
be eating the deep dish Chicago style pizzas, or the burritos.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.380
If you're lactose intolerant because even with lactase pills, that might just

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.090
still be too much dairy to consume at one time.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.362
So, I mean, that's the only advantage I can see.

00:05:56.362 --> 00:05:57.362
&gt;&gt;

00:05:56.362 --> 00:05:56.464
[LAUGH].

00:05:56.464 --> 00:05:58.240
&gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's just kind of, like I

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.730
said, it's an, an annoyance in your life.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.540
&gt;&gt; So do people ever tease you about it like do your friends ever like,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.010
you know will say nicely tease you?

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.480
I can't imagine somebody like teasing, teasing you.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.480
&gt;&gt;

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.250
[LAUGH].

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.160
Well actually, last time I came here, I

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.180
walked in, and they were like, oh, you're Ryan,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.432
you're lactose intolerant! And then people were eating

00:06:16.432 --> 00:06:17.715
ice cream oh, I guess you can't have that.

00:06:17.715 --> 00:06:19.280
[LAUGH]

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.810
But yeah, I mean, it's just light-hearted things. It's just like,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.790
oh, I've got my pills, it doesn't matter, and things like that.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.490
&gt;&gt; Have you ever gotten your own personal

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.770
genetic information? Done from a company like 23andMe?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.030
&gt;&gt; And did, what did that tell you about

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.900
you being lactose intolerant? Did it confirm this? Or

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.400
&gt;&gt; it confirmed I have the, the genotype that is likely

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.590
lactose intolerant. Because since lactose

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.710
intolerant can also depend on environmental

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.510
factors like your, your actual gut bacteria that breaks down the

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.360
lactose It means I have the tendency to be lactose intolerant.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.370
But it doesn't mean I am. The only way you can

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.100
confirm that you are is to kind of know that you are.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.050
&gt;&gt; You said that you found

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.850
out you were lactose intolerant relatively recently.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.270
Did you have the personal genetic information before or after you knew that?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.360
&gt;&gt; it was afterwards.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.020
&gt;&gt; Oh it was after.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.080
&gt;&gt; So I knew I was lactose intolerant. And then I got the 23andMe.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.410
And it said Yes, you have the genotype that is likely lactose intolerant.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.070
&gt;&gt; I said, well, yes.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.840
&gt;&gt; You were like, yes, correct.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.190
&gt;&gt; It's like, when I, you know, you see the 23 and, you are

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.720
likely, you likely have brown eyes. And I look in the mirror and go yes.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.060
&gt;&gt; Yes, you are correct 23andMe. So you say

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.440
the lactase pills work, the ones you take, you say

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.270
they're fast acting? And then you take one and your

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.180
normally good for like 45 minutes. are there other types

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.490
of lactase pills out there?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.140
&gt;&gt; Sure. There's another type of lactase pill

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.820
that's more slow acting. And they're generally a little

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.770
cheaper. But, that one you have to take about

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.840
half an hour, in advance of eating any dairy.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:46.991
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:48.880
&gt;&gt; And so, for that kind. That means you have to kind

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.750
of plan ahead of what you're eating. Whereas Since I don't like that,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.830
but in terms of planning my meals, oftentimes I'm just, I take

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.360
just the fast act pills because it allows me to make quick decisions

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.860
on food.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.400
&gt;&gt; And can you take two of your fast acting

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.320
ones at once to last longer, or does that not work?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.610
&gt;&gt; I, I don't know about it lasting longer, but if I'm eating

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.140
a large thing of dairy, so like I mentioned before, the deep dish Chicago

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.930
style pizza, I'll take two. I'll take two at that first bite, because

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.020
I know it's a lot to process, so taking two at once would help.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.800
&gt;&gt; What would you say, if you could give advice to somebody

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.880
who, let's say we're talking to Ryan three

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.680
years ago before he found out he was lactose

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.850
intolerant and he, you know, just discovered That your

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.559
lactose intolerant. What advice would you give that person?

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:40.020
&gt;&gt; I think the first advice would be to test your limits on lactose tolerance.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.164
So I can have a bite of ice cream or one nacho with cheese or

00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:45.560
[UNKNOWN].

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.030
So like knowing your limit on what you

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.260
can have without any kind of supplement is useful

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.190
and also to just Make the decision whether

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.530
you're going to change your diet or buy the

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.740
pills or some kind of combination of both,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.770
just kind of figure it out, or, and look

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:08.280
into lactose free alternatives to milk or, they even

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.670
have lactose free ice cream now, but it's very

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.800
expensive, so it's like.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.430
&gt;&gt; Sure. Is it worth it to buy the ice cream so you don't

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.120
have to take pills or do you want to take pills every single time you eat

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.670
ice cream sort of thing. It's kind of just decide all the different ways

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.150
to manage your lactose intolerance and figure out which way is the best for you.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.330
&gt;&gt; Can your lactose intolerance get worse over time, or have you noticed, you

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
know, that you've become even more intolerant

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.570
now that you use maybe the lactase pill?

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.020
&gt;&gt; yes,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.270
I would definitely say I've become

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.590
more lactose intolerant since I discovered it.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.050
When I discovered it, I still could have a single serving of dairy,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.890
&gt;&gt; And not experience symptoms, but now it's to the point where I can't

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.585
even have a full serving of dairy. I can't have an eight-ounce glass of

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:53.340
lact of regular milk without experiencing some

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.760
symptoms so yeah I think definitely it's

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.130
been, I've been more lactose intolerant over the time but I don't know what

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.700
causes that if it's just the fact that my

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.665
body is producing less, and less, and less and

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:08.620
that's a gradual thing or if it has anything

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.650
to do with supplementing it or not having normal lactose.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.850
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.140
&gt;&gt; So, but I'm not sure.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.510
&gt;&gt; Well thank you for coming in and chatting with us.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.755
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for talking to me. I don't get to talk about this that often.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:21.150
