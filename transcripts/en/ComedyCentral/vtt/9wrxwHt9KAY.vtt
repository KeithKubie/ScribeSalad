SCIENTISTS PREDICT THE EARTH

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:37.737 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S GOING TO
TAKE SO LONG.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I
KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.478 line:85%
LET'S PAY WOMEN THE SAME AS MEN!

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.178 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH! WHOO!

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:35.761 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WE SHOULD PASS A LAW! A LAW!

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:36.061 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.967 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE ONE KENNEDY ALREADY
SIGNED IN 1963.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.036 align:start position:0% line:85%
GREAT IDEA, JON.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.438 line:91%
HEY, JON, YOU HEARD OF THESE

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.975 line:85%

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.412 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WE DID, WE DID? WE
PASSED THAT EQUAL PAY LAW?

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:53.980 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL WHAT WAS THE LILLY
LEDBETTER ACT A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.014 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT WAS --

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.583 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT JUST MADE IT
EASIER TO SUE THE JERKS

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:02.355 align:start position:0% line:85%
VIOLATING THE 1963 LAW.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:07.660 align:start position:0% line:91%
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUMED THAT LAW
WAS JUST FOR SHOW.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:08.894 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  BUT STILL, THAT'S
GREAT.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:09.795 line:91%
WE GOT EQUAL PAY! AND WE GOT THE
LAW THAT YOU CAN SUE FOR EQUAL

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:10.796 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
PAY, SO GREAT... KRISTEN
SCHAAL, EVERYBODY!

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT WAS A SHORT PIECE, BUT
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S TERRIFIC, EVERYBODY TAKE
CARE AND --

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.569 align:start position:0% line:92%
&gt;&gt; NO! STOP!

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:17.169 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE!

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.137 size:81% position:41% line:85%

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU, LOCK THE DOORS!

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.043 line:85%
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAGE GAPS.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:25.978 align:start position:0% line:85%
THERE YOU ARE!

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.481 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT!

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:29.715 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES!

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.720 line:91%
ONE OF YOUR CLASSIC, OH, HEY,
LADY, HERE'S YOUR PAYCHECK, UH,

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.823 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAIT ONE SECOND...

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:38.724 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, WHY DID YOU RIP
SOME OF IT?

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.762 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW, YOUR
CHROMOSOMES, FELT LIKE IT.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.996 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT IT GETS WORSE!

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.400 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT? WORSE THAN THIS?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.135 align:start position:0% line:91%
YES, THE OTHER MORE MYSTERIOUS
WAGE GAP. THE SYSTEMIC ONE.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.038 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SYSTEMIC, THAT IS A
DIFFICULT --

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.006 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SYSTEMIC. IT'S A COMPLICATED
WORD.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:59.245 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU CAN SAY THE
SYSTEM-IC OR SYSTEMIC!

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.147 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BOTH OF THEM, GROSS!

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.983 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S BAR-BAR --

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:04.450 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IC!

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:06.052 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES! SURE!

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.453 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES, YES. YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, 

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:09.956 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE SYSTEM THAT PRINTS THE

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.190 align:start position:0% line:85%
PAYCHECKS WRONG.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:11.491 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH JON, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.125 line:85%
DO YOU?

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.293 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, I'M A DUDE.

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.963 line:91%

MEN TO GO INTO HIGHER PAYING

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0% line:91%
JOBS AND SUPPORTS THEM MORE WHEN
THEY GET THEM.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO THEN ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS PROVIDE WOMEN

BETTER CHILDCARE OPTIONS,
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

REALLY COULD THIS BE?

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.343 line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, NOT VERY COMPLICATED.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.177 align:start position:0% line:91%

LESS COMPLICATED THINGS

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.078 align:start position:0% line:91%
