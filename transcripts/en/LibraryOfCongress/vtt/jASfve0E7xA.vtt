00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It sounds like you all have this,
you know this nugget of background,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.250 position:63%
in that area, poetry, religion, English.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.520 position:72%
And I'm guessing though that you're using them

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.910
in different ways now than
you intended, years ago.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.360 position:72%
[chuckle] And so I guess, I'm just wondering,
how does that specialty maybe come in to play?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.480 position:61%
Or where does that, how does that,
come across to a patron who's coming in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.370 position:56%
and needing some kind of assistance?

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.250 position:69%
&gt;&gt; So I don't think English majors ever know
what they're going to be when they grow up.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.330
[Laughter] when they get there.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.740 position:59%
So, it took me a long, long time to
figure out I wanted to be a librarian.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.540 position:70%
And lots of people say, "Ah, you're so lucky.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.130
You get to be a librarian.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.570
You must get to read all day long?"

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.660
Is that vision.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.360
And I never get to read or
maybe just book reviews.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.070
But, in terms of assigning the
"ask the librarian" questions,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.180
we do assign those to the people.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.480
And the question comes in
asking "What is the meaning

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.970 position:64%
of life?", Cheryl has to answer that one.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.040
[Laughter]

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.260
&gt;&gt; And I have gotten that one.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.210
&gt;&gt; She has gotten that one.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.720
Yes, she has gotten that one.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.050 position:59%
And both Peter and I get the questions
of "I'm looking for this book,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.600 position:70%
but I can't remember the title or the author.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.750
But my mother used to read
it to me when I was little.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.180
And I'm about to have a grandchild
and I want to read."

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.880
All of that kind of thing.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.380 position:75%
But also looking for information on Shakespeare.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.880
A lot of literary criticism
questions, from all over the world.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.960 position:73%
And those are tricky, because it's hard to know
what resources they have available in Pakistan

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
or Iraq or; you know, where
ever, to study Joseph Conrad.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.800 position:58%
Usually not very much, and the notion

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.380
that everything's freely available
on-line, has to be explained.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.620
You know, we have to burst
that bubble right away.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.870 position:75%
But, so either my colleagues will direct someone
to me or I'll get asked librarian questions.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.580 position:61%
Or as Cheryl mentioned, we're also the
recommending officers in our specialty.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.940 position:63%
So I will be monitoring our bookdealers.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.970 position:61%
Well English Literatures Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, UK and Ireland.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.870
And so we have bookdealers in
those places and plans set up.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.280 position:56%
But I'm also reading other
materials, looking through new books

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300 position:56%
and deciding what we should get, so.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.950
&gt;&gt; One of the things that the
digital reference team does,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.990 position:56%
is to offer a regular outreach
programs on different subject areas.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.720 position:63%
So we offer a monthly orientation to the
Library of Congress' on-line resources.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.400
And I provide a few of those
presentations a year.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.170 position:70%
And that gives me an opportunity to highlight
some of our poetry resources in the course

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.990 position:75%
of talking about the overall Library of Congress
website, and the materials available through it.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.380
But as the poetry specialist for
our team, I've also been able

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.640 position:70%
to offer a number of poetry related programs.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.540 position:67%
So April is national poetry month and when,
during the previous April, this April,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.180 position:69%
we offered a few programs related to poetry.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.940 position:64%
So one of the programs that I offered was
an hour long webinar on poetry resources

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.340 position:56%
on the Library of Congress' website.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.720
And so that allowed me to take
advantage of my background.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.210 position:72%
To highlight different areas of our site, that
educators and members of the public could use

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.680
to find poetry related materials
and incorporate them.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.220 position:63%
If they're teachers, into the classroom.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.260
And we also just offered a
wonderful program on some

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.040 position:72%
of the literary audio archives at the library.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.640 position:72%
Where I was able to bring in somebody from the
Hispanic Division to talk about the archive

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.170
of the Hispanic literature on tape.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.480
And the archive of recorded
poetry and literature.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010 position:70%
Which are two major audio archives related
to poetry and literature here at the library.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.840 position:70%
Which were recently made available last year.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.410 position:59%
So people can now go on-line and
listen to recordings of famous authors

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.120 position:73%
and writers how have come to the library since
the early 1940s to read and discuss their work.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.700 position:67%
And so that's a fabulous resource and
based on my specialty, I had an opportunity

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.690 position:70%
to highlight some of these amazing resources,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.930
for people who don't always have
a chance to come to our library.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.800
&gt;&gt; I want to jump in and
tell you Peter's really,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.630
really active with the poetry
and literature center.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.310
So he writes wonderful blog posts.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.320 position:56%
It's called "From the Catbird Seat".

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.660
Because that's the name of the
office for the Poetry Center.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.030 position:72%
And he's one of the major editors of the blog.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.640 position:70%
And writes wonderful pieces for that as well.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.200
&gt;&gt; And Abby has made some great
contributions [chuckles] as well.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.080 position:63%
And I think that social media in general
is one of the ways that the Library

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.440 position:66%
of Congress is increasingly looking to
extend our reach to non-traditional users.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.360 position:70%
And so increasingly we're turning to
Facebook, to blogs, to Twitter, to Instagram.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.720 position:59%
To make people more aware of our
resources in mediums other than coming

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.490
to the Library of Congress itself.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.720 position:70%
It's a great way to reach people who normally
wouldn't come here to find information.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.320
&gt;&gt; And you asked about, you
know, what we imagined.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.910
And actually as a child I did
want to become a librarian.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.620 position:58%
[Laughter] I'm not the only one here.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.480
Because I just loved libraries.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.690
But I think I imagined that I
would read all day, which I don't.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.960 position:72%
But one of the things, the marriage of library
science and religion, is interesting for me,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.490 position:59%
just because of the people who are
drawn to religion for whatever reason.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.850
It's just a chance to meet
people and what they believe.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.620 position:70%
And or, it could be a very academic question.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.260 position:59%
Or it could be a faith based question.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.640 position:59%
But it, but to be, to stand there as
a reference librarian and be very open

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.000
to whatever it is they're trying to
find out, can be just fascinating.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.300 position:59%
And really it's such a privilege to,
to hear what they're passionate about.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.640
So.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.190
&gt;&gt; I think one of the things
that stood out as you have talked

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.300
about what you do, is just
how multifaceted it is.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.240 position:66%
I think when people talk to me about being
a teacher, they have a pretty, you know,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.760 position:58%
not very new understanding, of what
it really looks like to be a teacher.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.890
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.030 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Right. And so, I'm thinking the
same thing about the work that you do.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.420
And, so there's outreach.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.210
And then you're dealing with
social media platforms.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.090 position:72%
What's, what's one of the things, you wanted
to be a librarian and then things have changed

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.780 position:66%
over time, what's one of the things that's
surprised you the most over the years,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.230 position:56%
about this job that you do each day?

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.800 position:69%
&gt;&gt; I absolutely love my job for the variety.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000
The different things I get to do.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.720
Recently, I worked on an exhibit.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.780 position:59%
Peter and I put together a small case.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.250 position:58%
So I never thought I'd be a museum
curator along with being a librarian.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.450 position:73%
But I think the best thing about my job, is
that I get to learn something new all the time.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.810
Any, any, everyday there
are new questions coming in.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.050 position:67%
And as I get to research them, try and
find an answer, I'm learning along the way.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.670
So, I think it's a job where
you can never get bored.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.780 position:72%
&gt;&gt; I also think that you're learning something
often through somebody else's curiosity.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.780
And then you're curious about,
"Why is that like that?"

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.510 position:66%
and, and you get the fun of playing with
it, but you don't have to write the paper.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:17.150
[ Laughter ]

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.850
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
