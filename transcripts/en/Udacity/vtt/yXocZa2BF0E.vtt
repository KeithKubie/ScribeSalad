00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.260
The answer is five. Three for the location and two for the direction. You might

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.839
be tempted to answer six with three for the direction. If you think about how a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:09.312
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:12.444
works the sensor can be given in altitude and a swivel angle to specify

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:17.294
direction. Just two values. A third value would be needed for the distance in a

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:22.170
given direction, but our eyes detect just radiance, not distance. It's an

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.280
interesting way to think of the universe. Just five numbers specify the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.568
location and direction, and only need then is the radiance. Put together enough

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:32.296
radiance readings for a given location and set of directions and you get an

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:36.849
image. It's also informative to think how the radiance values change as you

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:41.314
move around. For example, if our sensor is in deep outer space, moving even

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:46.270
large distances will cause only small changes in the radiance values received.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.483
Having insight into how a scene's light field changes can help us figure out

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:53.360
how best we can compute and store these changes to simulate it
