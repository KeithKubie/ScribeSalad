00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
We tend to associate diplomacy with embassies,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.020
international relations and high politcs.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.760
But it really

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.560
refers to a set of skills that matter in many
areas of daily life, especially at the office

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.500
and on the landing, outside the slammed doors
of loved ones’ bedrooms. Diplomacy is the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.770
art of advancing an idea or cause without
unnecessarily inflaming passions or unleashing

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.329
a catastrophe. It involves an understanding
of the many facets of human nature that can

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.809
undermine agreement and stoke conflict, and
a commitment to unpicking these with foresight

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.940
and grace. The diplomat remembers, first and
foremost, that some of the vehemence with

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.489
which we can insist on having our way draws
energy from an overall sense of not being

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.789
respected or heard within a relationship.
We will fight with particular tenacity and

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.989
apparent meanness over a so-called small point
when we have a sense that the other person

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.870
has failed to honour our wider need for appreciation
and esteem. Behind our fierce way of arguing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.180
may lie a frustrated plea for affection. Diplomats
know the intensity with which humans crave

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.500
respect and so though they may not always
be able to agree with us, they take the trouble

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.600
to show that they have bothered to see how
things look through our eyes. They recognise

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.990
that it is almost as important to people to
feel heard, as to win their case. We’ll

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.810
put up with a lot once someone has demonstrated
that they at least know how we feel. Diplomats

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.800
therefore put extraordinary effort into securing
the health of the overall relationship so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.640
that smaller points can be conceded along
the way without attracting feelings of untenable

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.220
humiliation. They know how much beneath pitched
fights over money or entitlements, schedules

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.159
or procedures, a demand for esteem can stir.
They are careful to trade generously in emotional

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:15.319
currency, so as not always to have to pay
excessively in other, more practical denominations.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.290
Frequently, what is at stake within a negotiation
with someone is a request that they change

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.010
in some way: that they learn to be more punctual,
or take more trouble on a task, that they

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.209
be less defensive or more open-minded. The
diplomat knows how futile it is to state these

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.959
wishes too directly. They know the vast difference
between having a correct diagnosis of how

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.640
someone needs to grow and a relevant way to
help them do so. They know too that what holds

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.060
people back from evolution is fear – and
therefore grasp that what we may most need

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.909
to offer those whom we want to acknowledge
difficult things is, above anything else,

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.920
love and reassurance. It helps greatly to
know that those recommending change are not

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.319
speaking from a position of impregnable perfection
but are themselves wrestling with comparable

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.650
demons in other areas. For a diagnosis not
to sound like mere criticism, it helps for

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.430
it to be delivered by someone with no compunctions
to owning up to their own shortcomings. There

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.709
can be few more successful pedagogic moves
than to confess genially from the outset,

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:35.749
‘And I am, of course, entirely mad as well…’’
In negotiations, the diplomat is not addicted

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:41.439
to indiscriminate or heroic truth telling.
They appreciate the legitimate place that

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:48.700
minor lies can occupy in the service of greater
truths. They know that if certain local facts

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.390
are emphasised, then the most important principles
in a relationship may be forever undermined.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.760
So they will enthusiastically say that the
financial report or the homemade cake were

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.580
really very pleasing and will do so not to
deceive but to affirm the truth of their overall

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.379
attachment, which might be be lost were a
completely accurate account of their feelings

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.079
to be laid out. Diplomats know that a small
lie may have to be the guardian of a big truth.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.280
They appreciate their own resistance to the
unvarnished facts – and privately hope that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.650
others may on occasion, over certain matters,
also take the trouble to lie to them, and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.110
that they will never know. Another trait of
the diplomat is to be serene in the face of

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.030
obviously bad behaviour: a sudden loss of
temper, a wild accusation, a very mean remark.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.050
They don’t take it personally – even when
they may be the target of rage. They reach

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.069
instinctively for reasonable explanations
and have clearly in their minds the better

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.060
moments of a currently frantic but essentially
loveable person. They know themselves well

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.849
enough to understand that abandonments of
perspective are both hugely normal and usually

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.520
indicative of nothing much beyond exhaustion
or passing despair. They do not aggravate

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.919
a febrile situation through self-righteousness,
which is a symptom of not knowing oneself

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.289
too well – and of having a very selective
memory. The person who bangs a fist on the

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:30.210
table or announces extravagant opinions may
simply be rather worried, frightened or just

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.770
very enthusiastic: conditions that should
rightly invite sympathy rather than disgust.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.669
At the same time, the diplomat understands
that there are moments to sidestep direct

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.259
engagement. They do not try to teach a lesson
whenever it might first or most apply: they

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:54.720
wait till it has the best chance of being
heard. At points, they disarm difficult people

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.599
by reacting in unexpected ways. In the face
of a tirade, instead of going on the defensive,

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.090
the diplomatic person might suggest some lunch.
When a harshly unfair criticism is launched

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.320
at them, they might nod in partial agreement
and declare that they’ve often said such

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.960
things to themselves. They give a lot of ground
away and avoid getting cornered in arguments

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.270
that distract from the deeper issues. They
remember the presence of a better version

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:28.169
of what might be a somewhat unfortunate individual
currently on display. The diplomat’s tone

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.520
of reasonableness is built, fundamentally,
on a base of deep pessimism. They know what

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.939
the human animal is, they understand how many
problems are going to beset even a very good

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:44.759
marriage, business, friendship or society.
Their good humoured way of greeting problems

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.599
is a symptom of having swallowed a healthy
measure of sadness from the outset. They have

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.939
given up on the ideal, not out of weakness
but out of a mature readiness to see compromise

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:02.550
as a necessary requirement for getting by
in a radically imperfect world. The diplomat

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:09.229
may be polite, but they are not for that matter
averse to delivering bits of bad news with

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.150
uncommon frankness. Too often, we seek to
preserve our image in the eyes of others by

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.030
tiptoeing around the harsh decisions – and
thereby make things far worse than they need

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.419
to be. We should say that we’re leaving
them, that they’re fired, that their pet

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:29.040
project isn’t going ahead, but we mutter
instead that we’re a little preoccupied

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.870
at the moment, that we’re delighted by their
performance and that the project is being

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:40.000
actively discussed by the senior team. We
mistake leaving some room for hope with kindness.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.509
But true niceness does not mean seeming nice,
it means helping the people we are going to

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:52.310
disappoint to adjust as best they can to reality.
By administering a sharp, clean blow, the

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:58.020
diplomatic person kills off the torture of
hope, accepting the frustration that’s likely

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:05.260
to come their way: the diplomat is kind enough
to let themselves be the target of hate. The

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:12.449
diplomat succeeds because they are a realist;
they know we are inherently flawed, unreasonable,

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:17.919
anxious, comedically absurd creatures who
scatter blame unfairly, misdiagnose their

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:24.449
pains and react appallingly to criticism – especially
when it is accurate – and yet they are hopeful

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:29.409
too of the possibilities of progress when
our disturbances have been properly factored

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:33.820
in and cushioned with adequate reassurance,
accurate interpretation and respect. Diplomacy

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.930
seeks to teach us how many good things can
still be accomplished when we make some necessary

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:46.340
accommodations with the crooked, sometimes
touching and hugely unreliable material of human nature.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.300
