1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,980
Are we just saying that I'm beginning
to recognize some of you people.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,840
I would ideally like to have a class with
maybe just 10 students so that we can

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,290
have a lot of dialog and I can find
out what you're thinking about,

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,280
address your questions, that'll
make a lot of fun. But you know,

5
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:19,800
that's not possible in
an introductory course,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
but I think you should feel free to
interrupt or ask questions or discuss any

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,210
reasonably related issue
that I didn't get to. Okay.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,190
That would make it interesting
for everybody because I
told him many times the

9
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,100
subject is not new to me. It's
probably, it's new to you.

10
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,930
So what makes it interesting for me is
the fact that it's a different class with

11
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:47,620
a different set of people with
different questions. And Trust me, uh,

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,150
your ability to surprise me is
limitless because even on the subject,

13
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,030
which I thought is
firmly fixed in my mind,

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,420
some of you guys come up at some point
of view or some question that always of

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,480
interest to me or for people who have
been practicing this business for a long

16
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:07,830
time. So I welcome that. And
that'll make it more lightly.

17
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,780
All right,

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
so I think last time I got off on a
rant about all the different pedagogical

19
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:19,650
techniques,
some of which I don't endorse fully.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,250
I'm going to go back now 300 years in
time to one of the greatest laws that we

21
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,690
have. Because look at the power of
this wall right here is the equation

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,780
and all the mechanical phenomena that we
see around the world can be understood

23
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,714
with this law.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,430
And I was starting to give you examples
on how to put this lot of work because I

25
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:48,450
think I at least made you realize that
simply writing down the law does not give

26
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,520
me a good feeling for
how you actually use it.

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,510
So maybe you have understood it,

28
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:58,860
but I'm going to remind you one more time
on how you're supposed to use this law.

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,320
So I'm going to take a concrete example.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,660
The use of any law of physics is to
be able to predict something about the

31
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,060
future given something
of what the present.

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,810
So all problems that we solve
can be categorized that way.

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,550
So I'm going to take a very simple
problem problem to which I will return in

34
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:21,240
great detail later on. But
let me first start with, uh,

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,290
let me start with this problem,

36
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,790
which I will do very quickly now and we'll
come back and do it more slowly later.

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,330
But at least it's a country problem.
The problem looks like this.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,720
So here is a table and here's the spring,

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,940
here's some ass m there's
a forest constant, a,

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,680
I want to pull it by some amount of force
constant k I want to pull it by some

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,670
on capital a and let it go.

42
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,580
So that's the knowledge of the
present question is when I let it go,

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,750
what's this guy going to do?
That's the typical physics problem.

44
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,050
It can get more than a more complex.
You can replace the mass by planet.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,930
You can replace the spring by the sun,
which attracting the planet,

46
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,900
you can put many planets.
We can make it more and more complicated,

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,420
but they all boiled out
a similar situation.

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,560
I know some information now and I want
to be able to say what will happen next.

49
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,060
So he had to pulled the mass.

50
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,090
When I'm on a and I want
to know what it'll do next.

51
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,590
Remember when we go back to the loss of
Newton laws of Newton only tell you this

52
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:30,310
and we've been talking about
is this useful information?

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,200
First thing you have to know in
order to use the laws of Newton,

54
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,660
you have to separately,
no, the left hand side,

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,090
you have to know what force is going to
act on a body. You cannot simply say, oh,

56
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,200
I know the force of the body.

57
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:48,550
It does anytime say m a is
not a force acting on a body,

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,130
it's the response to it force.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,540
You gotta have some other means of finding
the force and in this case the force

60
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,950
on the masters due to the spring.

61
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,500
So I pull the spring by various
amounts and I see what force it exerts.

62
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,270
No, I think you know now in practice
how I know what force it exerts, right?

63
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,620
I pull it by some amount attached to
say the one kilogram standard mass.

64
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
I see what acceleration of experiences
and m times that acceleration or one

65
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,440
times the acceleration is
the force the spring exerts.

66
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,240
So I pull it up by various amounts and I
study this spring and I have learned by

67
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:30,241
studying the spring that the force it
exerts is some number k called the force

68
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,340
constant times.
The amount by which I pull it,

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,870
if I start off the mass in a position
by the spring is neither expat or not

70
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:42,610
contracted. That's what we
like to call x equal to zero.

71
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,820
So I pulled it to x equal to a,

72
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,270
now what I'm told is when
you pull it to any point x,

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,400
that's the forest to spring exerts.

74
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,580
So this is part of an independent study.
People who work in spring physics,

75
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,580
we'll study springs.
They will find out from you,

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,970
find out and tell you when
anytime you buy a spring from me,

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,280
it'll exit this force and they have done,

78
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,790
they figured that out by
pulling the spring and
attaching it to various entities

79
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,580
and seeing what acceleration it produces.

80
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,450
They're the masters I've taken to be
known because you can always borrow the

81
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:20,170
mass from the bureau of standards.
Are we discussed last time?

82
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,210
How if you have an unknown mass,

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,950
you can then compare it to this
mass and find out what its value is.

84
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,290
So every objects mass can be measured.

85
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,150
And then the guys making the
spring have studied what it does,

86
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,980
do different masses and figured this out.

87
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,680
Now you come with this mass and you say,
what happens when I connected?

88
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,700
Well I'm assuming the mass of this guy
can also be found by comparisons the way

89
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,270
I described to you last time. So we
can always find the mass of any object.

90
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,470
We went into some length.

91
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,410
Then Newton's law says this is equal to
m a but I want to write a as the second

92
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,244
derivative of.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,860
So you now go from a physical law,
but is really a postulate.

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,640
There is no way to derive f equals m a
you cannot just think about it and get

95
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:17,180
it. So whenever I do physics, I will
sometimes tell you this is a law.

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,610
That means don't even try to derive it.

97
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,630
Just summarizes everything we
know in terms of some new terms,

98
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,540
but it cannot be deduced.
On the other hand,

99
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:31,541
the fate of this mass can no be deduced
by applying Newton's law to this

100
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:35,690
equation. Now, this is a
new equation you men out.

101
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,890
I've seen this equation before.
For example, if I told you,

102
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,840
forget the lefthand side,

103
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:45,740
if it's totally the right hand side is
96 I think you guys know how to solve

104
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,450
that,
right?

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,370
You have to find a function
who is secondary [inaudible]
96 divided by m and you

106
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,210
all know how to do that.

107
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,420
It's t squared times a number and you
can fudge the numbers so it works.

108
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,980
This is more complicated.

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,270
The time delivered to have this
unknown function is not a given number,

110
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,550
but the unknown function itself. In other
words, x itself is a function of time.

111
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,420
This is called a differential equation.

112
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,770
A differential equation is an equation
that tells you something about an unknown

113
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,200
function in terms of its derivatives.

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,740
You can have a differential equation
in wall being the secondary way to the

115
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,350
first delivered to the 14th derivative,
whatever it is.

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,550
You're supposed to find out what
x of t is given this information.

117
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
So one thing is you can go to the
math department and say, hey look,

118
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,110
I got this equation. What's the
solution? And they will tell you now,

119
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,260
sometimes we have to do our own work and
we can solve this equation by guessing.

120
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,220
In fact, the only way to
solve a differential equation
is by guessing the answer.

121
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,720
There is no other way.

122
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,560
You can make a lot of guesses and every
time it works you'd be keep a little

123
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:56,240
table. Then you publish it called table
of integral. So I have in my office,

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,720
you'd huge table mark
capital's got his own integral.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,930
We don't leave home without our table
of intake notes. I got one at home,

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,820
I got one at work.

127
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,320
I may want to keep one of the car because
you just don't know when you will need

128
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,820
an integral. Okay, so people have
tabulated them over hundreds of years,

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,830
but how do they find them?

130
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,700
They are going to find them in the way
I'm going to describe to you now you look

131
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:22,400
at the equation and
you guessed the answer.

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,920
Let's make our life simple by taking a
case where the force constant is just one.

133
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,760
Okay, takes one Newton per
meter to stretch that spring.

134
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,760
I let the mass of the
object we want kilogram.

135
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,410
This is just to keep the Algebra simple.

136
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,660
Later on you can put any M and K and
we'll do all that. Then what am I saying?

137
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,270
I'm saying find me a function.

138
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,720
Who's second intervention
is minus that function.

139
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,460
Now as a word problem, maybe
it rings a bell, right?

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,230
Do you know such a function?
Uh,

141
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,790
explanation.
Yes.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,940
Exponential is good. Another one,
yes. Trigonometry functions that good,

143
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,020
so I'm going to temporarily
dismissed the exponential.

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,010
I will tell you why an exponential
function is actually a very good guess.

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,730
You can say x equals e
to the t for example.

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,760
The trouble is this is growing
exponentially and we know
this spring mass system,

147
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,610
the x is not growing exponentially.
Or it might say,

148
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,770
well let me fix that by making it minus t.

149
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,240
Then it quickly comes to rest after the
time and doesn't move. We saw the field,

150
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,860
we want this thing to be jiggling
around for a long time, so

151
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,830
the exponential function is even better
than this function because it says take

152
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:46,490
one deliberative and they reproduce
myself, but that's too much.

153
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:47,390
We only want to function.

154
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:50,690
That reproduces itself when you take
two derivatives and that's where the

155
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,160
trigonometry functions come in.

156
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,400
So I make a guess XFT this core scientists
and you can check if you take two

157
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,444
derivatives,

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
it'll basically equation the secondary
available avexis minus x itself.

159
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,110
But do I like this solution or that
there's something not fully satisfactory?

160
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,763
Yes,

161
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,500
you kept up the negative when
you, pardon me, it's great.

162
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,560
Actually t squared is,
that would be negative yet.

163
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,780
Oh, it will be negative
x. So let's do that.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
So let's take DXDT is equal to minus sine
t then take one more deliberative the

165
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:35,820
two x over Dt.
T square derivative of sine is cost side.

166
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,390
So this is minus cost sine t
but x was course scientist.

167
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,210
So it's really minus
of the excise started.

168
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,993
Yes.

169
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,170
So you had a question or
you wrote it up there.

170
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,280
Oh, this one? Yeah. Kotlon film. Yes.

171
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,170
That's a mistake.
Okay.

172
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,490
That should be minus very good.
Look,

173
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,610
it makes me mentally happy
when you guys catch me.

174
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,730
Of course it becomes an addiction. You try
to catch me. Sometimes it doesn't work,

175
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,480
but keep trying this time you
are absolutely right that way.

176
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,540
That's where you were looking confused.
Anything else?

177
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,930
Everyone followed the way this
very elementary problem is solved.

178
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,910
It's solved by making a guest. So
you're right. So the minus sign was one,

179
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,090
but now you agree everything is
working. This is the answer, but no,

180
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,970
I meant something else is not
quite okay with this. Yes.

181
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,550
Yeah.

182
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,990
That first of all I can add some sign
of TNL still work, but more importantly,

183
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:45,020
if I put t equal to zero
and you get x equal to one,

184
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,250
why should it be true that I
pulled it back exactly one meter?

185
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,740
I could have pulled it by
two or three at nine meters.

186
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,930
I want to be able to tell how much
I pulled it by a t equals zero.

187
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,550
Suppose it was pulled to five meters and
released. I want x of zero to be five.

188
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,780
The point is you can easily fix
that and putting a five here,

189
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,780
does it screw up everything?

190
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,781
It doesn't because the five just comes
along for the ride everywhere and don't

191
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,550
think it's five x because
this five is part of x.

192
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,710
So you can multiply your answer by any
number you like and you pick that number

193
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,740
which reproduces your
initial displacement.

194
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,890
So if you pulled it by five we put a
five so now we are very happy to describe

195
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,250
this problem. It is true. You can put
sign t but I will in this problem,

196
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,940
we don't need it. Here's an answer
that does everything you want it to do.

197
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,400
The initial time it gives you five Times
Square signed zero which is five and

198
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,880
that's what he told me was initial
displacement. Initial velocity.

199
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,670
If you take a DXDT is proportional,

200
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:51,610
the scientist and the t equals
zero that vanishes. That's correct.

201
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:54,710
You pull it and you let it go,
so the instant you released it,

202
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:59,711
it had no velocity and it satisfies
Newton's laws and that's your answer.

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,300
I want to do this simple example in
totality because this is the paradigm.

204
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,090
This is the example after which
everything else is model. Yes,

205
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,700
but me.
Ah,

206
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,130
you mean a t equal to zero. If the answer
was scientist, scientists vanishes,

207
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:26,131
the t equal to zero and of course it
doesn't manage has a robust value of one

208
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,650
but I want a value five.
I put a five in front look,

209
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,070
you guys may have a few more things to
say about this problem because this is

210
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:36,160
not the final and most general
solution to the problem.

211
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,990
It is a solution that certainly works
for the one example I had which is a mass

212
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,630
being pulled to five meters and released,

213
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,360
so carry this in your mind.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,440
This is really to me the most important
thing I can tell you right now,

215
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,961
the way I fake,

216
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:56,430
what's Mas applied in real life is half
the world is working on the lefthand

217
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,150
side. Finding the forces that act
on bodies under various conditions.

218
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,591
In this example,

219
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:07,280
the force due to a spring and by playing
with the spring you can study the force

220
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:11,200
that exerts had various displacements
at various amounts by which you pull it

221
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,560
and in this example if you
pull the spring by an amount x,

222
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,660
it exerts a force minus Kx and you can
measure k and you put the label on your

223
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,730
product and you sell the
spring with a given k.

224
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,920
Other people are measuring masters a
various objects and they've decided the

225
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,960
massive, this is whatever,
maybe one kilogram.

226
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,040
You put the two sides together and you
find the response of the system for all

227
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,510
future times and what this tells you.
Then you can apply this.

228
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,800
This is a graph that looks like this
goes from five to minus five and repeats

229
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,980
itself and it's very nice.
That's what we think the spring would do.

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,060
Now you think this is a real spring got,
I'm missing something.

231
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,040
This is the whole story.
Yes,

232
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,830
it's friction because we know
if you pull a real spring,

233
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,460
it's not going to oscillate forever.

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,050
It's going to slowly stop shaking
and pretty much come to rest.

235
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,200
That just means who do you want
to blame for this equation?

236
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,300
Do we conclude now that something wrong
with Newton's laws or what's the problem?

237
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,183
Pardon me?

238
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,210
Uh, the fault is not with a k. Yes.

239
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,780
Taking the capital that is correct.

240
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,870
So we will say we have missed something
that's another force acting on this mass

241
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,900
besides the spring.

242
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,950
That's the force of friction that'll
oppose the motion of the mass.

243
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,200
So you can say one of two things.

244
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,150
Either you can say something is
wrong with Newton's laws are,

245
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,130
you can say we have not applied Newton's
laws properly because we haven't

246
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,730
identified all the forces.
So if you'd never knew about friction,

247
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,440
you do this and you find, hey, it
doesn't work. The mass comes to rest.

248
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,450
Where does the theory
says isolate forever.

249
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,160
So you are at a fork a that you
can say Newton philoso right.

250
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,550
I'm missing some forces. I'm going to
look around and find out what they are.

251
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,610
Then you will derive
friction from that art.

252
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,380
Maybe it's time to give up Newton's laws.

253
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,580
It turns out even if there is no friction,
this is not the correct law. Physics,

254
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,340
correct lies given by Einstein's
relativistic dynamics that this does not

255
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:21,440
satisfy the relativistic dynamics.

256
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,960
By that I mean if you really pull a real
mass by five meters or whatever it and

257
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,440
release it is,
motion will not be exactly what I said.

258
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,050
What would it be off by a very,
very,

259
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:36,770
very tiny amount that you probably
will not discover in most laboratories,

260
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,660
but if the mass begins to move
with velocity is comparable
to that of light than

261
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:46,070
this equation will be wrong. So people
say, oh, what kind of business are you in?

262
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,430
Every once in a while somebody is wrong.
I tell you right now,

263
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,150
everything we know is wrong. You know
it's no secret. You can publish it.

264
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:56,630
You can tell the whole world, this
practitioner said everything is wrong,

265
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,050
but it's wrong in this limited sense.
Is Newton right or wrong? Well,

266
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:04,280
Newton didn't try to describe things
moving at speeds, comparable delight.

267
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,950
You dealt with what problem he
could deal with at that time.

268
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,130
So it's a lot of that has it
limited domain of validity.

269
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,480
You can always push the
frontiers of observation.

270
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,320
Did you come to a situation where the law
doesn't work but the special theory of

271
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:22,190
relativity doesn't also work all the time.
If the mass becomes very tiny,

272
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,280
becomes off atomic dimension, then you
need the laws of quantum mechanics.

273
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,840
That's wrong too.

274
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,980
So things work in a certain domain and
sometimes you abandoned the formalism but

275
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,060
don't rush to do that.
In this case,

276
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,820
the problem is not with
formulas but due to friction.

277
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,430
So you have to make sure
you've got all the forces.

278
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,370
Once you got all the forces
is still doesn't work,

279
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,610
then of course the experimentalists are
very happy because there's something

280
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:50,820
wrong with the theory. Then you got to
find the new theory till that works.

281
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,350
Okay, so that's the cycle.
So it's an ongoing process.

282
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,090
Physics is still a work in progress.

283
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,810
This is work it a 300
years ago and no one's fun.

284
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,580
Anything wrong with Newton's
laws provided. You don't
violate two conditions.

285
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,160
You don't deal with objects moving at
speeds comparable to that of light and you

286
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,200
don't deal with the objects
which are very, very tiny.

287
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,890
The notion of watch video tiny will
be very clear when you learn quantum

288
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:21,180
mechanics. Next term, right now
that is something rough called tiny.

289
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:24,420
There's things like atomic dimensions.
All right,

290
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,740
so now we are going to do
more concrete problems,

291
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,770
but I wanted to write that up for you
as a simple solvable worked out example

292
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:40,950
that displays everything that
happens in physics. All right,

293
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,180
so by the way, people are always looking
for new forces, electrical forces.

294
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,990
You find the charge on a table,
it's not connected to a spring.

295
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,080
I bring another charge next to
it and this guy starts moving.

296
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,580
What do I do about the
accelerating without any force?

297
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,540
I can say Newton is wrong or I can say
maybe there's a new force between that

298
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,080
body and this body and that will
turn out to be the electrical force.

299
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,370
Electrical force occurs. Whenever
you take something, you know,

300
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,730
you take a cat and you take a
piece of amber are, you rub it,

301
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,320
you do various things,

302
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,800
then you put them next to other things
and they're attracted or repelled and you

303
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:21,720
discover you're charging things that, so
electricity with discovery, but you know,

304
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,610
you don't have to have a cat.
If you have a buffalo,

305
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,130
you can take it to the
buffalo still works.

306
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,610
Then you got to find out what you
really need to find electric forces.

307
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,030
But you find that it's a new force and
you know you've got a whole new forced to

308
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:36,670
study. Then you got to find out
what's the cost of the force turn.

309
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,260
Salary's not the mass of the object.
If something else called electric charge,

310
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,530
then how does the force
very, with distance, uh,

311
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,020
well it varies like one over r squared,
you know that.

312
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:49,770
So that's how you slowly
study and identify new forces.

313
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,800
So the forces were found in the order of
gravitation first and then electricity

314
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:56,521
and magnetism.

315
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,970
And now of course there are new forces
called strong forces that are weak forces.

316
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,860
They are acting the sub nuclear level.
So that's why that business is not done.

317
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,550
We are not finished with the left
hand side is looking for new forces.

318
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,051
Okay,

319
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:15,051
so now I'm going to start doing
problems in two dimensions.

320
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,690
Everything I did last time is one d.
You know you're pulling something,

321
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:21,990
you're pushing something, you got one
blog connected to the second block,

322
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,120
third block and you pull it.
We have done all that.

323
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,570
So we're going to elevate
this to higher dimensions.

324
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,030
And as you know in higher dimensions,

325
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,580
acceleration is a vector and so forced
better be a vector because when you take

326
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,230
a vector,
multiply it by a number,

327
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,940
you get something else and there by
that process you've gone to higher

328
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:42,774
dimensions.

329
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,670
So let's take again simple problems and
try to make the motor more complex and

330
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,560
you cannot tell me eventually you
agree the problem is complex enough.

331
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,520
I will crank it up as we go along.
Some point you plead for mercy,

332
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:01,510
then we'll stop.

333
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
But there is no limit to how
difficult mechanics problems can be.

334
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,640
If you go back and read
Cambridge University exams
in 1600 and 1700 they have a

335
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,690
really difficult problems.
That's why we invented quantum mechanics,

336
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,870
which is a lot easier than those
problems from Newtonian mechanics.

337
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,980
You can make it as hard as you like.
So I'm just going to do a few.

338
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:25,060
Then once you got the idea you stock, but
again, we're going to start with easy.

339
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:30,061
One easy one is a table on which this
master sitting doing absolutely nothing.

340
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,480
And we want to study that guy and
understand it in terms of Newton's laws

341
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,230
because we had in two dimensions
you gotta have two axes.

342
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,080
So here is my ex and hate us.
My why.

343
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,340
So the first rule is if ethic was m
a we are really saying I at times Fx,

344
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,620
let's DF times ef.

345
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:58,621
Why is m I x Plus N J

346
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,020
a y?
It's a vector equation.

347
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,150
The force has to be a combination of
my and j because nobody, by the way,

348
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm working in the x y plane.

349
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,010
I told you I don't need to go to three
d for a long time in three every back.

350
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,990
Does someone want to buy in some
amount of j. That's what drew forever.

351
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,140
That's true for day. You write it out.
Then I told you have two vectors at equal.

352
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,360
Then the next components have to match

353
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,180
and the white parts also have to match.

354
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,030
You can see that if I draw two arrows on
the plane and I tell you this Arrow is

355
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,980
the same as that Arrow,
it's the same.

356
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,890
It's got the same horizontal
parked in the same vertical part.

357
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,960
So this is really two equations and
I'm going to play them to this block.

358
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,490
So when I look at this
block in the x direction,

359
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,820
it's not moving at all that are known.

360
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:56,260
Law enforces acting in the x direction
and that therefore is the case of zero

361
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,000
equals zero.
Did I miss something?

362
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,240
You guys look a little worried?
Yes.

363
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,683
Okay.

364
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,760
Okay. Now I look in the y direction.
If I look in the way that action,

365
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,200
I take this block and had rides
free body diagram, namely,

366
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:20,400
I write all the forces on it.
So that is the force of gravity.

367
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,830
M g wait, this. Sam is a
big game are smaller than,

368
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,380
Oh let's change the figure two small lamp
so that the rest of the equations are

369
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:33,510
right. The little mg is acting
down. If that's all you had,

370
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,110
the block would fall through the table.
It's not doing that to the table.

371
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,580
We know is exerting a force.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,690
The Standard Name for that
is n and n Stanford. Normal.

373
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,340
Normal is a mathematical
for perpendicular.

374
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,050
You say this vector is normal to that
vector you mean they are perpendicular and

375
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,570
here we mean this force is
perpendicular to the table.

376
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,040
They had the forces in the y direction
in the y direction and is a positive

377
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:04,120
force with a plus sign mds,

378
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:07,610
a negative force and that's
equal to m times a. Why?

379
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,820
It's interesting that in this
application of the Newtonian equation,

380
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,730
I'm going to say that I
know the right hand side.

381
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,670
I know the right hand side is zero because
I know this block is neither sinking

382
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:26,420
into the table, not flying off
the table is sitting on the table.

383
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:29,480
It has no velocity.
It does no acceleration vertically.

384
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,400
So that has to be zero because I know
the right hand side is that Newton's laws

385
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,770
quite often either I will know the
leftover, I will know that right?

386
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,470
Either I will know the force that
I will know the acceleration.

387
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,040
So if this is zero,
I come to the conclusion and equal same g,

388
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,930
this very simple example,

389
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,920
but this is how have
you figured out why the,

390
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:56,660
how the Newton's laws work in
this particular problem. Okay,

391
00:24:56,661 --> 00:25:01,661
now I'm ready to introduce another
force and that's the force of friction

392
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,650
as you all seem to be aware that his van,

393
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:14,300
really a force of friction between
this mass m and this table.

394
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,360
So how do we learn that is a force
of friction. Suppose someone said,

395
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,810
how do you know what that is?
Friction. Here's the mass.

396
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,180
What experiment will you
do that tells you, hey,

397
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:29,960
that is another force called
friction. Can anybody tell me? Yeah,

398
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,600
something you would do?
Yes.

399
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,390
Okay.

400
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,560
Okay. What's up? It's on this table, but
you are around. You can do what you want.

401
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,240
Yes,
go ahead.

402
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,153
Constant.

403
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,560
That's possible. That's good.
That's a very good answer.

404
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:55,820
One answer it is. You find that to
keep it moving at constant velocity,

405
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,500
you have to apply a force.

406
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,870
That means the 48 applying is canceled
by somebody else because that is zero

407
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,900
acceleration. That's
gotta be Zero Force. Yes.

408
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,600
Just apply force to personal day.
Everyone knows.

409
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,810
And that tells you that there
must be a force that's active.

410
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,390
Very good. I'd even before that,
even before it starts moving,

411
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,520
you find that if you push
it, it doesn't move. Right.

412
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,740
I tried to push the podium.
Well I don't know my own strength,

413
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:29,490
but I'm going to imagine I pushed it. It's
not moving. But if I push hard enough,

414
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,720
it will move. What's happening before
it moves? I'm applying a force.

415
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,250
I'm getting nothing in return for it.

416
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,560
So I know that is another force opposing
what I do and that's called the force

417
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:44,790
of static friction.
The static is when the body is not moving.

418
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,020
So I'm applying a force F uh,

419
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,730
let me give it some other name.
Little F. No, that's not so bad.

420
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,410
Little left was the name for friction.

421
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,970
So I'm going to play force calledF sub me.

422
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,530
You can label these things
anyway you like, okay,

423
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,520
this particular rotation that's not
caught on because people are not as

424
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,140
interested in what I think as I am, but
right now I'm going to call it f sub me.

425
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,400
I invite you to invent any notation
you want because there's nothing sacred

426
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,890
about rotation. At least I want
to convey to you that north.

427
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,550
So I call it f sub me,
I'm applying to the right.

428
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,550
Then I know that it's not moving that
forward. That has been other force,

429
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:31,980
that cancer suit. But how
much is the other force? Yes,

430
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,360
that's correct.
So it is not a fixed force.

431
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,170
Static friction is not a fixed force.

432
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,130
It's whatever it takes
to keep it from moving.

433
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,290
It will not be less than what
I applied because then remove.

434
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,960
It cannot be more than what our plight
because then we'll start moving backwards

435
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,380
so it will do what it takes
to keep it from moving.

436
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,980
So static friction is a force which
has a range from zero to some maximum.

437
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,240
So let's call it the force of friction
is less than or equal to some maximum.

438
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,490
Yeah.

439
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,490
And that maximum turns out to be a
number called the coefficient of static

440
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,110
friction times the normal force.

441
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,090
The force of friction seems to depend
on how much normal fourth the table is

442
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:28,230
exerting on the object,
which in our example, if you
want to do, in our example,

443
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,240
not always,
this is always true,

444
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,570
but in our example you made a place it
by new s times mg because Anders equal

445
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,800
AMG. So the force of friction seems
to depend on how heavy the object is,

446
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:45,300
the sitting on the table. But what does
it not depend on that it could depend on?

447
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,620
Can you think of something else?
Could depend on but doesn't. Yes.

448
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,760
The amount of surface area that seems
to have been depending on the area of

449
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:57,120
contact. In other words, if
this was a rectangular block,

450
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,290
it doesn't seem to matter whether it's
doing that or whether it's doing that.

451
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,250
You might think, hey, that's gotta be more
friction because there's more contact,

452
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,110
but it doesn't. So it's interesting.
Not only what it is, but what is not.

453
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,080
Okay. This is called the
corporate and status friction,

454
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:18,081
so I guess you guys should remember
that the force that friction applies is

455
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,020
equal to the force that I apply up to
a maximum of this and once I beat the

456
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:29,340
maximum, it'll give up and it'll
start moving. Once it starts moving,

457
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,440
you're going to have
a situation like this.

458
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,830
I apply episode me this way and friction
will apply a force which now is called

459
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,100
Musa Kinetic Times normal.

460
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,010
So the force of friction is different
when it's moving a Scott, by the way,

461
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:49,990
it is not moving is slightly
less once the body is in motion.

462
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,110
So it's always true for all situation.

463
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,320
Musa kinetic is less than Muse of static.

464
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,530
Okay, so this is how you categorize
friction. You study various objects,

465
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:12,130
then you find out friction certainly
depends on the nature of the two surfaces.

466
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,080
Given that constant,

467
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,950
it seems to depend only on the
normal force and not on the 18th

468
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,710
yes,
less than the maximum.

469
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,990
I remember we were sub candidate
is a fixed number, right?

470
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Maybe point to Musa static as a fixed
number 0.25 if it's 0.25 for static it

471
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:42,131
means if the normal force to some mg
up to quarter of the weight is the

472
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:47,930
frictional force.
It can apply to preventives motion stop.

473
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,860
I say I play a force on a body which
is originally one 10th of its weight.

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,180
It won't move to 10 type its weight.
It won't move quarter of its weight.

475
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,040
It's a tight 0.26 situate him
start moving once it starts moving.

476
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,030
Frictional Force will
be 0.2 times its weight.

477
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,010
9.2 is because the kinetic
friction is less. This is,

478
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,250
yes. The summary of friction. Okay.

479
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,830
So far even though I used vectors,

480
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,800
most of the action is just in
one or the other direction.

481
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,453
Yes.

482
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,250
No, it against seems it can
actually depend on many things.

483
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,910
Friction is something we don't understand
fully but it depends only on the

484
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,620
normal force.
Just the way I described.

485
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,333
Okay.

486
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:40,670
Now we are going to do the one problem
that has sent more people away from

487
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:44,940
physics than anything else.
Do you know what it is?

488
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,190
You haven't heard about the
problem that sends people away?

489
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,090
Okay?
This is called the inclined plane.

490
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,470
A lot of people may not remember
where they were during the Kennedy

491
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:05,160
assassination, but they say, I remember
the day I saw the inclined plane.

492
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,660
That's the day I said I'm not going
into physics because this is very bad

493
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,610
publicity for our field.
You know,

494
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,810
you come into the subject
hearing volatility and quantum
mechanics and then art,

495
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,680
maybe gravitation and astrophysics.
And we hit you with this.

496
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,610
So why am I doing this?
Well,

497
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,460
if you can do this and you find it boring,
you can move on.

498
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,540
But if you couldn't do this,

499
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:32,100
you have no right to complain because this
is the entry ticket into the business.

500
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,870
You gotta be able to do this only then
I can tell you other things. Okay?

501
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:41,600
So we have to, we'll do this
quickly watching the clock.
I won't linger over this,

502
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,640
but we have to do this
problem. Okay? So let's,

503
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,380
let's quickly finish this problem.

504
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:53,381
So here is the problem that isn't
mass m sipping on the inclined plane.

505
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,950
It makes them angle here.
You want to know what it's gonna do?

506
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,400
All right,
we know it's going to slide down the hill.

507
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,590
What do you want to be more precise?

508
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,250
And the whole purpose of Newton's laws
is to quantify things for which you

509
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,300
already have an intuition.

510
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,740
So the only novel thing about inclined
plane is that for the first time we are

511
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:17,210
going to pick out x and y axes.

512
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,150
Not along the usual directions,

513
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,400
but along and perpendicular to the
implant. That's going to be my accent.

514
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,450
That's going to be my why.

515
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,040
And I ask what are the
forces on this mass?

516
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,440
Well, I've told you first
deal with contact forces.

517
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,080
The only thing in contact
with the mass is the plane.

518
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,050
The inclined plane can exert a force
in general along its own surface and

519
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,800
perpendicular to own surface.
But I'm going to take a case,

520
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:53,270
but there is no friction.
There's no friction by definition.

521
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,340
It cannot exert a force
along his own length.

522
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,300
So it can only exert a force in this
direction. And we're going to call that an

523
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,990
then there's only one other force. That's
the force of gravity, which we agreed.

524
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:09,750
We have to remember, even though
the earth is not touching this,

525
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:14,190
block it or to somewhere down here is able
to reach out and pull this block down.

526
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,570
So let me show you the forces.
So here is an,

527
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,600
and here it is mg,

528
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,790
study your forces and with no friction,
that's it.

529
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,960
That's the key to doing any
problem I give you in any exam,

530
00:34:30,961 --> 00:34:32,040
no matter how stressful,

531
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,620
I guarantee you would get it from Newton's
laws provided you write every force

532
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,740
that is there and don't write any
force that is not there. So this is it.

533
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,640
You said the two forces and the mass will
do what these four says tell it to do.

534
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,200
So what we want to do then since
my access or in this direction,

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,590
I have to take this AMG and write
it as the sum of two vectors.

536
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,370
A one witness pointing in this direction
and one which is pointing in that

537
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,100
direction. So if I add
these two arrows, I get mg,

538
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,480
that's called resolving the forced
into some other directions. Now,

539
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:12,210
the key to all of this is
to know that this angle here

540
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,300
is the same as this angle here.
Other words,

541
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:20,970
if AMG is acting down,

542
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,690
that angle data is the same
as this angle data here.

543
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,870
This is going to be used all the time.

544
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,990
I'll tell you a little trick that tells
you how, how you figured that out.

545
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,730
Data is the angle between the
horizontal and the incline.

546
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,490
Now you've got to agree that if I draw a
perpendicular to the horizontal and the

547
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:42,330
draw perpendicular,

548
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:46,410
the incline angle between
those two perpendiculars
will be the same as the angle

549
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:50,010
between the two lines they began with
because perpendicular means rotate 90

550
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,150
rotate both lines by 90 the angle
between the rotator lines at the same,

551
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,780
the vertical is perpendicular to this
horizontal and this is the perpendicular

552
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:03,660
to the plane. Once you got
that, the rest is pretty easy.

553
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,440
So in the x direction I'm going to write
the following equation mg times sine

554
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:12,390
theta.

555
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:17,390
So you've got to understand that this
part here will be mg time scientists and

556
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:21,580
this part here will be empty
at times cause scientists,

557
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,860
you've got this something you'd better
get really used to it for vectors like

558
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:29,640
this and you want the force in that
direction, the angle, but fitness data.

559
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,200
Then you put the cost side,

560
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,120
the component that's adjacent to the
vector of course sign of the this one here

561
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:40,740
is a data. So I got the horizontal
part in the x direction.

562
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,140
I got MTA assigned data and that's it.

563
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,020
There's nothing else that's
gotta be equal to m times X.

564
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,850
Remember x is not horizontal.

565
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,350
A access along the inclined
downhill in the y direction.

566
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,800
I write n minus AMG consigned
data is m times a y.

567
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,780
That's simply writing down
Newton's laws as two laws,

568
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,320
one along x and one along why
and putting in whatever Reno.

569
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,060
What happens next is up to
what else we know, well,

570
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,510
we know that this block
is sliding down the hill.

571
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,760
It's not going into the block,

572
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,430
not as it flying out of the
block is moving along the plot.

573
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,660
That's the reason we chose the coordinate
to be perpendicular to the block

574
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:33,270
because that coordinate the
white coordinates not changing.

575
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,610
Even even though the block is sliding
down the hill when it's sliding down the

576
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:41,910
hill, the usual x and y coordinates,
if you define them this way,

577
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:42,744
they're all changing.

578
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,300
But by this clever choice is always at
y equal to zero. So he does know why.

579
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,120
Coordinators know why velocity
does know why acceleration.

580
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,980
So we know this guy is zero.

581
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:58,590
So this is an example of where we know
the acceleration by this kind of argument.

582
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,280
From that we did use that n
has to be mg cause scientists.

583
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,620
Okay then you come to
this fella here they had,

584
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:16,630
we found out that x you canceled the
m and defined as equal a g scientist.

585
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,440
So that's the big result.

586
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,740
It looks like down the hill with
an acceleration g signed data.

587
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,100
This is a good way to measure the g by
the way because if you drop something,

588
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,740
it falls too fast. What
do you do? Payment.

589
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,880
But if you let it go down an
incline by making data very small,

590
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,680
so it's is very in the gate, in the
very low, the body can accelerate, uh,

591
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:43,190
with a much slower acceleration downhill
because there's reduced by this factor

592
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:47,040
assigned data. Okay? Yes.

593
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,690
Another thing I should tell you right now,

594
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,530
most of us when we become professionals,

595
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,210
don't put the numbers till the very end.

596
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,220
So if you're told the [inaudible]
angle of 37 degrees, g is 9.8.

597
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,360
Don't start putting numbers into the
first equation. We don't do that.

598
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,400
And I know for some of
you it's pretty traumatic.

599
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,720
The work with symbols and
sometimes an exams, they say, Oh,

600
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:16,590
you had all these problems with symbols,
but I want to sell you another idea.

601
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,070
It's much better to work with
symbols then with numbers to Leanne,

602
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,520
why is that? First of all, if you put
numbers in and I suddenly tell you,

603
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:30,030
hey, I was wrong about the slope
is really 39 degrees and not 37,

604
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:31,680
you're going to do the
whole calculation again.

605
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,310
But this way you come to the formula
and you say, what's your data?

606
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,920
You changed your mind.
Okay, that's the new data.

607
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,010
You changed the value of g you
made a better, better measurement.

608
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,990
That's the answer. Then you can see if
your problem have some mistakes in it.

609
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,070
Suppose you've got g squared or scientist,

610
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,700
you will know it's wrong because this is
an acceleration. That's an acceleration.

611
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,970
Units have to match and signed it.
Of course there's no units.

612
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,910
Then maybe you got the trigonometry wrong.
Maybe it's really [inaudible].

613
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,480
That should be the right answer. How do
an old signed data? You can do a test.

614
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,950
We know for example, as the incline
becomes less and less inclined,

615
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,570
you've got to get less and
less acceleration because
it's going down hill less

616
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:19,980
and less and theater goes to small values.
X also diminishes

617
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,370
all right if you'll take your incline and
you really make it almost vertical and

618
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:27,900
in the end you make a completely vertical.

619
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,640
The block is just falling under gravity.

620
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,310
[inaudible] is 90 it becomes g
so you can test your results,

621
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,480
so be prepared for that part.
If you are in this course,

622
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,090
I will give you some homework problems
in which the numbers are not put into

623
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:46,560
liberty and that I may not even ask you
to put the numbers in because the thing

624
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:49,830
is to get this formula because anyone
can take the numbers and put them in the

625
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:50,664
calculator.

626
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,850
So that's going to be a part
of our agreement that we
will work with symbols and

627
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,500
if we look at any calculation we do,
if you caught me in my office,

628
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,840
I am not putting numbers in very early.

629
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,510
I mean I cannot wait to
find out what the answer is,

630
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,390
but I keep the symbols to end.
Then I put the numbers.

631
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,950
Then you can very different numbers. You
can say, what if the gravity was weaker?

632
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,580
I go up to Denver and do the experiment
but I get a different answer. You will.

633
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,510
So how things depend on the input
parameters is interesting. Yes.

634
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:19,890
Another interesting result.

635
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,970
What is missing in this formula
that could have been there?

636
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,520
I'd make the mass. It doesn't
seem to matter what the object is.

637
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,070
That's an interesting property
of the dissolved. Right?

638
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:37,250
And that's because m cancer load
of the two sides of that equation.

639
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,290
So these are all interesting features
you would not know if you kept numbers

640
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,580
everywhere and you get a equal to
0.62 meters per second square to meet.

641
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:49,580
That number doesn't tell me as much in
the end I want to know the number but the

642
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,910
formula is very interesting.
All right,

643
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:56,510
so now we're going to make
it a little more complicated.

644
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,200
We are going to now add friction to this.

645
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,740
So he hit us the block but now
does the Coefficient of friction.

646
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,360
Let's say the block is uh, let's
ask the polling. Simple question.

647
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,490
I think it was related to
what one of you guys said.

648
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:20,080
Let the blog be at rest and
data is an angle. I can vary.

649
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,110
Maybe that is a little thingy here.
You can turn it back and forth.

650
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,380
Let me crank up data and see when it
will start slipping. In other words,

651
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:31,470
there is a coefficient of static
friction between the block and the plane.

652
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,310
And I want to know like parking
your car in San Francisco.

653
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:38,040
What angle can it take before
it starts sliding down?

654
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,030
So let's write the forces and
let's write f equals I may.

655
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,760
So the forces are again right here.
Let me cut to the chase and Wright,

656
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:51,180
MD Cosa and data here and here.

657
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,730
AMG signed data here.
Watch la right for friction.

658
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,710
Do not write mu s times then because the
frictional force is anything you need

659
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:09,720
optimum us times. In other words, if
they had that was very small and empty,

660
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:13,270
signed data is very small, the frictional
force will be, in fact MD scientists.

661
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,590
It'll equal whatever it takes
to keep it from slipping.

662
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,320
But if I cranked up the angle to that
maximum angle beyond which it cannot stay

663
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:24,090
there,
let's give a name to that angle.

664
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:27,150
That is sine theta star
at the maximum angle.

665
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,910
Friction is doing the
maximum thing it can do.

666
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Then we can certainly say mg sine theta
is then equal to the static friction

667
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,513
times n,

668
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,200
which is now mu s times mg coastline data.

669
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,180
Again,
the mass cancels,

670
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:48,150
so it doesn't matter what kind
of car you parked on the slope.

671
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:51,630
It only depends on the following.
G can some stew.

672
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,680
So where did you park your car in the
air at the park it on another planet.

673
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,220
This is going to be the same restriction,
which is that temp data

674
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,100
has to be less than or equal to us equal.
The US is the critical value.

675
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,980
Less than that is acceptable.
Okay?

676
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,640
That's a simple problem. If you tilt it
the more than that, it will topple over.

677
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,040
So now let's take another problem
where the block has started moving.

678
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,990
It's going down the hill. Now
what formula do way, right?

679
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,910
You notice that I'm not writing every
step, every time it's time I deal with it.

680
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:32,940
I'm going to do some things faster. But
example, I already dissolved gravity.

681
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:36,210
The two parts of it are going through
the whole song and dance because you know

682
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:38,700
how to do that.
Now I put in the friction.

683
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,730
So now make God a muse of Kennedy,

684
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,790
not equal equals zero mass is moving.

685
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,170
You can ask,
and I'll watch the acceleration now.

686
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,960
So the horizontal equation along
x is going to be AMG scientists.

687
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:59,850
Data minus mew candidate
times a normal force.

688
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,220
But allow me to write for the normal
force AMG course and data that's gotta be

689
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:10,221
equal to m times X.

690
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,490
No. Can you do this? That's the test.

691
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,610
This is not enough to watch
me do this and say, okay,

692
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:20,180
he seems to know what he's doing.
The question is, can you do this?

693
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:21,380
Would you have thought about this?

694
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,120
Do you agree that I'm not doing anything
beyond Newton's laws when I do this?

695
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,940
Yes. Each one of you should
ask, if you cannot do that,

696
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:33,760
you have to deal with that now because
this is only going to get component.

697
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,350
On the other hand,
if you can do this,

698
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,390
you know everything I
know about Newton's laws,

699
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,400
this is all that is to Newton's laws and
how to apply them. So you cancel the em.

700
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,540
So notice here,
this is the normal force,

701
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:50,040
but I've taken the why equation that
says normal force is MD codes and data.

702
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,213
Put that here.

703
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,730
Then I find acceleration is g Damon's
sine theta minus mew subcommittee.

704
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,950
Of course scientists.

705
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:10,990
Okay. Yeah, that's the result. A
X, this is what I'm calling a no.

706
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,020
I want to study this in Beatty has limits.

707
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,320
First limit I take is no
coefficient of kinetic friction.

708
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,910
I get back to my signed data.
Well, let me try the following.

709
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,870
Interesting limit.

710
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,220
I crank up the coffees and the kinetic
friction more and more and more.

711
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,540
Look what happens here.
Scientists and [inaudible] fixed numbers.

712
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,620
If this become larger than
some amount than say a 10 data,

713
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:37,760
what happens to the expression?

714
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,270
A is negative. And what does that
mean? Block is moving uphill hill.

715
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,510
Do you buy that? So what's wrong? I mean,
I took the equation right. I told you,

716
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,760
told you all the time. Have you can
study various limits. Something is wrong.

717
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,250
It says if kinetic friction is very
large block, we'll move up here.

718
00:46:59,160 --> 00:46:59,993
Okay.

719
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,380
Uh, that's not the reason. Yes.

720
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,700
Oh,
uh,

721
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,690
oh, that's not the reason. Uh, why made
you can, you can also vary the angles.

722
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,280
Maybe keeping care of Sun Valley,

723
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,990
the angles so that this number of times
that can beat this, then what happens?

724
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,003
Yes.

725
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,860
You were already assigned the direction
downhill.

726
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:32,840
That is the point. Okay. Did let me repeat
his answer. That's the correct answer.

727
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,970
You're right. Board candidate being
less than static and so on, but are,

728
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:39,280
you can always imagine
keeping that number constant,

729
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,280
but changing the angle to the coast and
gets bigger in size and get smaller.

730
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:42,851
At some point,

731
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:46,930
the agree coastline will beat the site
because sign is going towards zero and

732
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,670
costs and going towards
one or the correct answer.

733
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:52,450
It is in writing this force law,

734
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,590
I'm assuming the force of friction
points to the left uphill.

735
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,970
That is correct only if the
body is moving downhill,

736
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,710
but if you've got an answer, but Ava's
negatives, definitely going up hill,

737
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,240
the starting premise is wrong,

738
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,400
so one videos for lesson to learn
here is when you apply a formula,

739
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,610
don't forget the conditions under
which you derive it and don't apply the

740
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:21,611
results to a case where the answer
does not belong to the domain that you

741
00:48:22,971 --> 00:48:24,200
assumed you're applying it to.

742
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,280
The trouble with friction
is the following.

743
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:34,150
Friction is not a definite fours with
a definite magnitude art direction.

744
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,010
This magnitude is definite, but
direction is not definite. It is uphill.

745
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:42,940
If you're going downhill, it's down
nearly. If you're going up hill, okay?

746
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,130
It's like the constant
opposition to motion,

747
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,400
bad as force of gravity,
the normal force,

748
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:51,950
everything else is fixed that actually
you can try it once and for all.

749
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,460
So in a formula where the forces
are what they are in any context,

750
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,290
you can apply the formula in any limit.

751
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,410
But if the frictional force
assumed a downward motion,

752
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,320
don't apply it when the block is going on.
Okay?

753
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:08,930
So I'm going to do one more of
this inclined planes and then, uh,

754
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,460
pretty much done with inflamed play.

755
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,810
Okay?
This is the problem off to masses.

756
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,740
Uh,
that is a rope that goes over the pulley.

757
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,630
Let's call this little lamb that's called
that big game at this angle. Again,

758
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:34,240
stay down and no friction.

759
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,180
You can mix and match various things.

760
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:39,970
But let's keep friction out because I'm
planning to do something different here.

761
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,943
Okay?

762
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,900
So do we want to know what
these guys will do now?

763
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,830
So first guest is, well am looks, capital
m looks so impressive, competitive,

764
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:56,670
small am so maybe it'll go downhill if
I realize that of course fallacy because

765
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:57,870
capital Emma's a symbol,

766
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,340
the value associated with maybe
one 10th that was smaller,

767
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,100
but the big end really is bigger
than small and then am I short?

768
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:05,934
It'll go downhill.

769
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,093
Yeah.

770
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:15,240
Pardon me. Has to be
good though. No, no, no.

771
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:17,940
I'm saying the, the big mass m
is bigger than the small mass.

772
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:20,040
And is that enough to say
we'll go downhill? Yes.

773
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,590
Depends on the angle because part of the
mass is not helpful in going downhill.

774
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:31,070
See if I had a pulley like this,
then you want absolutely right.

775
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,940
Big Guy Wins.
Now it's not clear because uh,

776
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,070
this has got all of
gravity pulling it down.

777
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:41,630
This got only part of gravity pulling
it down. So let's skip this direction.

778
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,650
It's not very interesting.

779
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,670
Let's look at this direction for
risk equation is the following.

780
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,010
If I just took that block,

781
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,050
it's got AMG scientist acting down and
this rope will exert a certain tension t

782
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:01,700
here, which I don't know. Under
the combined effect of these two.

783
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,930
I can say mg scientific data is equal to,

784
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,830
I'm sorry,
minus t physical,

785
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:13,880
the m a but a is assumed to
be positive going down here.

786
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,710
That's one equation. Then I come
to this fellow here, this block,

787
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,770
well, it's got little AMG acting
down and tension acting up.

788
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,750
I'm sorry guys.
I made one mistake here.

789
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:32,160
I think you'll know what it is
or this should be capital am

790
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,510
I should be capital m
salary for that and capital

791
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,630
for small n the equation is t minus M g.

792
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,420
Now let's be careful with what I do next.

793
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:53,630
I'm going to say little m
times a which is the same a,

794
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,060
yeah,

795
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,230
you should all understand why the
acceleration in magnitude is the same.

796
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,960
We're not saying that
that action is the same.

797
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:06,510
This is accelerating downhill at some
angle. That's accelerating uphill.

798
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,510
These are not the questions
which are the vectors,

799
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,910
the Stanford Equations
along certain directions.

800
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,380
This is the up down direction here and
that is up to slope down the slope.

801
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:20,210
That action for that one. But I think
you realize if the rope is inelastic,

802
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,660
if this mass moves down one inch,
that's got to go up one inch.

803
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,670
Therefore if it goes one it in one second,
so when the other guy,

804
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:31,040
they will have the same velocity and
they'll have the same acceleration.

805
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,850
So that's why there's only
one unknown acceleration a.

806
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,750
Once you realize that you're done
because now we know what to do.

807
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,890
Whenever they see a minus 10 or plasty,

808
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,910
you add them and you get g times m sine
theta minus little m on this site is

809
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:53,030
going to be a big game plus small
m time say, can you see that?

810
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,040
So let me short circuit one step
and divide by began a smaller.

811
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:05,040
So that's the formula here
and again, you've got to ask,

812
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,810
does it make sense? Now if you
notice that for it to be positive,

813
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,750
namely to go down hill,
it's not enough.

814
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:15,840
A big gamblers bigger than smaller
began signed data should be bigger than

815
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:16,674
smaller.

816
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,310
That's because m sine theta is the part
that's really pulling down him m course

817
00:53:20,311 --> 00:53:24,690
and data is trying to ram it into the
inclined plane and that's being countered

818
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:25,740
by the force.

819
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Second thing to notice is can I use this
formula when big game and small limb is

820
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:38,360
bigger than big m's, St data. Other words,

821
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,520
can I use this formula
when it becomes a negative?

822
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,300
After all I did all my thinking
saying it's going down,

823
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:45,830
but can I use it when it's going up?

824
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:47,740
Yeah.

825
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,430
Yes, and the reason anybody want
to say why that is okay here.

826
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,533
Yes.

827
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,060
Pardon me. No friction, right? Great.

828
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:03,950
Change is of course that is correct.
All the forces I drew here,

829
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,080
they're not going to change their mind.

830
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,800
When you change the body's motion grabbed,
this all is going to pull down.

831
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,540
So all of these forces that fixed and
magnitude and direction and therefore once

832
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:18,590
you got a formula for positive way,
you can apply to negative way,

833
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:22,130
but you cannot do it when
you have friction because
in friction you assumed the

834
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:26,040
direction of motion.
All right,

835
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:29,460
so now I'm going to leave the plane.
This is it.

836
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,760
We had finished with a plane. Uh,
you are not finished because, ah,

837
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,830
don't clap yet because I got a
homework problem by popular demand.

838
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,070
Two masters,
one pulley and friction.

839
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,960
That's the really, say we're finished
with a plane. Once you can do that,

840
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:49,680
you graduated from this bootcamp,
you can handle anything else,

841
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,960
but that's not something
I want to do in class.

842
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:54,330
If something you do in
the privacy of your room,

843
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:57,930
put all these things in and crank it
up and you'll always have enough time.

844
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,360
But that's the video that's got
some interesting angles. Uh,

845
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,540
you should think about, okay,
so now I'm going to do, um,

846
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,860
physics that basically
involves a rotational motion,

847
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:14,010
but let me do one Mickey mouse problem
and let it go because they assigned it to

848
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:18,900
you. Typical problem is that is
a tree here. That's a tree here.

849
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:23,580
And that is that our two ropes and there's
some backpack hanging here with some

850
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,240
wheat.
Uh,

851
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,060
you are told what that angle is
in your total, what that angle is.

852
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,510
You're supposed to find the
tension on these two ropes.

853
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,910
I think it's fairly simple.
So I want to the details,

854
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:44,570
but you know what you're supposed to do.
You take these two tensions,

855
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,680
break them at a horizontal parts with
science and because science and into

856
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:52,700
vertical parts, how does Arthur parts
better to cancel? Because this mass,

857
00:55:52,701 --> 00:55:54,980
this backpack is not going
any event horizontally.

858
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,570
The vertical parts of these two which
will be in fact additive should cancel the

859
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:04,160
weight of the object that gives you two
simultaneous equations for t one and t

860
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:07,100
two and you can fiddle
with them and solve them

861
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,681
well.
By the way,

862
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:14,600
I should tell you if you've
got some equation like t
one sine theta one equals d

863
00:56:14,601 --> 00:56:19,601
two sine data to that minus t two st it
a zero and another equation involving t

864
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,930
one with some numbers and t to

865
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,280
some are you seem to have trouble the
other day when that resigned. Data's here.

866
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,860
Let us, if this had been
numbers like three and four,

867
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,500
you knew how to solve this
simultaneous equations,

868
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,330
but I want you to realize that the
solving of the simultaneous equation for t

869
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:41,950
one and t two involve farming combinations
of these coefficients to eliminate

870
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:44,170
either t one or t two
so when you add them,

871
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:49,260
one of them drops out and that doesn't
depend on whether these are two economic

872
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:54,250
functions or any other
numbers you eliminated in
the same way like race on the

873
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:58,360
right hand side instead of some numbers
like three and four you have the wait w

874
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:01,750
of this mass. Well if you
multiply this equation by three,

875
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,030
multiply everything by
three and juggle them.

876
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,790
So you should get used to
eliminating coefficients,
which are not simply numbers,

877
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,420
which are symbols, science, core
science, but you don't have to.

878
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:18,160
If you had a sign here and of course sign
there, for example, how will it come by?

879
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,040
And then maybe you will multiply this
by saying in that way a sign and if you

880
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,910
subtract, it'll drop out. You
got to do stuff like that. Okay?

881
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:28,120
But it's important in a level.
Physics 200 level course,

882
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,270
you'd be able to solve those things.
Okay,

883
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:36,271
now I'm coming to the interesting problems
in which motion involves going in a

884
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,490
circle.
So here's one problem.

885
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,030
This is a string on which there is a
mass and the mass is going around in a

886
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:50,820
circle. This is like an amusement
parks where they have these uh,

887
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,420
dangling little tiny baby rockets and you
sit there and start spinning and as to

888
00:57:56,421 --> 00:57:59,920
being vertical, it starts lifting up.
You want to know why it's lifting up.

889
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:06,540
So if this angle here is data and this
is some mass m and is going around in a

890
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:12,781
circle with Velocity v and the radius
of the circle is a are you want to find

891
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:14,820
some relation between design,

892
00:58:14,821 --> 00:58:17,410
we'll Taita and these other
parameters in the problem.

893
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,020
So what do I do? I apply
f equals Ma, that's it.

894
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:26,560
And I'm going to get everything by a
planning f equals I may to this guy.

895
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,500
So here's that mass.

896
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:34,000
The tension on the rope
can only be along the rope.

897
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,050
Rope is not rigid object. It cannot
exert a force perpendicular to itself.

898
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,880
It can only pull it along.
It's that action. That's
the tension on the road, uh,

899
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,933
that is mg

900
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,330
and that's it. Under these things,
it's going to obey f equals m a.

901
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,050
So what I do with this tension is I
trade this guy for two forces. This is t,

902
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,280
uh, if that angle is data, let
me see. That angle is data.

903
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,880
So this is t scientists and
this is tico scientists.

904
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,990
So you trade that oblique t four to
t or the actual simple directions.

905
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,800
The fact that it's not going up or down
vertically tells me mg on the t signed

906
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:25,700
data.
I'm sorry.

907
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:26,683
Yes.

908
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,313
Okay.

909
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,390
Okay.
Then in the other direction,

910
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,020
t sine theta is the horizontal force.

911
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,680
That's got to be a mass times
acceleration at the incident.

912
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:43,440
But I've shown the object
because it's going in a circle.

913
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,840
It an acceleration in this direction
with Sites v squared over R.

914
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:56,040
Therefore, if you divide this
equation by that equation,

915
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:00,900
you want to get v squared
over r g equals stand data.

916
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,540
That's the angle that string we'll assume.

917
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,190
So if you knew the velocity,
you can do this problem.

918
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,243
Okay?

919
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:20,880
Then here's another interesting problem.
When you go on these roads,

920
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,300
you've got going in a circle,
stuff like this is your car.

921
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,180
I'm looking at you from the top.
You're going in a circle.

922
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,350
Anything wrong?
Yeah,

923
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,550
going in a circle,
you're accelerating towards the center.

924
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,700
Someone's got to provide the force.
That's what Newton says.

925
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:42,010
That forces the friction between
your tire and the road. In fact,

926
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:43,510
it's a case of static friction.

927
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,180
You might think as Kennedy
because the car is moving,

928
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,070
but it's not moving in this direction.

929
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,530
So it's a static friction
that keeps you from slipping.

930
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,260
So you need a certain static friction.

931
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,560
So that n times muse static at n equal
AMG must be equal to m v squared over r.

932
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,980
If you didn't have the static friction,

933
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,280
your card will not be able
to make the curve to fly off.

934
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:11,560
So what people have done is to find a
clever way in which you don't have to have

935
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:15,700
any friction. They can still make
the turn. That is the bank your road.

936
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:20,530
So imagine I'll get going into the
blackboard and you're turning left and the

937
01:01:20,531 --> 01:01:25,420
road looks like this is going away from
me. No, I don't have to draw this thing.

938
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:31,090
This is the road is that track restaurant
going round and round like this and I

939
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:32,320
gave it some angle table.

940
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,390
This road has no friction so it
can only exert a force that way.

941
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,660
But let me resolve the
force into two parts.

942
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,160
One like this and one leg.
This again,

943
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:52,161
if these two have an angle Taito that
is the same angle data there and that is

944
01:01:53,071 --> 01:01:54,810
the mass of the car this way.

945
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,680
Okay,

946
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,610
so what do I find?

947
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,930
I find an core sine theta equal to AMG

948
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,230
and [inaudible] signed data.

949
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,520
Okay.

950
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,230
Equals MV squared over R.

951
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,013
Okay,

952
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,970
that 40 if you again, take
the ratios, you will find 10

953
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,180
equals v squared over r.
G I think this may be a little fast now,

954
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:28,380
but you guys can do the Algebra.
What that means is the following.

955
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,320
If you want the car to go around
the bend at a certain speed,

956
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,150
40 miles per hour or so
many kilometers per hour,

957
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,170
and the road itself is part
of a circle of radius r.

958
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,480
It doesn't have to be full
circle at that instant.

959
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:46,800
It has to be a part of his circle.
Then if you bank your road at that angle,

960
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,740
you don't need any
friction to make the turn.

961
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:53,830
You got to understand how we
beat the system. If you wrote,

962
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,370
instead of being flat is tilted,

963
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:01,320
then even though the road can only
exert a frictional is normal force. Now,

964
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:04,380
part of the normal force is
pointing toward the center. In fact,

965
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,590
this picture is not
drawn to scale the druid.

966
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,170
That way this part of the vectors are
desirable and direct it towards the center

967
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,970
of the circle on which your orbit.

968
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:17,070
That's how you do the banking in any
good system of roads you'll find that is

969
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,913
banking.

970
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,380
Yeah.

971
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:20,591
Okay.

972
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:24,550
I'm going to do the last problem because
it's in the homework and then maybe I'm

973
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,870
a little late today. I apologize for
that. The last problem is very famous.

974
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:33,220
Very important. That's the loop, the
loop problem. As you know, the loop,

975
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:35,770
the loop is when you come down on a track,

976
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,910
you go on a circle and for
a while you're upside down.

977
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:41,783
Okay?

978
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:46,260
And the famous question is, you know, why
don't you fall down? What's the trick?

979
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,510
Does it violate Newton's
laws? And so on. We'll find,

980
01:03:48,511 --> 01:03:51,090
we can understand it
fully with Newton's laws,

981
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,300
but we'll find out that in order
for this thing to pull it off,

982
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,090
it's been at that instant,
has to have a minimum value.

983
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,670
And the application of Newton's
laws to this object is very simple.

984
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,380
It is gravity.

985
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,120
What about the track on which is going?

986
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,310
What's the direction of the
force that track exerts?

987
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,050
Pardon me down.
Anybody set up attract,

988
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:20,440
cannot exert a force upwards down.

989
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:25,660
So everybody track aimed yet
all acting downs. You see,

990
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,980
that's when you get a little worried.

991
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,870
This guy's up there at all the
forces of down. So we got ask.

992
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,730
So what does that mean?
Well,

993
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,760
I have to agree that all down I see t
plus m g is the downward force that's

994
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:40,330
gotta be MV squared over r

995
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,660
better four t is equal to m g
minus B squared over r minus g.

996
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,330
So what does that mean?
This d comes out negative.

997
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,870
You're dead good.
If it's negative,

998
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:12,670
you want the track to exert an upward
force and it can act in the real amusement

999
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:15,430
park. They have other t brackets
and so on to support you.

1000
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,850
What do you really believe in laws of
physics. You don't need any of that.

1001
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:23,560
You just got to make sure this number
is positive for it to be positive.

1002
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:27,070
You need B squared bigger
than or equal to RG.

1003
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,410
So you've got to make sure the veneer on
the top, you have this minimum velocity.

1004
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,660
If you go faster than that, that is
just fine. You go faster than that.

1005
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,100
Tb would a positive number.
So here's the interesting thing.

1006
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,930
Have he escaped the pull of gravity?

1007
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,430
How come we are not falling down
and the track is not helping us?

1008
01:05:49,431 --> 01:05:51,110
It's also pushing us down.
Yes.

1009
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,133
Uh,

1010
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,450
the tool and forth and changing the
direction of the velocity. But uh,

1011
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,573
yes.

1012
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,560
So the point is if you have
an apple with two forces,

1013
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:16,300
both pushing down that
apple is accelerating down
and accelerating down means

1014
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:20,950
really falling towards the ground two
at the center of the circle here in this

1015
01:06:20,951 --> 01:06:22,960
example,
it is definitely accelerating,

1016
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,930
but acceleration is not
added to zero velocity,

1017
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:27,490
in which case it'll pick up more and more.

1018
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:31,960
Speed is added to a huge
horizontal velocity in a tiny time.

1019
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:36,760
You give it a little velocity like this,
your new velocity points at a new angle.

1020
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,710
That just means your body has come
here and it's stop going like that and

1021
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:45,000
started going like this.
Therefore,

1022
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:49,030
downward acceleration does not
mean coming closer to the ground.

1023
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:54,580
It only means you velocity vector is
changing its direction. On the other hand,

1024
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:58,090
if you had no velocity vector downward
accelerations mean what you think it is.

1025
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:03,750
That is why if you drop an apple from
here, it is an acceleration due to mg.

1026
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:05,860
If the track was pushing
it down even more,

1027
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,320
it'll fall towards the
ground and hit the ground.

1028
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,040
But here it's actually
has an acceleration,

1029
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,410
but doesn't mean you're
any closer to the center.

1030
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,580
Going around in a circle as an example
of constantly accelerating toward the

1031
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:20,230
center,
but not getting any closer.

1032
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,960
That's the way back to his work
and you should think about that.
