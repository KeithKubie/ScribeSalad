[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.990
Almost every process in the
body is the result of a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.740
carefully orchestrated cascade
of events, elements that must

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.340
be coordinated to come together
to give a very

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.185
precisely amplified response.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:46.230
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.990
Now amongst the most well
studied or most carefully

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.770
studied of those cascades is
that which leads to blood

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.320
coagulation.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.060
How injury or exposure to
foreign surfaces leads to the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.800
formation of a stable
blood clot is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680
essential to our survival.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.590
And medicine's understanding of
that process, how to stop

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.440
blood clotting when you don't
want it to or keep the process

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.520
going when you do, has
been essential to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.100
our ability to intervene.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.060
But also, it's given us an
insight into important but

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.940
rare disease processes.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.400
When a blood vessel becomes
injured, the first thing that

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.990
happens are that platelets run
in to try and plug the hole.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.270
And platelets are just
broken down bits of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.850
old red blood cell.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.670
But that, on its own,
isn't enough.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.160
You need to throw down this
kind of biological chicken

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.310
wire on top of it to
stabilise the clot.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
And that stuff is strands of
fibrin, a glycoprotein which

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.600
is the result of the coagulation
cascade.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.240
And if you imagine that this
domino is one of the elements

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.810
of that cascade, you can see
that all of them need to come

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.770
together perfectly.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.890
And if any part of that chain is
interrupted, then you don't

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.280
get the perfect clot.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:10.229
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.180
Perhaps the best known of the
genetic disorders of bleeding

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.400
is haemophilia in which an
absence of factor VIII leads

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.090
to sometimes life threatening
haemorrhage.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.555
But there are others and one
in particular, know as von

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.310
Willebrand's disease in which
the absence of a specific

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.160
biomolecule leads to problems
with prolonged bleeding.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250
Now that disease was first
discovered in 1926 by a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.470
physician researcher called
Eric von Willebrand.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.500
And he, confronted with
a patient-- a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.120
young girl, in fact--

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.840
who had problems with extensive
bleeding, went on to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.100
trace her family line and found
that this was a disease

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.340
that ran in her family.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.160
And so having discovered that
disease, it would be several

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.050
decades before we understood
DNA and inheritance well

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.010
enough to trace it down to
a single gene that lay on

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.680
chromosome 12.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.561
And that gene bears von
Willebrand's name.
