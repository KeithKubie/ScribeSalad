00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.560
We're asked, what is the
prime factorization of 36?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.190
Let me get my little
scratch paper out.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.230
So the prime
factorization of 36.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.060
So let's start with the
smallest prime number we know,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.130
and that is 2.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.730
And think about,
does 2 go into 36?

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.770
Well, sure, it does.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.447
36 is 2 times 18.

00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:22.530
So we can write that down.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.150
36 is 2 times 18.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.270
So now we have 36 as a
product of a prime number,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.890
and 18 is clearly
a composite number.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.640
It has factors
other than 1 and 18.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610
So let's try to
factor this further.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.720
So is this divisible by 2?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.510
Sure.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.370
18 is 2 times 9.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.570
So now 9 is a composite number
that we haven't fully factored.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.790
Obviously, the 2's
are both prime.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.710
9 is not divisible by 2,
but it is divisible by 3.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.800
9 is 3 times 3.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.450
So we can say that 36 is equal
to 2 times 2 times 3 times 3.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.460
This is its prime factorization.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.710
All of these numbers are prime.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.790
So now let's input that to
make sure we got it right.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
2 times 2 times 3 times 3.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.410
And you can check yourself.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.740
If you have the product of
numbers that are all prime

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.800
and the product actually is
36, you have successfully

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.350
prime factorized the number.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.080
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.170
What is the prime
factorization of 30?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.300
So I'll get my scratch
paper out again.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.230
So we'll do the same process.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.820
So 30-- well, it's
divisible by 2.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.911
So we can write
that as 2 times 15.

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:50.950
15 isn't divisible by 2.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.970
But it is divisible by 3.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.160
It's the same
thing as 3 times 5.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.560
And both 3 and 5
are prime numbers.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.810
They are only divisible
by 1 and themselves.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.850
So the prime factorization
of 30 is 2 times 3 times 5.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.419
Let's enter that in.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:15.960
So it is 2 times 3 times 5.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.230
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.490
What is the prime
factorization of 73?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.925
Now, 73 is interesting.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.370
I'll get my scratch
paper out for this.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.050
We could try to factor 73.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.150
So you might try 2.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.650
Well, this is clearly
an odd number.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.380
So 2 isn't going to
be divisible into 73.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.120
You might try 3.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.550
You would immediately see,
well, 3 is divisible into 72.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.515
If you divide into 73,
you have a remainder of 1.

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.070
Well, 4 isn't a prime number,
so we wouldn't even try.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.790
5 isn't divisible into 73.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.050
It doesn't end in a 5 or 0.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.310
7 is not divisible into 73.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.522
7 goes into 70, so you'd
have a remainder of 3.

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:57.890
11 isn't divisible into 73.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.480
It's divisible into
66 or 77, so not 73.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.420
As I test more and
more numbers, it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.080
doesn't look like there's
any easy thing that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.020
divides into 73.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.330
So I'm willing to go with
73 itself is a prime number.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.010
So this is its
prime factorization.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.350
It's just 73.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.390
So let's write that down.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.190
So the answer here,
let's just write 73.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.910
And you don't want
to write 1 times 73,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.540
because 1 is not a prime number.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.070
Remember, 1 only has
one factor, itself.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.380
A prime number has two
factors, 1 and itself.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.690
Two different prime
factors-- 1 and itself.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.200
And itself is not one.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.250
So we just want to write
prime numbers here.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.660
73 is a prime number.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.240
Let's check our answer.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.867
And we got it right.
