ANNA CAVENDER: Thank you
everybody for joining us today.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:12.090
I'm really excited to welcome
our Lieutenant Governor, Cyrus

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.060
Habib.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.590
As lieutenant governor, he
presides over the State Senate

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.140
and he serves as acting governor
when the governor is out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.000
of town.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.170
And he's passionate
about several issues,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.000
including veterans and
disability employment,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.560
economic development, access
to higher education, trade,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
and international relations.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.590
Prior to being elected
as lieutenant governor,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.380
he served on both the State
Senate and the State House

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.220
of Representatives,
and he has a law degree

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.410
from Yale Law School.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.610
And he's done all of this while
overcoming many obstacles.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.450
He's a self-described
three-time cancer survivor,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.850
blind Iranian American from
a mixed-religion immigrant

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.630
family.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.100
So really excited to
have him here today.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.830
Thank you so much
for visiting us.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.335
I'll let you take it away.

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.626
CYRUS HABIB: Thank you so much.

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:09.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.940
Thanks so much.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.660
Well, it's wonderful to be here.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.110
Part of what I guess didn't
make its way into my bio

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.955
is that I'm also a former
Googler, although only briefly.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:26.300
I never made it out
of my Newgler phase.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.150
I was an intern in the London
office of Google sales intern

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780
the summer between my first
and second years in law

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.130
school working on Middle
Eastern and North African sales.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.580
I have a ton of first decade
Google swag to show for it.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.580
And actually, it was exactly
10 years ago this year.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.940
So it's wonderful
to be here with you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
guys to talk about
accessibility.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.250
I want to give you a
bit of framing around

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.145
why I'm personally passionate
about this issue, why

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:11.870
I care about it, why
I'm grateful to you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.760
all for caring about it.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.130
As you heard, I am the son
of immigrants from Iran.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.060
My parents came here in search
of economic and educational

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.650
opportunities.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.695
Shortly after I was born, I was
diagnosed with a rare childhood

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:32.150
eye cancer that took my eyesight
in my left eye as a newborn

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.090
and then came back again
and left me completely

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.550
blind at age eight years old.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.450
And I often joke that because
that happened in 1989, that's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.800
when I was eight years old.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.810
So all eight years
that I could see

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.380
actually took place
within the 1980s,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.556
so all my visual memories
are still from the '80s.

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:53.930
So everyone still looks like
Cindy Lauper and Boy George.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.270
We moved from Maryland where
I'd grown up to that point

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.340
to Washington state.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.030
And thanks to a combination
of parents who really believed

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.230
in me and believed in my ability
to fulfill my own potential

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.520
as well as relatively
well-resourced public schools

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.750
here on the east side of King
County and some extraordinary

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.099
teachers who had a big
effect in my life--

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.890
and as you'll hear in
a moment, thanks also

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.120
to some technologies--

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.110
and of course, thanks to
meaningful public policy

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.040
and laws, I was able to
travel the road from Braille

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.020
to Yale and beyond.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.310
So when I think
about technology,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.220
I had the great pleasure of
representing this district

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.270
in the state legislature.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.270
So in addition to
this campus, I also

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.452
represented Microsoft's
headquarters.

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.220
Around the world,
I say I may just

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.211
be a state legislator, what
other person in the state

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.710
legislature could
ever say that they

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.250
represent the two wealthiest
people on the planet?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.420
But more than the
two of them, it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.450
was and continues to be
of particular interest

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.740
and privilege for me to be able
to represent the future Bezos

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.060
and Gateses, the
future Pages and Brins,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.390
and essentially
the entrepreneurs

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.510
and innovators of the future
who may not be famous yet

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.900
and certainly may be
in this room right now.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.780
That's really what
is exciting to me.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.580
And I'll tell you why
technology has always

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.890
been-- because even
before I was a legislator,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.380
I practiced law at
Perkins Coie in Seattle

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.050
where I represented startups
and help technology companies

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.470
with licensing issues
and in other early stage

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.626
corporate matters.

00:04:58.626 --> 00:05:00.500
The reason it's always
been of interest to me

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.370
is that when you
have a disability,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.920
you've got this kind
of special relationship

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.190
with technology,
which is that you're

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:20.540
in a ever iterating cycle of
being disrupted by technology

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.160
and then having technology
then come to the rescue.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.970
And to some degree, that's not
unlike our general condition

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.000
as a human race, but
it's particularly

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.500
pronounced for people
with disabilities.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.610
So to take the IT
or ICT context--

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.070
so when I was a kid, I
wasn't the nerdiest kid.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.690
There are definitely nerdier
people in the room right now,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.250
but I was into computers.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.960
Growing up in this area,
a lot of my friends

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.840
were kids of
Microsofties and stuff,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.410
so I grew up around computers.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.840
I remember the
first computer I had

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.030
was a 486 and running
DOS primarily.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.670
And if you're blind,
DOS was the golden age--

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.740
command line interface,
just so easy, right?

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.380
There's a screen
reading software.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.670
And so it's great.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.960
You can copy files.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.870
You can find out what's in
the directory that you're in.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.149
You can move around to
different directories.

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:37.690
I think you all
knew, but directories

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.220
are what we called folders
before they were folders.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.450
And so you could do all kinds
of things that seemed impressive

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.490
at the time.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.620
And then Windows 3.1
and Windows 95 came out,

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.320
and I was just
starting high school.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.050
And that wasn't so good
for people who were blind,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:07.420
because graphical user
interfaces by definition

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.530
were not made for blind
people first and foremost.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.710
So there was this whole
setback and disruption.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.080
I could still use DOS,
but nothing interesting

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.370
was happening in DOS anymore.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.200
No one was making
applications for DOS.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.150
So I got pretty frustrated.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.650
I loved command line interfaces.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.410
So I was like, you know what?

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.234
My friend taught me about Linux.

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.400
And I was like, I'm going
to learn how to use Linux.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.180
But the problem with Linux was
that there was no real screen

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.280
reader for Linux.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.500
There were some weird
solutions that people had,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.860
but there was no screen
reader that just ran

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.510
on top of the operating system.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.760
So what I devised with
a friend was this kind

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.920
of dummy terminal running DOS--

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.000
a terminal that was like a--

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.550
I think it was a 386.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.410
It had no power.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.030
And all it had was just
telecommunications software

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.560
that would run the serial
drivers for the serial port.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.160
And there was a serial cable
connecting that dummy terminal

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.860
to a much more powerful Pentium
PC that was running Linux

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.410
so that I could effectively
do everything that anyone else

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.520
could do on Linux, which was
powerful but command line

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.169
text-based--

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.650
at least at that time and
still can largely be operated

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.330
in a text-based way--

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.159
operating system.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.650
So I did that for
a bunch of years.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.070
All the way through college
I was this weird guy who

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:52.070
had two computers, connected the
serial cable, only one monitor,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.290
and it was like
this whole thing.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.620
And then finally,
it got to a point

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.030
where I was going to go
interview for an internship.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.840
And they were like, look.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840
This was in grad school.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.370
I was going to go work
at a private equity fund.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.854
It was a job while I
was in grad school.

00:09:10.854 --> 00:09:12.020
It was more than internship.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.015
And they said, look.

00:09:14.015 --> 00:09:16.010
We can't work with
you like that.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.682
You need to be able to
create Excel spreadsheets.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:20.390
You need to be able
to do all this stuff.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.759
So I said, OK.

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.300
Well then, I'm going
to have to learn

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.240
how to use Windows after all.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.220
By that point, it
was Windows 2000.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.160
Or it was maybe
almost Windows XP.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.340
So I went and learned
how to use JAWS

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.800
for Windows, which is
the software that I still

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.030
somewhat use today.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.670
I use it all the time
when I'm using a PC.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.580
And so I kind of
had to learn that,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.810
and I felt pretty disrupted
there, but I But learned it.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.450
And right as I
was feeling pretty

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.960
good about PC solutions--

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.780
I had a laptop.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.470
I remember I started
in law school in 2006,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.630
and I was on the Metro
North from Yale to New York.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.760
And I was using a laptop with
one of those portable modem

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.579
things in it and
using earphones.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:14.120
It was great.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.080
I was using Windows.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.620
Then all of a sudden,
what happened?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.320
The smartphone with
the touch screen--

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.910
not good, right?

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.530
Not good.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.660
Not good for the blind, right?

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.680
So I shied away from using that.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.410
And I mean, all
the way until a guy

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.750
who's here today who
helped put this on,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.920
Mike Mello taught me in--

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:49.877
I remember it was
Halloween of 2010 or 2011.

00:10:49.877 --> 00:10:51.460
I just remember that
it was Halloween,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.650
because I remember I was
going to a Halloween party

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.149
that night.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:54.870
He came and basically
showed me how

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.320
to use voiceover software
on the iPhone which had just

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.760
incorporated into
the most recent iOS

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.845
upgrade into the iPhone.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.060
And then what happened was I
went from having been divided

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.790
from my peers by this technology
to not only catching up,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.480
but the iPhone--

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.120
I've said this, and I will
now include Android devices.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.770
But it was the iPhone that
brought the solution first--

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:36.730
for me was the greatest
civil rights innovation

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.220
since the Americans with
Disabilities Act for the blind.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:49.810
Nothing has changed my life
more other than public policy

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:55.390
when it comes to overcoming
this disability than the iPhone

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.890
than having access
to a smartphone--

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.810
not only because it allowed me
to do things which we're all

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.710
now able to do in this
decade since the iPhone

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.424
and its competitors really
came out and do them

00:12:08.424 --> 00:12:10.090
and be more efficient
the way all of you

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.410
are, but also because
so many solutions that

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.180
disproportionately
help the blind.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.290
Can you think of one?

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.140
What's one thing that
for the time being,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.130
blind people find it
really difficult to do?

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.030
Drive cars, right?

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.990
So if you were lucky enough
to be able to afford a taxi--

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.150
and I was a corporate
lawyer, so I could--

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.960
then if you were blind,
the distinct pleasure

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.170
of having to wait 20 minutes
for a taxi to come and hope

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.470
that the cab driver would be
able to first of all actually

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.397
make it to you.

00:12:47.397 --> 00:12:49.230
And then you couldn't
communicate with them,

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.980
so you'd have to hope
that they would just

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.790
figure out who you are.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.350
But most likely, they would
pick someone else up on the way

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.600
or think it's someone else
or someone hails them down,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.980
and then you got to call
again on your regular phone.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.780
And so it was like
a total nightmare.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.970
If you were taking the bus,
it was even worse, right?

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.627
Because if you didn't
have access to--

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:14.460
so now we have Uber.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.230
But if you were
taking the bus, you

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.700
didn't have access to OneBusAway
or any of the other apps,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.020
and so you were really
set adrift in so many ways

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.940
disproportionately.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.320
And so whether it's
wayfinding technologies--

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.640
and I know that with the
impact grants that Google

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.370
has been given, I know
that's an area where

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.250
I think Google Maps and
others are working together

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.490
on wayfinding solutions
for the blind.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.136
By the way, I'm
talking about blindness

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:45.510
because that's
what I know about.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.134
Obviously, disability
and accessibility

00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:49.920
is a much bigger topic,
but you can extrapolate.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.480
So then the smartphone
kind of became the thing

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.890
and allowed me not only to
catch up but also actually

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:07.890
disproportionately to
benefit I would say compared

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.020
to the typical population.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.610
I'm really excited that the
most recent user interface

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.530
innovation that came
about essentially

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.770
seems to have been
developed by blind people,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:29.640
because it's just like a
random cylinder with no screen

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.930
that you just talk to.

00:14:33.284 --> 00:14:34.950
I'm, of course, talking
about the Google

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.712
Home, not any of our other
hometown competitors.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.720
I did, of course, take
note earlier this year

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.320
when Amazon came out
with the Echo Look show--

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.710
there's a few of them--

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.540
with a screen on it.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.290
And I was like, all right,
so this will happen again.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:04.260
But it's OK, in large part
because of the interest

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.080
and knowledge and skills
that people in this room

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:13.260
and your counterparts at
Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.080
I always give special
recognition to Apple,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.550
because this has been part of
their culture from day one.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.350
Because of you and
your counterparts,

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.806
the lag time between the
disruption and the rescue

00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:28.305
has shrunk.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.980
But here's what I think is more
interesting than all of that.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.164
And before I do
that, let me say--

00:15:39.164 --> 00:15:40.580
the implications
of this are huge,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.850
because it's not just that I get
to know when the bus is coming

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.380
or call an Uber or whatever
or find my way around.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.330
But the implications for
employment for people

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.000
with disabilities are massive.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.520
For one thing, OneBusAway helps
people with disabilities to get

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.860
to work just like it helps
everybody to get to work--

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.720
disproportionately helps
people with disabilities to get

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.410
to work--

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.650
which is an important
part of working

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.585
is actually getting
to and from the job.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:20.470
The ability to use a
smartphone, tablets,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:26.680
and other mobile platforms
allows people with disabilities

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.170
to graduate from
entry level jobs

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.800
to more sophisticated jobs.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.960
But overall, it's
my great privilege

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.106
as lieutenant governor to
travel around the state and even

00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:42.730
the country and brag
about this region.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.590
And what I say is that Amazon,
Microsoft, and Google--

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.800
all three have your
cloud computing

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.550
and much of your other
fourth Industrial Revolution

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.790
technologies, big data,
AI, machine learning,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.800
internet of things--

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.230
have a lot of these
operations headquartered here.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.619
Amazon and Microsoft
obviously, but even Google

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:13.109
is growing your
cloud-based operations here

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.310
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.300
Well, why is that important
to this discussion?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.310
Because as you
create the solutions

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.060
that your customers are using--

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.000
that they're creating and that
other customers are using--

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.780
you have the ability to make
not only services, not only

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.160
software, but entire platforms,
entire systems accessible out

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.230
of the box, which is
going to have such

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.990
a huge impact on the
ability of people

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.260
to find employment, the ability
of people of all abilities

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.680
to be able to live the quality
of life that we all deserve.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.610
But I want to go
beyond all that,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.360
which is to say that's
all about accommodating.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.710
That's all about accommodating
people with disabilities,

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.100
and it's the right thing to do.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.308
In a lot of cases when we
get it right, it's the law.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.045
Congress passed the CVAA-- the
21st Century Communications

00:18:14.045 --> 00:18:16.130
and Video accessibility Act--

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:22.460
in 2010 to add on to the
ADA in the space in which I

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.880
imagine many of you work, which
is the communications space.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.770
So there are statutes,
there are regulations,

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.400
and those are good when
it comes to accommodating.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:36.110
But I actually think that
what's more important for us

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.230
to get the significance
of this evangelized

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.670
throughout
organizations as large

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:47.500
as Google is to talk about the
upside business proposition.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.350
Now, in part, that's the one in
five people with disabilities

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.160
in this country who you
also don't want to write out

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.350
as part of your customer base.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.610
But let me tell you something
that I said to Microsoft folks

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.960
much like you guys, and I
just wanted to be provocative.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.660
This is more of a salient
point to Microsoft

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.180
than it is to
Google, but I think

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.060
it applies some degree
to a number of companies.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.510
So what I said to
them was I said, look.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:30.530
Do you believe that the
technology behind Siri--

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.250
do you believe that
that was not doable

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.330
before Siri five years earlier?

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:44.990
Do you believe the technology
behind Alexa and the Amazon

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.000
Echo and other products
and now Google Home--

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.729
do you believe that it couldn't
have been done, that everyone

00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:55.520
was on the same page
that this is something

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.950
we need to do but they just
never got around or couldn't

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.270
get the technology together?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:05.030
And I said, you know, what
I believe is that speech

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.460
recognition software--

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.400
and I got a chance to meet Ray
Kurzweil, who's a hero of mine,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.410
just a few weeks
ago in New York.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.100
Speech recognition software was
for people with disabilities

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.820
primarily.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:28.882
Having output like Siri and
Alexa and Google Home do--

00:20:28.882 --> 00:20:30.465
that was for people
with disabilities,

00:20:30.465 --> 00:20:33.300
because everyone else
could read the screen.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.450
So it would be weird.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.739
Why would you have
this thing talk to you?

00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:37.780
It didn't make any sense.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.779
You can read the screen.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.630
That's how everyone
was thinking.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.850
Problem is that when we think
about how to be innovative,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.880
the hardest thing is to try
to think outside our own box.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.880
This has been something
Microsoft's particularly

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.690
struggled with.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.240
But I will say,
as Google becomes

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.520
more and more of
a legacy company,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.030
it's something Google's
got to think about too.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.260
You get comfortable.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.720
You've got some good products.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.490
You're cash rich.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.580
You're acquisitory
in some good ways.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.920
You make partnerships.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.700
The paradigms get set in stone.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.090
I don't know, but I imagine
it's probably quite challenging

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.279
to come and try to do search
in a completely different way

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:24.320
at a company like Google.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.574
The search and the ad ecosystem
that lies on top of it's

00:21:29.574 --> 00:21:31.490
been such a critical
part of Google's success,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.400
and it's Google's cash cow--

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.075
the ad business.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.820
Let me say this-- but when
you think about someone

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.320
with a disability and
how they do things,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.580
as soon as you do that, you
are in a different space.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.150
You are already in
a creative space.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.850
You're already in
an innovative space,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.920
because you got to think
completely differently.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.500
You got to completely
disrupt your own assumptions

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.640
about the best way to display
information or the best way

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.190
to take in a request.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.130
So what I told them was, look.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.660
I bet you, Microsoft.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.790
If you guys had actually said
back when Windows 95 came out,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.820
let's figure out the
best and most logical

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:26.620
way for people who are
blind to use Windows--

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.400
not just like, let's get
some third party developer.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.006
We'll share the
libraries with them.

00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:32.380
We'll have them
develop something

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.770
so that you can have a blind
person going to limp along

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.170
on top of Windows and
try to approximate,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:43.210
but actually tear it all up
and say, how would we do this?

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.300
Yeah, it's expensive.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.102
It's more expensive to do it
that way, even if it's legal

00:22:48.102 --> 00:22:49.060
and you won't get sued.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.470
But like it's expensive
to do it that way.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.020
You might think that there's
not that many blind people,

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.470
so I get why you may
not want to do that

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.520
from a short-term
economic perspective.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.220
But I bet you if you did that,
you would have beaten apple

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.470
to the market on Siri.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.100
And I bet you if you did
that, you'd have beaten Amazon

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.272
to the market on Alexa.

00:23:07.272 --> 00:23:09.230
You know how hard it is
for people at Microsoft

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.970
to hear those kind of words?

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.340
These people get to
elect or unelect me,

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.050
so it's not an easy thing
to say to everybody.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.300
I truly believe-- and
you can correct me--

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.450
but I truly believe that
when you wait for innovations

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:31.390
to happen by serendipity, it
will take longer than if you

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.697
follow what I believe to be a
sure-proof way of developing

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.280
new innovative solutions, which
is think about whatever you're

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.696
doing now and then
think about how

00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:43.470
people of all different
abilities or disabilities

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.346
would want to accomplish
the same task.

00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:47.220
The minute you do that,
you will be creative.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.680
And it will have all types
of unforeseen positive

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.297
consequences.

00:23:54.297 --> 00:23:56.130
People often talk about
the curb-cut effect.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.712
The people made wheelchair
ramps for people in wheelchairs.

00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:02.670
But then if we didn't
need wheelchairs anymore,

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.650
we wouldn't get
rid of curb cuts,

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.260
because everyone in this room
has used them for one purpose

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.620
or another-- stroller,
suitcase, whatever.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.780
So that effect is
true, but it is

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.930
I think particularly true if
the business that you're in

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.080
is competitive and the
fault lines of competition

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.372
are around innovation
and imagination.

00:24:22.372 --> 00:24:24.705
So thinking about people with
abilities and disabilities

00:24:24.705 --> 00:24:29.670
is not just the right thing
to do for the market share

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.340
that you will gain in
users but the right thing

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.090
to do if you want to come out
with the next game-changing

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.370
innovation for everybody.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.639
And I promise you that there
are innovations out there

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:44.680
right now that if you all
were thinking about how

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.304
to make your products
and services more

00:24:46.304 --> 00:24:50.830
available to the deaf, to
people with cerebral palsy,

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.470
to people with dementia maybe--

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.470
I mean, I'm serious.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.870
If you start
thinking about it, I

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.720
bet you you're going to learn
new things about memory,

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.940
new things about
kinetic technologies,

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.710
and how the internet of things
can move to the next level.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.980
So that's what I want
to share with you all--

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.640
is my personal story of how
technology has both disrupted

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.320
and rescued me over time, how
it's done that in the wider

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.590
society, and the particular--
not responsibility,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.220
because that's so boring and
nanny stateish, but actual

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.430
economic opportunity for
everyone here and everyone

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:32.380
at Google from Larry Page on
down to make money and create

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.580
new innovations by thinking
not about those with disability

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.410
as an afterthought
but having that

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.980
be a core part of a
multi-ability approach

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.660
towards product design
and development.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.130
So with that, I will
end my mansplaining

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.110
or politiciansplaining remarks
telling you how to do your job,

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.556
and I'm happy to answer any
questions that you guys have.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:03.352
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.940
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.800
So I used to work in
government contractor,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.200
and this was back when
the section 508 of the ADA

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.196
was first--

00:26:14.196 --> 00:26:15.570
CYRUS HABIB:
Rehabilitations Act.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.030
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.470
So one of the core
tenants of that

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:27.980
is that all government procured
software had to have compliance

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.960
with the Rehabilitation Act,
and there was a lot of effort

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.230
put in the time to bring systems
to that level of compliance.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.740
And I remember using
JAWS screen reader myself

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.570
to go through and
test the application

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.640
to make sure that it
was working or not

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.030
and usable with only
the audio interface.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.520
And I was wondering--

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.980
over the past decade,
how has the landscape

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.250
changed both in terms of
government-procured software

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.670
and the private industry
for smaller companies

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:07.740
in making their applications
accessible and usable?

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:13.040
CYRUS HABIB: Yeah, I mean,
that's why I mentioned mobile.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.460
Because mobile is so
much a part of how we all

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.916
do our computing and our
communications, et cetera.

00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:33.770
And so iPhone, iOS, Android,
increasingly Windows--

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:38.810
to the extent these technologies
have become accessible

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:43.820
natively, it's
made it all better.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.730
I'm sure it is the case--

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.350
I know it's the case--

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:57.530
that app developers have to
think about and get input

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.000
from the community.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.850
But it's so much easier when
the operating system developers

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:14.390
have themselves already
thought about how applications

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.948
on this platform are
going to interact

00:28:17.948 --> 00:28:20.960
with this
accessibility solution.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.699
So for those who
don't know, I don't

00:28:22.699 --> 00:28:23.990
know how it works with Android.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.700
I hate to say it--

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.630
iPhone user.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.150
But for the iPhone, for
example, the way it works

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.200
is you touch the screen.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.760
And rather than selecting that
item, it reads you that item.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.550
And then you would double tap
on it to actually select it--

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.560
so in that sense, kind of
analogous to a graphical user

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.470
interface with a mouse.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:56.000
And then there's some other
reconfigured keystrokes or hand

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.080
gestures that Apple itself--

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.820
which is constantly
in communication

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.840
with the community,
and I'm sure Google is.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.630
I've heard great things
about Android too.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:15.920
And so that just alleviates most
of the pressure on developers.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.830
There's still issues, right?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.710
Sometimes it's really
things, for example,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.700
like CAPTCHA challenges
and things like that.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.533
Sometimes it's very
simple things like that.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.200
And then websites-- the
display of information

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.700
on websites when
they're embedded

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.658
in graphics and things.

00:29:35.658 --> 00:29:38.247
I mean, there's still issues
that the operating system can't

00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:40.580
necessarily address or the
web browser can't necessarily

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.680
address, but they've gotten
so much better at doing it.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.580
Even recognition and photo
descriptions and things

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.040
like that is great.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:30:01.510
Government procurement-- I
think government does the best

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:08.440
job that it can, but it's not
like there are a ton of options

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.110
for most solutions sets.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.280
So usually you need an
enterprise solution,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.225
and here are your choices.

00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:21.790
And so that's why working
with these big four companies

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.358
is so important.

00:30:23.358 --> 00:30:26.680
AUDIENCE: So I have
two questions for you.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.646
I guess the line is OK, so
I'll ask my two questions.

00:30:30.646 --> 00:30:35.432
The first question is, if
you don't speak English,

00:30:35.432 --> 00:30:39.190
do you think your life
would have been much worse?

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.310
For example, if I think of
health bills for example,

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.160
they always have a page that
have a billion languages on it

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.970
saying here's your right.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.585
We can provide
interpreter for you

00:30:49.585 --> 00:30:51.960
to have your own language so
you can understand the bill,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.200
but that's all printed.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200
And so if you're blind, I
don't know what happened there.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.600
So that's my first
question-- is if you

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.337
don't speak English how your
life would have been affected.

00:31:02.337 --> 00:31:03.420
CYRUS HABIB: Do you mean--

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.550
sorry-- how my life would be
with respect to technology

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.440
or with respect to--

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.505
AUDIENCE: In general?

00:31:09.505 --> 00:31:11.130
CYRUS HABIB: If I
didn't speak English?

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:11.796
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:11.796 --> 00:31:14.620
But if you want, you
can also particularly

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.120
in technology if
that's what you want.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120
CYRUS HABIB: Do I get to
speak another language,

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.620
or do I just lose English?

00:31:24.347 --> 00:31:26.430
AUDIENCE: Let's say you
do speak another language.

00:31:28.584 --> 00:31:29.250
CYRUS HABIB: OK.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.710
What's your second question?

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:37.160
AUDIENCE: My second question is,
do you ever use a cheat sheet

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.060
or prep sheet when
you give public talk

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.150
or similar assistive thing to
help you with remembering what

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.572
you're going to talk about?

00:31:45.572 --> 00:31:48.030
CYRUS HABIB: Is that your way
of saying that my remarks are

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.710
scattered and disorganized?

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.563
That's OK.

00:31:51.563 --> 00:31:54.344
AUDIENCE: It's more like I
didn't know you weren't--

00:31:54.344 --> 00:31:56.760
CYRUS HABIB: What about a
hybrid question where it's like,

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.950
what if you don't speak
English and you need

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.210
a cheat sheet for your speech?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.610
I think that-- again,
smaller concentric circle,

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.530
but still would be a
cool technology for you

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.120
guys to develop.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.610
I think when it
comes to-- look, I

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.710
don't know enough
about being blind.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.580
I got the chance to visit
a school for the blind

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.480
in Seoul, South Korea, which was
really cool a couple of months

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.020
ago and talked to
those students.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:35.040
But I don't know enough
about the solutions

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.970
that are out there.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.910
The accessibility solutions
that are out there

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.700
vary from place to place.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:47.526
I do know that there is Braille
in all different languages.

00:32:47.526 --> 00:32:48.900
We should not
forget that Braille

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:54.379
wasn't developed by an English
speaker, so that does exist.

00:32:54.379 --> 00:32:55.920
And so where there's
Braille, there's

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.780
the ability to do
Braille printing.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.350
And I know that there
are screen readers

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.080
in a number of
different languages

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.510
for a whole bunch of
geopolitical reasons.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.850
Farsi, which is the language
that my parents first spoke,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.190
is probably going to
be one of the tougher

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:20.394
ones for a population that
large for a bunch of reasons

00:33:20.394 --> 00:33:21.810
having to do with
trade sanctions.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:29.910
But there's no doubt
that even if it were just

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.430
living in the US
but in a rural area,

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.890
I would have more challenges.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.520
I feel very lucky
to have grown up

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.007
in an environment that's just--

00:33:40.007 --> 00:33:42.340
I grew up just a couple of
miles from Bill Gates's home.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:48.090
So clearly when new
innovations would come out,

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.770
we had the wherewithal and the
knowledge and awareness of it

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:51.690
to do it.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:57.180
And clearly, Google--
it was interesting,

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.070
because I did spend a couple
of months working on Middle

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.230
East sales for Google.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.510
I know that growing
overseas is huge.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.344
But obviously, you
guys and everyone

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.010
test your products
out in English first.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.010
Those solutions come to
market first in English,

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:16.380
so that's definitely a big
advantage for all of us.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:22.620
But increasingly, you
have major tech disruptors

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.360
out there and tech companies--

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.110
Tencent and Alibaba and
others-- and so there'll

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.787
be new solutions that will
originate from those places

00:34:30.787 --> 00:34:31.620
and those companies.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.276
So I don't have any
kind of a cheat sheet.

00:34:35.276 --> 00:34:37.650
I could have things Brailled
for me and have them with me

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.810
or have a Braille display.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.385
By the way, just so you
guys know, one of the things

00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.510
I do as lieutenant governor
is I serve as president

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.710
of the State Senate.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.920
So I preside over
the State Senate.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.870
Part of that job is
calling on senators

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.286
when they want to speak, and
because they are politicians,

00:34:54.286 --> 00:34:56.350
they always want to speak.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.610
And so we had to figure out,
OK, how do we make that happen?

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.147
Because when people
stand up, how

00:35:02.147 --> 00:35:03.730
am I going to know
who wants to speak?

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:11.280
Well, we developed a solution
where state senators have

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.429
a touch screen on their desk,
and when they want to speak,

00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:16.470
they stand up and touch
the screen on their desk.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.600
And it sends their
name up to a PC that's

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.000
operating right up where I
am at the front of the Senate

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.480
chamber, and then
it sends their name

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.290
on to a Braille
display in real time

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.150
so I can call on
senators as they speak.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.780
So if you guys come to Olympia,
would love to show it to you.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.530
And if you're
struggling with amnesia

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.810
and you watch TVW
channel 23 at night,

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:39.462
you can see me presiding
over the State Senate

00:35:39.462 --> 00:35:40.920
and putting that
technology to use.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.110
So I do sometimes
use technologies

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.050
in those kind of situations.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.550
Up there I do have
Braille so that I

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.100
know which bills that we're
doing, which legislation we're

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.420
considering, but I
don't for speeches.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.170
And I probably wouldn't if
I could see, because I just

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.212
think it's better to speak
naturally to you guys

00:36:01.212 --> 00:36:02.670
and have a
conversational approach,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.216
even if it's a big speech.

00:36:06.216 --> 00:36:06.840
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.340
Thank you.

00:36:10.486 --> 00:36:11.860
CYRUS HABIB: Any
other questions?

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.651
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.651 --> 00:36:14.870
There's a line now.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.470
So first of all, thank you
so much for taking the time

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.390
to come and address
us this afternoon.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.530
I am speaking to you as
the very proud mother

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:29.360
of two boys on IEPs who have
developmental disabilities.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.030
And as you yourself
experienced, technology

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.620
is such an amazing difference
when it comes to their ability

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.680
to access the general
education curriculum

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.020
and to be included in gen ed.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.350
And yet because of funding
and inadequate funding growth,

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.580
especially as things like
autism have exploded,

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.040
there has not been
sufficient funding

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.860
to be able to give them
that kind of an opportunity

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.840
so that they can
also go to Yale.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.440
So what is being done
in Olympia to address

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.010
that in the short term?

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.430
CYRUS HABIB: To
my mind, because I

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:14.330
had the benefit of a 24 hour a
day pro bono attorney as a kid.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:21.500
That's my mom-- like you,
fierce advocate for her son.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.590
That question that you asked
is the one that both motivates

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.720
me and disturbs and haunts me.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.600
Notice that when I--

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.891
I don't know if you were here
when I first started out,

00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:38.050
but I said first,
parents, second,

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.770
a reasonably well-funded
public school district.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.800
And it's absolutely critical.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.620
It's why smaller class
sizes are important.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:54.530
It's why funding all day
kindergarten is important.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:59.200
So the larger education spending
that we do disproportionately

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.650
helps kids with disabilities.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.290
But over and above
that, the underfunding

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:13.090
of special education to my mind
means that we're not there yet

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.520
when it comes to our
constitutional duty

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.250
in this state for
basic education.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.920
We're not there yet on our
statutory responsibilities

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:26.470
under the IDEA and
state laws, and so I

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.230
think parents should 100%--

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.619
first of all, legislators
should do the right thing

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:32.410
in the first place.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.500
But sometimes, litigation
is a part of that

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.000
and lawsuits have happened,
and they'll continue to happen.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.660
And I think that's an
important part of the system,

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.640
because kids need to--

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.924
stories of kids who
were not getting access

00:38:45.924 --> 00:38:48.340
to the kind of assistance that
they need, the support they

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.910
need to be able to fulfill
their full potential.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.950
Those stories need to get heard.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.610
And if they're not heard
in legislative offices,

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.820
they need to be
heard in courtrooms.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.360
And so it's extremely important.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.587
It's extremely important.

00:39:03.587 --> 00:39:05.170
AUDIENCE: Appreciate
all of your help.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:05.670
Thank you.

00:39:09.157 --> 00:39:10.990
AUDIENCE: I actually
would like to thank you

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.780
for coming in and addressing
us this afternoon.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:20.611
I found what you said both
interesting and inspiring,

00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:23.110
particularly in my case, because
I work on a user experience

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.870
team.

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.220
So we're very much focused on
how to make things work better

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.950
for all kinds of people.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:35.280
I started at Microsoft back
in the windows 2.0 days.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.410
And I remember very clearly
how much it came as a shock

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:44.180
to us to learn that people with
visual disabilities loathed us,

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.990
because Windows had
disrupted their ability

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.570
to use computers so much.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.240
And I was wondering if you see
any emerging technologies that

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.390
might prove to be as equally
disruptive for people

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.810
with both visual and
other disabilities

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.340
that we should be
watching out for.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.326
CYRUS HABIB: You should not--

00:40:06.326 --> 00:40:09.980
I appreciate the question, but
you're asking the wrong person.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.710
You should be asking
your colleagues,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.200
and those colleagues
should have disabilities.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.780
So that's the
single best way you

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.930
get the right answer to that
question, because I don't know,

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.430
nor do you want me to know.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.042
Because if I know, it
means Amazon knows, right?

00:40:25.042 --> 00:40:27.500
So you don't want me to know
what technologies you guys are

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.617
about to come out with.

00:40:28.617 --> 00:40:30.450
And by when you bring
it out, it's too late.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:34.190
It's not too late,
but it's late, right?

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.400
So you want your trade secrets
to remain your trade secrets.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:46.460
You want your project names,
secret names to remain secret,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.620
and you want to do
what you're doing.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.600
But you want to have the
bench depth of people

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.560
with all different abilities so
that those questions are being

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:04.460
asked-- and again, not just
because you want to figure out,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.610
well, we're developing.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.510
We want to connect YouTube to
the Google Homes or whatever,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.134
right-- whatever new thing
you guys are going to do.

00:41:14.134 --> 00:41:15.800
Not just like, well,
how do we make sure

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.960
that people who are blind can
do that, but rather, OK, what

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.080
is it about how a blind
person would want to receive

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.990
that information
that would actually

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.030
be interesting for others?

00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:32.150
I don't know.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.120
This didn't happen this
way, but I mean, one thing--

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.740
I think back to Google search.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.220
And when Google search
came out compared to Yahoo

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.640
and compared to Altavista and
Lycos and all the other search

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.830
engines that have gone
the way of the dinosaur,

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.600
one thing that was
unique about Google

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.180
from a user
experience perspective

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.920
was how stripped down
and simple it was.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.890
It was extremely low--

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:06.170
it's a big deal when Google will
put a holiday thing on there,

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.130
because it's like such
a bare-bones thing.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.520
Whereas Yahoo and these other
things were using search--

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.440
really, embedding search
into what they hoped

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.420
would be kind of
like a home page

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.065
for a bunch of other things.

00:42:20.065 --> 00:42:21.440
Now when you go
to Google search,

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.140
you've got news, mail,
YouTube, whatever,

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.224
but it's still
relatively bare-bones.

00:42:28.224 --> 00:42:30.140
Not as much as it used
to be, but it still is.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.645
Now, that's something that--

00:42:32.645 --> 00:42:34.520
it didn't happen because
a blind person said,

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.404
that makes it
easier to navigate.

00:42:36.404 --> 00:42:38.570
It does make it easier for
blind people to navigate,

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:44.150
but it also has other
market value with respect

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.000
to non-blind people.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.980
So again, I would say that
question that you're asking--

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.750
you should both ask
it of people that

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.460
are your colleagues
who then would be

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.668
well-positioned to answer it.

00:42:53.668 --> 00:42:57.080
But then you should also ask the
complementary question, which

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:02.600
is, which alternative
user experiences

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.790
should we metastasize outside
the disability context

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.275
into a broader
use case scenario?

00:43:10.275 --> 00:43:11.150
Does that make sense?

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.566
AUDIENCE: It makes
a lot of sense.

00:43:12.566 --> 00:43:13.630
Thank you.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.200
AUDIENCE: Have you tried VR?

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.850
CYRUS HABIB: Me?

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:18.680
I'm down.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.250
I'm ready.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:27.917
But there's a great example next
generation technologies that

00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:30.000
could unite, that could
divide, that could rescue,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.110
that could disrupt.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.370
But in any case, look.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.980
People with disabilities
already live

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:41.930
in realities that have different
sensory dimensions to them,

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.080
so why anyone would
develop an AR,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.390
VR platform without
having people

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.780
with sensory disabilities
right in the room

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.640
makes no sense to me.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.799
And I think failure to do that--

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.340
it doesn't mean the
end of the world,

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.610
but I do think it will mean
a delay in getting products

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.540
and solutions to market.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:08.390
Because there is no doubt
that with the technology

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.849
that Google has and
had in 2005, 2006--

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.640
you all could have done
the Echo back then.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.577
You know that.

00:44:14.577 --> 00:44:16.410
You know you could have
done Siri back then.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.034
I mean, of course you could
have, but it was weird.

00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:20.450
Why would someone
who can see ever

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.040
want to use that kind of thing?

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.830
So again, I think the AR,
VR is a great use case

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:31.586
for the proposition
that I'm making here.

00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:34.080
AUDIENCE: So thanks so
much for being here today.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.650
I don't quite
follow your argument

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:40.180
about things having been
able to be done back then.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.960
For example, Arthur C.
Clarke, Isaac Asimov--

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.350
these concepts of
robot units that

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.180
can answer your
question off hand

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.410
have been available
for a very long time,

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.485
so I'm not following.

00:44:53.485 --> 00:44:55.810
And they were thought
of in some cases

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.780
by people who were trying to
envision what the world would

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.502
be like by others who couldn't
work that way in various--

00:45:02.502 --> 00:45:04.210
CYRUS HABIB: Right,
but they were never--

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:11.470
but it costs money to take it
a Las Vegas Expo and even more

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:17.680
so from the pages of a science
fiction book or a futurist TED

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.460
Talk.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.550
It takes money to get it
from there to something

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.470
that you can hold in your hands.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:28.180
So yes, it's not like the
idea of Alexa or Cortana

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.840
or Google Home or Siri--

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:38.440
it's not like any of these were
not thought of before, right?

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.000
I mean, look.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.820
The internet of things,
the smart home--

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.320
you guys remember.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.110
You could go to Redmond,
and they had one in '98.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.490
So they knew it, right?

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.700
But so much of the
technologies that ended up

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.130
making it possible and
desirable were ones

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.950
that you'd have to be
sensory deprived to think

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:59.510
were innovative.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.560
Why isn't there a screen?

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.160
Because everyone's idea was
the best way to get information

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.810
is from a screen.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:10.350
The best way to input
information is with your hands,

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:12.030
and so you'll do
it with keystrokes.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:16.010
But no-- that's a moving part.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.990
Then you go to a mouse.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:19.004
OK, that's object-oriented.

00:46:19.004 --> 00:46:19.920
That's an improvement.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.790
It's still a moving part.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:21.831
How about a touch screen?

00:46:21.831 --> 00:46:24.610
OK, but you're still
using your hands.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.270
So the idea that you
would use your mouth

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.632
to input information--

00:46:30.632 --> 00:46:32.340
it wasn't that they
hadn't thought of it.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:36.174
Of course people had thought of
it, but it was not desirable.

00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:38.590
It wasn't viewed as marketable,
because it was like, well,

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.970
who's doing that--

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.710
just some paraplegic?

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.220
Who can't use their hands
to use a touch screen?

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.350
It's the easiest thing ever.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.430
So that's my point.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.240
It's not a lack, I think, of
technological imagination.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.934
I think it's a lack of
business case imagination.

00:46:58.934 --> 00:46:59.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.010
CYRUS HABIB: But I want
people to disagree with me,

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.124
because it's like nothing's
more offensive to me

00:47:05.124 --> 00:47:06.790
than when people come
in and tell me how

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.200
the legislative process works.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.560
So I'm sure some of you
find it really irritating

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.620
that this know-it-all
who took my last math

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.140
class in 12th grade
is telling you

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.110
guys what you could or
couldn't have done or whatever.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.827
Tell me that I'm wrong.

00:47:21.827 --> 00:47:22.660
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.540
I'm only asking this question
because nobody else is up here.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.840
Ever since I saw your
first campaign sign

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.110
after I moved to this area,
I have a really good friend

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.040
from grad school who
has a son named Cyrus.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.600
And when we looked at the sign,
I looked my wife, and I said,

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.340
do you think he pronounces
it "see-roos" or "sigh-rus?"

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.230
Because my friend
who has a kid named

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.650
Cyrus is a Farsi name
or a Persian name.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.585
And so now you're
here, so now I want

00:47:49.585 --> 00:47:51.460
to ask you so I can
settle this with my wife.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.040
CYRUS HABIB: I would say it
depends on which language

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.480
I'm speaking.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:05.965
So if I'm speaking Farsi,
then you would say "see-roos."

00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:10.690
And if I'm speaking English,
I would say "sigh-rus,"

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.320
because that's the English
language pronunciation.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:19.180
Just like if you're
speaking Spanish,

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.850
you would say "meh-hi-co,"
if you're speaking English,

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.290
you'd say Mexico.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:28.060
And from my
perspective, that's OK.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.540
It's OK to use either one.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.580
It's OK to use both.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.160
AUDIENCE: We were just curious.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.540
There's no right answer.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.970
CYRUS HABIB: Yeah.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:43.360
I'll tell you, Miley
Cyrus was a big help.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:49.060
The thing is, it's more that
you want people to know how

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.650
to spell it when they hear it.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.350
That's a bigger problem
than knowing how

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.900
to say it when they read it.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:01.750
So the problem that I want
to solve for is when I say,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:05.020
email me at cyrush@gmail.com--

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.162
S-I-R, whatever, right?

00:49:07.162 --> 00:49:09.620
So if I said "See-rus," that
would just really throw people

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.240
off. .

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:19.480
I like to build off of the name
equity if not necessarily brand

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:27.040
equity that Miley Cyrus has
built in pronouncing that name.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.170
It is the case that Cyrus and
this kind of similarly sibilant

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.590
name Silas--

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.090
you like how I did
that right there?

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.756
It was very meta what
I did right there.

00:49:35.756 --> 00:49:38.650
Similarly sibilant
name Silas tend

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.170
to be the names of villains
in a lot of movies,

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.440
so just think about it.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.810
Are there any other questions?

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:47.710
No other questions?

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:48.210
OK.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.007
I'll be around.

00:49:50.007 --> 00:49:52.090
I think we'll be around
for a couple more minutes,

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:53.995
and then I'm heading out.

00:49:53.995 --> 00:49:57.300
You know where to find
me on social media,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:04.360
and now you know how to
spell @cyrushabib or @waltgov

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.320
on Twitter and on
Facebook, et cetera.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.330
So look forward to being in
touch with anybody who wants

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.890
to talk about these things.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:15.820
And in closing, I will just
say that the single best

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.140
thing that anyone can
do here above and beyond

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.390
the substantive engineering
work that you're doing

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:27.612
is to help to build an HR
culture that will allow there

00:50:27.612 --> 00:50:30.070
to be-- because there's nothing
about the job of lieutenant

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.820
governor that says that I
need to come in and give tech

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:39.160
companies ideas on
how to build products.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.490
The best thing is to hire
people with all different sorts

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:46.300
of personal stories and
experiences and abilities

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:52.300
into the company to enrich and
enliven the user base right

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.841
here and to help you all imagine
what the future can look like.

00:50:55.841 --> 00:50:56.590
Thank you so much.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.640
[APPLAUSE]
