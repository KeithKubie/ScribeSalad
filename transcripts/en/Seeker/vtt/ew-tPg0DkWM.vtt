00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.970
I like big brains and I cannot lie, those
other guys can’t deny when a girl walks

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.970
in with a….

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.700
wait hold on, does a big brain actually mean
more intelligence? or does it just mean a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.960
big head?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.929
Hey guys

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.320
You know what they say, the bigger the better,
right?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.760
So does that hold up for noggin size too?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
Well in a way.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.680
We like to think big brains mean more smarts.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.109
Bigger is better right?

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.259
Not really.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.589
Big brains aren’t unique to humans, whales
and elephants also have large noggins.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.149
Compare an average blue whale brain to an
average human brain: blue whales, 15 pounds,

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.710
average human brain, 3 pounds.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.260
But even though their brain is five times
heavier, humans come out on top.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.640
So what’s going on?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.450
So maybe the weight of our brain isn’t the
right way to look at it, maybe it’s a comparison

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.450
to body weight.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.629
In that case, blue whales have a relatively
small brain; it’s only 0.007% of its body

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.629
weight.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.579
While human brains are about 2% of body weight.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.640
and comparing ratios.. well that still doesn’t
tell the whole story either.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.190
Humans have a 1:40 ratio, but that’s about
the same as a mouse.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.400
And elephants which many consider to be pretty
smart cookies have small, 1:560 brain to body

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.400
ratio.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.760
So a really smart animal might have a large
ratio and on the other a not so bright critter

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.440
like the tree shrew has a relatively large
head compared to it’s body size, 1:10.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.410
So not an ideal measurement either.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.650
So researchers found a way to put humans in
their rightful place…

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.330
well, not really.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.010
They created the "encephalization quotient”
which is similar brain to body ratio, but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.000
it takes into account the fact that some parts
of the brain like the part that controls breathing,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.610
is the same size across species.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.790
So the EQ also includes a comparison of similarly
sized animals.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.320
The formula looks like this ___

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920
And according to this measurement, humans
dominate.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.930
On the higher end, humans have an EQ of 7.8,
elephants- only 2.36, which is similar to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.700
chimps, who rate at 2.5.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.140
Which sort of seems right when it comes to
ranking intelligence.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.360
But maybe size has less to do with intelligence
than we thought.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.540
Some scientists say the EQ it’s not an accurate
way to judge intelligence and that other features

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.540
of the brain matter more.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.040
Like the development of certain parts of the
brain like the cerebral cortex or the number

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.100
of folds in the brain which increase surface
area.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.470
Maybe it’s the way the brain signals.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.860
One study published in the journal Nature
Neuroscience found that maybe it’s not the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.060
size, but the underlying structure and molecular
signalling at the synapses.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600
Synapses are those points between neurons
which exchange information.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.940
The researchers examined molecular signaling
across various species like yeast, fruit flies,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.940
and mice.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.480
They found that most species have the same
proteins in the synapses.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.030
But it’s the number interactions and gene
duplications of these proteins that begin

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.480
to show differences in intelligence.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.510
The basic proteins found in yeast can also
be found throughout the brain in regular amounts

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.190
kind of like a foundation made out of bricks.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.460
But the researchers say that it’s the way
these proteins interact and the number of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.620
duplications that evolved into regions of
higher thinking.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.600
So like bricks in a house, it’s how many
and how they’re put together that make a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.700
strong building.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.490
And maybe it’s the size of different regions
of the brain that matter.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.520
Take a look at Einstein, widely considered
to be one of the smartest people to ever grace

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
this planet.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
His brain?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520
Not so big.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.630
Kind of average actually.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.740
Though there might be some evidence that his
inferior parietal lobe was 15 percent wider

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.600
than normal, and that part of the brain has
been linked with mathematics and spatial processing.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.710
So what’s the verdict?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.360
Size doesn’t always matter, but maybe connections
do.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680
Curious about how we judge the intelligence
of other animals?

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:35.680
