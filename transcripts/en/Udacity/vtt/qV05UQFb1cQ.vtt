00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.360
In this lesson, we have learned that
synchronization operations such as locks

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.510
and barriers are needed to coordinate
the activities among multiple threads

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.710
and that special atomic instructions are
needed to implement locks efficiently.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.440
In the next lesson, we will see that
synchronization can be messed up

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.950
when a processor can reorder loads and
stores, and

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.960
we will learn how to guard against that.
