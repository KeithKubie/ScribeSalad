answer that is well sort of just like

answer that is well sort of just like
you do you know it's yes they know and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
you do you know it's yes they know and
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670
you do you know it's yes they know and
no they don't and they know because

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
no they don't and they know because
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260
no they don't and they know because
they're really smart and gifted and all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
they're really smart and gifted and all
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670

that but they don't know because it's

that but they don't know because it's
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740
that but they don't know because it's
not all articulated plus they're working

purse because morality is about what's
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480

than the damn cricket did you just don't
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830
than the damn cricket did you just don't
and you can't because you're too

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
and you can't because you're too
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.600

complicated but you act them out and
 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.460
complicated but you act them out and
then you also have representations of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
then you also have representations of
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410

so even the the imagistic representation

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
so even the the imagistic representation
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.749
so even the the imagistic representation
of your behavior in your past which is

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
of your behavior in your past which is
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.270

turning it into a relatable story it
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320
turning it into a relatable story it
can't help but do that it's the only way

you can represent it and so you don't

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
you can represent it and so you don't
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.339
you can represent it and so you don't
know how you do that or why you do that

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
know how you do that or why you do that
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.250
talked about it your problems you talked
about them with your friends you talked

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
about them with your friends you talked
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.960
about them with your friends you talked
about them and maybe you have dreams

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
about them and maybe you have dreams
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.460
about them and maybe you have dreams
about them and you're you're trying to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
about them and you're you're trying to
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.660
about them and you're you're trying to
relate them and you have memories about

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
relate them and you have memories about
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.160
relate them and you have memories about
them that you can't get rid of because

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
them that you can't get rid of because
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.630
them that you can't get rid of because
they're negatively toned so you talk

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640
they're negatively toned so you talk
 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.430
they're negatively toned so you talk
about them and then someone comes up

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440
about them and then someone comes up
 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.650
about them and then someone comes up
with a little statement that links them

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
with a little statement that links them
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.479
with a little statement that links them
together causally do you think aha

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
together causally do you think aha
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.120
together causally do you think aha
that's what I'm doing and then maybe you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130
that's what I'm doing and then maybe you
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.220
that's what I'm doing and then maybe you
can stop doing it or at least you or at

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
can stop doing it or at least you or at
 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.870
can stop doing it or at least you or at
least maybe then you can think up some

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
least maybe then you can think up some
 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.020
least maybe then you can think up some
strategies for not doing it anymore but

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030
strategies for not doing it anymore but
 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.240
strategies for not doing it anymore but
it's not like you know it's like you're

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
it's not like you know it's like you're
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.180
it's not like you know it's like you're
acting it out you know it that way but

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190
acting it out you know it that way but
 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.550
acting it out you know it that way but
until that's all until the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
until that's all until the
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.340
until that's all until the
representation matches that pattern that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350
representation matches that pattern that
 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.410
representation matches that pattern that
clique of insight doesn't occur and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
clique of insight doesn't occur and
 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.449
clique of insight doesn't occur and
that's like a revelation it's a really

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
that's like a revelation it's a really
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.449
that's like a revelation it's a really
good way of thinking about it because

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459
good way of thinking about it because
 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.949
good way of thinking about it because
the knowledge is there in its implicit

watch yourself watch your fantasies

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789
watch yourself watch your fantasies
 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.730

because they're always happening and so
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.800

one of the things I do when when I'm

one of the things I do when when I'm
 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.430
one of the things I do when when I'm
interacting with my clients is we'll

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440
interacting with my clients is we'll
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.140
interacting with my clients is we'll
have a discussion and then they'll their

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150
have a discussion and then they'll their
 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.149
have a discussion and then they'll their
eyes will drift a little bit and I'll

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159
eyes will drift a little bit and I'll
 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.589
eyes will drift a little bit and I'll
know that they're that something's

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599
know that they're that something's
 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.450
know that they're that something's
flitted through their mind you know and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
flitted through their mind you know and
 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.159
flitted through their mind you know and
that means we've touched on something

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169
that means we've touched on something
 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.920
that means we've touched on something

that has multiple multiplicity of
 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.570
that has multiple multiplicity of
elements and so I'll stop and say look I

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580

that's another thing to really watch or

that's another thing to really watch or
maybe you like or you drifted at least

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030
maybe you like or you drifted at least

it's like it's because some other

thought has entered your field of
 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.850
thought has entered your field of
consciousness and then if you can get

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860
consciousness and then if you can get
 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.740
consciousness and then if you can get
the person to grab those thoughts to

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750
the person to grab those thoughts to
 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.140
the person to grab those thoughts to
notice them then you can often figure

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150
notice them then you can often figure
 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.450
notice them then you can often figure
out the avenues along which that

out the avenues along which that
particular conversation might unfold

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110
particular conversation might unfold
 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.980
particular conversation might unfold
that's a complex that's a union complex

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990
that's a complex that's a union complex
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.689
that's a complex that's a union complex
or a psychoanalytic complex it's like

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699
or a psychoanalytic complex it's like
 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.330
or a psychoanalytic complex it's like
there's an emotional core that produces

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340
there's an emotional core that produces
 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.610
there's an emotional core that produces
a whole range of associated ideas and

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620
a whole range of associated ideas and
 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.320
a whole range of associated ideas and
that thing's got a life it's like a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330
that thing's got a life it's like a
 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.480
that thing's got a life it's like a
micro personality and it might have

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
micro personality and it might have
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.610
micro personality and it might have
resentment in it might have anger it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620
resentment in it might have anger it's
 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.059
resentment in it might have anger it's
often negative emotion tinge because the

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069
often negative emotion tinge because the
 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.640
often negative emotion tinge because the
negative emotion tinged episodes are

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650
negative emotion tinged episodes are
 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.800
negative emotion tinged episodes are
still problems and they will emerge

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810
still problems and they will emerge
 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.450
still problems and they will emerge
automatically because your threat

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460
automatically because your threat
 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.269
automatically because your threat
detection systems force them onto your

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279
detection systems force them onto your
 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.430
detection systems force them onto your
consciousness essentially so you watch

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440
consciousness essentially so you watch
 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.580
consciousness essentially so you watch
and when you drift you'll drift and the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
and when you drift you'll drift and the
 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.830
and when you drift you'll drift and the
fantasy is partly a representation of

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840
fantasy is partly a representation of
 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.899
fantasy is partly a representation of
the problem space you know what that

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909
the problem space you know what that
 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.159
the problem space you know what that
happens when you wake up at 3 in the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169
happens when you wake up at 3 in the
 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.420
happens when you wake up at 3 in the
morning and you're worried about things

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430
morning and you're worried about things
 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.640
morning and you're worried about things
right because actually what happens is

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650
right because actually what happens is
 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.740
right because actually what happens is
you wake up during threat processing and

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750
you wake up during threat processing and
 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.869
you wake up during threat processing and
if you're depressed actually that gets

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879
if you're depressed actually that gets
 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.999
if you're depressed actually that gets
so intense you can't sleep so then you

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009
so intense you can't sleep so then you
 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.860
so intense you can't sleep so then you
just lay there all night worrying not

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870
just lay there all night worrying not
 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.320
just lay there all night worrying not
fun and those are fantasies about the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330
fun and those are fantasies about the
 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.209
fun and those are fantasies about the
negative elements of your past present

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219
negative elements of your past present
 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.990
negative elements of your past present
and future

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000
and future
 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.269
and future
then the fantasies can also breed

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279
then the fantasies can also breed
 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.209
then the fantasies can also breed
solutions and that's partly why Freud

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219
solutions and that's partly why Freud
 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.360
solutions and that's partly why Freud
regarded dreams as wish fulfillment it's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370
regarded dreams as wish fulfillment it's
 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.300
regarded dreams as wish fulfillment it's
partly and he wasn't that was where he

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310
partly and he wasn't that was where he
 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.899
partly and he wasn't that was where he
stopped it's not correct it's partially

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909
stopped it's not correct it's partially
 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.240
stopped it's not correct it's partially
correct it's like the fantasy will

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250
correct it's like the fantasy will
 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.610
correct it's like the fantasy will
provide you with a problem and a

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620
provide you with a problem and a
 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.409
provide you with a problem and a
potential solution but they're more like

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419
potential solution but they're more like
 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.230
potential solution but they're more like
problem identification mechanisms the

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240
problem identification mechanisms the
 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.100
problem identification mechanisms the
fantasies with the possibility of a

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110
fantasies with the possibility of a
 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.170
fantasies with the possibility of a
solution built in and so a way of

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
solution built in and so a way of
 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.850
solution built in and so a way of
thinking about that is that you

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
thinking about that is that you
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.040
thinking about that is that you
can generate potential futures so

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050
can generate potential futures so
 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.330
can generate potential futures so
they're like each segregate able

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340
they're like each segregate able
 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.400
they're like each segregate able
environments according to the rules of

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410
environments according to the rules of
 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.050
environments according to the rules of
your fantasy then you can generate

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060
your fantasy then you can generate
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.970
your fantasy then you can generate
little avatars of yourself that inhabit

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980
little avatars of yourself that inhabit
 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.440
little avatars of yourself that inhabit
each of those little universes and you

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450
each of those little universes and you
 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.930
each of those little universes and you
can run them as simulations and then you

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940
can run them as simulations and then you
 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.910
can run them as simulations and then you
can watch what happens in the simulation

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920
can watch what happens in the simulation
 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.920
can watch what happens in the simulation
and if it's a catastrophe then you don't

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930
and if it's a catastrophe then you don't
 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.050
and if it's a catastrophe then you don't
have to act it out and that's exactly

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060
have to act it out and that's exactly
 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.780
have to act it out and that's exactly
not exactly that's akin to what you're

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790
not exactly that's akin to what you're
 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.100
not exactly that's akin to what you're
doing when you go watch a movie

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
doing when you go watch a movie
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.290
doing when you go watch a movie
except that is much more coherent and

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300
except that is much more coherent and
 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.930
except that is much more coherent and
well thought through you know and then

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940
well thought through you know and then
 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.060
well thought through you know and then
it than just a dream which is often

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070
it than just a dream which is often
 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.740
it than just a dream which is often
quite fragmentary and that's part

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750
quite fragmentary and that's part
 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.450
quite fragmentary and that's part
because the dream is willing to

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460
because the dream is willing to
 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.990
because the dream is willing to
sacrifice coherence to play with

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000
sacrifice coherence to play with
 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.700
sacrifice coherence to play with
category structures you know and that's

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710
category structures you know and that's
 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.350
category structures you know and that's
why in dreams things can change from one

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360
why in dreams things can change from one
 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.970
why in dreams things can change from one
thing into another really weirdly or

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980
thing into another really weirdly or
 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.860
thing into another really weirdly or
scenes can change from one scene into

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870
scenes can change from one scene into
 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.380
scenes can change from one scene into
another without a logic the logic gets

it's dangerous to do that and that's

it's dangerous to do that and that's

it's dangerous to do that and that's
partly why you do it when you're asleep
