00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.610
During a typical sticky, unbearable August
weekend in 1965 in Gainesville- the home of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.270
the University of Florida Gators- football
practices were well underway in anticipation

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.590
for the upcoming season.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.280
However, the weather had wreaked havoc on
the freshman football team over the weekend.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.130
25 players had been admitted to the infirmary
with heat-related illness.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.080
Even those who didn’t get treatment were
losing a relatively large amount of water

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.550
weight due to sweating, with performance suffering
accordingly.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.800
This all greatly concerned the entire coaching
staff, but especially assistant coach Dwayne

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Douglas.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.860
He had experienced similar symptoms when he
was a player too (including in the NFL for

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.970
a short time before hurting his knee).

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.320
After a weekend of way too many of his players
falling ill, he decided to seek help with

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320
the problem.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.380
Robert Cade was a 37-year-old associate professor
of medicine at the University of Florida,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.410
specializing in kidney disease and one of
the few doctors in the country who was performing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.270
kidney dialysis at the time.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.610
When he was approached by one of his fellows,
who had been approached by Douglas wondering,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.240
among other things, why his players had difficulty
urinating for some time after practices, Cade

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.750
was quick to decide to tackle the task.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.110
After all, he was already well-known around
campus for making various drinks and concoctions

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.800
that helped with kidney function and digestion.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.010
He was also a big sports fan, having grown
up in St. Louis and loving the city’s baseball

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.150
team, the Cardinals.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.310
Cade and his team, including Dana Shire, A.M.
deQuesada, and Jim Free, went to work trying

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.170
to fashion a drink that would help the football
team survive in the Florida weather.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.340
First, though, this meant that Cade and co.
had to monitor the players practicing.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.400
Sometimes this meant stopping by practice
and collecting data via everything from blood

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.740
samples to taking player body temperature,
though Cade jokingly lamented that they were

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.000
not always able to get the most accurate data
possible, as the players “would not consent

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.730
to having practice stopped so we could measure
their body temperatures rectally.”

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.620
After testing the players during a number
of practices, the research team made some

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.930
pretty interesting discoveries.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.490
Beyond simply losing fluids, the players were
losing up to 25% of their bodies’ store

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.730
of salt through their sweat and their blood
pressure and blood sugar levels were significantly

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.890
lower than before the practices.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.110
While, according to Cade, the problem and
solution were relatively obvious even before

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.000
collecting data, neither he, nor really anyone
else, had ever bothered to put their mind

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
or research efforts to it.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.730
In fact, many coaches at the time even discouraged
drinking much water during athletic events

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.920
as it was thought it would hurt performance…

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.380
(For more on this bizarre thought process
that was around a surprisingly long time,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.889
see: The Trials and Tribulations of 1904 Olympic
Marathon Runners.)

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.830
Now with a bonafide physician and kidney specialist
leveling his brain power on the issue, however,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.470
the problem was quickly solved.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.290
“The solution,” Cade would say later,
“was to give them water, but with salt in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.310
it to replace the salt they were losing in
sweat.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.360
Also, give them sugar to keep their blood
sugar up.”

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.260
Unfortunately for Cade, his concoction also
apparently tasted worse than sweat.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.010
In fact, one of his fellow researchers, Dana
Shires, noted he thought it tasted like toilet

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.160
bowl cleaner… we can only assume he was
speaking metaphorically and hadn’t actually

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.889
ever tasted toilet bowl cleaner to literally
compare.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.540
Others said it had a distinctive seawater
quality to it, which is probably a bit more

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.840
accurate of a statement given its salty nature.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.750
Cade reportedly couldn’t even keep it down,
choking up the first gulp he took.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.140
Needless to say, in order for any athlete
to want to drink this stuff, it had to taste

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.449
better.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.260
At the suggestion of Cade’s wife, the researchers
purchased bushels of lemons to squeeze lemon

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.620
juice into the mixture.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.190
They also added the artificial sweetener cyclamate
to further help mask the taste.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.560
If you’re wondering why they didn’t simply
add more sugar, they were concerned too much

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.440
sugar would upset the stomachs of the players.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.970
In the end, the additional flavoring worked
enough that they players were willing to drink

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
it.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.971
According to Cade, the first on-field test
of what was then being called Cade’s Ade

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:30.720
or Cade’s Cola was during an intrasquad
scrimmage between the freshman football team

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.260
and the varsity squad’s B team.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.290
He claims, “At the end of the first half,
the B team was ahead 13-0.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.090
They pushed the freshmen around pretty good.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.690
In the third period, the freshmen, who had
been given the solution, came out and began

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.320
pushing the B team around.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.430
They scored two or three touchdowns in the
third period and five or six more in the fourth

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.430
period.”

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.940
Later that week, the Florida Gators were set
to take on the number five ranked Louisiana

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.840
State University Tigers.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.280
It was a showdown that the team was highly
anticipating, despite being heavy underdogs.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.330
On the sideline, Cade and his team set out
cups of their concoction hoping players would

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.940
drink it despite its urine color and – as
more than one player said – taste.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.100
They assured the players that it would help
them stay hydrated and fresh later in the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.580
game, just when LSU was tiring.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.550
The temperature during that matchup reportedly
peaked at 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 C).

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.240
Under the unbearable heat, the favored LSU
Tigers faded in the second half with the Gators

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.500
coming back to win 14 to 7.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.790
Later, Jim Free, who was a player on that
Gators team and would go on to become a doctor,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.870
would say, “If we had lost, you probably
would not have heard of Gatorade again.”

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.030
For the rest of the season, the yellow-tinted
liquid was on the sideline of every Florida

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.030
Gators game.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.910
They finished the season well, becoming known
as a “second-half team” for their tendency

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.610
to dominate towards the end of the game when
the other team was fading.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.440
Gatorade became a campus sensation, with Free
hanging a sign on Cade’s door that read

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.080
“Dr. Cade’s Lab, Home of GATORADE.”

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.220
Despite this, it wasn’t until late 1966
that the national media began to pick up on

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.580
how revolutionary Gatorade was.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.560
Things all changed when the Gators came from
behind and defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.320
Jackets in the Orange Bowl in 1967 and Yellow
Jackets’ coach Bobby Dodd publicly stated

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.030
the reason his team lost was “We didn’t
have Gatorade.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.910
That made the difference…”

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.530
Around that same time, Cade had companies
knocking on his door wanting to purchase the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.770
rights to sell the drink.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.440
Soon enough he sold Gatorade to Stokely-Van
Camp, a company known for its pork and beans

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440
products.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.380
Their agreement included a percentage of the
royalties going in perpetuity to Cade, his

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.480
research team, and some investors.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.220
This was all well and good until the product
started bringing in hundreds of thousands

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.670
of dollars and the University of Florida decided
that they, not Cade and his team, should be

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.220
the rights holders for the product.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.610
As Cade later noted, “They told me it belonged
to them and all the royalties were theirs.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.420
I told them to go to hell.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.440
So they sued us.”

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.550
The government also jumped in, noting that
Cade and his team were operating under a grant

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.600
from the U.S. Department of Health when they
invented Gatorade.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.280
After a lengthy legal battle, it was decided
that Cade, his team, and his investors would

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.960
share the royalties for the product with the
university 80/20 and, because of the federal

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.290
grant funding their research, they would rescind
patent applications related to the drink and

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.150
would publicly publish the Gatorade formula,
which they subsequently did.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.660
Since then, the total amount the university
has earned from Gatorade up through 2015 is

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.790
approximately $281 million.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.820
Doing the math on that 80/20 split, this means
Cade and his team have profited some $1.4

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.260
billion or so, though they’ve never publicly
shared this information, nor how they’ve

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.290
divvied up their profits.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.660
gatorade-showerThis brings us to how the practice
of dumping a large container of Gatorade over

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.400
a winning coach’s head, known as a Gatorade-Dunk,
got started.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.270
It’s commonly stated that this was first
done by Chicago Bears lineman Dan Hampton

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:52.220
when he dumped such a cooler over Mike Ditka’s
head after a game on November 25, 1984 in

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:58.720
which the Bears defeated the Vikings 34-3
in front of a crowd of 56,881.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.181
Why the Hampton angle continues to be touted
by many an otherwise reputable source is a

00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:09.540
mystery given easily found and readily available
video footage proving he wasn’t the first.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.580
Said footage shows New York Giant’s player
Jim Burt dumping a cooler of Gatorade over

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:19.210
coach Bill Parcells in a game on October 28,
1984 in which the Giants defeated the Redskins

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.040
37-13 in front of a crowd of 76,192.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.120
This is just under a month before Hampton
doused Ditka and gives us the actual first

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.850
known instance of such a Gatorade victory
shower.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.659
This dousing would become something of a tradition
after every win for the Giants, with Harry

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:39.579
Carson particularly enjoying the prank- even
going so far as dumping a container of popcorn

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:44.380
over President Ronald Reagan’s head when
visiting the White House in 1987 to celebrate

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.670
the Giant’s 1986 Super Bowl championship.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.670
(He didn’t think the Secret Service nor
President would appreciate an actual Gatorade

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.670
shower.)

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.010
It was that season, in which Parcells was
doused 17 times, that really thrust the practice

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.139
into the national spotlight thanks to the
final dumping after the Giant’s Super Bowl

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:00.500
victory, ultimately seeing the Gatorade shower
gain widespread adoption.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.180
As to the original motivation behind dumping
the cooler of Gatorade onto Parcells’ head,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.860
according to the book First in Thirst: How
Gatorade Turned the Science of Sweat Into

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.190
a Cultural Phenomenon, by Darren Rovell, and
corroborated in the book Point of Attack:

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.910
The Defense Strikes Back, by Harry Carson
himself, Burt was looking for a way to playfully

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.690
get back at Parcells for Parcells riding Burt
hard the previous week, including making him

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.510
lift and set back down a 20 pound (9.07 kg)
weight over and over again for 45 minutes.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:10:11.390
He simply figured dumping an icy cooler of
liquid over Parcells’ head if they won was

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:28.650
good payback.
