india i would like to ask q's and two

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
india i would like to ask q's and two
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.640
india i would like to ask q's and two
questions my first question is that

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
questions my first question is that
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.100
questions my first question is that
there are currently there are two

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
there are currently there are two
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259
there are currently there are two
prevailing theories for the evolution of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
prevailing theories for the evolution of
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.810
prevailing theories for the evolution of
universe first one is the Big Crunch and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
universe first one is the Big Crunch and
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939
universe first one is the Big Crunch and
second or in a big freeze I would like

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
second or in a big freeze I would like
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.509
second or in a big freeze I would like
to suggest a third one that is do you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
to suggest a third one that is do you
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.540
to suggest a third one that is do you
think whether the existence of wormholes

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550
think whether the existence of wormholes
 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.339
think whether the existence of wormholes
may create a new dimension for the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
may create a new dimension for the
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.009
may create a new dimension for the
evolution of universe since it prevents

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
evolution of universe since it prevents
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319
evolution of universe since it prevents
the collapse of the universe while it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
the collapse of the universe while it
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.290
the collapse of the universe while it
takes the way it continues to contract

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300
takes the way it continues to contract
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.940
takes the way it continues to contract
forming a maze of wormholes do you think

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
forming a maze of wormholes do you think
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.970
forming a maze of wormholes do you think
it is possible and my second question is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
it is possible and my second question is
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190
it is possible and my second question is
that in conventional computing we have

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200
that in conventional computing we have
 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130
that in conventional computing we have
modern micro process to process bits so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
modern micro process to process bits so
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.900
modern micro process to process bits so
what what would the quantum computing

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910
what what would the quantum computing
 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.020
what what would the quantum computing
processors would possibly look like
