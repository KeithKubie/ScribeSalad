00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Many people seek love or to be in a relationships

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.125
but that involves growth which can at times be painful,

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.725
compromised and vulnerability.

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:11.185
Love demands that we constantly improve, be more

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.805
understanding and practice patience.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.145
On the flip sided it also means knowing when things just

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:19.005
aren't working out anymore

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.835
and having the guts to leave. Confused about how you feel,

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:23.905
Here are 6 signs you were never in Love.

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:27.225
One, you move things fast with your partner.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.240
Infatuation thrives on speed while love takes time

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.400
to develop. Relationship expert Susan Winter says

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.575
"Infatuation lives in illusion.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.485
Love can survive reality".

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:41.240
When you're quick to jump in a relationship with someone, you base it off

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.080
your dreams more than whose really infront of you.

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.315
Common examples include fantasizing

00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:47.775
about your future with them,

00:00:47.775 --> 00:00:50.745
lusting after them, and obsessing about them

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:53.825
all done only after a few weeks of knowing them

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.865
Two, you expect them to be flawless, and then you get angry

00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:59.675
or disappointed when they show you their true colors.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:02.455
Do you believe in soulmates or fate?

00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:05.215
It sounds good in theory, right? But Winter

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.545
states that infatuation needs perfection

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:09.880
in order to survive. When you expect your partner

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:12.800
to be consistently well dressed, good with their words

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.585
or impressive with their accomplishments, you're

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.275
not giving them space to be honest with you.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.105
Love, on the other hand, is grounded.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.635
When you love someone, you accept their imperfections,

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.345
work through the bad and enjoy the good together,

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:30.255
Three, you're not comfortable around them.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.765
Okay,  who has'nt felt self conscious about saying

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.725
the wrong thing or making a bad impression? But when you truly

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:38.445
fall in love in someone, that's when you can let loose

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.455
and stop caring so much. Doctor Brennade Brown

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:44.495
research expert on vulnerability discovered that

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.125
those who have a strong sense of love and belonging

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.020
are more open to vulnerability.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.840
Whereas those who feel disconnected with their partners

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.865
consistently build their walls up. When you don't share

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:58.095
your emotions and struggles, nor secrets with someone,

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:00.785
you haven't fully loved. Four, you become more

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:03.485
distant. It's normal for passion to intensify

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.105
initially only to taper

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:08.065
off into a steady relationship. But two people

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:11.275
in love will still want to be around each other frequently.

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:14.375
If you find yourself wanting to get away from your partner

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.205
more and more these days, cancelling dinner plans

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:20.380
often because you'd rather go hang out with your friends or family

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.180
or cat, then something's up.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.680
Five, your mind is elsewhere, and soon your heart

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.880
follows too, Stephen Betchen, author of magnetic partners states that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.920
"Partners who are in love tend to maintain a focus on their

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:35.655
counterparts. When you notice the little things about them,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.355
or express concern when the two of you run into conflict,

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.845
it shows that you care for them.

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:41.425
But if you avoid those

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:44.185
tough conversations or slip away from arguments,

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:47.645
you also stop emphasizing their importance in your life.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:50.795
Six. you've developed anxiety,

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.805
Have you been experiencing digestive problems or have trouble sleeping?

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:56.825
Psychologist K. Bylist Kleely and Doctor

00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:58.645
Ann Shiba both say that

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.565
anxiety can show in this bodily function

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:04.565
you might have something you need to get off your chest and dread how

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:07.245
to break the news off to your partner. Remember, you can only

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.915
run away from the truth for so long before it catches

00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:12.985
up to you. Forcing love when it's absent will only

00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.745
the two of you. Both of you deserve to

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:18.855
find love elsewhere if it cannot be found in your relationship.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:21.725
Where do you think you stand on your feelings?

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.145
