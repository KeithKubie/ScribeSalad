00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.480
- [Narrator] A while back,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.030
I was teaching physics in California.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.400
I got to class and I
was all like, hey class,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.160
you wanna hear a physics joke?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.400
Yeah, okay, totally.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.850
Does light hold mass?

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.420
I don't know, does it?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.370
No, it's not even Catholic.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh man.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.470
Shoulda went to the beach today.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.350
Dude, really?

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.960
Totally lame.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.000
But wait, doesn't light really have mass?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.090
It should.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.120
It's got momentum so it's gotta have mass.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.440
It has momentum so it must have mass.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.730
Whoa, hey!

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.300
Everyone just calm the heck down.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.820
You see, the worst part of all this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.110
wasn't that my joke bombed,
it was that I actually managed

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.420
to confuse people by telling it.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.450
My students had read
that light has momentum

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.520
and they were right, light
really does have momentum.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.450
But then I come to class and I'm all like,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.570
hey, guess what, light has no mass.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.080
Now my students are
thinking to themselves,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.460
dude, but P equals MV.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.680
In other words, if momentum
equals mass times velocity,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.780
how could light, which has
no mass, ever have momentum?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.260
Well, I had to break it to my students

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.568
that P equals MV

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:16.830
isn't really accurate
for things that travel

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.930
close to the speed of light.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570
For things going that fast,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.050
you have to use special relativity.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.670
I don't wanna waste a lot of time

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.560
talking about special
relativity in this video

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.870
so you're just gonna have
to take my word for it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.810
that the rules of special
relativity allow for a loophole.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.730
This loophole provides a
way for massless objects

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.640
to have momentum.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.940
Alright, so the bad news
is that we cannot use

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.110
P equals MV to find the
momentum of a photon.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.540
The good news is that the
formula for the momentum

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.610
of a photon is simple,
the momentum of a photon

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.120
equals H over lambda.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.030
H is Planck's constant,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.030
6.626 times 10 to the
negative 34 joule-seconds.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.460
Lambda is the wavelength
of the light in meters.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.510
Be careful, don't use nanometers,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.490
you have to convert to meters.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.830
The momentum of a single photon
is gonna be extremely small,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.964
that's why it doesn't feel
like we're getting pushed on

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:19.670
very much when light shines
on us, but theoretically,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.680
if you had a big enough
solar sail, the light

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.260
bouncing off of that solar
sail could propel it forward

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.320
due to the impulse imparted
by the momentum of the light.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.260
Okay, so very long story short,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.830
you should never ever use P equals MV

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.310
to find the momentum of a photon.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.170
To find the momentum of a photon,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.991
you should always use
momentum equals H over lambda.
