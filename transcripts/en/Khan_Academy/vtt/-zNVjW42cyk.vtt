00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.560
- [Instructor] Get up from that chair

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.260
because doctors say that walking

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.500
for even two minutes every hour

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.373
can have a significant
impact on you're health.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.260
So, we've underlined you're

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.110
and this is strange

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.440
because you apostrophe re,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.250
this is a contraction for you are.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.360
And so, we should just be able
to replace it with you are

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.880
and see if it makes sense

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.110
because doctors say that even walking

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.580
for two minutes every hour
can have a significant impact

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.050
on you are health.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.680
That clearly doesn't make any sense.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.950
I am not health.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.940
So, let's rule out
keeping it the way it it.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.750
And the intention here was to have your,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.770
the second person possessive.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.660
Your health, whose health?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.940
Your health.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940
So, this is something that you have,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.380
you have your health,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.670
so this is what was intended

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.870
and they sound the same

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.570
but they're spelled differently.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.610
We want Y-O-U-R.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.200
Yours health, that
doesn't even sound right

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.810
or a significant impact on their health.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.470
Their health doesn't make sense

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.510
because they're telling,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530
the sentence is speaking
to the second person,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.650
it's saying get up from that chair,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.430
speaking directly to a person.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.930
So, if I'm speaking directly to a person,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.850
I would say hey you,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.700
I wouldn't say, them, or their health,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.970
so I would rule out these two as well.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.490
So, very important to realize

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.986
this your versus you're,

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:24.150
this is one of the the most
common grammar mistakes,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.547
I would say your versus you're

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.730
is up there with their versus there

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.240
and its and it's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.130
versus it's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.670
and in all of these cases,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.210
these are possessive
pronouns right over here

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.177
and these are other things

00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:50.480
and this one over here

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.810
and this one over here,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.890
these are contractions

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.790
and there, this is in
references to something,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.010
this is kind of saying a location,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.010
here or there or there are so many things,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.240
this is a possessive.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.480
So, these are good ones to know

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.110
and I think even the best of folks

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.020
have made this mistake

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.197
when they're typing an email really fast

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.733
and so, it's definitely a good
thing to keep a close eye on.
