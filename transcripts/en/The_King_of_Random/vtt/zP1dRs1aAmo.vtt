00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.560
&gt;&gt; In the past, we've had a few videos

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.940
where we melted down copper,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.139
some where we melted aluminum,

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:05.430
and some where we melted salt.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.930
And today, we're gonna see
what happens if we try combining

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.020
some of these things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.780
[Music]

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.640
Hey guys. I am Nate.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.300
Welcome back to
this Center of Science,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.420
the concrete pad.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.840
To start off, we'll throw
some aluminum into one crucible,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.099
and some salt into the other.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.760
We'll melt both of them at the same time,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.560
and try to pour them
both into one muffin tin,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.240
and see what happens as they combine.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:43.720
[Music]

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.620
Alright.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.760
Start by pouring some
aluminum into this ingot mold.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.160
That's nice and liquid.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000
Now let's see what happens
if we pour in some salt.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.660
[Music]

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.120
Oh, looks like the salt is kind of just
floating on the surface of the aluminum.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.560
I'm gonna see if I can stir it.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.660
[Music]

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.680
Well, the salt has cooled down.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.240
The aluminum is partially cooled down.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.940
They're both pretty liquid.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm going to try same thing in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.460
another ingot,
and I won't mix this one.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.740
[Music]

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.860
A bit of salt that spilled out
as I was trying to pour.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.520
Already cooled down.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.660
Cooled down is a relative term.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.560
It is solidified.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.880
But that piece of salt,
I bet still quite toasty.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.380
Ooh, and our aluminum
still is liquid right here.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.700
So it's got solidified salt,
but liquid metals still going on.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.960
Is that underneath this salt
might still be liquid aluminum too,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.939
but I don't want to break
through the surface of the salt.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.060
I want to let it cool down
entirely while it's in the tin.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.960
[Music]

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.600
There we go.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.660
Our aluminum has now solidified,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.980
at least in that one.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.760
We'll give it a little
bit more to cool down.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.859
And then we'll try
and pop it out of the tin.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.870
This one started sort
of moving up at an angle,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.260
not sure what's causing that.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.580
Might be the bottom of
the tin has warped a little bit.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.580
Alright, I think
our salt and our aluminum,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.500
they're still very warm,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.000
but I think they're cooled down enough

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that they're quite solid,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.720
so I'm gonna see if I can flip
this pan over and shake them out.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.280
[Music]

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.420
There's one.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.540
[Music]

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.459
This one doesn't want to come out so well.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.320
Maybe it will come out in pieces.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.300
Oh, there it is.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.440
Well, even though I tried mixing it,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.380
it looks like for the most part,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.600
it's still one piece
of aluminum at the bottom,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000
and then some slightly
mixed up salt and aluminum

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.140
on top of that piece on the bottom.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.680
And of course, this one
where I poured them separate,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.500
they're pretty much separate.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.280
Once this is completely cooled,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.820
which it's still very hot.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.440
Once it's all the way cooled down,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.220
I might see if I can
pull these two pieces apart.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.660
Alright, let's try this.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.720
So I'll do salt first,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.660
then aluminum.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.100
[Music]

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.180
Alright, I've done aluminum and then salt.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.380
And then I tried the same thing

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.180
and mixed it up.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.980
Now, just to see if
I get any different result,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.020
I'm gonna pour the salt in first,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.540
and the aluminum on top of it.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.940
[Music]

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.980
Pretty sure the aluminum just
went right down through the salt

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.120
into the tin.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.510
I bet it's gonna end up looking
a lot like the one where we didn't mix it.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.800
The color of it really starts
to change as it cool down.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.129
That's kind of interesting.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.700
Well, we tried with aluminum.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.220
Let's try this with copper,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.740
which is so much heavier to lift up
with a pair of tongs than aluminum is.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:03.820
[Music]

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.320
Oh.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.660
I think my aluminum
was still a little bit soft.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.940
Yes, yes it is.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.980
It's kind of like a paste.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.340
Well, I think I was too eager
to get that out of the tin.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.020
I'll just flip that back over,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.380
let it cool down on the nice concrete.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.380
Yesterday, we tried
melting down the copper ingots

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.100
to try and get some molten copper,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.320
but despite sitting
in the furnace for 45 minutes,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.540
they wouldn't melt.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.660
It's also possible that
they aren't pure copper.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.780
I'm not entirely sure
what they were cast from.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.700
They could be an alloy
with some other metal.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.460
So today,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.060
we're gonna try melting down
just some of this copper pipe,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.940
there's a lot more exposed surface area,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.180
and should go much faster.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.230
[Music]

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.520
Our copper is melted,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.220
and I actually put our
cup of salt in there as well,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.420
so that should also be liquid.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.290
Let's take them both out of the furnace,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.180
and see what happens
if we mix them together.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.760
[Music]

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.500
Nice molten copper down
in the bottom of that cup.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.580
That looks pretty neat.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.500
Oh, and it cools down quickly.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.031
The pipes were sitting over the edge,

00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:11.090
and some of it had spilled,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.800
and so we've just got a little puddle
of copper formed at the bottom there.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.000
Here's our copper.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.820
Here is our salt.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.640
Start by pouring the copper into the ingot.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.180
That looks really cool.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.540
Alright, adding some salt.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.600
3, 2, 1.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.460
I think the salt
cooled down the copper.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.060
I'm just gonna pour
more copper on top of that.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.880
Sinks right through it.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.340
I guess that's not surprising.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.580
The copper melts at
almost 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.400
And our furnace only barely
gets above 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.640
The salt melts at closer
to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.060
and it started cooling down fairly
quickly after I took it out of the furnace,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.840
to the point that I think
when I poured the molten salt

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.560
on to the molten copper,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.560
the heat difference was enough

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.060
that the molten salt
actually cooled down the copper.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.460
Our cup didn't really
love being in the furnace

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.870
of that temperature either.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.180
As you can see it's flaking like mad.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.410
So here we have what I believe
is now just completely cooled copper

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.601
with some still liquid salt on top of it.

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:30.480
The salt is starting
to cool down as well.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.930
You can see crystallizing on top.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.220
And it's just gonna keep crystallizing
until it's solid all the way through.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.500
And then hopefully, we can get
this ingot out of the mold.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.820
Sometimes, our ingots kind
of like to bond to the steel.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.560
But I'm hoping that
once this one cools down,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.340
we'll be able to get it out just fine.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.280
Molten copper looks awesome.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.840
Here's another piece of copper
which doesn't look anything

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.300
like copper right now

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.560
because it's just so covered
in carbon and smoke and stuff,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.620
but that's just copper right there.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.940
I bet we can sand that down,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.490
and maybe even polish it up.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.400
And bring that color back out.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.260
That is now solidified.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.500
But of course,
it's still extremely hot.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.580
So we got to give it some time to cool.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.900
[Music]

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.340
Well, some aluminum from previously.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.520
[Music]

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.480
Oh some of our salt broke out.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.680
The copper still attached.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.440
A very different color of salt.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.410
So having the copper in it
may have done something to it.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.140
Looks like we kind of had
layering in how the salt cooled.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.360
[Music]

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.580
That is pretty well attached there.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.900
I think we're starting
to have our entire muffin tin

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.580
pop out of the whole tray.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.680
We might need a new muffin tray.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.560
Its probably about that time.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.360
The whole tray is loose.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.660
Just need to kind of tear
it the rest the way out.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.860
And then I'm gonna
probably tear it open,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.060
if I need to to get the copper out.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.960
Well, I scraped away some salt.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.150
You can see the exposed
copper underneath it.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.900
I think the moral of this story
is that you should always use

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.100
a new muffin tin
to pour molten copper into.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.820
Because, man a lot of it
is sticking a lot.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.650
I don't know that a new muffin
tin would make it stick less,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.800
but I think it would.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.440
Ha!

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:41.780
Well, finally, got the muffin tin
off of our salt and copper block.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.120
See if I can break off some more of that.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.260
You can see there's just
the exposed copper underneath it,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.400
with not a lot of mixing going on.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.400
Although something turned
our salt very very brown.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.480
It's possible that that was just
from being heated up in our steel cup,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.310
but we haven't had anywhere
near that result before.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.160
So I'm betting somehow,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.980
there's copper mixed into this salt,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.820
at least on some level.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.090
The salt comes off the copper
more easily than the copper

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.440
came off the muffin tin.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.900
Comparing the aluminum mixed with salt,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.620
and the copper mixed with salt

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.620
is kind of strange.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.960
And I don't know if
there's a definite correlation,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.490
but the salt and aluminum,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.240
the salt really turns
sort of a grayish white,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.840
and aluminum is sort of
a grayish white metal.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.440
Whereas with the copper,
which is a very orange-brown metal,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.180
our salt really took on
a brownish orange color.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.120
Like I said, I don't know
for sure that it's any of the metal

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.020
being mixed into the salt there,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.080
but it seems to have picked up
some of the characteristics of it.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.640
We got some really cool colors
from our copper being melted down.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.980
I really like that look.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.280
That's always fun.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.460
Hey guys. Grant here.
Quick reminder.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.920
We're giving away a
Nintendo Switch and Mario Kart 8.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.080
There's a link down in the description,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.100
so you can get your name on the list.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.240
If that's not what you want,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.640
we're sending the gift receipt as well,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.750
so you can take it back to the store,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.200
and get the cash back instead.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.140
