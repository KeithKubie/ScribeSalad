1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,900
This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich
and today we are talking about the

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,440
placebo effect and the
power of suggestion.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,810
We're looking at a lot of new research.
I don't know. It was new research we've,

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,140
we've done well. It is new research,

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,090
but the problem has been
with us for centuries,

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,230
even at the very beginning of the
age of reason. Let me take you back.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,450
18th Century. The enlightenment was in
full swing. There was change in the air.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,550
Voltaire was denouncing the
church. Ben Franklin was flying.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,860
Kite live was Yang, was
inventing chemistry.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,800
It was the beginning of
modern times. Modern Science,

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,820
you might say reason inquiry. People
were reexamining the big questions.

13
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,960
How does the world work? What possibly
could hold everything together

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,480
and this was new.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,720
Well, you have to understand that
in earlier historical moments,

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,380
the unification of the universe was
not a problem because it was God that

17
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:03,270
unified everything and everything was
a manifestation of God. That's it.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,310
Colin talking about God,
he's a, he's starring you.

19
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,540
But if God isn't the glue that
holds the universe together,

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,250
then what does hold the world

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,620
together? Enter End Twan.
Mesmer and who? Antwan Mesmeric.

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,820
Have you ever said a,

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,830
you mesmerize me my dolling feel
to that said the word Mesmer.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,610
I'm as mesmerization comes from Anton
Mesmer was a real historical figure.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,340
So he's part of our narrative. Yeah,

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,780
I'll get out on my way home
to tell the rest of the story.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So in 1778 he moves to
Paris and he has a theory,

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,190
he believed that the world was filled
with a kind of fluid that moved through

29
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:43,850
all living things and he gave it his
own kind of sexy name, animal magnetism,

30
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,790
or as they say in the French
magnetism and he married it, right?

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,580
And as this force flowed
through all of life,

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,350
occasionally it would get stuck like
in a traffic jam, it would bunch up.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,000
Right? And that is also the bunching
up can also be a cause of a problem.

34
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,510
That's what he thought. Being
sick was blocking the flow.

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,870
I restrictions in the flow of
animal magnetism in the organism.

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,800
I mean not that dissimilar to the way
that we understand traditional Chinese

37
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:09,634
medicine.

38
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,200
She with the needles and
the, and the acupuncture.

39
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,930
A Mesmer thought this life
was when it got stuck,

40
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:18,870
could be released with a little help
from needles. You don't know. This is a,

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,260
there's a lot more theatrical.

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,100
He created a kind of salon.
I actually think of it as um,

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,780
a prototype for the,

44
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:30,650
the idea of a happening in the 60s
that's the way I like to think of it.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,161
You know,

46
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:35,090
it's sort of like everybody kind of
came in and there was this like music,

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,840
there was like dim light

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,520
and he would walk around in
his lovely purple suit and,

49
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,950
and he had to let her pull.
Yeah, I think he was a,

50
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,430
a lilac was a belief that
actually lifts the shade that

51
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,640
report it and then he would go
over to a particular client.

52
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,361
Usually it was a women,

53
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:54,870
most of his clients were women and he
would madame sit across from them and

54
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:59,871
their knees would touch
your magnetism or it is,

55
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,940
how do say all pushy and
then to unblock this flow,

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,810
he would stare into her eyes stare. Right?

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,720
[inaudible] if he, if he jammed
you, how would you know? Oh okay,

58
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,640
cause you would have a healing
crisis. What was that? Simple?

59
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,250
They would scream, they would vibrate,

60
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,670
had actually a padded room where the
ladies could go and loosen their corsets

61
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:37,340
and fling themselves about and bang
their heads against the wall and whatever

62
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:41,420
they needed to do in order to kind
of release the damned up energy.

63
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,700
It was apparently quite dramatic.

64
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,390
Oh my, the looks of it.

65
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:50,810
They were real seizures and people
said they felt better afterwards.

66
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,750
So word spread and SUNY had disciples

67
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,170
and then more disciples and it had
a lot of popularity. Yes it did.

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,400
So he did what any businessman would
do. He franchised it, he branched out.

69
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,750
And I mean this, literally,
he magnetized trees, trees,

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,510
trees, Mesmer, or,

71
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,350
or sometimes his assistants would
take to magnetized iron rods,

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,590
touch them to a tree in the forest,

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,720
and that would transfer
the magnetism to the tree.

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,720
The tree would then have the kind of
therapeutic powers that a mesmerist would

75
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:26,000
have, how convenient. That's in
Harrington, a Harvard historian.

76
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,900
And this was quite efficient because
then you could sort of have the trees do

77
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,940
part of the work for you.

78
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,150
So imagine if you will.

79
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:36,320
Lots and lots of people gathered around
a tree touching each other and the tree

80
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,420
and allowing the flow
to move through them.

81
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,280
Then they would all have fits together.

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,720
And the problem was the doctors of the
time who used to have all these people as

83
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,450
their patients were now
losing patients and money.

84
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,730
So they protested to the king.

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,310
King established a commission.

86
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,110
And actually one of the members of
that commission was Benjamin Franklin,

87
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,230
who at the time was the
ambassador to France.

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
And there were other important scientists.

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,250
[inaudible] was one of them. Is that
the guillotine? We know from the right,

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,540
so we're talking here about a major,
major league panel. These were big guys,

91
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,120
big names,

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,120
and they devised a series of experiments
to test for a magnetic field.

93
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,570
They weren't concerned whether
or not animal magnetism work.

94
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,980
They were concerned whether or not
animal magnetism existed because they

95
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,480
figured, you know, it can work

96
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,280
even though it may not exist.

97
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,380
And one of the most dramatic tests that
they devised is sometimes identified as

98
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,040
the first placebo
controlled trial in history.

99
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,100
[inaudible]

100
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,710
they were actually down on
Benjamin Franklin's estate.

101
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,840
This was just south of Paris and
Franklin himself conducted an experiment

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,690
and it involved front of a young
boy. Is that on too tightly?

103
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,830
No. Yeah, that was with 12, 13
years old. Can you see anything? No.

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,750
Any light at all? No. And uh,
he was told that is the deal.

105
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,380
Young boy, a lot of these five oak trees,

106
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,660
one of the trees on the estate has
been eyes by an actual mesmerist.

107
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,120
We'll take you to one tree at a time.

108
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,530
Your job is to tell us which
one has been magnetized.

109
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,760
They said one of the trees when magnetised
and where you blindfold you and you,

110
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,960
you tell us when you
know you're up by them.

111
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:34,961
Magnetic trees cause patients insisted
that they could feel the energy.

112
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,500
And by the way, I believe them,

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,010
I'm totally persuaded that the
real experiences were happening.

114
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,440
They brought the boy to one
tree, this is tree number one.

115
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,350
He began to kind of shake and
they brought him to another.

116
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,540
We started before tree number two.

117
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,240
They began to sweat and by the time they
brought him to the third and they look

118
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,640
forward. Here we are before tree number

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,300
II sort of collapsing convulsions,

120
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,340
which is all that dramatic
except okay tree number one,

121
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,750
tree number two and number
three and number four. Yup.

122
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,140
Had never been magnetized.

123
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,320
So this was seen as pretty definitive
evidence that there was no mandate

124
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,480
magnetic force here.

125
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,620
But they also didn't think that
the boy was sort of faking it.

126
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,340
So what they concluded was that
there is no magnetic force,

127
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,370
but that all the effects which they don't
deny the reality of were caused by the

128
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:36,150
imagination.

129
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,340
That was Harvard just starting in.
And Harrington and Rutgers historian,

130
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,350
Ed Cohen, my final stuff in this hour
comes from reporter Gregory Warner,

131
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,090
who recently visited a tent
revival in upstate New York,

132
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:54,890
little Adirondacks, lakeside community,
very rural to see a faith healing.

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,480
Okay, so, so I get there and I'm a little
bit late, I'm a little bit nervous,

134
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,270
there's a lot of mosquitoes.
People are restless,

135
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,240
they're sitting in their chairs,
the tent flaps are still up,

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,780
the sun is kind of setting. And Steve,

137
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,000
Steve Booza is going on about some
verses of scripture and people are really

138
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,270
bored. And he says, don't worry,
we're going to get to the healing.

139
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,550
Pretty soon the readings
important too, you know,

140
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,490
that kind of thing like a teacher,
like so then he says, okay,

141
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:23,750
now it's time for some healing.

142
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:28,751
The flaps go down and suddenly the space
changes because what was before this

143
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:34,781
kind of people milling in and out
becomes this very focused title chamber.

144
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,410
And in the beginning of the
Ministry of any kind combined, okay,

145
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,870
this preacher who, who is
this guy? That's Steve Booza,

146
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,530
he owns a construction company
in Syracuse. All the [inaudible]

147
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,800
physical healings. Financers,

148
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,700
so he's looking out into the crowd and
then the volunteer comes up. Hi. Hi.

149
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,960
Strawberry Blonde hair. Pink
Cardigan. Okay. Oh my new,

150
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,780
my backbone shit and yeah, Ninja backbone
straight and tell me what your honor,

151
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,980
how old is she? She's in high
school in an s shape. B diagnosis,

152
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,400
her scoliosis. That's cool though.
Don't let this scare scary.

153
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,520
Now I'm not trying to scare her.

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,910
Scoliosis of the spine
is 100% of the time.

155
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,680
Demonic. Okay, that's not
even physical. That's a demon.

156
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,990
I'm standing next to Steve. If it's
going to be straightened right now,

157
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,540
can be your hands full.
He spins her around.

158
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,190
I break any generational curse off of
my sister right now. In Jesus name,

159
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,380
you'll spirit of scoliosis.

160
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,050
I break your power and then all of a
sudden you spirit me now in Jesus name

161
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,570
backbone,

162
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,350
be straightened and Jesus just kind of
shoved her forward straight and right now

163
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:50,970
in Jesus name and Jesus. Then try it now.

164
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,740
Move around. Do what
you couldn't do before.

165
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,840
Stand back and give yourself plenty
of room movement. Moving more

166
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,323
faith.

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,990
I really don't want to say that she
was healed or that she wasn't healed

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,090
because she was just crying for some of
this. This isn't a hundred percent bad,

169
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,690
but I did meet a woman who something,

170
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,730
I think something did happen with
the other woman that I met had.

171
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,660
Okay, so there was nothing wrong
with it. From my phone sticks out.

172
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,853
She comes up,

173
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,150
I'm older woman in her 50s or 60s and
she just holds her hands up and I know I

174
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,130
clean offices sometimes

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,240
do have carpal tunnel problems.
Carpal tunnel. Explain what that is.

176
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,580
I mean as far as I know, it's
like an inflammation of the,

177
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,400
of the ligaments and it's
really, really painful.

178
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,010
It's a repetitive stress injury. I
want to show you something though.

179
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:56,340
Sandra sand right here. Sideways
cover. You could everybody see he,

180
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,180
what he does is he basically tells her
to to grip together her little pen,

181
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,010
pinkie and her phone and make
a ring like an okay symbol.

182
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,450
I'm going to take my
smallest finger, my pancake.

183
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,690
Then he sticks his finger in in the rain.

184
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,750
Try to see if I can pull my pinky
through. Your hand. He says,

185
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,960
I'm going to try to break it and you try
to stop me and I want you to fight me.

186
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,540
Now I want to, I want to see how much
strength you have. After you're ready,

187
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,950
he just pops it right open. You
got no strength. Throw it all day.

188
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,490
She can't hold her grip. That means
she got trouble in her carpal tunnel,

189
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,210
which is right here. Give me
those hands. Give me no chance.

190
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,150
She gives me her hand. He takes
it and both of his carpal tunnel.

191
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,440
I command you in Jesus
name for all swelling and
inflammation and rubbing right

192
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,280
now his thumbs,

193
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,700
I command all the ligaments and tendons
circled back to the normally last.

194
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,590
Statistically that's supposed
to be a narrow command.

195
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:47,670
All pain to be going out to this carpal
tunnel region like command healing like

196
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:51,420
one to this entire arm and his carpal
tunnel and all strengths that come back

197
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,610
there and Jesus then don't
do it again. He said, okay,

198
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,170
let's do the same
demonstration right again.

199
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,340
He hasn't bring her pinky against her
thumb. Now make that, make that grip.

200
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,890
I'm going to take my big finger
and I'm going to fight you.

201
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,920
And when he puts his finger in this and
watch what's going to happen and fold

202
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,070
your ready, he doesn't break her grip

203
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,050
and you can hear, he just drags
her right across the stage.

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,353
Okay?

205
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,800
The silly it worked. It maybe
did Lee's temporarily. Um,

206
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,680
she went back to her seat. They gave
her a blanket. She was really trembling.

207
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,060
I went over to talk to her.

208
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,330
Can you describe what
the experience was like?

209
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,160
But then when he did that thing,

210
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,390
Christian belief is that
Christ died for our sins.

211
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,400
We actual phrases, which they always
repeat is Jesus Christ. I'm healed.

212
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,440
By his stripes, we were healed by
the stripes of Jesus. You work.

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,970
He killed me when he died on
the crush. What does that mean?

214
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,770
It means that you were healed.

215
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:08,360
Meaning he died in the cross for
our sins and also for our ailments.

216
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,940
So we've already been hit.
We've already been healed.

217
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,260
We just have to access it and realize
it by our connection and relationship to

218
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,940
God. Okay, so, so what
happened to Linda afterwards?

219
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,540
The carpal tunnel came back
almost immediately. And um,

220
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,250
I met with her in a coffee shop.

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
But this is my belief from reading
the word of God. The Devil,

222
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,530
Satan comes in, tries
to talk you out of that.

223
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:34,780
He like he'll say you
didn't really get healed.

224
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,850
You know those things come into your
mind. And I believe that's just Satan.

225
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,900
So you have to have strong faith to
stand against that pain is Satan's way of

226
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:49,560
testing her belief? I think
that's what she thinks.

227
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:53,580
I talk to Satan and I tell them, yeah,
like the pain is part of the test.

228
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,540
God says you are liar and if the
pain is there, you wants me to pos,

229
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,690
she's not healed. She's seeing this,

230
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,670
this bigger struggle,

231
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:07,530
this bigger battle where pain is
just one more kind of obstacle.

232
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,250
Not that there aren't
times that I, I doubt I do,

233
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,730
but I have to be pet and I
have to say, I'm sorry God,

234
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:18,870
I doubt it because I know
you feel me so many times.

235
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,650
There's so many different things.
So I know it's for real. It's not,

236
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,240
you know, fake. I'm not part cause I know
that. I think that's a crucial point.

237
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,940
I mean if we think of it
as a medical encounter,

238
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,670
it's about pain in the body.

239
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,330
But if we think of it as a spiritual
encounter, the way she sees it,

240
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,780
it's really a battle against doubt.

241
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,240
