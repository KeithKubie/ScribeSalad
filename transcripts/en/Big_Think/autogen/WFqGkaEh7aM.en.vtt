hey Bill Nye its tailor baggert I was

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
hey Bill Nye its tailor baggert I was
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.639
hey Bill Nye its tailor baggert I was
wondering what you think about the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
wondering what you think about the
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.650
wondering what you think about the
censorship of scientific discoveries if

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
censorship of scientific discoveries if
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.299
censorship of scientific discoveries if
the discovery could be used in a harmful

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
the discovery could be used in a harmful
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.180
the discovery could be used in a harmful
way if there were censorship how should

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
way if there were censorship how should
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460
way if there were censorship how should
the censorship process be designed and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
the censorship process be designed and
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.529
the censorship process be designed and
what groups should be involved in

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
what groups should be involved in
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.000
what groups should be involved in
determining what the public does and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
determining what the public does and
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070
determining what the public does and
does not get to know thanks so much

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
does not get to know thanks so much
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.679
does not get to know thanks so much
Taylor Taylor Taylor we in the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
Taylor Taylor Taylor we in the
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720
Taylor Taylor Taylor we in the
scientific community have this process

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
scientific community have this process
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.349
scientific community have this process
we have this censorship process in the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
we have this censorship process in the
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120
we have this censorship process in the
sense that we have what's called peer

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
sense that we have what's called peer
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.380
sense that we have what's called peer
review this is where somebody comes up

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
review this is where somebody comes up
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.400
review this is where somebody comes up
with a scientific claim or a belief or a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
with a scientific claim or a belief or a
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.619
with a scientific claim or a belief or a
test result experimental result other

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
test result experimental result other
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.279
test result experimental result other
people read it read the paper study his

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
people read it read the paper study his
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650
people read it read the paper study his
or her results and see if there's any

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
or her results and see if there's any
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.819
or her results and see if there's any
validity to them then if there is that

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829
validity to them then if there is that
 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.569
validity to them then if there is that
paper or that information gets published

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579
paper or that information gets published
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.040
paper or that information gets published
so there is in a sense scientific

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
so there is in a sense scientific
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619
so there is in a sense scientific
censorship in a sense if someone makes

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
censorship in a sense if someone makes
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.679
censorship in a sense if someone makes
an extraordinary claim that silly or can

information is available to everybody so
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010
information is available to everybody so
the real challenge is not censorship

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
the real challenge is not censorship
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249
the real challenge is not censorship
it's what I would call critical thinking

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
it's what I would call critical thinking
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.819

the military you know I you know I had

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200
the military you know I you know I had
 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.340
the military you know I you know I had
security clearance very briefly and you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
security clearance very briefly and you
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.690
security clearance very briefly and you
take it you just take it really

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
take it you just take it really
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.880
take it you just take it really
seriously because you think the security

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
seriously because you think the security
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.730
seriously because you think the security
of your native country is at stake and

and I when you say sensor I heard you

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640
and I when you say sensor I heard you
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.130
and I when you say sensor I heard you
referred to who's going to adjudicator

make the decisions and those traditions
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.470
make the decisions and those traditions
of secrecy I think will be in the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
of secrecy I think will be in the
 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000
of secrecy I think will be in the
military anyway will be there for a long

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
military anyway will be there for a long
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.330
military anyway will be there for a long
time but the real problem is the lack of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
time but the real problem is the lack of
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.690
time but the real problem is the lack of
censorship it's just stuff all this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
censorship it's just stuff all this
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.790
censorship it's just stuff all this
information is everywhere so we need to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
information is everywhere so we need to
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.949
information is everywhere so we need to
find ways to sort it out because there's

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
find ways to sort it out because there's
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.470
find ways to sort it out because there's
there's no stopping it once when you try

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
there's no stopping it once when you try
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.050
there's no stopping it once when you try
to retract something that's been

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060
to retract something that's been
 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.490
to retract something that's been
published electronically it's very

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
published electronically it's very
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.620
published electronically it's very
different it's very difficult what we

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630
different it's very difficult what we
 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.449
different it's very difficult what we
need is people to notice that whatever

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459
need is people to notice that whatever
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.750
need is people to notice that whatever
was clearly false that was published was

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
was clearly false that was published was
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.180
was clearly false that was published was
clearly false that is a great question

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
clearly false that is a great question
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.380
clearly false that is a great question
