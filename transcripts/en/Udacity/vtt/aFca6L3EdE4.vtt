00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.287
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we know that these two numbers a and b need to add to equal 8 and

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:09.060
multiply to equal 15, can you fill in what they are down here? This is going to

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.681
give us the factored form of x squared plus 8x plus 15. Doesn't matter which

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.988
number goes in which box, as long as you get the right combination of two

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:18.642
numbers.
