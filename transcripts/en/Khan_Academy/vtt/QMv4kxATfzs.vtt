00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.300
I want to make one
clarification on my video

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.360
on supernovae, because that's
the plural for supernova,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.790
is that I said this supernova
occurred 1,000 years ago.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.810
That's actually not
precisely right.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.340
The supernova was first
observed 1,000 years ago,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.530
or the light from
that first explosion

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.960
was observed by astronomers
we believe 1,000 years ago.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.510
But we have to be
very clear here.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.880
Because the Crab
nebula at its core

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.560
is roughly 6,500
light years away,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.650
even this light, even this
image we see right here

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.210
is that nebula as it
was 6,500 years ago.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.300
And so the supernova itself, if
we think about when it actually

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.880
occurred, it actually must have
occurred about 7,500 years ago.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.050
So it must have occurred
about 7,500 years ago.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.730
And that first slide
from that first explosion

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.250
from that first energetic
event reached us

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.950
about 1,000 years ago.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.570
So it took 6,500
years to get to us,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390
and reached us 1,000 years ago.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.769
So first light 1,000 years ago.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:17.060
Just wanted to make that clear.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.300
Might have been obvious
to some of you all,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.969
but always important
to think about it.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.510
When I said 1,000
years ago, I really

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.200
should have said it
was first observed,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680
the explosion was
observed 1,000 years ago.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.500
But since it's so
far, the actual event

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.660
must have occurred
7,500 years ago.
