00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Voiceover] Let's figure out what 6.3

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.620
divided by 0.25 is.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.232
And when I look at something like this,

00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:08.832
the first thing that
I think about is well,

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:10.792
is there a way that I can rewrite this?

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.492
Instead of dividing it by 25 hundredths,

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.952
instead of dividing it by 0.25,

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:19.552
I could divide it by a
whole number, maybe 25.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:23.212
And so how do I turn
25 hundredths into 25?

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:24.432
Well, if I multiply it by,

00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:26.892
if I multiply it by 10 once,

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.133
then. the decimal's one spot to the right.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.592
And if I multiply it by 10 twice,

00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:33.992
then I'm gonna move
two spots to the right.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.752
And 25 hundredths is going to become 25.

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:41.512
I multiplied by 10 twice,
which is the same thing

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:43.852
as multiplying by a hundred.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:46.972
Now of course, I can't only do it to 0.25,

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:49.912
that would change the value
of this entire expression.

00:00:49.912 --> 00:00:52.113
I also have to do it to 6.3.

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:54.852
If I move the decimal to
the right twice over here,

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.332
to get a whole number, I gotta move

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:58.593
the decimal twice to the right over here.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.072
So let's see, if I move
it to the right once,

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:06.033
I get 63, so that's one
multiplication by 10.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.672
And now I wanna move
it to the right again,

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:09.412
and you might say, "Wait,
wait, there doesn't look like

00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:10.612
"there's any other digits here

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.652
"that I can move to the right of."

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:14.252
And we just have to remind ourselves,

00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:18.832
that 6.3, well that's going
to be the same thing as 6.30,

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:20.052
or we could actually as many zeroes

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.352
as we want to the end of this,

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.082
and not change the value, it's still 6.3.

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.002
Six and three tenths is the same thing

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.222
as six and 30 hundredths.

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:31.232
So now, I can move the decimal
one more spot to the right.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.382
And, so I'm multiplying by 10 again.

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:37.582
And it becomes 630.

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.982
So 6.3 divided by 0.25 is the same thing

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:44.502
as 630 divided by 25.

00:01:44.502 --> 00:01:45.263
And let me do that again,

00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:48.322
because this is really, the
tricky part, or the artful part,

00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:49.942
when you're dividing decimals.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.812
If I were to write,

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:56.772
0.25, being divided into,

00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:59.002
being divided into,

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.782
6.3.

00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:03.422
Six, let me do it.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:07.112
Six, 6.3.

00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:09.612
Now, what I care about is moving
this decimal to the right,

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:11.512
far enough so that this
becomes a whole number.

00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:12.852
I don't have to move it any further,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:15.372
just far enough so that
this becomes a whole number.

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:16.632
And then I have to move this,

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:18.812
the same number of times to the right.

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.712
But the goal is to make
this a whole number,

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.512
not to make the 6.3 a whole number,

00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:25.732
although that is going to
happen for this particular case.

00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:28.292
So if I move it two spaces to the right,

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:30.122
so, one, two.

00:02:31.152 --> 00:02:33.812
0.25 becomes 25,

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:35.872
and then 6.3 becomes,

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.512
move it one space, two
spaces to the right,

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:40.612
it becomes 630.

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:43.372
And so let me, let me clarify that,

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:45.952
let me just clear all of this
stuff away out of the way,

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:49.352
to just make that clear what I just did.

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:50.392
So we don't have to deal with all

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:52.532
of this messiness when we're actually

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:54.912
doing our long division now.

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:57.312
And so this one over here,

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.652
let me erase all of this business.

00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:02.472
And we are ready to do some,

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:06.653
we're ready to do some,
some long division, alright.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.372
So now this is just straightforward,

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:11.032
dividing a two digit number
into a three digit number.

00:03:11.032 --> 00:03:12.592
And so we could say,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.892
well, 25 goes into six zero times,

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:15.612
so let's keep going.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.672
25 goes into 63, let's see,

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:20.373
two times 25 is 50,

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:22.813
three times 25 is 75, so that's too much,

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:24.912
so we wanna go two times.

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:27.642
Two times 25 is going to be 50,

00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:30.255
and we can subtract.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:33.255
Or, if you didn't know two
times 25 is going to 50,

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:36.375
you could have said two times five is 10,

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.335
carry the one or regroup the one.

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:41.975
Two times two is four, plus one is five.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:43.595
So we got 50.

00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:45.915
And now we subtract, and we get

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.595
three minus zero is three,

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:50.175
six minus five is one.

00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.675
And now we bring down the next digit.

00:03:53.675 --> 00:03:56.335
We can bring down this zero.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:57.785
And we could say, 25, and let me

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.565
scratch this out, so I
don't confuse myself later.

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:03.505
25 goes into 130 how many times?

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:06.225
Let's see, 25 times four is 100,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.585
25 times five is 125,

00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:11.085
25 times six would be
150, so that's too big.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:12.985
So I'm gonna go five times.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:15.825
So five times,

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:16.737
And I write, it's very important to

00:04:16.737 --> 00:04:18.677
keep track of my places right here,

00:04:18.677 --> 00:04:20.157
I brought down the zero to make

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:21.857
the 13 into 130,

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:24.317
so I say 25 goes into 130 five times,

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:26.237
I write it above the zero,

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:28.517
I write it right above
the zero right over there.

00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:31.257
And then five times 25, five times five,

00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:32.177
we already know what it is,

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.217
but I'll just figure it out.

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:36.838
Five times five is 25, regroup the two,

00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:39.798
five times two is 10, plus two is 12.

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:44.310
And now we can, now we can subtract.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.830
And you might know
offhand, well (mumbles),

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.910
130 minus 125 is going to be five,

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.930
or if you like, you could
do a little regrouping,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.190
can make this, you could
take a 10 from there,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.590
and then put the 10 in the ones place,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.810
and this becomes 10,
10 minus five is five.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.950
Now, we aren't done yet.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.050
We wanna divide this completely,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.911
so we can bring down another zero.

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:05.550
We can bring down another zero,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.250
and I'm picking an appropriate color,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.290
to, for the next, so I'll use,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.350
well I already used the green once,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.650
we'll use yellow.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.150
So once again, I can
bring down another zero,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.170
but I have to be very careful here,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.670
I can't just, I can't just throw

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.130
a zero right over there.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.990
That's gonna turn 630 into 6300.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.990
I have to be very particular,
say no, look, look.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.650
This next zero I'm gonna put,

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.710
that's gonna be after the decimal.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.090
Now 630 is the same thing as 630.0,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.510
and if I'm gonna add a decimal there,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.530
I wanna throw the decimal right above it.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.350
Need to be very careful with that.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.250
But now we're ready to start
bringing down the zero.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.790
So let's bring down this zero.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.051
And we have 50,

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:45.850
how many times does 25 go into 50?

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.010
Let me scratch this out,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.350
so we don't confuse ourselves later.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.110
25 goes two times into 50,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.201
two times 25 is in fact 50,

00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:55.741
is in fact 50.

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:57.801
And so now we can subtract.

00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.242
And we now have a remainder of zero,

00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:03.721
and there's nothing left to
bring down other than zeros,

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:04.801
and we have a remainder of zero,

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:07.741
so we are done dividing completely.

00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:12.581
You take 630, divided by 25, it's 25.2.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.321
Or if you look at our original problem,

00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.091
if you look at our original problem,

00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:19.212
which was 6.30 divided by 0.25,

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.211
that also is 25.2.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.391
So this is also going to be 25.2.

00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:27.931
Let me rewrite it, let me rewrite it.

00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:30.931
So our original problem was 6.3

00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:34.571
divided by 0.25,

00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:36.482
which we just figured out,

00:06:36.482 --> 00:06:37.322
what we just figured out

00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:41.082
is 25.2.

00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:42.522
And we're done.
