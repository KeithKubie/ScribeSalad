00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
You know what I love?

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.980
How cats claim stuff

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.980
Mine!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.280
Mine, mine, mine!

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.540
(clawing)

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.880
Mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine!

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.180
And recently I realized just how much stuff I have claimed

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.860
You know, I rarely get rid of clothes

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.060
Because as an actor you just never know when you need

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.860
A pair of spiky pants

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.940
Or a  spiky bra

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.020
Or a spiky wig

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.940
And I'm so afraid of getting rid of props

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.560
Like this staff

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.640
Or this random backpack

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.980
Just in case someday, maybe

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400
I might need them for a video

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.860
And this has essentially turned into me kind of becoming a hoarder

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
No!

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.100
Yes, I can't get rid of anything because I know the moment that I get rid of it

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.980
I'm gonna need it the next day because that's how it always happens

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.820
And I'm so run by the fear of not having something that me trying to declutter

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.760
Looks like this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.420
But I hate it!

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.940
I've noticed that when my space isn't organized

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.800
I don't feel mentally organized

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.140
I think it's one of the reasons why like I have to make my bed before I can get my day started

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.380
The more clutter that there is in my closets

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.360
And the more junk

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.880
The less clear-headed I sometimes feel

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.420
Plus, it's like not even helpful to have all of this stuff around

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.540
It's like it makes it harder to actually sift through what you have

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.160
And because you have so much junk

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.760
You don't even remember what's in there

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.180
And because it stresses you out

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.180
You just don't even want to go near it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.300
So I bought the book the life-changing magic of tidying up

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.520
Hoping that it would help me

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.220
Regain a sense of control over...stuff

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.340
And I followed all of the practices she kind of outlines in it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.040
But my favorite takeaway was this idea that if you hold an item

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.280
And it doesn't spark joy

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.700
It's totally okay to either get rid of it, or donate it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.660
Even if the item is a gift

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.000
I've always had a really hard time parting with something

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.780
If it was originally a gift for me

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.060
But the konmari method says

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.920
That the initial joy you received when you got the gift means that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.600
It has fulfilled its purpose

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.540
So now if it doesn't spark joy, it's totally fine to get rid of it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.520
(Eric speaking off cam)

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.560
Yeah, yeah, can you leave that in the edit so that everyone else knows that you also did this with me

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.160
Also, what Eric said.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.380
The book also had some other advice that I found incredibly helpful

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.280
Such as organizing by category not by room

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.580
And decluttering everything before you attempt to organize it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.660
And she also had this method of folding clothes

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.680
And storing it vertically so that when you open your drawers

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.780
Everything's kind of laid out for you

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.200
And pleasantly aesthetic

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.400
If you are a freak for organization or just desperately need to spring clean

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.660
And don't really know where to start

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.540
I would really recommend checking out her book and trying out all of the things

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.120
And seeing what resonates with you and what doesn't

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.960
I am currently working on paring down even more

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.240
Because I just have so much junk and I hate I just hate throwing things away

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.740
So I'm working on selling a bunch of old wardrobe and costumes and props

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.640
So that I can use the proceeds to fund my favorite organization

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.360
Sante D'or Foundation, which I've talked about numerous times before

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.080
So that I'm not just, you know, going down to Goodwill

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.560
Time after time with heaps of junk

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.320
Which is why I'm stoked to say that today's episode is sponsored by Mercari

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.780
Mercari is a free app think of it like a digital garage sale

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.140
You can purchase items or sell items directly from your phone

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.940
So it's the perfect way to declutter and make a little extra cash for the holiday season

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.520
Selling is super easy

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.260
You just take a photo of something

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.200
You put in a little description and you list it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.040
When it's sold you get a shipping label

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.160
And you just drop it off at the post office

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.520
