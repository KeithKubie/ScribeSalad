00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:09.162
So, I think all good
tornado talks need to start

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:11.182
with an awesome tornado shot.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.332
And this is not that awesome tornado shot.

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.781
That was the first tornado I ever saw,
it was really cool, really scary,

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:18.243
and I'm showing it to you guys

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:21.061
because that's why I got
into the field in the first place.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:22.884
So even though it's a bad photograph,

00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:25.260
it was really cool
to be out there the first time.

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:27.473
But now I'm taking real tornado footage.

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:28.901
Fast forward a few years.

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.166
This is a few years ago,
during a field project called VORTEX2,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.068
where myself and a bunch
of other scientists were out there,

00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:37.965
surrounding tornadoes
with different types of instrumentation

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.145
and trying to figure out
how tornadoes form.

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:42.179
It's a big question
we're trying to answer.

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:43.729
It sounds like a very basic one,

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.199
but it's something
we're still trying to figure out.

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:49.960
We're also still trying to figure out
what the winds are like near the surface.

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:52.468
We know what the winds are like
above building level,

00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:55.199
but we really don't know
what they're like at the surface

00:00:55.223 --> 00:00:58.195
and how that relates
to what we're seeing above building level.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.133
Most tornadoes form from what we call
supercell thunderstorms.

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:04.002
Supercell thunderstorms
are what you commonly think of

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.504
as tornado-raising storms.

00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:07.400
They're big, rotating thunderstorms

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:10.685
that happen a lot of times
in the midsection of the United States.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.245
But the problem is that even though
they're rotating up above,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.563
it doesn't mean they're rotating
at the surface.

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:18.166
And when we look at these storms

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.375
and at these pictures
and at the data we have,

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.993
they all kind of look the same.

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:23.328
And it's really problematic

00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:25.950
if we're trying to make
tornado forecasts or warnings,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:28.861
because we only want to warn
or forecast about the storms

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:30.905
that are going to actually make a tornado.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.092
One of the big, critical distinguishing
features, we think, between these storms,

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.753
is something about
the rear-flank downdraft.

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:40.630
So these big rotating thunderstorms
have this downdraft

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:42.566
that wraps around the rear edge of it,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.298
hence the "rear-flank" downdraft.

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:47.827
But we think how warm that is,
how buoyant that air is,

00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.976
and then also how strong
the updraft it's wrapping into,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.389
makes a big difference on whether or not
it's going to make a tornado.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.300
There's a lot more that goes into it --

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.167
I'll tell you about that in a second.

00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:01.351
Once you actually get a tornado,
again, the problem that we have

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.572
is getting measurements near the surface.

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:06.231
It's really hard to get measurements
near the surface --

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.530
most people don't want
to drive into tornadoes.

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:11.609
There are a few exceptions;
you might have seen them on TV shows.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:13.455
But most people don't want to do that.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.166
Even getting instrumentation in the path
of the tornado is pretty tricky, too.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.016
Because, again, you don't want
to be that close to a tornado

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.281
because sometimes the winds
around the tornado are strong as well.

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.774
So getting information,
that critical location,

00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:27.914
is key for us because,
again, we don't know

00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:30.290
if the winds that we're seeing
above ground level,

00:02:30.314 --> 00:02:31.505
way above building level,

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.934
actually map to the surface,

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.576
if they're stronger, weaker,
or about the same

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.536
as what we're seeing above buildings.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.152
The way we get at answering
a lot of these questions --

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:43.020
and I'm an observationalist;
I love to get out in the field,

00:02:43.044 --> 00:02:44.575
and collect data on tornadoes --

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.177
we compile a lot of observations.

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:48.587
I work with this group
who operates mobile radars,

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:51.190
and they're exactly
what they say -- basically, a radar

00:02:51.214 --> 00:02:52.751
on the back of a big blue truck,

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:55.899
and we drive up really close
to tornadoes to map out the winds.

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:57.367
We map out the precipitation.

00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:00.045
We map out all these
different things that are going on

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.105
in order to better understand
the processes in these storms.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.735
And that bottom there,
that's what a tornado looks like

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.726
when you're looking at it
with a mobile radar, and really close.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.580
Also, what we do is a lot of modeling,

00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:14.214
so we do a lot of computer
models and simulations,

00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:16.976
because the atmosphere
is governed by the laws of physics.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.689
So we can model the laws of physics

00:03:18.713 --> 00:03:20.789
and see where the tornado might go,

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:22.379
where the storm might go,

00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:24.362
how strong the winds are near the surface

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:26.496
and not actually have
to go out in the field.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.388
But of course, we want to have
both observations and modeling

00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:31.095
to move forward with the science.

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.911
So, I showed you that video earlier
that went real quick, too.

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:37.507
This is what it looks like,
looking at it with a radar.

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.723
So you saw it visually,

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:42.163
but this is what I get really excited
about when I see now in the field,

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:43.533
stuff that looks like this.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.307
The really exciting thing
about looking at stuff like this

00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.290
is that we caught this storm
from when it didn't make a tornado

00:03:49.314 --> 00:03:51.274
to when it made a tornado and intensified

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.455
and when it dissipated.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.323
This is the one of the rare data sets
that we have out there

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:58.584
that were able to study
the entire life cycle of a tornado.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:02.084
I talked about how we think
that rear-flank downdraft is important

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:05.473
because it tilts, there's a lot
of spin in the atmosphere,

00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:07.947
but the problem with
all this spin in the atmosphere

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:09.795
is it needs to be oriented vertically,

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.732
because that's what tornadoes are doing,

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:14.285
and it needs to orientated
vertically near the ground.

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:17.110
So we think this rear-flank
downdraft just pulses.

00:04:17.134 --> 00:04:19.777
And these pulses in this
rear-flank downdraft, we think,

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.127
are very important
for converging that rotation,

00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.244
but also getting that rotation
into the right place.

00:04:25.268 --> 00:04:26.522
Other things we've learned

00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:29.220
is that we have gotten
a bunch of fortuitous measurements

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:31.834
in the path of the tornadoes
and very near the surface.

00:04:31.858 --> 00:04:33.011
And we found out

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:36.018
that the winds near the surface
are actually pretty comparable

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.696
to what we're seeing 30, 40 meters
above ground level.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.982
So there's not a big reduction
in what we're seeing above the surface

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.973
to what we're seeing at house level.

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:46.238
And that was a pretty
surprising finding for us,

00:04:46.262 --> 00:04:49.103
because we kind of assumed
that the winds decrease

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:51.019
pretty substantially near the surface.

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:52.868
I'm going to end with this real quick.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.118
And this is not my last
tornado I ever saw,

00:04:55.142 --> 00:04:56.893
but I really like this image,

00:04:56.917 --> 00:05:00.457
because this was taken with one of those
mobile radars I was talking about.

00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:02.174
This is a tornado, not a hurricane,

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:05.106
and this is what it looks like
when you're really close to it.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.283
And I find this amazing,

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:09.696
that we can actually take technology
this close to these types of storms

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.257
and see these inner workings.

00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:14.207
And for those of you who look
at tornado images often,

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:17.104
you can see there's a lot going on --
there's rain spiraling,

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:20.469
and you can actually see the debris cloud
associated with this tornado.

00:05:20.493 --> 00:05:22.931
I look forward to the future
and future technologies

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.508
and being able to learn
a lot more about these storms,

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:26.696
as the world advances,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.562
as you guys contribute to the science

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:31.690
and we're able to really learn
more about how tornadoes form.

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:32.870
Thank you.

00:05:32.894 --> 00:05:34.894
(Applause)
