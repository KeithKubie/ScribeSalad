00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.320
This is crazy.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.340
This is ridiculous.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.320
It's getting me up for my mid-afternoon drowsiness.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.440
For some reason I thought it was going to
be like really easy.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.880
I guess there’s no reason it needs to be
in.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.320
Can we do it?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.320
It fits, I think.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.020
No it's not this one!

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.160
Oh, oh, oh.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
We're good, we're good.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.660
Yeah, we're just doing the stairs, this is
not good.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.620
But is it going to fit in the stairs?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.680
We're going to see, I don't know.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.800
It was a great attempt

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.900
Plan B.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.560
Sorry.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.920
It's okay.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.060
It's the same process.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.680
Lift high.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you want me to go under?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Yeah, but hold on you have to rest it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.720
Okay.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.580
Got it?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Yeah.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.420
You want to put it… there.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.360
What do you guys think of this idea of kind
of starting over here on the left with the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.800
book-like situation in the vitrine and then
this idea that the pages are kind of floating

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
out and around

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.080
What's happening there?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
Those are the four pieces that are gonna be
on that wall?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.980
Mm-hmm.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.600
For the, I mean, that's what we were thinking.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600
Yeah.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.960
What do they call that?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.980
The microbe?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.580
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.400
Oh, I think it's great.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.640
I think it's gonna look beautiful.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.920
I just...I mean, I would...I like this better
than just not having any prints on top.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.480
Like if it were to be isolated but having
the prints on top and having that, the whole

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.740
thing works together.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.620
So we're on the second floor, a former print
galleries.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.620
The show is called, "Max Ernst: Beyond Painting."

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.220
It's all works from MoMA's collection but
across all the departments and mediums.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:04.700
So, "Beyond Painting," is a phrase of Ernst's referring
to the way that he worked.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.840
One of the reasons we have such amazing holdings
of Max Ernst's work is because we began to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.520
collect him very early on.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.480
The earliest works in this show were acquired
for the museum in 1935, and we've sort of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.560
kept going ever since then.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.160
And that is why we're able to tell this story
of this incredibly inventive artist in such

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.480
a synoptic way, just by going to our storage
vaults.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.360
I don't have those even.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.440
Yeah, move that that way.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.960
Yeah, a little bit to that way...to the left.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.640
The center one?

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.100
Yeah, center one to the left.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.960
I don't know if they'll have that much space
in the mat but... We're testing everything so

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.840
we'll know how to lay out the walls.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.540
You know, in some museums, you put a show,
the walls were already there and so you just

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.240
work with what you've got and you make it
look as good as you can.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.060
But at MoMA, every time there's a new exhibition,
we invent new walls for the most part for

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.160
the special exhibitions.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.960
So in a way, it's great because you think
that you've got any idea that you wanna do,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.760
you can use.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.340
But when you have limitless possibilities,
that's a problem too.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.380
You know, sometimes limitations are good and
they help you, but right now, I'm happy that

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.000
we have the chance to make them exactly the
way we want to.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.280
Does it look like plaster?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.620
It's plaster but Anna just did some reflective
FTIR analysis and it's actually, most probably

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.920
oil paint.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.820
FDIR?

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.860
FTIR.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.600
That's that machine over there.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.400
The Fourier…

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.740
Yeah.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.380
So I think it might be better to say oil and
plaster on...

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.380
On canvas.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.500
And it's actually, I mean, it's canvas but
it's burlap.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.320
I would say burlap, maybe it's more specific.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.720
Ellen, was I correct

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.040
in that you were saying that now that you've taken
the varnish off of "Birds Above the Forest,"

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.620
that there's a real similarity between the
pigments?

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.760
I'm just...at least, visually because we haven't
done analysis on this one, but just visually,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.680
this black just feels much more similar, like
they're both very matte velvety black.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.560
And they're very close together, so, you know,
it could be a material that he's just had.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.060
Just had...has round?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.020
So if we get more information about what the
actual pigment is here, it might be interesting

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.920
to compare.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.540
Compare the two.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
Yeah.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.540
And had you gotten to see "Birds Above the
Forest" without its varnish on?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.340
No.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.340
There's still a little remnant just for a
reminder but this is how glossy the varnish was.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.020
Wow. Oh my God.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.800
So it's a pretty dramatic change.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.720
To me, it feels like that one should be a
little higher.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.800
The king?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.600
The big one.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.320
Really?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320
No?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.640
Huh, okay.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.840
I was thinking it looked pretty good.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.160
Okay, but let's see it higher.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.840
Very...

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.400
Imposing.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.280
Imposing, yeah.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.640
Looks much more...

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.120
Like he's looking down on everybody now.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480
Kind of annoyed.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.000
Which is kind of good, it's more imperious.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.500
Very.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.120
Yeah.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.880
I think maybe that's good.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.020
Got to look at him from far away.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.400
Yeah I think I'm good with that.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.880
This one to me feels the least likely.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.120
I think it's too light but...okay.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.560
This is the only one that's kind of a true
grey.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.280
Can we...let's just hold it up a little bit.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.980
Wow, it's nice.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.820
It's nice.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.560
They change, when, you know.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.680
When they are on the wall.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.020
Don't forget you're looking at these against
a white background which also affects the

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.100
way you will get the color.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.400
The way we perceive it.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.920
Yeah.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.840
Can we see the lighter ones though, just because
they seem to get darker the moment we put

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.800
them on the wall?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.000
Yeah.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.720
Which one of these...

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.240
Hold it up for a second.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.200
Well, that's like a slight, warmer version
of that one a little bit.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.820
This thing is...

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.920
That one's more blue, isn't it?

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.360
Yeah.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.200
Do you want more hashtags?

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.880
You can hashtag Max Ernst.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.080
Okay.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.440
Beyond painting.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.080
I never like too many hashtags. I think they're
annoying.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.680
So basically, we'll just put some tape on
the back

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.920
and then we usually put more on the top just to make sure.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.600
I think so, right?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.080
Yeah, that's the top.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.440
Okay, let's have a look.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.200
And we just have to fix the...like where the
M and the E meet, the contour so it feels

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.560
straight.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.360
I mean, I guess, we might as well just go
here if we can.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.560
Yeah.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.920
I mean, yeah, wouldn’t we just want more
space

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.880
Yeah.,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.520
It's not even that much of a difference
in the end but the more, the merrier.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.640
Because this wall's not moving anymore, right?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.400
I don't think so, yeah.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.880
I think they're just asking about the script.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.960
Okay.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.720
That's it.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.720
So we'll just wait and then see what they
say.
