00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130
warnings it's not always perfect I want
 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.110
warnings it's not always perfect I want
to lower expectations a little bit

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
to lower expectations a little bit
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.479
to lower expectations a little bit
here's another example here we have a

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489
here's another example here we have a
 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.870
here's another example here we have a
data class in Java there's a one-line

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880
data class in Java there's a one-line
 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.250
data class in Java there's a one-line
version of this you could write in Colin

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
version of this you could write in Colin
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.830
version of this you could write in Colin
but if you run into the convertor

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840
but if you run into the convertor
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.229
but if you run into the convertor
you end up with code that is completely

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239
you end up with code that is completely
 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.050
you end up with code that is completely
accurate but not the most optimal so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
accurate but not the most optimal so
 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.940
accurate but not the most optimal so
this does the same as before in :

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950
this does the same as before in :
 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.589
this does the same as before in :
so it's really a great starting point

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599
so it's really a great starting point
 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.300
so it's really a great starting point
and then typically you massage it a bit

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310
and then typically you massage it a bit
 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.879
and then typically you massage it a bit
more so here's a Kotlin file showing

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
more so here's a Kotlin file showing
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.620
more so here's a Kotlin file showing
several language features you have you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630
several language features you have you
 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.590
several language features you have you
know the four for loop with ranges you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600
know the four for loop with ranges you
 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.939
know the four for loop with ranges you
have a left statement with the lambda

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949
have a left statement with the lambda
 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.980
have a left statement with the lambda
and you have a when statement we don't

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
and you have a when statement we don't
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.180
and you have a when statement we don't
have time to cover the language today

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190
have time to cover the language today
 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.920
have time to cover the language today
there's going to be talks about that

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
there's going to be talks about that
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.020
there's going to be talks about that
tomorrow that you don't want to miss but

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030
tomorrow that you don't want to miss but
 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.100
tomorrow that you don't want to miss but
when you're starting out you might have

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110
when you're starting out you might have
 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.290
when you're starting out you might have
some concerns about performance here you

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
some concerns about performance here you
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.940
some concerns about performance here you
know like is this going to be expensive

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950
know like is this going to be expensive
 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.200
know like is this going to be expensive
what about this left statement is this

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210
what about this left statement is this
 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.150
what about this left statement is this
making a new inner class and an object

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160
making a new inner class and an object
 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.120
making a new inner class and an object
there's a really great way to find out

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130
there's a really great way to find out
 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.460
there's a really great way to find out
so you can invoke the show byte code

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470
so you can invoke the show byte code
 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.980
so you can invoke the show byte code
window this is going to show the byte

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
window this is going to show the byte
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.980
window this is going to show the byte
code for the current statement if you

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990
code for the current statement if you
 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.659
code for the current statement if you
read by code that's great but if you

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669
read by code that's great but if you
 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.920
read by code that's great but if you
don't there's this really great

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930
don't there's this really great
 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.710
don't there's this really great
decompile button in the top right window

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720
decompile button in the top right window
 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.200

here when I click on this I get the

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210
here when I click on this I get the
 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.909
here when I click on this I get the
equivalent Java code so now I can look

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919
equivalent Java code so now I can look
 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.040
equivalent Java code so now I can look
at this and go okay that range loop

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050
at this and go okay that range loop
 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.960
at this and go okay that range loop
turns into a really pure while loop with

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970
turns into a really pure while loop with
 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.940
turns into a really pure while loop with
index check and similarly the less

so don't prematurely optimize in your

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200
so don't prematurely optimize in your
 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.840
so don't prematurely optimize in your

is going to do right you know the most
 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.930
is going to do right you know the most
beautiful calling code you can and when

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940
beautiful calling code you can and when
 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.670
beautiful calling code you can and when
you're in doubt you can check what it's

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680
you're in doubt you can check what it's
 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.129
you're in doubt you can check what it's
doing last thing I'm going to say about

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139
doing last thing I'm going to say about
 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.180
doing last thing I'm going to say about
Kotlin is that all the Android lint

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190
Kotlin is that all the Android lint
 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.310
Kotlin is that all the Android lint
Tech's that ran on Java files there's

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320
Tech's that ran on Java files there's
 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.620
Tech's that ran on Java files there's
about 80 of those they're all running on

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630
about 80 of those they're all running on
 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.540
about 80 of those they're all running on
Kotlin as well there's no gap it's the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550
Kotlin as well there's no gap it's the
 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.380
Kotlin as well there's no gap it's the
same codebase now

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390
 
 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.430
 
alright let's talk about the layout

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440
alright let's talk about the layout
 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.780
alright let's talk about the layout
editor so we launched the new layout

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790
editor so we launched the new layout
 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.790
editor so we launched the new layout
editor last year at i/o and we continued

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800
editor last year at i/o and we continued
 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.430
editor last year at i/o and we continued
working on it obviously so one of the

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440
working on it obviously so one of the
 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.480
working on it obviously so one of the
things we have in the new version is

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490
things we have in the new version is
 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.860
things we have in the new version is
better handling of error since you can

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870
better handling of error since you can
 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.200
better handling of error since you can
see here and constraint layout we've

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210
see here and constraint layout we've
 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.930
see here and constraint layout we've
enhanced that a lot so first of all we

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940
enhanced that a lot so first of all we
 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.270
enhanced that a lot so first of all we
recently added chains so a chain is a

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
recently added chains so a chain is a
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.120
recently added chains so a chain is a
way to distribute widgets along an axis

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130
way to distribute widgets along an axis
 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.920
way to distribute widgets along an axis
so you can select these three widgets

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930
so you can select these three widgets
 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.840
so you can select these three widgets
say that I want to create for example a

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850
say that I want to create for example a
 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.120
say that I want to create for example a
horizontal chain I don't know if you can

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
horizontal chain I don't know if you can
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.350
horizontal chain I don't know if you can
see but there's kind of a beautiful

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360
see but there's kind of a beautiful
 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.330
see but there's kind of a beautiful
chain graphic here and I can align this

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340
chain graphic here and I can align this
 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.590
chain graphic here and I can align this
horizontally and now there's this chain

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600
horizontally and now there's this chain
 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.690
horizontally and now there's this chain
cycle button so I can basically click on

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700
cycle button so I can basically click on
 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.310
cycle button so I can basically click on
this to explore how the chains are

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320
this to explore how the chains are
 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.340
this to explore how the chains are
behaving another another feature we're

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350
behaving another another feature we're
 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.840
behaving another another feature we're
about the launch is constraint layout

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850
about the launch is constraint layout
 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.580
about the launch is constraint layout
1.1 and in 1.1 we have barriers and the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590
1.1 and in 1.1 we have barriers and the
 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.350
1.1 and in 1.1 we have barriers and the
easiest way to explain this is just to

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
easiest way to explain this is just to
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.720
easiest way to explain this is just to
show it I think and so if I were to move

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730
show it I think and so if I were to move
 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.520
show it I think and so if I were to move
this widget you can see that this line

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530
this widget you can see that this line
 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.640
this widget you can see that this line
next to it basically we make sure that

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650
next to it basically we make sure that
 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.380
next to it basically we make sure that
we don't ever overlap with it so this is

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390
we don't ever overlap with it so this is
 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.540
we don't ever overlap with it so this is
a pretty good way to make layouts that

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550
a pretty good way to make layouts that
 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.030
a pretty good way to make layouts that
respond correctly and that's actually

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040
respond correctly and that's actually
 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.200
respond correctly and that's actually
all I'm going to say about constraint

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210
all I'm going to say about constraint
 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.340
all I'm going to say about constraint
layout because there's a whole talk

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350
layout because there's a whole talk
 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.110
layout because there's a whole talk
about it in a couple of a couple of

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120
about it in a couple of a couple of
 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.340
about it in a couple of a couple of
hours that you don't want to miss

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350
hours that you don't want to miss
 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.010
hours that you don't want to miss
another feature was added in the layout

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020
another feature was added in the layout
 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.790
another feature was added in the layout
editor is support for sample data so in

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800
editor is support for sample data so in
 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800
editor is support for sample data so in
your apps you might have a ListView

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810
your apps you might have a ListView
 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.230
your apps you might have a ListView
recycler view it's pretty common and it

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240
recycler view it's pretty common and it
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.730
recycler view it's pretty common and it
looks nothing like the layout editor

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740
looks nothing like the layout editor
 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.140
looks nothing like the layout editor
when you run because you're putting data

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150
when you run because you're putting data
 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.660
when you run because you're putting data
into it images and of course

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670
into it images and of course
 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.630
into it images and of course
applications mystic data so a couple of

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640
applications mystic data so a couple of
 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.280
applications mystic data so a couple of
years ago we added some support to deal

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290
years ago we added some support to deal
 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.690
years ago we added some support to deal
with this with design-time attributes

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700
with this with design-time attributes
 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.580
with this with design-time attributes
the tools attributes right so you could

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590
the tools attributes right so you could
 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.650
the tools attributes right so you could
put some string in and you can start

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660
put some string in and you can start
 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.210
put some string in and you can start
approximating what your apps going to do

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220
approximating what your apps going to do
 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.970
approximating what your apps going to do
but that's terrible and it lists you so

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:17.980
but that's terrible and it lists you so
 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.570
but that's terrible and it lists you so
we've continued enhancing this so now we

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580
we've continued enhancing this so now we
 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.380
we've continued enhancing this so now we
have this new sample resource type so

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390
have this new sample resource type so
 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.000
have this new sample resource type so
for example I can pull it I can pull in

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010
for example I can pull it I can pull in
 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.880
for example I can pull it I can pull in
some lorem ipsum text or I can pull in

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890
some lorem ipsum text or I can pull in
 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.970
some lorem ipsum text or I can pull in
let's say a date of the week but the

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980
let's say a date of the week but the
 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.470
let's say a date of the week but the
real power of this is when you actually

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480
real power of this is when you actually
 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.080
real power of this is when you actually
define your own data so here is this new

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090
define your own data so here is this new
 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.140
define your own data so here is this new
JSON file that I've created in my

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150
JSON file that I've created in my
 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.450
JSON file that I've created in my
project this is for a fitness app so

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:45.460
project this is for a fitness app so
 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.130
project this is for a fitness app so
there's various activities that you know

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.140
there's various activities that you know
 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.110
there's various activities that you know
this app is modeling biking

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120
this app is modeling biking
 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.340
this app is modeling biking
walking and so forth and there's some

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350
walking and so forth and there's some
 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.409
walking and so forth and there's some
other data associated like distances and

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:52.419
other data associated like distances and
 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:54.600
other data associated like distances and
we even have some icons what I can do

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610
we even have some icons what I can do
 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.719
we even have some icons what I can do
now is go into my item layout that I'm

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:57.729
now is go into my item layout that I'm
 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:59.219
now is go into my item layout that I'm
using in the list and I can start

00:07:59.219 --> 00:07:59.229
using in the list and I can start
 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.350
using in the list and I can start
binding these things so code completion

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360
binding these things so code completion
 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360
binding these things so code completion
works here for the app sample tag it's

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370
works here for the app sample tag it's
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.770
works here for the app sample tag it's
picking out all the attributes from the

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:04.780
picking out all the attributes from the
 

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.510
picking out all the attributes from the
JSON file and I can for example hook up

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520
JSON file and I can for example hook up
 

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.610
JSON file and I can for example hook up
the you know the icon property to this I

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:08.620
the you know the icon property to this I
 

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.650
the you know the icon property to this I
can hook up the description property to

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:10.660
can hook up the description property to
 

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.540
can hook up the description property to
this next textview and so when I come

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:12.550
this next textview and so when I come
 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.760
this next textview and so when I come
back to this you can see I get a layout

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:14.770
back to this you can see I get a layout
 

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.020
back to this you can see I get a layout
that looks much more like the rail out

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.030
 
 

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.879
 
alright the last layout and repeats are

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:23.889
alright the last layout and repeats are
 

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:27.650
alright the last layout and repeats are
going to show is support for a

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660
going to show is support for a
 

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.529
going to show is support for a
downloadable fonts so in oh you can

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:31.539
downloadable fonts so in oh you can
 

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:33.570
downloadable fonts so in oh you can
declare downloadable fonts there's lots

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.580
declare downloadable fonts there's lots
 

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.070
declare downloadable fonts there's lots
of advantages we'll talk about that as

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080
of advantages we'll talk about that as
 

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.469
of advantages we'll talk about that as
well of course but the way this works is

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479
well of course but the way this works is
 

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:39.930
well of course but the way this works is
that I select a text view and in the

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:39.940
that I select a text view and in the
 

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.600
that I select a text view and in the
layout editor in the font family chooser

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.610
layout editor in the font family chooser
 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.190
layout editor in the font family chooser
there's some more fonts item on the

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200
there's some more fonts item on the
 

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.410
there's some more fonts item on the
bottom when I invoke that I can browse

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:46.420
bottom when I invoke that I can browse
 

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.100
bottom when I invoke that I can browse
the available online fonts or search I'm

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.110
the available online fonts or search I'm
 

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.820
the available online fonts or search I'm
going to pick my favorite finger paint

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:52.830
going to pick my favorite finger paint
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.710
going to pick my favorite finger paint
and you can see I now get this new font

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720
and you can see I now get this new font
 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.890
and you can see I now get this new font
resource in my project and you know it

00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:58.900
resource in my project and you know it
 

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.510
resource in my project and you know it
actually works the way you'd expect

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:02.520
actually works the way you'd expect
 

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.949
actually works the way you'd expect
alright another feature we've added is

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959
alright another feature we've added is
 

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.460
alright another feature we've added is
support for adaptive icons so in the

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.470
support for adaptive icons so in the
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.190
support for adaptive icons so in the
image asset wizard we now help you

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200
image asset wizard we now help you
 

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.740
image asset wizard we now help you
create these so we help you with the

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:13.750
create these so we help you with the
 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.010
create these so we help you with the
foreground layer you can modify the

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.020
foreground layer you can modify the
 

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.340
foreground layer you can modify the
background layer I don't if you can tell

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:20.350
background layer I don't if you can tell
 

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.440
background layer I don't if you can tell
from the screen but there's also options

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.450
from the screen but there's also options
 

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.480
from the screen but there's also options
to show safe zones grid and so forth so

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:24.490
to show safe zones grid and so forth so
 

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.860
to show safe zones grid and so forth so
this hopefully helps you put all the

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:25.870
this hopefully helps you put all the
 

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.550
this hopefully helps you put all the
right bits in the right places another

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560
right bits in the right places another
 

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.530
right bits in the right places another
small feature that's easy to miss is the

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.540
small feature that's easy to miss is the
 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.730
small feature that's easy to miss is the
bottom right corner here there's the

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:32.740
bottom right corner here there's the
 

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.690
bottom right corner here there's the
device Explorer now finally so here you

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:36.700
device Explorer now finally so here you
 

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.310
device Explorer now finally so here you
can go in and actually explore files on

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320
can go in and actually explore files on
 

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.199
can go in and actually explore files on
your filesystem you know you can click

00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:40.209
your filesystem you know you can click
 

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:42.750
your filesystem you know you can click
on files to see them locally and you can

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760
on files to see them locally and you can
 

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.130
on files to see them locally and you can
right click on folders to upload and

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.140
right click on folders to upload and
 

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.460
right click on folders to upload and
download files and that kind of thing

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.470
download files and that kind of thing
 

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.060
download files and that kind of thing
alright let's talk about thank you

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.070
 
 

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.820
 
let's talk about instant apps so we have

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:54.830
let's talk about instant apps so we have
 

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.110
let's talk about instant apps so we have
a lot of support for Internet's we have

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120
a lot of support for Internet's we have
 

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.670
a lot of support for Internet's we have
a bunch of new literals we have support

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680
a bunch of new literals we have support
 

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.080
a bunch of new literals we have support
in the Gradle build system which I think

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.090
in the Gradle build system which I think
 

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.420
in the Gradle build system which I think
is I will talk about we have new Wizards

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:01.430
is I will talk about we have new Wizards
 

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.300
is I will talk about we have new Wizards
for creating feature modules but the

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.310
for creating feature modules but the
 

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.490
for creating feature modules but the
hardest part of creating a instant app

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
hardest part of creating a instant app
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.020
hardest part of creating a instant app
is probably going to be to break up your

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.030
is probably going to be to break up your
 

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.210
is probably going to be to break up your
monolithic app so we're working on some

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:10.220
monolithic app so we're working on some
 

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.400
monolithic app so we're working on some
refactoring tools to help with that so

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.410
refactoring tools to help with that so
 

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.810
refactoring tools to help with that so
I'm going to take this simple example

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:13.820
I'm going to take this simple example
 

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.780
I'm going to take this simple example
first so here I have a class I'm going

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:16.790
first so here I have a class I'm going
 

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.560
first so here I have a class I'm going
to extract it

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:17.570
to extract it
 

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.030
to extract it
so I invoke the marginalize your

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
so I invoke the marginalize your
 

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.060
so I invoke the marginalize your
factoring and you can see that it offers

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.070
factoring and you can see that it offers
 

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.280
factoring and you can see that it offers
to pull four classes out into this new

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.290
to pull four classes out into this new
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.990
to pull four classes out into this new
module and that's because this class

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000
module and that's because this class
 

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.070
module and that's because this class
depends on three other classes

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.080
depends on three other classes
 

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.650
depends on three other classes
recursively and it'll also pull along

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:29.660
recursively and it'll also pull along
 

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.630
recursively and it'll also pull along
with it resources and manifest entries

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640
with it resources and manifest entries
 

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.910
with it resources and manifest entries
this is the ideal case that I bet you

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920
this is the ideal case that I bet you
 

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.140
this is the ideal case that I bet you
will not actually encounter with your

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.150
will not actually encounter with your
 

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.360
will not actually encounter with your
own app here's the more realistic

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.370
own app here's the more realistic
 

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.040
own app here's the more realistic
example so I'm going to try to pull this

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.050
example so I'm going to try to pull this
 

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.120
example so I'm going to try to pull this
activity into its own module and here

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.130
activity into its own module and here
 

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.340
activity into its own module and here
you can see it's pulling a lot and we

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:45.350
you can see it's pulling a lot and we
 

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.200
you can see it's pulling a lot and we
have some spaghetti because my class

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.210
have some spaghetti because my class
 

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.170
have some spaghetti because my class
depends on this class which then you

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.180
depends on this class which then you
 

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.240
depends on this class which then you
know utils class which is then pointing

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.250
know utils class which is then pointing
 

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.620
know utils class which is then pointing
it to some other stuff this is real

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.630
it to some other stuff this is real
 

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.060
it to some other stuff this is real
spaghetti and so what you have to do now

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:55.070
spaghetti and so what you have to do now
 

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.160
spaghetti and so what you have to do now
is start deciding where to cut the

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.170
is start deciding where to cut the
 

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.650
is start deciding where to cut the
spaghetti right and so you invoke this

00:10:59.650 --> 00:10:59.660
spaghetti right and so you invoke this
 

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.240
spaghetti right and so you invoke this
it creates in your code and then you

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.250
it creates in your code and then you
 

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.350
it creates in your code and then you
would have to actually fix the code

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360
would have to actually fix the code
 

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.630
would have to actually fix the code
afterwards so this we have an initial

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640
afterwards so this we have an initial
 

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.070
afterwards so this we have an initial
version of this in Canary one but this

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.080
version of this in Canary one but this
 

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.450
version of this in Canary one but this
is a feature we're very much still

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:07.460
is a feature we're very much still
 

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.650
is a feature we're very much still
working on we've also improved the apk

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:11.660
working on we've also improved the apk
 

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.490
working on we've also improved the apk
analyzer so what I can do here is load

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:18.500
analyzer so what I can do here is load
 

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.930
analyzer so what I can do here is load
in a apk that is a release binary right

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:22.940
in a apk that is a release binary right
 

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.670
in a apk that is a release binary right
so last year we launched this and we had

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680
so last year we launched this and we had
 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.990
so last year we launched this and we had
a lot of support for resources this year

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000
a lot of support for resources this year
 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.760
a lot of support for resources this year
we've added a bunch of support for for

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.770
we've added a bunch of support for for
 

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.580
we've added a bunch of support for for
code and Dex so first of all I can drill

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:30.590
code and Dex so first of all I can drill
 

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:36.340
code and Dex so first of all I can drill
into the deck system here let's see so I

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:36.350
into the deck system here let's see so I
 

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.890
into the deck system here let's see so I
can right-click on a class and we

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:38.900
can right-click on a class and we
 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.710
can right-click on a class and we
disassemble the byte code for you you

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720
disassemble the byte code for you you
 

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.240
disassemble the byte code for you you
can also notice that the package name

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.250
can also notice that the package name
 

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.790
can also notice that the package name
here is a EI and I promise we didn't

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800
here is a EI and I promise we didn't
 

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.530
here is a EI and I promise we didn't
write the code that way that's because

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:47.540
write the code that way that's because
 

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.500
write the code that way that's because
this is a pro guarded APK right so pro

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:50.510
this is a pro guarded APK right so pro
 

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.910
this is a pro guarded APK right so pro
guard has gone and shrunk all the

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920
guard has gone and shrunk all the
 

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.740
guard has gone and shrunk all the
symbols down to something very short but

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:53.750
symbols down to something very short but
 

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.390
symbols down to something very short but
now we have this button for loading the

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:55.400
now we have this button for loading the
 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.360
now we have this button for loading the
ProGuard mapping file so when i do that

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:58.370
ProGuard mapping file so when i do that
 

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.530

I'm going to find my program mapping

00:11:59.530 --> 00:11:59.540
I'm going to find my program mapping
 

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.910
I'm going to find my program mapping
file when I do that you can see that we

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920
file when I do that you can see that we
 

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.040
file when I do that you can see that we
now show the original symbol names

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.050
now show the original symbol names
 

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.300
now show the original symbol names
instead as you're drilling around on the

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.310
instead as you're drilling around on the

debug and release binary by the way we

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.230
debug and release binary by the way we
 

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.329
debug and release binary by the way we
have this compare button up here on the

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:22.339
have this compare button up here on the
 

00:12:22.339 --> 00:12:24.370

right and I noticed that hey I need to

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.380
right and I noticed that hey I need to
 

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.019
right and I noticed that hey I need to
actually keep this class for the release

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.029
actually keep this class for the release
 

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:28.360
actually keep this class for the release
or conversely I might be surprised that

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.370
or conversely I might be surprised that
 

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.760
or conversely I might be surprised that
this class is in the release binary and

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:30.770
this class is in the release binary and
 

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.079
this class is in the release binary and
so I can right click and say show me the

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:32.089
so I can right click and say show me the
 

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:34.570
so I can right click and say show me the
usages in the ProGuard code to help me

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:34.580
usages in the ProGuard code to help me
 

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.410
usages in the ProGuard code to help me
identify what it is I need to get rid of

we have another feature for apks and

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:39.860
we have another feature for apks and
 

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.800
we have another feature for apks and
that is apk debugging so the way this

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:41.810
that is apk debugging so the way this
 

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.480
that is apk debugging so the way this
works is that either from the welcome

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:43.490
works is that either from the welcome
 

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.280
works is that either from the welcome
screen or from the file menu here you

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.290
screen or from the file menu here you
 

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:51.060
screen or from the file menu here you
can point to a random apk let's see I

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.070
can point to a random apk let's see I
 

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.990
can point to a random apk let's see I

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.760
 
think I'm having Network issues well

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:01.770
think I'm having Network issues well
 

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.350
think I'm having Network issues well
that's very sad all right

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360
that's very sad all right
 

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.520
that's very sad all right
I'm just going to talk through it so

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:04.530
I'm just going to talk through it so
 

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.710
I'm just going to talk through it so
basically if you're not using studio if

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720
basically if you're not using studio if
 

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.350
basically if you're not using studio if
you're a game developer we give you a

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360
you're a game developer we give you a
 

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.690
you're a game developer we give you a
way to just point to an apk and we make

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700
way to just point to an apk and we make
 

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.850
way to just point to an apk and we make
a shell project for you based on the apk

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860
a shell project for you based on the apk
 

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.260
a shell project for you based on the apk
analyzer where we show you the sources

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.270
analyzer where we show you the sources
 

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.840
analyzer where we show you the sources
inside the apk on the left and then we

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:17.850
inside the apk on the left and then we
 

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.640
inside the apk on the left and then we
let you map sources the Java source code

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:19.650
let you map sources the Java source code
 

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.100
let you map sources the Java source code
as well as the shared libraries we we

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.110
as well as the shared libraries we we
 

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.040
as well as the shared libraries we we
let you drop in a Esso with debuggable

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.050
let you drop in a Esso with debuggable
 

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.720
let you drop in a Esso with debuggable
symbols to stand in place for the

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
symbols to stand in place for the
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.210
symbols to stand in place for the
optimized one so I'm really sad that

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220
optimized one so I'm really sad that
 

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.270
optimized one so I'm really sad that
didn't work all right

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:31.280
didn't work all right
 

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.280
didn't work all right
next I should talk about the profiler

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.290
next I should talk about the profiler
 

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.140
next I should talk about the profiler
this is a really really big feature for

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.150
this is a really really big feature for
 

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.300
this is a really really big feature for
us with lots of people working on it and

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:38.310
us with lots of people working on it and
 

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.300
us with lots of people working on it and
here's how it works so I've already

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.310
here's how it works so I've already
 

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.250
here's how it works so I've already
started running my app it's an image app

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260
started running my app it's an image app
 

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.750
started running my app it's an image app
in fact you probably saw this in the

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760
in fact you probably saw this in the
 

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.610
in fact you probably saw this in the
keynote I started running it and so the

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620
keynote I started running it and so the
 

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.470
keynote I started running it and so the
way the profiler works is I can now open

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480
way the profiler works is I can now open
 

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.890
way the profiler works is I can now open
up the profiler tab and it will attach

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:51.900
up the profiler tab and it will attach
 

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:58.130
up the profiler tab and it will attach
to the process all right no connected

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:58.140
to the process all right no connected
 

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.540
to the process all right no connected
devices

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:01.550
 
 

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:09.580
 
I'm going to run it again

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:09.590
 
 

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.130
 
it's very unhappy I'm going to kill the

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.140
it's very unhappy I'm going to kill the
 

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:22.720
it's very unhappy I'm going to kill the
emulator and start over

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.730
 
 

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.490
 
this is really exciting television isn't

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:24.500
this is really exciting television isn't
 

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:32.500
this is really exciting television isn't
it all right should work on making that

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:32.510
it all right should work on making that
 

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:41.710
it all right should work on making that
system image boot faster all right so

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720
system image boot faster all right so
 

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.460
system image boot faster all right so
here we have it

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:42.470
here we have it
 

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:47.579
here we have it
and no connected devices Wow

00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:47.589
 
 

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:51.850
 
you know what I say we there we go

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:51.860
you know what I say we there we go
 

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:59.050
you know what I say we there we go
here we go whoo all right okay so the

00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.060
here we go whoo all right okay so the
 

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.460
here we go whoo all right okay so the
aliens works is that it's attached to

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:00.470
aliens works is that it's attached to
 

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.889
aliens works is that it's attached to
this process and it's join will show me

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:02.899
this process and it's join will show me
 

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:04.810
this process and it's join will show me
what's happening with the CPU memory and

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:04.820
what's happening with the CPU memory and
 

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.720
what's happening with the CPU memory and
network and so let's go and make some

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:07.730
network and so let's go and make some
 

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.550
network and so let's go and make some
stuff happen in the app right so I'll

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560
stuff happen in the app right so I'll
 

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.960
stuff happen in the app right so I'll
click on an image and Wow

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:13.970
click on an image and Wow
 

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:19.780
click on an image and Wow
network is very unhappy okay all right

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:19.790
network is very unhappy okay all right
 

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.300
network is very unhappy okay all right
super slow okay anyway it works because

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.310
super slow okay anyway it works because
 

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.860
super slow okay anyway it works because
we look in the background here and I

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:23.870
we look in the background here and I
 

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.970
we look in the background here and I
accidentally clicked on the memory

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:24.980
accidentally clicked on the memory
 

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.430
accidentally clicked on the memory
profiler here we have the CPU memory and

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440
profiler here we have the CPU memory and
 

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.710
profiler here we have the CPU memory and
network you see these little purple dots

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720
network you see these little purple dots
 

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.689
network you see these little purple dots
up here those are my touch events you

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:31.699
up here those are my touch events you
 

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:33.449
up here those are my touch events you
can also see the activities happening

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:33.459
can also see the activities happening
 

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:36.129
can also see the activities happening
activity things like stops and destroyed

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:36.139
activity things like stops and destroyed
 

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:38.199
activity things like stops and destroyed
it's very small but it's basically list

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:38.209
it's very small but it's basically list
 

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:40.420
it's very small but it's basically list
and activity names up here so let's

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:40.430
and activity names up here so let's
 

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.710
and activity names up here so let's
start with the network this is the time

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720
start with the network this is the time
 

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.900
start with the network this is the time
line I can scroll in so I'm going to

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:43.910
line I can scroll in so I'm going to
 

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.670
line I can scroll in so I'm going to
click down in the network area and here

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680
click down in the network area and here
 

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.680
click down in the network area and here
I can see the network traffic and radio

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:47.690
I can see the network traffic and radio
 

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.730
I can see the network traffic and radio
traffic that happened in this time

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:48.740
traffic that happened in this time
 

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.120
traffic that happened in this time
interval I can zoom in on something like

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.130
interval I can zoom in on something like
 

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.559
interval I can zoom in on something like
this and it'll show me the network calls

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:53.569
this and it'll show me the network calls
 

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:55.509
this and it'll show me the network calls
that happen during that time and I can

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519
that happen during that time and I can
 

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:56.980
that happen during that time and I can
click on a particular network request

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:56.990
click on a particular network request
 

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.170
click on a particular network request
and sort of see it and the call stack

00:15:59.170 --> 00:15:59.180
and sort of see it and the call stack
 

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.240
and sort of see it and the call stack
and the way this works is that we

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.250
and the way this works is that we
 

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.180
and the way this works is that we
instrument your app at Build time and

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:04.190
instrument your app at Build time and
 

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.040
instrument your app at Build time and
you have to opt in to this so you go to

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.050
you have to opt in to this so you go to
 

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.319
you have to opt in to this so you go to
your run config and there's a profiling

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:08.329
your run config and there's a profiling
 

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:10.449
your run config and there's a profiling
tab where you enable advanced profiling

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:10.459
tab where you enable advanced profiling
 

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:14.620
tab where you enable advanced profiling
so basically we look for uses usages of

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.630
so basically we look for uses usages of
 

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.350
so basically we look for uses usages of
HTTP URL connection and so if your app

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360
HTTP URL connection and so if your app
 

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.509
HTTP URL connection and so if your app
is using that or anything based on it

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519
is using that or anything based on it
 

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:22.780
is using that or anything based on it
like volley and we also support ok HTTP

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:22.790
like volley and we also support ok HTTP
 

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:28.930
like volley and we also support ok HTTP
now as of 3.0 canary 1

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:28.940
 
 

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.059
 
we've also added support in Android Oh

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:32.069
we've also added support in Android Oh
 

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:35.329
we've also added support in Android Oh

any kind of bill time instrumentation so

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240
any kind of bill time instrumentation so
 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.819
any kind of bill time instrumentation so
that will be enabled in an upcoming

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:40.829
that will be enabled in an upcoming
 

00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:43.670
that will be enabled in an upcoming
build of Android studio all right so

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680
build of Android studio all right so
 

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.990
build of Android studio all right so
that's the network profiler let's look

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000
that's the network profiler let's look
 

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.629
that's the network profiler let's look
at the CPU profiler all right so I'm

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639
at the CPU profiler all right so I'm
 

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.449
at the CPU profiler all right so I'm
going to again click in here and here I

00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459
going to again click in here and here I
 

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:52.970
going to again click in here and here I
can see the thread activity so I'm going

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980
can see the thread activity so I'm going
 

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.910
can see the thread activity so I'm going
to jump to be live again and then I'm

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920
to jump to be live again and then I'm
 

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.350
to jump to be live again and then I'm
going to do some stuff in the app so

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360
going to do some stuff in the app so
 

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.870
going to do some stuff in the app so
I'll click on this image actually I

00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880
I'll click on this image actually I
 

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.730
I'll click on this image actually I
forgot that what I want to do is start

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740

more information and then I'll do some
 

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:14.390
more information and then I'll do some
stuff in the app like that and now I'll

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400
stuff in the app like that and now I'll
 

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.470
stuff in the app like that and now I'll
stop recording okay so now the timeline

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480
stop recording okay so now the timeline
 

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.360
stop recording okay so now the timeline
is showing me here that during this

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.370
is showing me here that during this
 

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.039
is showing me here that during this
interval we had we have more information

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:22.049
interval we had we have more information
 

00:17:22.049 --> 00:17:25.039
interval we had we have more information
and I can stop I can click on a

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:25.049
and I can stop I can click on a
 

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:26.779
and I can stop I can click on a
particular thread I'm interested in so

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:26.789
particular thread I'm interested in so
 

00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:28.069
particular thread I'm interested in so
the thread displays in the middle here

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079
the thread displays in the middle here
 

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.470
the thread displays in the middle here
and we can see that async task 3 looks

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480
and we can see that async task 3 looks
 

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.580
and we can see that async task 3 looks
pretty interesting so I'll click on that

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:31.590
pretty interesting so I'll click on that
 

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.560
pretty interesting so I'll click on that
you can see a flame chart on the bottom

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:33.570
you can see a flame chart on the bottom
 

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.289
you can see a flame chart on the bottom
here and this is actually based on rain

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299
here and this is actually based on rain
 

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:38.659
here and this is actually based on rain
dish that I select right so I can I can

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:38.669
dish that I select right so I can I can
 

00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:40.549
dish that I select right so I can I can
narrow my focus on what I'm particularly

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559
narrow my focus on what I'm particularly
 

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.340
narrow my focus on what I'm particularly
interested in and we also have you know

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.350
interested in and we also have you know
 

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.260
interested in and we also have you know
a actually that with the culture this is

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:45.270
a actually that with the culture this is
 

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.520
a actually that with the culture this is
the flame chart and we also have top

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:46.530
the flame chart and we also have top
 

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.159
the flame chart and we also have top
down and bottom up this place of the

00:17:49.159 --> 00:17:49.169
down and bottom up this place of the
 

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:50.570
down and bottom up this place of the
frames so here I can sort in descending

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580
frames so here I can sort in descending
 

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.529
frames so here I can sort in descending
order of method calls for example so

00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539
order of method calls for example so
 

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:57.169
order of method calls for example so
that's the CPU profiler and last but not

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179
that's the CPU profiler and last but not
 

00:17:57.179 --> 00:18:00.140
that's the CPU profiler and last but not
least we have the network profiler so

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:00.150
least we have the network profiler so
 

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.549
least we have the network profiler so
again I'm going to go live so I just

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559
again I'm going to go live so I just
 

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:02.750
again I'm going to go live so I just
want to iterate it at this point about

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760
want to iterate it at this point about
 

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.240
want to iterate it at this point about
this timeline keeping all data I think I

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.250
this timeline keeping all data I think I
 

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.950
this timeline keeping all data I think I
was told about 5 megabytes per hour it's

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960
was told about 5 megabytes per hour it's
 

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.430
was told about 5 megabytes per hour it's
what this cost so now I'm going to go

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440
what this cost so now I'm going to go
 

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.680
what this cost so now I'm going to go
live and we're going to start looking to

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:12.690
live and we're going to start looking to
 

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.450
live and we're going to start looking to
memory so the first thing I'll do is I'm

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460
memory so the first thing I'll do is I'm
 

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.460
memory so the first thing I'll do is I'm
going to go inside the app and I'm going

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:16.470
going to go inside the app and I'm going
 

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:21.380
going to go inside the app and I'm going
to ask it to clear all of its caches and

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:21.390
to ask it to clear all of its caches and
 

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.640
to ask it to clear all of its caches and
then I'm going to go into network

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:22.650
then I'm going to go into network
 

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.120
then I'm going to go into network
profiler and I'm going to click on the

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.130
profiler and I'm going to click on the
 

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.260
profiler and I'm going to click on the
garbage collection so now we have sort

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:30.270
garbage collection so now we have sort
 

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.930
garbage collection so now we have sort
of a good baseline all right so this is

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940
of a good baseline all right so this is
 

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.820
of a good baseline all right so this is
showing you the memory of the app right

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:34.830
showing you the memory of the app right
 

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.130
showing you the memory of the app right
now and let's start collecting

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140
now and let's start collecting
 

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.380
now and let's start collecting
allocation stack traces this means that

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.390
allocation stack traces this means that
 

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.950
allocation stack traces this means that
any kind

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960
any kind
 

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.360
any kind
a location that happens in the apps

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:41.370
a location that happens in the apps
 

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.890
a location that happens in the apps
we're going to record where was done and

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900
we're going to record where was done and
 

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.960
we're going to record where was done and
the reason for that will be obvious in a

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:44.970
the reason for that will be obvious in a
 

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.320
the reason for that will be obvious in a
second and now I'm going to do some more

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:47.330
second and now I'm going to do some more
 

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.790
second and now I'm going to do some more
memory intensive activities in the app

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:49.800
memory intensive activities in the app
 

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.260
memory intensive activities in the app
you can see in the background the

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:51.270
you can see in the background the
 

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.510
you can see in the background the
metrics are scrolling us it's realizing

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520
metrics are scrolling us it's realizing
 

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.230
metrics are scrolling us it's realizing
the heat this larger and now let's go in

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240
the heat this larger and now let's go in
 

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.570
the heat this larger and now let's go in
and grab a heap dump with this down area

00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580
and grab a heap dump with this down area
 

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.280
and grab a heap dump with this down area
here so now it's fetching a heap dump

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:03.290
here so now it's fetching a heap dump
 

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.400
here so now it's fetching a heap dump
and that should be fast yeah so here we

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:07.410
and that should be fast yeah so here we
 

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.470
and that should be fast yeah so here we
can see basically a summary of the

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480
can see basically a summary of the
 

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.980
can see basically a summary of the
objects in the heap if I click on for

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:12.990
objects in the heap if I click on for
 

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.230
objects in the heap if I click on for
example the bitmap class there's 70 6/5

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240
example the bitmap class there's 70 6/5
 

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.410
example the bitmap class there's 70 6/5
I can see those objects here I can click

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:18.420
I can see those objects here I can click
 

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.900
I can see those objects here I can click
on a bitmap class and just like in the

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:20.910
on a bitmap class and just like in the
 

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.460
on a bitmap class and just like in the
old heat viewer I can now start chasing

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:22.470
old heat viewer I can now start chasing
 

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.560
old heat viewer I can now start chasing
down the references if I want to look

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:24.570
down the references if I want to look
 

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.230
down the references if I want to look
for a leak but I can also see which

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240
for a leak but I can also see which
 

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.830
for a leak but I can also see which
bitmap this is or if this was allocated

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840
bitmap this is or if this was allocated
 

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.410
bitmap this is or if this was allocated
during my allocation tracking run I can

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:33.420
during my allocation tracking run I can
 

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.240
during my allocation tracking run I can
see the allocation stack trace where

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:35.250
see the allocation stack trace where
 

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.700
see the allocation stack trace where
this object came from and for other

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:37.710
this object came from and for other
 

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.160
this object came from and for other
classes for example string yes we show

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.170
classes for example string yes we show
 

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.280
classes for example string yes we show
the actual string so that's the new

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:43.290
the actual string so that's the new
 

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.200
the actual string so that's the new

release yesterday then let's talk about
build performance we know it's a it's a

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:41.809
build performance we know it's a it's a
 

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:43.509
build performance we know it's a it's a
big problem for lot of developers and we

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:43.519
big problem for lot of developers and we
 

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.940
big problem for lot of developers and we
spent the last few quarters really

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:45.950
spent the last few quarters really
 

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.729
spent the last few quarters really
focusing on that a lot so the first

00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:48.739
focusing on that a lot so the first
 

00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:50.070
focusing on that a lot so the first
thing that I want to talk about is

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080
thing that I want to talk about is
 

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.509
thing that I want to talk about is
making a lot of tasks more incremental

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:52.519
making a lot of tasks more incremental
 

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:55.269
making a lot of tasks more incremental
so we took at we looked at the biggest

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:55.279
so we took at we looked at the biggest
 

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:57.310
so we took at we looked at the biggest
starts at the longest to run and we

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320
starts at the longest to run and we
 

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.200
starts at the longest to run and we
looked at what we could do to make them

00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.210
looked at what we could do to make them
 

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.779
looked at what we could do to make them
incremental so the Java compilation is

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:01.789
incremental so the Java compilation is
 

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.039
incremental so the Java compilation is
actually part of Gradle itself

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:03.049
actually part of Gradle itself
 

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:05.619

support a magician processor but it's

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:11.509
support a magician processor but it's
 

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:12.759
support a magician processor but it's
something that we're working with the

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:12.769
something that we're working with the
 

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:16.389

then finally a ticket packaging in 2.2

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720
then finally a ticket packaging in 2.2
 

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.799
then finally a ticket packaging in 2.2
we increase we release at and the

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:28.809
we increase we release at and the
 

00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:31.119
we increase we release at and the
incremental packages so that we don't

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:31.129
incremental packages so that we don't
 

00:21:31.129 --> 00:21:32.830
incremental packages so that we don't
have to recompress entries that you know

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840
have to recompress entries that you know

is faster than just running program so

00:21:55.089 --> 00:21:55.099
is faster than just running program so
 

00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:56.619
is faster than just running program so
you can use that just for debug and do

so greater in 3.5 release a bill cash

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:06.910
so greater in 3.5 release a bill cash
 

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.810
so greater in 3.5 release a bill cash
that works at the test level so greater

that so it took almost three minutes to
 

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.820
that so it took almost three minutes to
configure and up pretty terrible so we

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:30.830
configure and up pretty terrible so we
 

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.799

00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:34.879
2.3 but even then we are still doing
 

00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:36.279
2.3 but even then we are still doing
things that we shouldn't be doing like

things that we shouldn't be doing like
 

00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:38.409

we couldn't really fix it properly

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440
we couldn't really fix it properly
 

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.320
we couldn't really fix it properly
without a lot of new API so in

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:44.330
without a lot of new API so in
 

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.570
without a lot of new API so in
trudeau with bread or photo we finally

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:46.580
trudeau with bread or photo we finally
 

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.159

we work very closely with the greater

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:01.970
we work very closely with the greater
 

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.359
we work very closely with the greater
team they did a lot of new API saws and

00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:04.369
team they did a lot of new API saws and
 

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:06.190
team they did a lot of new API saws and
finally we can fix that so let's look at

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200
finally we can fix that so let's look at
 

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.680
finally we can fix that so let's look at
an example here here on the Left we have

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:08.690
an example here here on the Left we have
 

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.239
an example here here on the Left we have
some tasks that belong to an app that

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:10.249
some tasks that belong to an app that
 

00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:12.129
some tasks that belong to an app that
consumes the library and the tasks down

00:25:12.129 --> 00:25:12.139
consumes the library and the tasks down
 

00:25:12.139 --> 00:25:14.739
consumes the library and the tasks down
the right so let's go through what

00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:14.749
the right so let's go through what
 

00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:16.779
the right so let's go through what
happened in the build and you know we're

00:25:16.779 --> 00:25:16.789
happened in the build and you know we're
 

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:18.039
happened in the build and you know we're
going to basically build all the

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:18.049
going to basically build all the
 

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:20.259
going to basically build all the
elements of the app of the library and

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:20.269
elements of the app of the library and
 

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:22.359
elements of the app of the library and
then package them in a big zip file they

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:22.369
then package them in a big zip file they
 

00:25:22.369 --> 00:25:24.099
then package them in a big zip file they
are and then we're going to leave that a

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:24.109
are and then we're going to leave that a
 

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:26.200
are and then we're going to leave that a
are and we are going to consume it you

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.210
are and we are going to consume it you
 

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.090
are and we are going to consume it you
know on the app so you can see zero

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:28.100
know on the app so you can see zero
 

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.720
know on the app so you can see zero
parallelism

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.730
parallelism
 

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.729
parallelism
that's pretty terrible so again with

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:30.739
that's pretty terrible so again with
 

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:32.320
that's pretty terrible so again with
those new aps that we have now we can

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:32.330
those new aps that we have now we can
 

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.560
those new aps that we have now we can
publish all those elements of the and

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:35.570
publish all those elements of the and
 

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.509
publish all those elements of the and
there's about like 14 of them separately

00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:37.519
there's about like 14 of them separately
 

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:39.009
there's about like 14 of them separately
instead of just having to publish the

00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:39.019
instead of just having to publish the
 

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:41.049
instead of just having to publish the
foyer and the bill instead can look

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:41.059
foyer and the bill instead can look
 

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:41.799
foyer and the bill instead can look
something like that

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:41.809
something like that
 

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:43.629
something like that
as soon as the manifest of the library

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:43.639
as soon as the manifest of the library
 

00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:46.269
as soon as the manifest of the library
is used it is available we can keep

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279
is used it is available we can keep
 

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:47.710
is used it is available we can keep
building the library but we can start

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720
building the library but we can start
 

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.419
building the library but we can start
building the app too and then you have

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:49.429
building the app too and then you have
 

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:51.879
building the app too and then you have
better parallelism I notice also that we

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:51.889
better parallelism I notice also that we
 

00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:53.830
better parallelism I notice also that we
don't build the AR doll anymore we don't

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840
don't build the AR doll anymore we don't
 

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.299
don't build the AR doll anymore we don't
unzip it so the buildings are so more

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:55.309
unzip it so the buildings are so more
 

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.220
unzip it so the buildings are so more
efficient that way and then finally

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:57.230
efficient that way and then finally
 

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.409
efficient that way and then finally
Gradle follower some additional API to

00:25:59.409 --> 00:25:59.419
Gradle follower some additional API to
 

00:25:59.419 --> 00:26:02.590
Gradle follower some additional API to
do parallelism inside a single module we

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600
do parallelism inside a single module we
 

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.999
do parallelism inside a single module we
are not quite using them yet but we are

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:04.009
are not quite using them yet but we are
 

00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:06.729
are not quite using them yet but we are
going to start using them soon all right

00:26:06.729 --> 00:26:06.739
going to start using them soon all right
 

00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:07.899
going to start using them soon all right
let's talk about some new build features

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:07.909
let's talk about some new build features
 

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:09.759
let's talk about some new build features
oh and I want to mention that you know

00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:09.769
oh and I want to mention that you know
 

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:11.649
oh and I want to mention that you know
it's just a first step writer we're not

00:26:11.649 --> 00:26:11.659
it's just a first step writer we're not
 

00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:13.239
it's just a first step writer we're not
saying we're going to three doors gonna

00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:13.249
saying we're going to three doors gonna
 

00:26:13.249 --> 00:26:14.799
saying we're going to three doors gonna
fix everything rightly something we'll

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:14.809
fix everything rightly something we'll
 

00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:16.720
fix everything rightly something we'll
keep investing a lot in and it's just

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:16.730
keep investing a lot in and it's just
 

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.799
keep investing a lot in and it's just
like a first step

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:17.809
like a first step
 

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:20.440
like a first step
okay so some new good features first I

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:20.450
okay so some new good features first I
 

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.119
okay so some new good features first I
want to talk about is job eight language

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:22.129
want to talk about is job eight language
 

00:26:22.129 --> 00:26:25.719
want to talk about is job eight language
features so it used to require Jack we

00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:25.729
features so it used to require Jack we
 

00:26:25.729 --> 00:26:27.159
features so it used to require Jack we
announced a few weeks ago that Jack is

00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:27.169
announced a few weeks ago that Jack is
 

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:29.320
announced a few weeks ago that Jack is
deprecated in fact in 300 Jack is

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:29.330
deprecated in fact in 300 Jack is
 

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.999
deprecated in fact in 300 Jack is
completely removed if you try to enable

00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:31.009
completely removed if you try to enable
 

00:26:31.009 --> 00:26:33.099
completely removed if you try to enable
it it will tell you don't anybody the

00:26:33.099 --> 00:26:33.109
it it will tell you don't anybody the
 

00:26:33.109 --> 00:26:34.330
it it will tell you don't anybody the
DSL is still there so that we have a

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.340
DSL is still there so that we have a
 

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.549
DSL is still there so that we have a
proper message all you have to setup is

00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559
proper message all you have to setup is
 

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:37.989
proper message all you have to setup is
the source compatibility on the target

00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:37.999
the source compatibility on the target
 

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:41.709
the source compatibility on the target
compatibility so the will look something

00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:41.719
compatibility so the will look something
 

00:26:41.719 --> 00:26:43.839
compatibility so the will look something
like this right we go from Java C which

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:43.849
like this right we go from Java C which
 

00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:45.639
like this right we go from Java C which
generate Java is classified code to a

00:26:45.639 --> 00:26:45.649
generate Java is classified code to a
 

00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:47.830
generate Java is classified code to a
converter that convert that to jela 7

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840
converter that convert that to jela 7
 

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.109
converter that convert that to jela 7
class bytecode transform and indexing

00:26:50.109 --> 00:26:50.119
class bytecode transform and indexing
 

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:52.119
class bytecode transform and indexing
the transform is things like program in

00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:52.129
the transform is things like program in
 

00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:53.950
the transform is things like program in
some trend but also your own transforms

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960
some trend but also your own transforms
 

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.359
some trend but also your own transforms
potentially if you use the transform API

00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:55.369
potentially if you use the transform API
 

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:58.389
potentially if you use the transform API
so just as a heads-up later probably in

00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399
so just as a heads-up later probably in
 

00:26:58.399 --> 00:26:59.799
so just as a heads-up later probably in
302 one we're going to reverse this

00:26:59.799 --> 00:26:59.809
302 one we're going to reverse this
 

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:02.799
302 one we're going to reverse this
two-step and do the conversion after so

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:02.809
two-step and do the conversion after so
 

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:04.419
two-step and do the conversion after so
if you have custom transform you need to

00:27:04.419 --> 00:27:04.429
if you have custom transform you need to
 

00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:06.549
if you have custom transform you need to
update them to Java 8 classified code as

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559
update them to Java 8 classified code as
 

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:08.709
update them to Java 8 classified code as
soon as possible

00:27:08.709 --> 00:27:08.719
soon as possible
 

00:27:08.719 --> 00:27:10.570
soon as possible
the second feature I want to talk about

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:10.580
the second feature I want to talk about
 

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.180
the second feature I want to talk about
is dependency management so there's a

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.190
is dependency management so there's a
 

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.279
is dependency management so there's a
lot of changes here on trade although

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:14.289
lot of changes here on trade although
 

00:27:14.289 --> 00:27:16.299
lot of changes here on trade although
you're probably aware that if you have

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:16.309
you're probably aware that if you have
 

00:27:16.309 --> 00:27:19.029
you're probably aware that if you have
an app and a library right now the

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039
an app and a library right now the
 

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.129
an app and a library right now the
library the app only consumed the

00:27:21.129 --> 00:27:21.139
library the app only consumed the
 

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:23.709
library the app only consumed the
release version of the library always so

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:23.719
release version of the library always so
 

00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:24.729
release version of the library always so
on the right here you have the

00:27:24.729 --> 00:27:24.739
on the right here you have the
 

00:27:24.739 --> 00:27:26.769
on the right here you have the
configuration of the library debug and

00:27:26.769 --> 00:27:26.779
configuration of the library debug and
 

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:27.609
configuration of the library debug and
release and then you have the

00:27:27.609 --> 00:27:27.619
release and then you have the
 

00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:29.409
release and then you have the
configuration of the app he began

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:29.419
configuration of the app he began
 

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:31.299
configuration of the app he began
release and then compiled and packaging

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:31.309
release and then compiled and packaging
 

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:33.639
release and then compiled and packaging
and you could kind of like go around

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:33.649
and you could kind of like go around
 

00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:35.619
and you could kind of like go around
that by manually setting up you know

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:35.629
that by manually setting up you know
 

00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:37.329
that by manually setting up you know
debug compile and then targeting debug

00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:37.339
debug compile and then targeting debug
 

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:39.820
debug compile and then targeting debug
and that would work but excuse flavor it

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:39.830
and that would work but excuse flavor it
 

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.079
and that would work but excuse flavor it
doesn't quite work very well

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:41.089
doesn't quite work very well
 

00:27:41.089 --> 00:27:42.759
doesn't quite work very well
ix read other things are more

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:42.769
ix read other things are more
 

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:44.919
ix read other things are more
complicated because for composition

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:44.929
complicated because for composition
 

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:46.749
complicated because for composition
vidal avoidance what we have on the

00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:46.759
vidal avoidance what we have on the
 

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:48.489
vidal avoidance what we have on the
library side is we publish to

00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:48.499
library side is we publish to
 

00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:51.129
library side is we publish to
configuration tour volumes so now we

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:51.139
configuration tour volumes so now we
 

00:27:51.139 --> 00:27:52.599
configuration tour volumes so now we
have debug api elements and debug

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:52.609
have debug api elements and debug
 

00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:53.799
have debug api elements and debug

which were renamed to much the greater

00:27:56.769 --> 00:27:56.779
which were renamed to much the greater
 

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.320
which were renamed to much the greater
ones so the good news is that we finally

00:27:59.320 --> 00:27:59.330
ones so the good news is that we finally
 

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.820
ones so the good news is that we finally
took that in three doto

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:00.830
took that in three doto
 

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.070
took that in three doto
thanks to new api in Gradle and now the

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080
thanks to new api in Gradle and now the
 

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.200
thanks to new api in Gradle and now the
step do automatically we don't have to

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.210
step do automatically we don't have to
 

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.509
step do automatically we don't have to
manually try to make that work so let's

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519
manually try to make that work so let's
 

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.269
manually try to make that work so let's
see how that works are the high level

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279
see how that works are the high level
 

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.349
see how that works are the high level
basically we have the ability to set of

00:28:11.349 --> 00:28:11.359
basically we have the ability to set of
 

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:13.749
basically we have the ability to set of
attributes on this configuration object

00:28:13.749 --> 00:28:13.759
attributes on this configuration object
 

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.579
attributes on this configuration object
and Gradle will automatically merge them

00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:15.589
and Gradle will automatically merge them
 

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:17.560
and Gradle will automatically merge them
so we created an attribute on build type

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:17.570
so we created an attribute on build type
 

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.419
so we created an attribute on build type
for you automatically and then debug

00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:19.429
for you automatically and then debug
 

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:21.729
for you automatically and then debug
matches debug and then release matters

00:28:21.729 --> 00:28:21.739
matches debug and then release matters
 

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.889
matches debug and then release matters
release if you have flavor of something

00:28:23.889 --> 00:28:23.899
release if you have flavor of something
 

00:28:23.899 --> 00:28:25.570
release if you have flavor of something
right we create a new attribute for the

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.580
right we create a new attribute for the
 

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.339
right we create a new attribute for the
flavor and then you know blue debug

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:27.349
flavor and then you know blue debug
 

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:28.450
flavor and then you know blue debug
matches with blue deep

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:28.460
matches with blue deep
 

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.680
matches with blue deep
magically you know you don't have

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:29.690
magically you know you don't have
 

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.180
magically you know you don't have
anything to do it's done automatically

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.190
anything to do it's done automatically
 

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.030
anything to do it's done automatically
now of course if you don't have the same

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.040
now of course if you don't have the same
 

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.920
now of course if you don't have the same
number of label everywhere it's going to

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:35.930
number of label everywhere it's going to
 

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.630
number of label everywhere it's going to
work too like if you don't them in the

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640
work too like if you don't them in the
 

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.580
work too like if you don't them in the
library blue debug is going to match

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:39.590
library blue debug is going to match
 

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.130
library blue debug is going to match
with debug automatically the attributes

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:42.140
with debug automatically the attributes
 

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.770
with debug automatically the attributes
are actually optional however it's if

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:44.780
are actually optional however it's if
 

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.060
are actually optional however it's if
that's the other way around if you have

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.070
that's the other way around if you have
 

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.130
that's the other way around if you have
a library with flavors but you don't

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.140
a library with flavors but you don't
 

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.990
a library with flavors but you don't
have flavor in an application then it's

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000
have flavor in an application then it's
 

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.040
have flavor in an application then it's
just not going to work and you're going

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.050
just not going to work and you're going
 

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.480
just not going to work and you're going
to get a billy roll and you have to fix

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.490
to get a billy roll and you have to fix
 

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.790
to get a billy roll and you have to fix
it so we have a new DSL it's called

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:54.800
it so we have a new DSL it's called
 

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800
it so we have a new DSL it's called
flavor selection it's not balanced where

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:56.810
flavor selection it's not balanced where
 

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.030
flavor selection it's not balanced where
we are yet but we're going to do that

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.040
we are yet but we're going to do that
 

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.860
we are yet but we're going to do that
where you basically tell the build I

00:28:59.860 --> 00:28:59.870
where you basically tell the build I
 

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.630
where you basically tell the build I
want to pick blue instead of you know

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640
want to pick blue instead of you know
 

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.350
want to pick blue instead of you know
orange and then it just works now if you

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360
orange and then it just works now if you
 

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.570
orange and then it just works now if you
switch to 3.0 and you have levels you're

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:07.580
switch to 3.0 and you have levels you're
 

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.010
switch to 3.0 and you have levels you're
very likely to run into that you're

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.020
very likely to run into that you're
 

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.680
very likely to run into that you're
saying you know hey flavor I mentioned

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:11.690
saying you know hey flavor I mentioned
 

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.570
saying you know hey flavor I mentioned
name is now required which you may

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:13.580
name is now required which you may
 

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.070
name is now required which you may
already be doing with two different ones

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080
already be doing with two different ones
 

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.680
already be doing with two different ones
but not if you have a single dimension

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:17.690
but not if you have a single dimension
 

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.720
but not if you have a single dimension
so fixing it is very easy right you know

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:19.730
so fixing it is very easy right you know
 

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.030
so fixing it is very easy right you know
you have that your code roughly and then

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.040
you have that your code roughly and then
 

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.830
you have that your code roughly and then
you fix it with that and that's done you

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840
you fix it with that and that's done you
 

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.120
you fix it with that and that's done you
don't actually need to put it in like

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.130
don't actually need to put it in like
 

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.710
don't actually need to put it in like
level one of the autoblog because

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720
level one of the autoblog because
 

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.120
level one of the autoblog because
there's only one dimension we can just

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:28.130
there's only one dimension we can just
 

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.760
there's only one dimension we can just
fix that for you so the big question is

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:30.770
fix that for you so the big question is
 

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.650
fix that for you so the big question is
why do we force you to do that why can't

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:32.660
why do we force you to do that why can't
 

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.510
why do we force you to do that why can't
we just pick up a random default value

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:34.520
we just pick up a random default value
 

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.150
we just pick up a random default value
so let's look for an example here we

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:37.160
so let's look for an example here we
 

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.790
so let's look for an example here we
have an app and the app requires debug

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:39.800
have an app and the app requires debug
 

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.040
have an app and the app requires debug
orange and then we have two library one

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.050
orange and then we have two library one
 

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.810
orange and then we have two library one
of them with two flavors blue and orange

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:43.820
of them with two flavors blue and orange
 

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.550
of them with two flavors blue and orange
and the one with strawberry and orange

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:45.560
and the one with strawberry and orange
 

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.590
and the one with strawberry and orange
now you can already see that's not quite

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600
now you can already see that's not quite
 

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.420
now you can already see that's not quite
the same orange right and we just not

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:49.430
the same orange right and we just not
 

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.430
the same orange right and we just not
know so when the app says orange it's

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440
know so when the app says orange it's
 

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.400
know so when the app says orange it's
like I don't know which orange eaat so

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:54.410
like I don't know which orange eaat so
 

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.560
like I don't know which orange eaat so
that's why we asked you to name those

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:56.570
that's why we asked you to name those
 

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.150
that's why we asked you to name those
flavor dimension because we're going to

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:58.160
flavor dimension because we're going to
 

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.590
flavor dimension because we're going to
use that as the name of the attribute

00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600
use that as the name of the attribute
 

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.840
use that as the name of the attribute
and then the name of the attribute is

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:01.850
and then the name of the attribute is
 

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.310
and then the name of the attribute is
actually you know color blue color

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320
actually you know color blue color
 

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.200
actually you know color blue color
orange and then fruit strawberry and

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.210
orange and then fruit strawberry and
 

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.640
orange and then fruit strawberry and
then we can make the right selection and

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:06.650
then we can make the right selection and
 

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:08.350
then we can make the right selection and
it's the same thing right here to make

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360
it's the same thing right here to make
 

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.820
it's the same thing right here to make
it work you have to set up level

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:09.830
it work you have to set up level
 

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.920
it work you have to set up level
selection and in order to do that and it

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:11.930
selection and in order to do that and it
 

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.510
selection and in order to do that and it
should not just give us blue but you

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520
should not just give us blue but you
 

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.010
should not just give us blue but you
need to give us color blue so that we

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.020
need to give us color blue so that we
 

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.620
need to give us color blue so that we
can properly set that you attribute on

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:17.630
can properly set that you attribute on
 

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.750
can properly set that you attribute on
the configuration and then it just works

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760
the configuration and then it just works
 

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.710
the configuration and then it just works
out of the box okay let's talk about

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720
out of the box okay let's talk about
 

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.080
out of the box okay let's talk about
instant up a little bit so let's say you

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.090
instant up a little bit so let's say you
 

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.880
instant up a little bit so let's say you
have an app you know it has a few module

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:27.890
have an app you know it has a few module
 

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.100
have an app you know it has a few module
and AB module with that the application

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.110
and AB module with that the application
 

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.950
and AB module with that the application
module some library module and then you

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960
module some library module and then you
 

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.420
module some library module and then you
want to make some of those libraries as

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:34.430
want to make some of those libraries as
 

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.850
want to make some of those libraries as
feature for your in Santa so the first

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:36.860
feature for your in Santa so the first
 

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.010
feature for your in Santa so the first
thing you're going to do is change some

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.020
thing you're going to do is change some
 

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.899
thing you're going to do is change some
of those plugin

00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:39.909
of those plugin
 

00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:42.180
of those plugin
to beam up library but be feature it's a

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:42.190
to beam up library but be feature it's a
 

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.559
to beam up library but be feature it's a
new plugin that we released it's part of

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:43.569
new plugin that we released it's part of
 

00:30:43.569 --> 00:30:45.930
new plugin that we released it's part of
$3 all right and what's nice about that

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:45.940
$3 all right and what's nice about that
 

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.089
$3 all right and what's nice about that
feature plug-in is that it uses the

00:30:48.089 --> 00:30:48.099
feature plug-in is that it uses the
 

00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:49.409
feature plug-in is that it uses the
attribute mechanism I just talked about

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:49.419
attribute mechanism I just talked about
 

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:53.639
attribute mechanism I just talked about
so that it publishes both a or at least

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:53.649
so that it publishes both a or at least
 

00:30:53.649 --> 00:30:56.459
so that it publishes both a or at least
the content of the air phone app and a

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:56.469
the content of the air phone app and a
 

00:30:56.469 --> 00:30:58.979
the content of the air phone app and a
feature lpk so when an app says hey you
