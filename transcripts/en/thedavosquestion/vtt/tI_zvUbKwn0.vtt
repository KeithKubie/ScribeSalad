00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
&gt;&gt; By asking this question- of whether the
Obama Administration will improve the state

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.940
of the world. We're implicitly saying we have
great expectations. The Obama Administration

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.610
will make the world a better place. On that
I have to give a resounding yes.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.160
&gt;&gt; [girl in front of camera chanting "Obama,Obama.
Obama! Obama!]

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.039
&gt;&gt; The answer is no way. No! Because Obama
is the goat.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.230
&gt;&gt; Well I think that he already changed the
world in 2008. Being the first colored person

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.780
to be elected President of the United States.
Me myself being Asian-American. I feel more

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.969
comfortable about him. My future generations.
If not this generation. You know three generations

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.640
from now we might see an Asian president or
Latino. Don't matter. You know he's broken

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.739
the status quo for presidency.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.670
&gt;&gt; The Obama Administration. Hope for the
better? You bet! The fact that he just happens

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.900
to be a Black man will change the way that
people view our country forever.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.070
&gt;&gt; I'm really serious when I walking around
talking about how Americans are being perceived

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.750
different over seas. My buddy here just said
it what I consider very poetically is that

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.960
we're in a situation now where you know what?
People are going to look at the world a little

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.540
bit different. [man laughing in background]
Barack Obama is not for Black, he's not for

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.749
White, he's not for red, blue, green. He's
for everybody.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:32.450
&gt;&gt; First off he will definitely change this
country. Obviously he's gonna change America.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.320
Mostly because his policies are so different
from President Bush's. Obviously the way that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.650
he'll do things, the way he'll run. Some of
the laws that will be enacted in his time

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.180
in office. The country will change. Now, for
the same reason I believe that he will also

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.180
change the world.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.899
&gt;&gt;I hope that Mr. Obama will succeed in change
outside to Red States and also succeed in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.920
changing the way we are looking towards the
United States and it's (inaudible).

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.750
&gt;&gt; I do believe that Obama can bring change
in this world. If he stays committed to that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.660
same value that brought him the Presidency.
That value of a genuine person.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.010
&gt;&gt;Obama has this unique and the team behind
because it's a full team. Has this unique

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.190
opportunity um to, to make a difference because
people trust him.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.650
&gt;&gt; Obama is not alone because. He has cabinet.
he his team, and he has all the supporters

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.670
around the world. It's not just about him.
It's the world.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.879
&gt;&gt;When Obama said " Yes, We Can." He didn't
say "Yes, I can" He said "We". And that's

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.799
we the people.
