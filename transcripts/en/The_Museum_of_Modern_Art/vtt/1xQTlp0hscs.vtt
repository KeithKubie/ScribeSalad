(jazz music)

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:18.232
Voiceover: Around 1960, when Franz Kline
had started selling some paintings,

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:19.148
making some money,

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:21.398
he had been working almost
exclusively with house paint.

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:24.416
Now, Sidney Janis, his gallerist,
didn't like that idea so much,

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:27.514
perhaps because he was
looking for fine art prices,

00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:29.680
not hardware store prices.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.587
What he did one night, was
to break into Kline's studio,

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:37.827
take all of the house paint and replace it
with Winsor Newton fine art grade paints.

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:39.840
The next day Kline came in and said,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.862
"What is all this?"

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:41.589
Took it out of there.

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:42.530
Went back to the hardware store.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.082
Got some more house paint
and went back to work.

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:50.206
Why was Kline so enamored
with house paint?

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:51.250
Because it's cheap.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.417
Because it's kind of crass.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:53.944
Because it's kind of consumerist.

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:55.499
Because it's not fine art.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.380
All of those are on the table.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.007
How about the material itself?

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's take a look in the studio.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.718
Looking at the paint in the can,

00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:04.954
it looks quite different
from artist quality paint.

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:06.556
It's very, very fluid.

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:11.559
It dries to a very, very hard very,
very flat and high glossy surface.

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:13.395
Things that were all
very seductive to Kline,

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:16.251
in addition to the viscosity
of paint that could be pulled

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:18.035
across the canvas with
a brush with this paint,

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.167
because it is such a low viscosity paint.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.280
(jazz music)

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.816
Looking at Franz Kline's painting
called "Chief" from 1950.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:29.501
You might be surprised to
learn that just two years prior

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:30.501
to the making of this painting,

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:32.667
Kline spent most of his time in the studio

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.951
making figurative drawings and
paintings of things like furniture,

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:37.453
chairs for example.

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:40.899
Around that time, Kline visited
his friend Willem De Kooning.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.231
De Kooning invited Kline to
show him a new toy, a projector.

00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:47.426
Something that could enlarge
a drawing or photograph

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:50.982
many, many times, up to
the scale of, say, a wall.

00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:54.535
Kline, at that time, was drawing
these chairs, if you will,

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:56.736
on the pages of a phonebook.

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:58.869
When he projected these onto the wall,

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.827
he realized that they're so large that
no longer could you see the chair.

00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:06.366
In fact, you couldn't even read the
numbers and letters of the phonebook page.

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:09.890
Instead, he abstracted black on white,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.017
or in that case yellow in the phonebook,

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.854
abstracted images out
of his source material,

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:18.664
again drawings and the numbers
and letters in a phonebook.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:22.270
What Kline saw was something that
looked a little bit like this.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.302
It was a transformative moment for Kline.

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:27.770
He realized that the abstract
language that he wanted to pursue

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.477
was based on that figure on ground,

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:33.245
or in this case, black on white.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.115
(jazz music)

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:37.549
When Kline decided that he was
going to become an abstract painter

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.108
it did not mean that he
was done with drawing.

00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:42.834
In fact, this painting,
which looks very spontaneous,

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:46.278
looks like it perhaps could have
been done in just half an hour,

00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:47.505
maybe even less,

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:49.946
actually was the result
of careful studies.

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.104
Kline made abstract sketches

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:55.008
and then quite carefully
transferred those sketches

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.968
onto this large scale painting,

00:02:56.968 --> 00:03:00.245
again with fast dripping enamel paint.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:01.635
(jazz music)

00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:03.467
It's still one layer more complicated

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:06.052
because this is not simply black on white.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.789
This is actually black on white,

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.117
but then white back on top of the black,

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:13.080
black back on top of the white again.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.747
It's an iterative process.

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:17.912
Giving and going, if you will,
between these two colors.

00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:21.959
One step further, we're not
talking about just one color white.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.830
If we look here, we have kind
of a cool, crisp looking white.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.898
If we look here, we find
a much warmer white color.

00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:32.913
Paintings like this are often
referred to as action paintings,

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:36.329
because we can almost imagine
the painter as a kind of dancer

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.277
whose movements in front of the
canvas are recorded in time and space.

00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:44.026
(jazz music)
