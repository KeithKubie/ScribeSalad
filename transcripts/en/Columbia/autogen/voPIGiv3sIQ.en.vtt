it's a very dull dishwater so what I
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.290
it's a very dull dishwater so what I
want to do today is to open it up a bit

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300
 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.019
the transformation and then pose a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
the transformation and then pose a
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.549
the transformation and then pose a
problem if this is the case for oral

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
problem if this is the case for oral
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.130
