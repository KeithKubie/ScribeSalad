would end up in an unknown state and
 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.070 align:start position:0%
would end up in an unknown state and
that<00:07:42.950><c> was</c><00:07:43.070><c> really</c><00:07:43.250><c> bad</c><00:07:43.720><c> but</c><00:07:44.720><c> the</c><00:07:44.870><c> really</c>

that was really bad but the really
 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
that was really bad but the really

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.250 align:start position:0%
exciting bit of it was that the other
 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.430 align:start position:0%
exciting bit of it was that the other
that<00:07:46.700><c> there</c><00:07:47.030><c> were</c><00:07:47.150><c> hooks</c><00:07:47.450><c> for</c><00:07:47.690><c> build</c><00:07:48.080><c> scripts</c>

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.170 align:start position:0%

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.950 align:start position:0%
and we could expand on this process

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
basically dynamically so we did just
 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.620 align:start position:0%
basically dynamically so we did just

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.530 align:start position:0%

unless with the background coordinates
which<00:16:37.070><c> makes</c><00:16:37.280><c> it</c><00:16:37.400><c> not</c><00:16:37.520><c> only</c><00:16:37.640><c> really</c><00:16:37.940><c> easy</c><00:16:38.120><c> to</c>

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:38.330 align:start position:0%
which makes it not only really easy to
 

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
which makes it not only really easy to

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:39.530 align:start position:0%
make these combined images you don't
 

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
make these combined images you don't
have<00:16:39.710><c> to</c><00:16:39.770><c> maintain</c><00:16:39.920><c> them</c><00:16:40.280><c> manually</c><00:16:40.610><c> it's</c>

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.090 align:start position:0%
have to maintain them manually it's
 

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.610 align:start position:0%
have to maintain them manually it's
really<00:16:41.360><c> easy</c><00:16:41.510><c> for</c><00:16:41.720><c> developers</c><00:16:41.780><c> to</c><00:16:42.200><c> use</c><00:16:42.410><c> them</c>

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.620 align:start position:0%
really easy for developers to use them
 

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
really easy for developers to use them
in<00:16:42.710><c> the</c><00:16:42.800><c> code</c><00:16:43.010><c> the</c><00:16:43.400><c> mix-ins</c><00:16:43.700><c> are</c><00:16:43.850><c> named</c><00:16:44.060><c> after</c>

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the code the mix-ins are named after
 

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the code the mix-ins are named after
the<00:16:44.480><c> image</c><00:16:44.720><c> itself</c><00:16:45.020><c> so</c><00:16:45.380><c> you</c><00:16:45.470><c> just</c><00:16:45.650><c> put</c><00:16:46.040><c> the</c>

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.130 align:start position:0%
the image itself so you just put the
 

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.130 align:start position:0%
the image itself so you just put the
image<00:16:46.370><c> name</c><00:16:46.580><c> and</c><00:16:46.880><c> you</c><00:16:47.210><c> basically</c><00:16:47.390><c> get</c><00:16:47.810><c> the</c>

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.140 align:start position:0%
image name and you basically get the
 

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.860 align:start position:0%
image name and you basically get the

the coordinates change because we've
 

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.890 align:start position:0%

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:53.900 align:start position:0%
added a new image and if it's
 

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.260 align:start position:0%
added a new image and if it's

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.180 align:start position:0%
with them and make the change and this
 

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
with them and make the change and this
has<00:19:41.270><c> been</c><00:19:41.420><c> really</c><00:19:41.690><c> really</c><00:19:41.900><c> effective</c><00:19:42.470><c> for</c><00:19:42.620><c> us</c>

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:42.770 align:start position:0%
has been really really effective for us
