00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.080
Hi I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
U.S. history and today we’re gonna talk

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.009
about the Cold War.
The Cold War is called “Cold” because

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.240
it supposedly never heated up into actual
armed conflict, which means, you know, that

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.219
it wasn’t a war.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, but if the War on Christmas

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.650
is a war and the War on Drugs is a war…
You’re not going to hear me say this often

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.910
in your life, Me from the Past, but that was
a good point. At least the Cold War was not

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.490
an attempt to make war on a noun, which almost
never works, because nouns are so resilient.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.660
And to be fair, the Cold War did involve quite
a lot of actual war, from Korea to Afghanistan,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.730
as the world’s two superpowers, the United
States and the U.S.S.R., sought ideological

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.660
and strategic influence throughout the world.
So perhaps it’s best to think of the Cold

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.809
War as an era, lasting roughly from 1945 to
1990.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.110
Discussions of the Cold War tend to center
on international and political history and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.550
those are very important, which is why we’ve
talked about them in the past. This, however,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.399
is United States history, so let us heroically
gaze--as Americans so often do--at our own

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.190
navel.
(Libertage.)

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.190
Stan, why did you turn the globe to the Green
Parts of Not-America? I mean, I guess to be

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.330
fair, we were a little bit obsessed with this
guy.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.540
So, the Cold War gave us great spy novels,
independence movements, an arms race, cool

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
movies like Dr. Strangelove and War Games,
one of the most evil mustaches in history.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.610
But it also gave us a growing awareness that
the greatest existential threat to human beings

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.410
is ourselves. It changed the way we imagine
the world and humanity’s role in it.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.200
In his Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech, William
Faulkner famously said, “Our tragedy today

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.830
is a general and universal physical fear so
long sustained by now that we can even bear

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.000
it. There are no longer problems of the spirit.
There is only the question: When will I be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.420
blown up?”
So, today we’re gonna look at how that came

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.420
to be the dominant question of human existence,
and whether we can ever get past it.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.220
intro
So after WWII the U.S. and the USSR were the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.360
only two nations with any power left. The
United States was a lot stronger – we had

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.280
atomic weapons, for starters, and also the
Soviets had lost 20 million people in the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.670
war and they were led by a sociopathic mustachioed
Joseph Stalin.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.740
But the U.S. still had worries: we needed
a strong, free-market-oriented Europe (and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.050
to a lesser extent Asia) so that all the goods
we were making could find happy homes.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.470
The Soviets, meanwhile, were concerned with
something more immediate, a powerful Germany

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.000
invading them. Again. Germany--and please
do not take this personally, Germans--was

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
very, very slow to learn the central lesson
of world history: Do not invade Russia. Unless

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.860
you’re the Mongols.
(Mongoltage.)

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.840
So at the end of World War II, the USSR “encouraged”
the creation of pro-communist governments

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.370
in Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland--which was
a relatively easy thing to encourage, because

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.860
those nations were occupied by Soviet troops.
The idea for the Soviets was to create a communist

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.500
buffer between them and Germany, but to the
U.S. it looked like communism might just keep

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.620
expanding, and that would be really bad for
us, because who would buy all of our sweet,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
sweet industrial goods?
So America responded with the policy of containment,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.830
as introduced in diplomat George F. Kennan’s
famous Long Telegram. Communism could stay

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.950
where it was, but it would not be allowed
to spread.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.500
And ultimately this is why we fought very
real wars in both Korea and Vietnam.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.380
As a government report from 1950 put it the
goals of containment were:

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.709
1. Block further expansion of Soviet power
2. Expose the falsities of soviet pretensions

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.120
3. Induce a retraction of the Kremlin’s
control and influence, and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.410
4. In general, foster the seeds of destruction
within the Soviet system.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.190
Harry Truman, who as you’ll recall, became
President in 1945 after Franklin Delano Prez

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.090
4 Life Roosevelt died, was a big fan of containment,
and the first real test of it came in Greece

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.160
and Turkey in 1947.
This was a very strategically valuable region

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.250
because it was near the Middle East, and I
don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.280
the United States has been just, like, a smidge
interested in the Middle East the last several

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.440
decades because of oil glorious oil.
Right, so Truman announced the so-called Truman

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.800
Doctrine, because you know why not name a
doctrine after yourself, in which he pledged

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.209
to support “freedom-loving peoples” against
communist threats, which is all fine and good.

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.380
But who will protect us against “peoples,”
the pluralization of an already plural noun?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.660
Anyway, we eventually sent $400 million in
aid to Greece and Turkey, and we were off

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.650
to the Cold War races.
The Truman Doctrine created the language through

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.090
which Americans would view the world with
America as free and communists as tyrannical.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.260
According to our old friend Eric Foner, “The
speech set a precedent for American assistance

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260
to anticommunist regimes throughout the world,
no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.930
of a set of global military alliances directed
against the Soviet Union.”[1]

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.590
It also led to the creation of a new security
apparatus – the National Security Council,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.320
the Central Intelligence Agency, the Atomic
Energy Commission, all of which were somewhat

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.570
immune from government oversight and definitely
not democratically elected.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.290
And the containment policy and the Truman
Doctrine also laid the foundations for a military

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.150
build-up – an arms race – which would
become a key feature of the Cold War.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.650
But it wasn’t all about the military, at
least at first. Like, the Marshall Plan was

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.600
first introduced at Harvard’s Commencement
address in June 1947 by, get this, George

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.410
Marshall, in what turned out to be, like,
the second most important commencement address

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.490
in all of American history. Yes, yes, Stan,
okay. It was a great speech, thank you for

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.900
noticing. Alright, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.840
The Marshall Plan was a response to economic
chaos in Europe brought on by a particularly

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.680
harsh winter that strengthened support for
communism in France and Italy.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.370
The plan sought to use US Aid to combat the
economic instability that provided fertile

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.530
fields for communism. As Marshall said “ our
policy is not directed against any country

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.580
or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty,
desperation and chaos.” [2] Basically it

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.310
was a New Deal for Europe, and it worked;
Western Europe was rebuilt so that by 1950

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.310
production levels in industry had eclipsed
pre-war levels and Europe was on its way to

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.190
becoming a U.S. style-capitalist-mass-consumer
society. Which it still is, kind of.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.330
Japan, although not technically part of the
Marshall Plan, was also rebuilt. General Douglas

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.710
MacArthur was basically the dictator there,
forcing Japan to adopt a new constitution,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.240
giving women the vote, and pledging that Japan
would foreswear war, in exchange for which

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.370
the United States effectively became Japan’s
defense force. This allowed Japan to spend

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.229
its money on other things, like industry,
which worked out really well for them.

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.229
Meanwhile Germany was experiencing the first
Berlin crisis. At the end of the war, Germany

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.060
was divided into East and West, and even though
the capital, Berlin, was entirely in the east,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.610
it was also divided into east and west. This
meant that West Berlin was dependent on shipments

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.080
of goods from West Germany through East Germany.
And then, in 1948, Stalin cut off the roads

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.690
to West Berlin. So, the Americans responded
with an 11-month-long airlift of supplies

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.160
that eventually led to Stalin lifting the
blockade in 1948 and building the Berlin Wall,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.280
which stood until 1991, when Kool Aid Guy--no,
wait, wait, wait, wait, that wasn’t when

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.830
the Berlin Wall was built. That was in 1961.
I just wanted to give Thought Bubble the opportunity

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.060
to make that joke.
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So right, the Wall

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.650
wasn’t built until 1961, but 1949 did see
Germany officially split into two nations,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.699
and also the Soviets detonated their first
atomic bomb, and NATO was established, AND

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.050
the Chinese Revolution ended in communist
victory.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.600
So, by the end of 1950, the contours of the
Cold War had been established, West versus

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.330
East, Capitalist Freedom versus Communist
totalitarianism.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.830
At least from where I’m sitting. Although
now apparently I’m going to change where

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.110
I’m sitting because it’s time for the
Mystery Document. The rules here are simple.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.440
I guess the author of the Mystery Document
and about 55% of the time I get shocked by

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.160
the shock pen.
“We must organize and enlist the energies

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.690
and resources of the free world in a positive
program for peace which will frustrate the

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.259
Kremlin design for world domination by creating
a situation in the free world to which the

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.570
Kremlin will be compelled to adjust. Without
such a cooperative effort, led by the United

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.160
States, we will have to make gradual withdrawals
under pressure until we discover one day that

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.870
we have sacrificed positions of vital interest.
It is imperative that this trend be reversed

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.440
by a much more rapid and concerted build-up
of the actual strength of both the United

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.830
States and the other nations of the free world.”
I mean all I can say about it is that it sounds

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.889
American and, like, it was written in, like,
1951 and it seems kind of like a policy paper

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:17.889
or something really boring so I...I mean...
Yeah, I’m just going to have to take the

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.050
shock. AH!
National Security Council report NSC-68? Are

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.660
you kidding me, Stan? Not-not 64? Or 81? 68?
This is ridiculous! I call injustice.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:33.459
Anyway, as the apparently wildly famous NSC-68
shows, the U.S. government cast the Cold War

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:38.199
as a rather epic struggle between freedom
and tyranny, and that led to remarkable political

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:42.969
consensus--both democrats and republicans
supported most aspects of cold war policy,

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:46.369
especially the military build-up part.
Now, of course, there were some critics, like

00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:51.139
Walter Lippmann who worried that casting foreign
policy in such stark ideological terms would

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:56.029
result in the U.S. getting on the wrong side
of many conflicts, especially as former colonies

00:08:56.029 --> 00:09:00.889
sought to remove the bonds of empire and become
independent nations. But yeah, no, nothing

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:02.939
like that ever happened.
Yeah, I mean, it’s not like that happened

00:09:02.939 --> 00:09:08.959
in Iran or Nicaragua or Argentina or Brazil
or Guatemala or Stan are you really going

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:13.069
to make me list all of them? Fine. Or Haiti
or Paraguay or the Philippines or Chile or

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:16.540
Iraq or Indonesia or Zaire or, I’m sorry,
THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM, OKAY?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.589
But these interventions were viewed as necessary
to prevent the spread of communism, which

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:24.579
was genuinely terrifying to people and it’s
important to understand that.

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:28.740
Like, national security agencies pushed Hollywood
to produce anticommunist movies like “The

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.160
Red Menace,” which scared people. And the
CIA funded magazines, news broadcasts, concerts,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.329
art exhibitions, that gave examples of American
freedom. It even supported painters like Jackson

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:43.899
Pollack and the Museum of Modern Art in New
York because American expressionism was the

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:48.429
vanguard of artistic freedom and the exact
opposite of Soviet socialist realism.

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:53.149
I mean, have you seen Soviet paintings? Look
at the hearty ankles on these socialist comrade

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.879
peasants.
Also because the Soviets were atheists, at

00:09:55.879 --> 00:10:00.959
least in theory, Congress in 1954 added the
words “under God” to the pledge of allegiance

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:06.399
as a sign of America’s resistance to communism.
The Cold War also shaped domestic policy--anti-communist

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.910
sentiment, for instance, prevented Truman
from extending the social policies of the

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.959
New Deal.
The program that he dubbed the Fair Deal would

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:17.259
have increased the minimum wage, extended
national health insurance and increased public

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:21.720
housing, Social Security and aid to education.
But the American Medical Association lobbied

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.499
against Truman’s plan for national health
insurance by calling it “socialized” medicine,

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:29.899
and Congress was in no mood to pay money for
socialized anything.

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:33.850
That problem goes away.
But the government did make some domestic

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.480
investments as a result of the Cold War--in
the name of national security the government

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.879
spent money on education, research in science,
technology like computers, and transportation

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:47.230
infrastructure. In fact we largely have the
Cold War to thank for our marvelous interstate

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.259
highway system, although part of the reason
Congress approved it was to set up speedy

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.589
evacuation routes in the event of nuclear
war.

00:10:53.589 --> 00:10:56.899
And, speaking of nuclear war, it’s worth
noting that a big part of the reason the Soviets

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:01.529
were able to develop nuclear weapons so quickly
was thanks to espionage, like for instance

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:05.199
by physicist and spy Klaus Fuchs. I think
I’m pronouncing that right.

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:08.499
Fuchs worked on the Manhattan Project and
leaked information to the Soviets and then

00:11:08.499 --> 00:11:13.610
later helped the Chinese to build their first
bomb. Julius Rosenberg also gave atomic secrets

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.910
to the Soviets, and was eventually executed--as
was his less-clearly-guilty wife, Ethel.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.429
And it’s important to remember all that
when thinking about the United States’s

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:26.160
obsessive fear that there were communists
in our midst. This began in 1947 with Truman’s

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.300
Loyalty Review System, which required government
employees to prove their patriotism when accused

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.939
of disloyalty.
How do you prove your loyalty? Rat out your

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:37.720
co-workers as communists. No seriously though,
that program never found any communists.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.239
This all culminated of course with the Red
Scare and the rise of Wisconsin senator Joseph

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:47.999
McCarthy, an inveterate liar who became enormously
powerful after announcing in February 1950

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:51.709
that he had a list of 205 communists who worked
in the state department

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:56.600
In fact, he had no such thing, and McCarthy
never identified a single disloyal American,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.230
but the fear of communism continued. In 1951’s
Dennis v. United States, the Supreme Court

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.619
upheld the notion that being a communist leader
itself was a crime.

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:11.339
In this climate of fear, any criticism of
the government and its policies or the U.S.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:17.129
in general was seen as disloyalty. There was
only one question--when will I be blown up--and

00:12:17.129 --> 00:12:21.739
it encouraged loyalty, because only the government
could prevent the spread of communism and

00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:24.970
keep us from being blown up.
We’ve talked a lot about different ways

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.559
that Americans have imagined freedom this
year, but this was a new definition of freedom--the

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:33.879
government exists in part to keep us free
from massive destruction.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:37.970
So, the Cold War changed America profoundly:
The U.S. has remained a leader on the world

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.829
stage and continued to build a large, powerful,
and expensive national state. But it also

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:48.699
changed the way we imagine what it means to
be free, and what it means to be safe. Thanks
