00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, it's time to solve the SEIR model by computer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We've provided the constants that we've been using all of the time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We are providing erase to write the results. We're providing the initial values.

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And your job is to actually solve this system of differential equations.
