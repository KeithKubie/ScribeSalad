00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.666
- [Voiceover] Some
students traveled by train,

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.615
airplane, or boat during the summer.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:07.751
This bar graph shows how many students

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:09.748
used each type of travel.

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:11.896
All right, let's look at this thing.

00:00:11.896 --> 00:00:13.753
All right, so it tells us

00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:17.665
that five students traveled by train.

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:22.110
It tells us that 10 students
traveled by airplane.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.111
Two students traveled by boat.

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:28.454
Then we're asked how many
more students traveled

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:30.686
by airplane than boat?

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:34.715
Well let's see, 10 students
traveled by airplane,

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:36.827
two traveled by boat.

00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:40.147
So how many more is 10 than two?

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.248
Well we could figure that out by saying,

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:44.605
well what's 10 minus two?

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:49.028
So 10 minus two is going
to be equal to eight.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:52.122
Eight more students traveled by airplane

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:53.466
than by boat.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.881
And you could even see it in the bar graph

00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:57.204
that if you wanted to go from the two

00:00:57.204 --> 00:01:00.002
who traveled by boat to the 10

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.232
who traveled by airplane, you would have

00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:06.762
to add one, two, three, four,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:09.212
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:13.530
So eight more traveled
by airplane than by boat.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.142
Let's keep going.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:18.987
Sunny, Rover, and Buster buried,

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:21.123
Sunny, Rover, and Buster buried bones

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.723
in the backyard, or in the yard.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:25.963
This bar graph shows how many bones

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:27.809
each dog buried.

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:31.524
All right, so Sunny buried 10 bones.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.600
Rover buried three bones.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.141
Buster buried seven bones.

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:42.321
How many fewer bones did
Rover bury than Sunny?

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.281
Let's see, Rover buried three bones,

00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:47.185
Sunny buried 10 bones.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.974
So how many fewer is three than 10?

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:51.542
Well to go from 10 to three

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:53.262
you have to take away seven.

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.482
10 minus seven is three,

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.328
or 10 minus three is seven.

00:01:56.328 --> 00:02:00.932
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:05.564
So Rover buried seven
fewer bones than Sunny.

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:08.247
10 minus three is seven.

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:11.639
The difference here is seven.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.056
Seven.

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:15.270
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.228
Let's do one more.

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:19.540
The weather in November

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.105
was sunny, cloudy, or rainy.

00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:24.230
This bar graph shows the number of days

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.925
of each kind of weather.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:27.032
All right.

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:31.292
So we have 18 sunny days in November.

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:35.390
We have seven cloudy days in November.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.431
We have five rainy days in November.

00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:41.949
How many rainy days
were there in November?

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.097
Well I just said it.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:44.910
Look at the rainy category,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.175
and this bar graph shows us

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.532
it goes all the way up to five.

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:53.532
There were five rainy days in November.

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:55.887
We got it right.
