00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Voiceover] Write
the first nonzero terms

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.844
of the Maclaurin series for e to the x.

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:08.363
Use the Maclaurin series for e to the x

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:11.068
to write the third-degree
Taylor polynomial

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.733
for g to the x is equal to e to the x

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.914
times f of x about x equals zero.

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.596
So Maclaurin series, if
that looks familiar to you,

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:21.860
watch the videos on Khan
Academy on Maclaurin series.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.393
I'll give a little bit of primary here.

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:26.017
For taking the Maclaurin series of f of x,

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:29.941
that's going to be equal to f of zero.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.820
We could view this f of
zero times x to the zero

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.399
over zero factorial,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.535
if you assume zero
factorial is equal to one,

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:40.761
and then plus f prime of zero

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:44.441
times x to the first over one factorial

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:50.258
plus f prime prime, the second
derivative evaluated at zero,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:53.988
times x squared over two factorial.

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:54.975
I think you see the pattern here.

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:58.829
Plus f prime prime prime,
the third derivative

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.255
evaluated at zero of x to the third power

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:03.019
over three factorial.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.399
I think you see where this is going.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.199
And of course, this
first one, x to the zero

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.662
over zero factorial, that's just one.

00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:11.460
So oftentimes it will
just be written f of zero.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.735
And this term one factorial is just one.

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:15.689
So oftentimes it's just
a zero, and this f prime

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.614
of zero times x, so on and so forth.

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:20.931
So, actually, let me just write

00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.288
approximately right over there.

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:26.248
And so let's do it for e to the x.

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:30.405
So e to the x is approximately equal to,

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:33.855
well it's going to be e
to the zero which is one.

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.055
Plus, you might already know

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:40.128
that f of x.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:42.729
If f of x is equal to e to the x,

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.142
then f prime of x is
also equal to e to the x.

00:01:46.142 --> 00:01:48.476
That's one of the magical
things about e to the x.

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:52.319
The slope of the tangent
line at any point is,

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.314
well, equal to the value is
equal to the x value there.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:58.437
And if you take the third
derivative or second derivative,

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.190
it's also, you're gonna get as
many derivatives as you want.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.537
You'll still get e to the x.

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:03.429
That's one of the special things about e.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.473
So the first derivative evaluated zero,

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:09.014
well that's still e to the zero
power times x to the first.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:11.556
So plus x.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.935
And then we have the second
derivative evaluated at zero.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:15.771
Well, that's still one.

00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:18.778
So it's going to be times,
or so it's one times

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:20.357
x squared over two factorial.

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:23.898
So we just say plus x squared over two,

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.150
plus x squared over two.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.950
Two factorials is two times one

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.238
and then plus.

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:30.991
Once again, the third
derivative evaluated at zero,

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.868
that's just e to the x evaluated at zero

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:34.388
which is e to the zero which is one.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.966
So x to the third over three factorial.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:40.611
So plus x to the third
over three factorial.

00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.063
We could write it as three factorial

00:02:42.063 --> 00:02:43.607
or that's three times two times one.

00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:44.965
That's equal to six.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.683
And then we keep going.

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:49.702
So we just wrote the
first four nonzero terms

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.327
of the Maclaurin series for e to the x.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:54.265
That's one, two, three,
four nonzero terms.

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:57.469
Now we wanna use, so let
me just underline that.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.965
That's part of what
they're asking us to do.

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:03.367
Then they say use the
Maclaurin series for e to the x

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:05.608
to write the third-degree
Taylor polynomial

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:07.953
for g of x which is equal to the product

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.903
of e to the x and f of x.

00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:11.889
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.491
our original f of x.

00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:16.289
Let's write down the
first few terms of it.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.573
And then what we could
do this thing about,

00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:21.139
well, how can we multiply
those two polynomials?

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.414
And we just have to know
enough about the multiplication

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:24.750
of those two polynomials

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.931
to just get us our

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.566
terms that are no higher
than third degree.

00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:34.211
So f of x is approximately equal to,

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.429
let's see, it's x, I have a bad memory,

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:40.167
it is x minus 3/2 x squared.

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:46.157
X minus 3/2

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:49.659
x squared and then,

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.882
plus three x to the third power,

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.741
plus three x to the third power.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:58.439
Plus three x to the third power.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.446
Plus, and actually you
could say minus if you like

00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:02.723
because that is gonna be,

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:05.788
you are gonna have, it's
plus minus plus minus,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:07.123
however you want us to do it.

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:08.041
And that's enough.

00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:09.921
And, why do I feel confident
that that's enough?

00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:12.861
Well, we only want we only want to write

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:15.959
the third degree Taylor polynomial.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.752
So if we multiply this
and we involve terms

00:04:18.752 --> 00:04:20.337
that are higher than third degree,

00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:23.268
well, we're gonna, that's going to give us

00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:25.039
the terms that are polynomial

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.853
that are higher than third degree.

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:28.024
So let's just think about it.

00:04:28.024 --> 00:04:29.336
What's gonna be the product?

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:33.516
So e to the x times f of x.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:36.058
That's going to be approximately equal to,

00:04:36.058 --> 00:04:37.196
well let's see.

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:40.760
We are going to multiply
this infinite polynomial

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.676
times this infinite polynomial

00:04:42.676 --> 00:04:44.917
and that might seem
intimidating to you at first.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:48.214
What you could do is you could
go for each of these terms.

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:49.386
Must start multiplying it

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:50.884
times each of these terms at here.

00:04:50.884 --> 00:04:52.778
Essentially, you know, when
you're multiplying polynomials,

00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:54.763
you're just repeatedly doing
the distributive property

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:57.526
so you take this and
distribute it on that.

00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.140
But we should only worry about the terms

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.624
up to third degree because
anything beyond that,

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:03.540
well, that's going to add up

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.618
to a higher than third degree term.

00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:08.416
So x times one is x.

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.854
X times x squared,

00:05:10.854 --> 00:05:13.269
or sorry, x times x is x squared

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:14.988
so plus x squared.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:17.135
X times x squared over two is

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:20.735
x to the third over two.

00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:23.475
So I'll just write plus 1/2

00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:26.516
x to the third power.

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:27.376
And I'm gonna stop there

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:28.571
because if I do x times that,

00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.814
that's gonna be fourth degree term

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:30.870
and I don't wanna worry about that.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.134
We are writing the
third-degree Taylor polynomial.

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:37.685
So that's x, x squared,
x to the third over two.

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:42.685
So now let's distribute
the negative 3/2 x squared.

00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:44.953
I'll use another color here

00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:47.441
just to help explain it a little bit.

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.984
So if you multiply that times one,

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:54.767
that's going to be minus 3/2 x squared.

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:55.986
I'm just going to a second line here

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:58.575
so I can line things
up and add them nicely.

00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:01.478
And then this times this is

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.276
negative 3/2 x to the third.

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:07.538
Negative 3/2 x to the third.

00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:08.384
And once again, I'm gonna start there.

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:10.963
If I multiply these two, I'm
gonna get a fourth degree term.

00:06:10.963 --> 00:06:13.111
I don't care about the
fourth degree terms.

00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:16.745
And then, and then,

00:06:16.745 --> 00:06:19.061
let's do, let's worry about this guy.

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:20.292
And so let's start distributing.

00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:22.207
So if I multiply it times this one,

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:24.251
I'm gonna get three x to the third power.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:25.470
Three x to the third power.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.248
And I'm gonna stop there.

00:06:26.248 --> 00:06:28.105
Because then if I start
multiplying it times that guy,

00:06:28.105 --> 00:06:29.626
it's getting me a fourth degree term

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:30.787
and then a fifth degree term

00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:31.762
and then a sixth degree term

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:33.167
which I don't need to worry about.

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:35.710
So these are all the pieces
that are going to make up

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.532
that third degree polynomial.

00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:40.616
And so, what is that going to be equal to?

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:41.830
What is that going to be equal to?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.983
This is a little bit of,
you know, getting your math

00:06:44.983 --> 00:06:48.234
intuition for multiplying
infinite polynomials.

00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:50.335
Let's see, you're gonna have x.

00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:51.682
And then you're going to have,

00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:55.757
this is one x squared
minus 1 1/2 x squared.

00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:59.902
So that's going to be
negative 1/2 x squared.

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:00.993
Now let's see.

00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:04.696
Here, you have plus 1/2 minus 1 1/2

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:07.494
which would give you negative two

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.037
and then plus three,

00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:11.189
plus, no, sorry,

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.207
1/2 minus 1 1/2

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.220
which would be negative one

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.240
plus three is positive two

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.119
plus two x to the third power.

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:24.707
So we could say e to the x times f of x,

00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:28.979
the third degree Taylor
polynomial for this is

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.422
x minus 1/2 x squared

00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:35.185
plus two x to the third power.

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:37.983
And we are done.

00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:40.503
So this was a little bit tricky.

00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:42.662
You have to appreciate how
to, and besides calculus,

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.079
it's a little bit of just algebra.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.681
I just appreciate, okay, I
only need the third degree.

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:46.545
I don't have to distribute this

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:48.444
times the infinite number of terms.

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:49.923
Because, at first you might
say, "That's super hard.

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:51.827
"How do I multiply two
infinite polynomials?"

00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:54.109
The key is we only worry
about the third degree,

00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:55.924
up to the third degree.
