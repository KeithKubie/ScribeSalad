be useful for that but I'm not sure if I
 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.190
be useful for that but I'm not sure if I

d my ass so one on the left side and one
 

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.590
d my ass so one on the left side and one
on the right side and if you choose any

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600
on the right side and if you choose any
 

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.990

slider which just slides over one of
 

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.670
slider which just slides over one of
those fragments and then there's some

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680
those fragments and then there's some
 

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.020
those fragments and then there's some
content without using an external

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.030
content without using an external
 

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.810

the developer that useless framework
 

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.750
the developer that useless framework
needs to make some configuration files

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760
needs to make some configuration files
 

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.920
needs to make some configuration files
so you need to give the framework some

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:34.930
so you need to give the framework some
 

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.900
so you need to give the framework some
key value pairs somehow and I've

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:37.910
key value pairs somehow and I've
 

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.580
key value pairs somehow and I've
wondered where would I let the

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:39.590
wondered where would I let the
 

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.220
wondered where would I let the
developers all this since if I

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:42.230
developers all this since if I
 

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.890
developers all this since if I
understood it right if he put it to

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:44.900
understood it right if he put it to
 

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.690
understood it right if he put it to

three sources every other app could
access it we are code because they are a

also what you mentioned earlier I know

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:53.210
also what you mentioned earlier I know
 

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.090
also what you mentioned earlier I know
that anywhere where I stored on the

guided them out but where could I let me

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:00.860
guided them out but where could I let me

what you mean by it's in the resource is

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:11.450
what you mean by it's in the resource is
 

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:13.030
what you mean by it's in the resource is
another app will be able to access it

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040
another app will be able to access it
