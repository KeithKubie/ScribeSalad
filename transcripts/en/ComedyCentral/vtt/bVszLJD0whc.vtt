 - Hi, I'm Rob Lowe.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.342
 - We're here at the
 promo shoot right now

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.777 align:start size:88% position:13%
 where Rob's getting
 all dolled up

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.214 size:88% position:44%
 to help promote his
 own tongue lashing.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:20.486 align:start position:0%
  - You know, people talk
  about honors in this town.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.590 size:88% position:44%
  Golden Globes, the
  Emmys, the Oscars.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.826 align:start size:88% position:13%
The Comedy Central Roast
trumps all of them.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.529
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.398 size:84% position:42%
  David, have you seen your
  little girl outfit yet?

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.566
 Where are you?

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.469
 David Spade?

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.437 size:88% position:44%
 - Hey Sexy.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:42.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - What are you
 doing in my bedroom?

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:44.444 size:88% position:44%
  - Nothing.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.514
 - I've been asking David Spade
 to do the roast for so long.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Oh man, I'm so glad
 you're doing this.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.452 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I know, it's safety
 in numbers, right?

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.686
 - We go way, way back.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.421 size:88% position:44%
  We've been in the
  trenches together.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:59.158 align:start position:0%
 He's got some stories I
 hope that he does not share.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:03.362 size:88% position:44%
  - I have to figure out a
  way to really shit on him.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.297 size:88% position:44%
 Gracefully.

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.266 size:84% position:42%
  - When I do these
  types of things,

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.868 size:88% position:44%
  it's like going to battle.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I will hang up
 pictures of Rob Lowe

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.108
from every movie and TV
show he's ever been in.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.443 align:start position:0%
 - I see a couple that I
 didn't have on my wall here.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.411
 Austin Powers?

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.345
- Yeah.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:21.147
 - All right.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.814
 - Huh?

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:22.682 size:84% position:42%
  Huh? Huh?

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:23.616
 Macho.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
Huh?
- [David] Cycles, yeah.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.353 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's the PR team going
scramble, scramble,

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:28.387
 make him look tougher.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.555
 Throw a motorcycle in.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.124 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The problem with jokes
 with him are like,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.126 size:88% position:44%
 are all really compliments.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.361 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.331
 - I never thought it
 would happen to me.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.866 align:start size:88% position:13%
 When I was a kid
 growing up in Ohio,

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.301
my goals were to
become an actor,

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.171
 to star in movies, to
 have a long career,

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.306
and to be made fun of by people

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:49.809
who are a lot uglier than I am.
