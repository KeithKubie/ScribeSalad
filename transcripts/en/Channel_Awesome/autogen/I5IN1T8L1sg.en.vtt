00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.330 align:start position:0%
clever because this is a trick maybe
 

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.820 align:start position:0%

you've<00:28:21.570><c> noticed</c><00:28:21.780><c> where</c><00:28:22.140><c> they'll</c><00:28:22.320><c> have</c><00:28:22.530><c> the</c>

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:22.830 align:start position:0%
you've noticed where they'll have the
 

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
you've noticed where they'll have the
you<00:28:23.340><c> know</c><00:28:23.460><c> when</c><00:28:23.640><c> it</c><00:28:23.730><c> goes</c><00:28:23.820><c> to</c><00:28:23.970><c> the</c><00:28:24.090><c> big</c><00:28:24.240><c> action</c>

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.450 align:start position:0%
you know when it goes to the big action
 

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.210 align:start position:0%
you know when it goes to the big action
scene<00:28:24.870><c> so</c><00:28:25.050><c> get</c><00:28:25.230><c> rid</c><00:28:25.410><c> of</c><00:28:25.440><c> the</c><00:28:25.590><c> black</c><00:28:25.770><c> bars</c><00:28:26.010><c> on</c>

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.060 align:start position:0%
top and make it seem bigger but
sometimes<00:28:28.230><c> what</c><00:28:28.380><c> we'll</c><00:28:28.530><c> do</c><00:28:28.650><c> is</c><00:28:28.770><c> that</c><00:28:28.920><c> they'll</c>

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.070 align:start position:0%
sometimes what we'll do is that they'll
 

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes what we'll do is that they'll
have<00:28:29.280><c> the</c><00:28:29.310><c> black</c><00:28:29.670><c> bars</c><00:28:29.970><c> and</c><00:28:30.360><c> the</c><00:28:31.170><c> 3d</c><00:28:31.530><c> will</c><00:28:31.650><c> go</c>

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:31.770 align:start position:0%
have the black bars and the 3d will go
 

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.650 align:start position:0%
