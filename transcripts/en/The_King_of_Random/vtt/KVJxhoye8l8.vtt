00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.380
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
The idea for today's video

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.380
is brought to us by
YouTube user Dalton Wood

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.240
who wants to see us
mix iron powder into oobleck,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
and then see if a magnet will
cause that oobleck too harden up.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.760
[Music]

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.000
Not too long ago, we showed you a DIY
recipe for making some magnetic ooze.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.099
It'll be interesting to see

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.769
if the magnetic oobleck
will get drawn into a magnet

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.720
in the same way the magnetic ooze does,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.779
or if the non-Newtonian
fluid nature of the oobleck

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.180
will cause it to just harden up
in the presence of the magnet.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.300
The idea for this one is very simple.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300
We're gonna mix up a batch of oobleck
and then try mixing in some iron oxide,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.620
which is quite magnetic,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.620
to see if we can make magnetic oobleck.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.640
Will a magnet cause the oobleck to
harden up the way pushing on it does?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.680
Or it will stretch and reach
the way magnetic putty will?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.700
As the first step,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.580
I think we need to mix
ourselves up some oobleck.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.980
[Music]

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.780
Here we go.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.140
We've got ourselves
a batch of normal oobleck,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.260
which of course is just made from
corn starch and water mixed together,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.380
and this stuff is so freaking cool.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.800
I think everyone's played with this stuff.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.640
So now, let's see
if we can make this magnetic

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.500
by adding some magnetite.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.520
This is a synthetic black
iron oxide available online,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.591
and we're just gonna
add a little bit of it,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.340
and see how much we need
to add to make it magnetic.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.299
Of course, we don't
want to add too much

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.760
because cornstarch
and water is fairly specific,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.649
and you start adding too much
of other liquids or solids

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.430
than it doesn't react the same way.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.430
This whole bag.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.700
You can see is quite attracted
to a magnet.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.440
Get some of this very fine
black powder out.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.780
I don't know how much
of this we're going to need

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.260
to make the oobleck magnetic.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.500
Let's start small,

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.060
and just keep adding from there.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.579
And mixing oobleck is always loads of fun
because as soon as you start to mix it,

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.909
it turns solid.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.780
You basically just break pieces off
and pull them on top of each other

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.880
and let it liquefy again.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.860
It looks like cookies and cream.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.400
[Music]

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.240
Even with just that little bit,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.959
this feels a little bit more
crumbly than it was before.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.980
It's still basically the same
idea but it's even more dry.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.720
Maybe we've just had a slight
bit of evaporation.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.560
But I think we need
to add a little bit more water.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
[Music]

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.490
We've got our non-Newtonian fluid
with some of our magnetite mixed in.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.060
But the question is if we have
enough for it to really be magnetic.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.600
It's not even black yet.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600
It's dark gray.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.940
But in the past, before we got
something really to respond to a magnet,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.660
we had enough magnetite
in it to turn it black.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.480
So I'm gonna try adding
just a little bit more.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.610
[Music]

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.740
We've got our blackened
magnetite filled oobleck,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.660
and now I think it's time to test|
whether or not this stuff is magnetic.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.470
And if it is, what happens
when you bring a magnet near it?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.920
I'm starting off with
a pretty darn powerful magnet

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.780
just because I really
want to see what happens

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.660
in the presence of something
that's really gonna pull on this.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.620
So I'm gonna start by just putting
it on the outside of the bowl.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.100
Let's see what it does on the inside.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.700
I can see it is gathering a little bit.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.600
It's moved over to the side.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.260
It's not pulling on it
very strongly though.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.660
Where if it is and it's solidifying up
so we can't see it pulling much.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.250
Let's just bring it right next to magnet
and really see what happens here.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.000
Oh, it's certainly pulling on it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.760
and that's looking quite a bit like
how it reacts to the magnetic ooze.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.520
But I think it is actually keeping it
from turning back into a liquid.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.260
It's constantly pulling on it enough.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.510
You can see with just this little blob,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.990
if I stop moving,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.220
it starts running,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.980
just kind of pouring
down my finger a little bit.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.160
The magnetite, this black dust,
has a tendency to stain

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.800
very quickly and easily.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.440
I'm going without gloves because
I want you to be able to see it really nicely

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.890
but I don't know, it might just
turn my fingers black pretty quick.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.880
So you can see as long as I
keep this rolling around,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.460
it's fairly solid then as soon as I stop,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.540
it just puddles, turns into a liquid.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.140
It's not quite as runny as it is with normal
oobleck without magnetite powder in it.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.980
But, the same thing is working.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.000
So now, let's see what happens
on the magnet again.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300
Put it on the magnet.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.460
And it does seem to be holding it still.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.740
It's not running off
the way it was in my fingers.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.780
Let's just grab another little
blob about the same size.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.459
So my fingers, if I stop
doing anything with it,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.860
see it begins to run.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.910
But the stuff on the magnet
is being held in place.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.180
It's staying fairly solid.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960
In fact, I can even poke it
and feel that it feels fairly solid.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.200
But when I have strands dripping down,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.340
it really does pull on it in a similar
manner to our magnetic ooze.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.540
Here, I've got a batch of the same
magnetic slime that we mixed up previously,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.920
and this is our newly-made
magnetic oobleck.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.600
Let's look at the differences
between how these react.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.860
So magnetic slime, magnet,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.040
see it starts pretty well.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.140
Here stretching stuff.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.540
As a comparison, our magnetic oobleck.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.080
It does
start to move very quickly.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.620
It moves into the magnet pulling on it.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.020
But at that point,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.200
it doesn't pull and stretch the
way our magnetic slime does.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.760
[Music]

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.100
To get a little bit of it,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.900
I have to hold the magnet closer,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.460
move it around a bit,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.900
and it's definitely slower

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.920
but we are getting from
stretch out of our oobleck.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.320
So definitely a very different
type of stretching

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.860
we see with our magnetic ooze.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:57.680
[Music]

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.280
So our two giant magnets inside
of our two magnetic semi-fluids

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.540
do behave differently.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.580
This one over here is the slime,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.700
and we were able to see that
that slime very quickly reached up

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.281
and grabbed all the way around the
magnet surrounding it, engulfing it.

00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.840
It is just completely suspended
in the magnetic slime right now.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.600
Magnetic oobleck,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.200
it did some similar things

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.960
but it didn't do nearly
as much as the slime did.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.919
As the magnet started pulling it together,

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.300
I believe it did start hardening the Oobleck

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.660
the same way as when you play with it
or roll it around or poke it really hard.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.420
And because of that,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.560
not too much of the substance was able
to start climbing up around the magnet.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.600
But I did find that when I started
taking the bowl and vibrating it,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.760
it sort of made the oobleck
into the state of liquefaction,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.260
where became more runny,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.340
and suddenly it began climbing up
the sides of the magnet a lot faster.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.840
It was also fun because the whole magnet
started sliding toward the other magnet.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.320
They're about eight inches apart,
and they're starting to pull each other.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.420
So the magnetic oobleck
does definitely harden up.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.000
The magnet powder in
there not only changes

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.600
the consistency of the oobleck a little bit

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.660
but it also makes it react to a magnet,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.140
and it seizes up and becomes
a lot more hard and durable,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.580
and in fact, just poking this spot over here

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.110
feels a lot softer than the part
that's touching the magnet itself.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.340
I also thought it was fun.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.500
As I was moving the bowls,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.060
I noticed that the magnets like to
stay pointed towards each other.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.920
So if I turn the magnet in the slime,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.560
themagnet starts just rotating,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.280
dragging all the slime with it.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.880
Another interesting thing
happening right now

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.780
is that the magnet is pulling on some
of the oobleck with magnetite powder in it

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.050
so hard that it's actually squeezing
some of the water out of it.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.040
This is a similar issue to what we ran into

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.200
when we were trying to make
magnetic fluid, a ferrofluid,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.600
and it's that a lot of the time,
the magnet is so strong

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.760
it squeezes the particulate
together so hard

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.480
that the water doesn't have
space in between little particles,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.320
and it just starts dripping out.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.060
Dalton Wood, you wanted to know
whether or not we could add iron powder

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.740
and make magnetic oobleck.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.220
The answer is mostly we can.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.580
It does change the consistency,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.870
so it's not quite the
same as normal oobleck

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.220
but it does still form
a ball when you play with it,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.639
and puddle out when you
stop moving it around.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.400
It's not quite as firm or quite
as liquid either side,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.460
but it is still a non-Newtonian fluid
and it does get pulled by a magnet.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.500
And yes, the pull of the magnet
does cause it to harden it.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:17.160
So good question, fun experiment to try.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.210
