00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.210
This right here is a
solid of revolution

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.590
whose volume we were able to
figure out in previous videos,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.070
actually in a different
tutorial, using the disk method

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.352
and integrating in terms of y.

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:14.810
What we're going
to do right now is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.537
we're going to find the same
volume for the same solid

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:20.120
of revolution, but we're going
to do it using the shell method

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.250
and integrating
with respect to x.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.920
So what we do is we have
the region between these two

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.620
curves, y is equal
to square root of x

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.130
and y is equal to x squared.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.880
And we're going to rotate it
around the vertical line x

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.740
equals 2.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.547
And we're going to do
that at the interval

00:00:34.547 --> 00:00:37.130
that we're going to rotate this
space between these two curves

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.150
is the interval when square root
of x is greater than x squared.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.920
And so it's between 0 and 1.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.690
And so let's try to do
it with the shell method.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.090
And so to do that, what we do
is we want to construct a shell.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.880
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.100
Let's imagine a rectangle
right over here.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.250
It has width dx.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.937
and its height is the difference
of these two functions.

00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:09.770
And so if I were to
draw it right over here,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.186
it would look
something like this.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.310
It'd be there, and
then it is a shell,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.240
it's kind of a
hollowed-out cylinder.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.340
So it would look
something like this.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.340
Just like that.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.100
And it has some depth,
that's what the dx gives us.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.182
So we have the depth that
looks something like that.

00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:37.890
And then let me shade
it in a little bit,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.990
just so we can see a
little bit of its depth.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.580
So when you rotate
this rectangle

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.790
around the line x equals 2,
you get a shell like this.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.540
So let's think about
how we can figure out

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.317
the volume of this shell.

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:53.150
Well, we've already
done this several times.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.983
The first thing we might
want to think about

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:58.260
is the circumference of
the top of the shell.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.090
We know circumference
is 2 pi times radius.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.150
We just need to know what
the radius of the shell is.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.840
What is that
distance going to be?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.730
Well, it's the
horizontal distance

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.010
between x equals 2 and whatever
the x value is right over here.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.700
So it's going to be
2 minus our x value.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.720
So this radius, this
distance right over here,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.050
is going to be 2 minus x.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.990
And so the circumference is
going to be that times 2 pi.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.340
2 pi r gives us the
circumference of that circle.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.440
So 2 pi times 2 minus x.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.160
And then if we want
the surface area

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.310
of the outside of our
shell, so the area

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.410
is going to be the circumference
2 pi times 2 minus x

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.680
times the height of each shell.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.100
Now, what is the
height of each shell?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.250
It's going to be the
vertical distance expressed

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.710
as functions of y.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.480
So it's going to
be the top boundary

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960
is y is equal to square root
of x, the bottom boundary is

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.170
y is equal to x squared.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.715
So it's going to be square
root of x minus x squared.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.500
Let me do this in the yellow.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.370
So it's going to be square
root of x minus x squared.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.410
And so if you want the
volume of a given shell--

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.330
I'll write all this
in white-- it's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.700
going to be 2 pi
times 2 minus x times

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.220
square root of x
minus x squared.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.945
So this whole expression,
I just rewrote it,

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:41.190
is the area, the outside surface
area, of one of these shells.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.690
If we want the volume, we have
to get a little bit of depth,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.514
multiply by how deep the
shell is, so times dx.

00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:49.430
And if we want the volume
of this whole thing,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.020
we just have to
solve all the shells

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.630
for all of the x's
in this interval

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.100
and take the limit as the
dx's get smaller and smaller

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.980
and we have more
and more shells.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.420
And so, what's our interval?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.210
Well our x's are going
to go between 0 and 1.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.360
So that right over there is
the volume of this figure.
