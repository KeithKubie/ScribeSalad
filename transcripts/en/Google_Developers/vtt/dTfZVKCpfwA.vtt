[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.150
You know, what I really
love about Android

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.800
is that it's an open ecosystem
that I can contribute to.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.230
I feel like I have
part ownership.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.940
I can go and look
at the source code.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.740
I can find libraries and APIs.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.780
I can build on what
other people have built.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.290
And I can contribute.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.260
There's lots of open
source projects.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.680
And I'm really in control
of the experience.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.710
So it's just a platform
where I can create.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.100
So in a way, it's a creative
outlet for a programmer.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.750
