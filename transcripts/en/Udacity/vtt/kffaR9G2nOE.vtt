00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.040
Now that we know how to make stuff move,
let's make it interactive.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.060
There are a ton of different ways to
interact with libGDX games, key presses,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.450
your mouse, touches, and even device
orientation and acceleration.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.710
In this level we'll learn to detect
user input of all kinds, and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.470
respond to it in our games.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.060
Let's get started.
