00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:02.508
- [Voiceover] Let's say
someone walks up to you

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:05.067
on the street and says to you,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:09.798
50 divided by five,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.840
50 divided by five is equal to blank,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.407
is equal to blank.

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.035
How can you think about this

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:20.203
as a multiplication problem?

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:24.768
Well, whatever blank
is, whatever blank is,

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:27.403
if you multiply it by five,

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.085
if you multiply by five,

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.641
you should get 50.

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:35.924
You should get 50. You should get 50.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.666
So one way of thinking
about it, you could say

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.304
"what times five is 50?"

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:43.201
Well, 10 times five is 50.

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.401
10 times five is 50, so 50 divided by five

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.917
is going to be 10.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.543
Hopefully you see the relationship here.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:55.594
If 50 divided by five is 10,
then 10 times five is 50.

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:59.055
10 times five is 50.

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:01.510
And you could do it the other way around.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.795
What is 50 divided by 10 going to be?

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:09.722
50 divided by 10, well that's
going to be equal to five.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.931
50 divided by 10 is going
to be equal to five.

00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.238
How do I know that?

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:18.499
Well, five times 10, five times 10,

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:21.605
five times 10, is equal to 50.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.487
Is equal to 50.

00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:26.335
So let's keep thinking about this.

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:28.540
If someone walked up to
you in the street again,

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:33.354
and said blank, blank, divided by,

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:36.713
divided by two,

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:41.531
blank divided by two is equal to,

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.073
is equal to nine.

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:46.198
How would you figure out what blank is?

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:48.798
Something divided by two is equal to nine.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.536
Well, one way to think about
it, and if we just follow here,

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:52.993
if you said 50 divided by five is 10,

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:55.205
you could say 10 times five is 50,

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.731
so right over here we could say

00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.891
well, nine times two,

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:02.504
nine times two,

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.227
must be equal to blank.

00:02:05.252 --> 00:02:07.795
Must be equal to our blank.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.478
Well we know what nine times two is,

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:12.856
that is 18, so this must be 18.

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:15.288
18 divided by two is nine.

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:17.626
And that's really describing how

00:02:17.626 --> 00:02:19.914
18, two, and nine relate to each other.

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:23.254
Two nines is 18, or nine twos is 18,

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:26.473
or if I were to divide 18 into two groups,

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:27.971
each group would have nine.

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:29.840
Or if I were to divide into groups of two,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.233
you would have nine groups.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:32.417
Any way you look at it,

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:36.956
18 divided by two is nine,
nine times two is 18.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.651
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:40.474
So, someone walks up to you on the street,

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:43.214
and tells you, and tells you that

00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:46.112
12 divided by,

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.376
divided by blank,

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:53.313
12 divided by blank is equal to three.

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.577
Is equal to three.

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.992
What is blank going to be?

00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.012
Well one way to think about this

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:03.529
is three times blank is
going to be equal to 12.

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.962
Three times blank,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.627
three times this unknown number,

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:11.337
is going to be equal to 12.

00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:15.163
And three times what is equal to 12?

00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:19.390
Well three times four is equal to 12,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.783
so 12 divided by four is equal to three.
