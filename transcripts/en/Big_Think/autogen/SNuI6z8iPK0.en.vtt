well you know oil is just one part of

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
well you know oil is just one part of
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.820
well you know oil is just one part of
the energy picture it's not it's not the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
the energy picture it's not it's not the
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.379
the energy picture it's not it's not the
whole picture we just happen to see it

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
whole picture we just happen to see it
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.690
whole picture we just happen to see it
most clearly because we use it in our

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
most clearly because we use it in our
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.730
most clearly because we use it in our
cars but again when you turn on that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
cars but again when you turn on that
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.650
cars but again when you turn on that
light switch there's very little oil in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
light switch there's very little oil in
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019
light switch there's very little oil in
that equation at all that's coming from

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
that equation at all that's coming from
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.759
that equation at all that's coming from
a lot of other sources so I'm not sure

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
a lot of other sources so I'm not sure
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290
a lot of other sources so I'm not sure
the oil she'd be picked out is the only

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
the oil she'd be picked out is the only
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.080
the oil she'd be picked out is the only
one I'm not sure anybody has a right to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
one I'm not sure anybody has a right to
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.960
one I'm not sure anybody has a right to
anything in life I think we we have we

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
anything in life I think we we have we
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.389
anything in life I think we we have we
have I guess the right we have the right

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
have I guess the right we have the right
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520
have I guess the right we have the right
to work hard and hope that we get

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
to work hard and hope that we get
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.639
to work hard and hope that we get
blessed with the right answers but but I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
blessed with the right answers but but I
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380
blessed with the right answers but but I
think we've got to act responsibly I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
think we've got to act responsibly I
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880
think we've got to act responsibly I
think we've got to work for it I don't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
think we've got to work for it I don't
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.930
think we've got to work for it I don't
think it's going to be dropped from

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
think it's going to be dropped from
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330
think it's going to be dropped from
heaven and I some people think that some

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
heaven and I some people think that some
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.560
heaven and I some people think that some
of these new technologies can be dropped

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
of these new technologies can be dropped
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720
of these new technologies can be dropped
from heaven i guess i don't i don't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
from heaven i guess i don't i don't
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279
from heaven i guess i don't i don't
believe that i'm a scientist and i

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
believe that i'm a scientist and i
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720
believe that i'm a scientist and i
believe in science and i believe in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
believe in science and i believe in
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420
believe in science and i believe in
science being patient and that science

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
science being patient and that science
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.970
science being patient and that science
being anticipated this is not something

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
being anticipated this is not something
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.500
being anticipated this is not something
like you're trying to go to the moon or

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
like you're trying to go to the moon or
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.689
like you're trying to go to the moon or
develop a atomic weapon this is a

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699
develop a atomic weapon this is a
 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.929
develop a atomic weapon this is a
multi-element complex model of various

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
multi-element complex model of various
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149
multi-element complex model of various
energy sources that has a huge

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
energy sources that has a huge
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490
energy sources that has a huge
infrastructure in place this is not like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500
infrastructure in place this is not like
 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.960
infrastructure in place this is not like
starting over from scratch and saying

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
starting over from scratch and saying
 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.190
starting over from scratch and saying
you can just create something out of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
you can just create something out of
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679
you can just create something out of
nothing and that's where people miss it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
nothing and that's where people miss it
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960
nothing and that's where people miss it
is to recreate the infrastructure that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
is to recreate the infrastructure that
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940
is to recreate the infrastructure that
we have to think that a technology like

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
we have to think that a technology like
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.469
we have to think that a technology like
the combustion engine could actually

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
the combustion engine could actually
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570
the combustion engine could actually
last in today's world for over a hundred

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
last in today's world for over a hundred
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.620
last in today's world for over a hundred
years why is that possible it's just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
years why is that possible it's just
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.780
years why is that possible it's just
because it happens to be a phenomenal

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790
because it happens to be a phenomenal
 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.130
because it happens to be a phenomenal
technology now what the next one is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
technology now what the next one is
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480
technology now what the next one is
going to be I don't know we got to be

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
going to be I don't know we got to be
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.710
going to be I don't know we got to be
working on it and we should put a lot of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
working on it and we should put a lot of
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.870
working on it and we should put a lot of
money behind it but putting 30 billion

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
money behind it but putting 30 billion
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.039
money behind it but putting 30 billion
behind it's not going to change the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
behind it's not going to change the
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.020
behind it's not going to change the
answer more input in 50 billion 50

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
answer more input in 50 billion 50
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.179
answer more input in 50 billion 50
million behind it probable again the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
million behind it probable again the
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.119
million behind it probable again the
right people focused on
