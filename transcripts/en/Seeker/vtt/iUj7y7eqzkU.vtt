00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.810
It’s a fun playground question, Is my red
like your red? Well if you’re colorblind,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.980
your red is probably a lot like your green.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.749
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.520
Being colorblind not as rare as you’d think.
Around 7%–10% of men have some form of what

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.700
is commonly called red-green color blindness.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.020
In colorblind people,
75% have trouble with green, while only 20%

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.970
have issues with seeing red.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.560
It’s not like those colors don’t exist
for them. Most ‘colorblind’ people can

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.420
actually see these colors when they’re bright,
but if they’re dull or muted in some way,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780
they started to get a little hard to tell
apart.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.780
Most men get the gene from their mother’s
father. It’s a genetic mutation on the X

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.130
chromosome, which means if men get that copy
of that gene, they will express it, or experience

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.430
it. Whereas most women have two XX chromosomes,
so sometimes one x will have the mutation

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.860
and the other will be just fine and kind of
overrides the mutation.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.140
To understand what exactly this mutation is
doing, let’s take a closer look at the eye.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.410
The back of your eyes have a lining filled
with photoreceptors. Which means cells that

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.420
can sense light. Across the animal kingdom
there’s quite a few kinds of these cells.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.150
But humans have only two. Rods and cones.
While rods help us see in low light situations,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.600
they see the world in mostly black and white.
Cones on the other hand, help us see a rainbow.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
Three different kinds of cones, each absorb
different wavelengths of light. Short, long

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.270
and medium.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.420
Basically when one of the genes get mutated,
one or more of these cones don’t work right.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.670
The most common form of color blindness, red-green,
occurs when medium wavelength sensing cones

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.700
don’t develop properly. This is called Dichromacy.
Monochromacy occurs when two or more of the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.820
light sense cones can’t work, inducing an
almost total color blindness.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.560
Less severe is "anomalous trichromacy". Where
the cones work.. kind of. They’re anomalous,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.750
or different in some way. So some people might
have trouble distinguishing between shades

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.650
of colors. A rare condition, achromatopsia,
is the inability to see any color. They literally

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.259
see the world in black and white.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.560
On the other end of the spectrum, some people
see MORE colors. Tetrachromacy occurs when

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.159
someone, almost always a woman, has a fourth
type of cone cell. But not a single case was

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.240
actually found until fairly recently.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.400
The idea that some people might have a fourth
cone was put forward in the late 1940s by

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.200
Dutch scientist HL de Vries. After studying
color blindness in men, he thought that maybe

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.670
their daughters might carry the mutation too.
Since the mutation is carried on the x chromosome,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.989
that means women with the gene would have
three normal cones, but ALSO the mutation.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.370
Equalling a total of four types!

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.060
But after searching and searching scientists
couldn’t find a single person with this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.970
condition until 2010. It seems that it takes
training to unlock the powers of this fourth

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.910
cone. Concetta Antico works as an artist and
sees shades we can’t even imagine. She sees

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.200
pink in moonlight and red in green leaves.
But it’s not all sunshine and roses, she

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.780
says going to the supermarket is like “a
trash pile of colour”. While genetics aren’t

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.950
all that rare, maybe up to 12% of women have
the gene, it takes training to really see

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.120
all the possibilities, like becoming a painter.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.520
So no, you probably aren’t a tetrachromat
and no, that alone doesn’t prove or do anything

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.410
really. Sorry to burst your bubble. On the
other hand though, you can still lose your

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.370
sense of color even if you don’t have the
gene due to eye, nerve, or brain damage, or

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.510
even exposure to certain chemicals. Or some
people’s ability to distinguish colors can

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.260
fade over time. The cones just get worn out.
Over half of people 85 or older have some

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.819
trouble seeing colors. according to a study
published in Optometry and Vision Science.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.010
As you get older the optical media within
the lens fades and yellows. So some greens

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.870
appear more yellow.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.870
So enjoy that color while you can kid. It
won’t last forever. So excuse me, i’m

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.209
going to go take photos of a sunset or something.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.080
