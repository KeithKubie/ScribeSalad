I thought actually the airbending being

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340
I thought actually the airbending being
 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.490
I thought actually the airbending being
opened up after the other elements are

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
opened up after the other elements are
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.020
opened up after the other elements are
taken away I thought that was clever

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
taken away I thought that was clever
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930
taken away I thought that was clever
I actually liked that too yeah we just

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

add something like weight cuts off your

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
add something like weight cuts off your
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.760
add something like weight cuts off your
connection to the element so I kind you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
connection to the element so I kind you
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.229
connection to the element so I kind you
sever that connection then you've just

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
sever that connection then you've just
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240
sever that connection then you've just
got the air laugh so since like tada

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
got the air laugh so since like tada
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340

her powers are gone so it's like using
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149
her powers are gone so it's like using
just whatever she knows of the element

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
just whatever she knows of the element
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149
just whatever she knows of the element
there and that would probably result in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
there and that would probably result in
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710

but you could figure out that even if

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
but you could figure out that even if
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.680
but you could figure out that even if
it's taken away that could work I'm

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680
which gave us then beifong how
 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.140
which gave us then beifong how
interesting would have been if Lin

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.150
interesting would have been if Lin
 

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.390

and I know it's not gonna be avatar uh
but I still like it was why you need to

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:26.190
but I still like it was why you need to
 

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.220
but I still like it was why you need to
compare it to avatar because it has same

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.230
compare it to avatar because it has same
 

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.430
compare it to avatar because it has same
series its displace in the same world

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440
series its displace in the same world
 

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.260

okay it's like comparing Batman and

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:33.270
okay it's like comparing Batman and
 

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.990
okay it's like comparing Batman and
Batman Returns it's it is the sequel and

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
Batman Returns it's it is the sequel and
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.970
Batman Returns it's it is the sequel and
and that's what you're going to compare

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980
and that's what you're going to compare
 

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.440
and that's what you're going to compare
it but again I don't need to be as good

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.450
it but again I don't need to be as good
 

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.210
it but again I don't need to be as good
as avatar I to me it's more like trying

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220
as avatar I to me it's more like trying
 

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220
as avatar I to me it's more like trying
to compare the burden Batman's with the

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.230
to compare the burden Batman's with the
 

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.020
to compare the burden Batman's with the
Nolan Batman so these are the same

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.030
Nolan Batman so these are the same
 

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.850
Nolan Batman so these are the same
people these are the same people but

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860
people these are the same people but
 

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.010
people these are the same people but
it's really stylistically different no

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:49.020
it's really stylistically different no
 

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.840
it's really stylistically different no
but it's it still matches that well

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:50.850
but it's it still matches that well
 

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.010
but it's it still matches that well
still the same world it's still the

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.020
still the same world it's still the
 

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.800
still the same world it's still the
continuation and but I guess I'm not

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:54.810
continuation and but I guess I'm not
 

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.450
continuation and but I guess I'm not
expecting it to be the next I'm not

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:56.460
expecting it to be the next I'm not
 

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.220
expecting it to be the next I'm not
expecting it to be avatar if I wanted

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:58.230
expecting it to be avatar if I wanted
 

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.600
expecting it to be avatar if I wanted
