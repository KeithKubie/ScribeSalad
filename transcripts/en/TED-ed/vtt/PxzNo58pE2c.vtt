00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:12.584
More than two kilometers below 
the surface of northern Ontario,

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:18.704
suspended in 345,000 liters 
of ultra-pure water,

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.655
there’s a perfect sphere.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:24.215
It contains 3600 kilograms 
of liquid argon,

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:28.245
cooled to -180 degrees Celsius.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:32.106
Scientists continuously monitor 
this chamber from above ground,

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.085
looking for a glimmer 
of light in the darkness.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:36.284
Because down here,

00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:39.845
deep beneath the Earth’s surface 
and cocooned in a watery shield,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:44.809
that light would indicate the presence of
one of the universe’s greatest mysteries:

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.220
dark matter.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.015
All the matter we can see,
planets, stars and galaxies,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.765
doesn’t create enough gravitational pull

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.877
to explain
the universe’s larger structure.

00:00:55.877 --> 00:01:01.066
It’s dark matter, which is estimated 
to make up 25% of the known universe.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.424
But despite its prevalence,

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:05.715
so far we haven’t been able 
to detect it directly.

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:07.485
It’s no small challenge.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:11.597
Dark matter was so named because it
doesn’t interact with any type of light,

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:13.695
visible or otherwise,

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:15.776
which means our usual observation tools

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.338
simply don’t work 
when trying to observe it.

00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:21.809
But while dark matter may not be visible 
in the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.354
it’s still matter,

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:26.944
so we should be able to measure 
its interactions with other matter.

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:29.328
And if our current model 
of physics is correct,

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:32.066
billions of sub-atomic 
dark matter particles

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.763
are passing through 
the Earth every second.

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:36.606
Despite the prevalence of dark matter,

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.434
its interactions are predicted to be rare 
and extremely weak.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.935
To detect these interactions,

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.636
dark matter experiments need to be
incredibly sensitive.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.414
With such sensitive equipment,

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:50.736
the ever-present background radiation 
on Earth’s surface

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.966
would create so much noise in the data

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.435
that any dark matter particles 
would be completely overwhelmed.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:00.276
It would be like trying to hear
a pin drop on a busy city street.

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:01.696
To solve this problem,

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:04.754
scientists have had 
to dig deep into the Earth.

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:08.946
Dark matter experiments are set up 
in specialized underground labs,

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:11.416
either in mines or inside mountains.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:15.217
The rock that makes up 
the Earth’s crust works like a filter,

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.710
absorbing radiation 
and stopping disruptive particles.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.195
The ultra-pure water
in which the detector is suspended

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:25.115
adds an additional layer 
of radiation filtering.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:29.094
This shielding ensures that only 
the particles scientists are looking for

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:31.904
can make their way into the detectors.

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.986
Once these particles reach 
an experiment’s inner vessel,

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.665
scientists have a chance 
of detecting them.

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:41.475
The detector media are chosen because 
they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.946
that can be purified extremely well.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.966
These could be a liquid noble gas,

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:46.754
germanium

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:48.194
and silicon crystals,

00:02:48.194 --> 00:02:49.205
a refrigerant,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:50.724
or other materials.

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:53.645
When radiation interacts, 
it leaves tell-tale signs,

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:55.397
such as light or bubbles,

00:02:55.397 --> 00:02:58.515
which can be picked up by the sensors
inside the detector.

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.975
The detector media are held 
in a central chamber made of glass

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:03.994
or a special type of acrylic.

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:06.903
These chambers have to be able 
to hold the substance inside

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.666
without interacting with it

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.426
while withstanding incredible pressure 
from the water outside.

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.415
The inner vessel is surrounded 
by powerful sensors

00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:18.645
designed to detect even the
tiniest blips of light,

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.965
or the sound vibrations 
caused by a single bubble.

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:25.086
Each sensor records data 24/7,

00:03:25.086 --> 00:03:28.593
and experiments run for months 
and years at a time,

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:31.407
generating terabytes of data every day.

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:35.235
Building dark matter detectors 
is as much a feat of engineering

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.244
as it is a feat of physics.

00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:40.194
By the time an experiment 
is ready to start collecting data,

00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:44.485
years or decades of work and investment 
have already gone into it,

00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:47.506
to the tune of tens 
of millions of dollars.

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:53.376
As of 2017, no dark matter particles 
have been directly detected.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:55.135
That’s not entirely surprising.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:04:00.115
Physicists expect these interactions to be
incredibly rare and difficult to detect.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.255
In the meantime,

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:04.125
scientists continue 
to develop new technologies

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.135
and increase detector sensitivity,

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:09.128
closing in on where dark matter is hiding.

00:04:09.128 --> 00:04:10.264
And when they find it,

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:15.625
we’ll finally be able to bring the 
universe’s darkest secrets into the light.
