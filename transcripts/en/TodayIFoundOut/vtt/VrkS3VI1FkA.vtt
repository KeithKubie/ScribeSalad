00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:12.730
The word 
dunce derives from the name of an extremely

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:21.560
accomplished religious scholar- John Duns
Scotus (1265/66-1308), an influential philosopher

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.980
and theologian of the High Middle Ages.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.800
If you guessed that his ideas and those who
touted them were (somewhat unfairly) eventually

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.430
widely panned as moronic, you’d be correct.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.540
Born near the Scottish village of Duns, from
which he took the name, Duns Scotus was ordained

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.520
into the Catholic Franciscan Order at St.
Andrew’s Priory, Northampton, England in

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
1291.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.350
Over the next 17 years, Duns Scotus strongly
influenced both religious and secular thought.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.730
One of Duns Scotus’ most notable contributions
was the idea that existence was abstract,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.010
but it remained the same for all beings and
things, only differing in terms of degree.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.870
However, he was perhaps most well known for
making complex arguments, and in particular

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.110
to prove the existence of God and the Immaculate
Conception.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.829
For instance, his long and detailed argument
for the existence of God can more or less

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:11.990
be summed up as follows:

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.389
1) Something, A, is produced.

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:18.439
2) It is produced either by itself, nothing,
or another.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.729
3) Not by nothing, for nothing causes nothing.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.520
4) Not by itself, for an effect never causes
itself.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.499
5) Therefore, by another; call it B.
6) We return to 2).

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:33.479
B is produced either by itself, nothing, or
another.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.340
The ascending series will either continue
infinitely or we finally reach something which

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.179
has nothing prior to it.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.359
7) An infinite ascending series is impossible.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.689
8) Therefore, a simple first efficient cause
exists.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.469
Given his detailed and genuinely well respected
analyses in his time, Duns Scotus earned the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.840
nickname “the Subtle Doctor,” and an entire
school of philosophy, Scotism, was named for

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
him.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.479
Important to the discussion at hand, Duns
Scotus was a fiercely devout Catholic who

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.280
even advocated for the forcible baptism into
the One True Church of Jewish children and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
adults.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.370
Along with his extremely intellectual form
of reasoning, this strict adherence to Church

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.989
doctrine and teachings are ultimately what
led to him becoming the namesake for dunce,

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.700
despite the man himself being anything but.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.019
Skip forward approximately 200 years after
his death, and in the interim his ideas were

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.050
still being widely taught and his work still
well respected… that is, until the Protestant

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.299
Reformation had reached England.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.489
Even before Henry VIII began the switch from
Catholicism to Anglicism, the Reformation

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.250
was tearing through northern Europe and its
ideas, as well as the new thinking that came

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.549
with the Renaissance, had begun to seep into
the island nation.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.050
Nonetheless, traditional Catholics fought
back hard, and often relied on Duns Scotus’

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.459
theories and way of reasoning in their defense
of the Church and its doctrines.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.910
However, many of the modern scholars of the
late Renaissance saw Duns Scotus’ arguments

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.520
as “hair splitting” and characterized
his philosophy with the pejorative “sophistry.”

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.750
Pro-Protestant forces, seizing on this interpretation
of Duns’ philosophy began to characterize

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.140
their opponents who followed him as dupes
too stupid to see behind Duns’ specious,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.609
deceptive arguments and slavish devotion to
Catholic doctrine; and, naming them for their

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.359
hero, they became known as Duns, such as in
Tyndale’s Parable Wicked Mammon (1527):

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.159
“A Duns man would make xx. distinctions.”[1]

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.469
Over the years, Duns changed to duns and began
to be applied to those beyond the spell of

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.860
Duns Scotus, with one of two meanings.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.819
The first- one whose study of books has left
him dull or stupid- was first seen in J. Lyly’s

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.219
Euphues, (1578): “If one bee harde in conceiuing,
they pronounce him a dowlte, if giuen to study,

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.150
they proclayme him a duns.”[2]

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.890
The second meaning- a dull-witted, stupid
person with no capacity for learning- was

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.390
first seen in F. Thynne’s Ann.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.390
Scotl.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.489
(1587): “But now in our age it is growne
to be a common prouerbe in derision, to call

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:15.739
such a person as is senselesse or without
learning a duns, which is as much as a foole.”

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.170
The present spelling of Dunce was seen as
early as 1535, when R. Layton, in a letter,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.500
used the word to describe Duns Scotus’s
works; it was first applied more generally

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.880
to denote a stupid person in 1611, in R. Cotgrave’s
Dictionary of French &amp; English Tongues: “Lourdaut,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.090
a sot, dunce, dullard.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.690
Viedaze, . . . an old dunce, doult, blockhead.”[3]

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:44.060
Not all has been lost concerning Duns’ reputation,
however, and he is today generally considered

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.380
one of the more important philosophers of
the Middle Ages.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.760
Pope John Paul II even beatified Duns in 1993.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.030
johndunsscotusAs for who came up with the
idea of putting a silly pointed hat on the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.600
heads of a person labeled as a dunce, this
isn’t clear.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.140
It has been suggested that Duns held that
the wearing of conical hats aided in learning,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.930
with the shape being a symbol of learning,
funneling the knowledge into the head of the

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.930
wearer.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.641
(This is not unlike Abracadabra cones that
have been used in healing since at least the

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:11.641
2nd century.)

00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:16.570
Hence this idea supposedly championed by Duns
ultimately saw those mocking the dunces forcing

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.690
them to wear such a hat.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.840
However, there appears to be no direct evidence
to support such a notion and the first known

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.971
reference to a dunce cap didn’t come about
until the 1840 work by Charles Dickens, The

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:30.440
Old Curiosity Shop, in which it states

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.060
Displayed on hooks upon the wall in all their
terrors, were the cane and ruler; and near

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.110
them, on a small shelf of its own, the dunce’s
cap, made of old newspapers and decorated

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.500
with glaring wafers of the largest size.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.580
The word “dunce” at this point had long
been applied as a derogatory term for people

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.580
labeled as stupid or having done or said something
moronic, with no connection to Duns or his

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.580
work at all.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.130
Given the context it was first mentioned,
and later continued to be used for (punishment

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.940
for students), the idea behind it may well
have had nothing to do with hats from Duns’

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.270
time, whether he actually wore them or not-
simply a way to visually let everyone know

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.580
said individual had done something stupid
or acted out via making them wear a silly

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.700
hat that was easy and cheap to make- just
a simple means of humiliation.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.960
In fact, long before the idea of a dunce cap
seems to have popped up, there was the “dunce

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.141
table”, referenced in the 1624 play by John
Ford, The Sun’s Darling, in which poor performing

00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:52.840
students were forced

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:05.340
to sit.
