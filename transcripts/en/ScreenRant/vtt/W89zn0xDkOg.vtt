00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.400
Tons of couples meet at work.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.310
It’s a safe place to get to know someone
before deciding wether or not to shave your

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.750
legs and meet them for a drink in the real
world.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.340
Plus, job talk is guaranteed conversation
fodder, and fills those long silences nicely.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.920
Us mortals aren’t the only ones who find
our partners this way— the stars do it too.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:43.220
Here are 10 Popular Actors Who Found Love
On A Movie Set.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.110
Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes, The Place Beyond
the Pines

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.950
In 2012’s The Place Beyond The Pines, the
chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.540
is so intense, it’ll steam up the inside
of your screen.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.900
Director Derek Cianfrance tells the gritty
story of a man dead set on providing for his

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.900
family.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.160
After learning about the birth of his son,
Gosling’s character quits the carnival and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.410
gets himself a real profession: bank robber.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.710
It was on this movie that Mendes and Gosling
met, and they’ve been an item ever since.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.790
They’re married, and even have a couple
of kids.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.030
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, The Amazing
Spider-Man

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.560
When Andrew Garfield described meeting Emma
Stone for the first time in 2011, he said

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.390
it was “like diving into whitewater rapids
and having no desire to hang on to the side”.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.200
The two began dating while working on The
Amazing Spider-Man, and stayed together for

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.380
four years afterward.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.180
It’s a good thing the two liked each other,
since the movie had a pretty intense promotional

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.600
schedule that saw them spending every single
day in close proximity for months.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.560
And even though they broke up in 2015, the
pair are still great friends.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.380
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, Green Lantern
Opening to largely negative reviews, 2011’s

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.799
Green Lantern was panned by audiences for
its overuse and reliance on CGI.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.479
Especially when it came to the main character’s
suit.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.300
And although it’s viewed as an all-around
disappointment, one good thing did come from

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.970
the movie: the real life romance of Blake
Lively and Ryan Reynolds.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
Yes, there was some time in between those
two events, but it’s the end result we care

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.050
about.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.190
Both on screen and off, the two make a fantastic
team, and celebrated the arrival of their

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.860
first child in 2014.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.190
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Days of Thunder
Tom Cruise may be known for his couch-jumping,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.780
Oprah stunt where the actor proclaimed his
love for actress Katie Holmes.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.920
But back before Dawson’s Creek was invented,the
actor set his sights on another willowy lady

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.170
— Nicole Kidman.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.770
The two met while filming the stock car racing
flick Days of Thunder.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.870
The two fell head over heels and got married
that same year.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.350
And remained a couple until 2001, even starring
in a few movies together during their relationship.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.200
Since the two went their separate ways, Cruise
has been on a series of high profile love-quests,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.170
but nothing as enduring as his connection
to Kidman.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.010
Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, Step Up
Before he was workin’ the pole as Magic

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.180
Mike, Channing Tatum was hot stepping all
over one lady’s heart on the set of 2006’s

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.180
Step Up.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.640
His character Tyler ends up at a performing
arts school after a series of poor decisions.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.620
Spoiler alert: Tyler’s checkered past countered
by his passion for dance turns out to be a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.790
catalyst for change.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.150
And he falls in love with a fellow student
named Nora.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.970
Life imitates art, and the two young students
fell head over heels for each other in real

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.970
life too.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.840
The couple has been together ever since, and
no discussion about relationship goals is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.150
complete without at least a few nods in their
direction.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.790
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Mr. and Mrs.
Smith

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.820
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie met on the set
of Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2005, and began the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.980
process of falling in love.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.600
The only thing is that Brad wasn’t technically
single at the time, and Jennifer Aniston fans

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.660
were PISSED.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.460
Rumors of his infidelity swirled like tumbleweeds
in a tornado, and everyone and their dog was

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.620
picking a side.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.180
But once Pitt and Jolie were “official”,
Brangelina became a grade-A Hollywood power

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.870
couple with a humanitarian focus.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.120
They have six children and got married in
2014.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.070
And their recent split made the 6 o’clock
news everywhere.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.540
Gwyneth Paltrow/Brad Pitt, Se7en
Brad, Brad, Brad.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.460
We meet again.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.849
In addition to Angelina and Jen, the actor
also had a high-profile relationship with

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.449
actress Gwyneth Paltrow in the mid-nineties.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.210
And at one point they even had matching haircuts.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.860
The two actors met on the set of Se7en, and
if you’ve seen the movie, you’ll know

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.590
its story is a morbid one.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.449
So the fact that these two somehow found the
energy to flirt after long days of dealing

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.710
with a deranged murderer is amazing.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.750
They were engaged to be married, but the blonde
babes ultimately split after three years together.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.409
Helena Bonham Carter/Tim Burton, Planet of
the Apes

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.210
Ever notice how many of Tim Burton’s movies
feature Helena Bonham Carter?

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.159
Since 2001, the actress has been a fixture
in the director’s work.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.189
After meeting on Burton’s Planet of the
Apes, the two creative types began a relationship

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.849
onscreen and off.

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.860
Their chemistry is undeniable, and the actress
is the perfect fit for Burtons cinematic sensibilities.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.229
If it’s in the best interest of the character,
she’s not afraid to get weird.

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.069
But after eight movies, two kids, and thirteen
years, the couple went their separate ways.

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.560
Milla Jovovich/Paul W.S. Anderson, Resident
Evil

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.349
Love ‘em or hate ‘em, there are six installments
in the Resident Evil movie franchise.

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.090
And Paul W.S. Anderson was involved with every
single one of them.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.330
He owes a lot to the series, including his
marriage to wife Milla Jovovich.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.469
They met on the set of the first chapter and
have been together ever since.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.889
It’s probably really awesome to see your
wife play one of the most badass female characters

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.229
to ever hit the big screen.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.400
The actress has a habit of playing strong
ladies, and Alice is one of the best.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.870
Margot Robbie/Tom Ackerley, Suite Française
Sorry to shatter the illusion everyone, but

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.710
Margot Robbie is one very taken lady.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.710
We know, it hurts.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.699
But they are the cutest couple on the planet,
so turn that frown upside down.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.430
While filming Suite Francaise, one of the
assistant directors caught the actress’

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.430
eye.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.219
Apparently Robbie and husband Tom Ackerley
hit it off instantly and the rest, as they

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:18.479
say, is history.

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.650
The two initially kept their relationship
on the DL, but the cat’s out of the bag

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.499
now and there’s no going back.

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:29.349
The couple got married on the beach back in
2016.

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:35.580
Those are our picks for actors who fell in
love on their movie sets, but if you can think

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.279
of any others, let us know about them in the
