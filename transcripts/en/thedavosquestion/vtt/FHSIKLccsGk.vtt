&gt;&gt; Hi YouTube. I would like to answer to Freesouljah.
I agree absolutely with what you are saying

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.040
and I wanted to ask you if you have ever looked
at Wikipedia. I joined that project six years

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.811
ago and I joined because I wanted to communicate
with others and work with others. And what

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:25.189
I discovered is a place where people recreate
communities and they work together to create

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.039
content and make this content debateable to
all the other ones. And what is very interesting

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.270
to really join this community would discover
that many of our editors are very young people.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.340
We have people as young as 14 years old. We
have many 17, 18 year olds, so they could

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.761
be my children. And they teach me a lot of
things and whilst they add content to Wikipedia

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:53.720
not only do they feel empowered to do it and
teach others what they know but they also

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.320
learn from others. And they learn a lot of
new skills such as, collaboration, they learn

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.659
how to deal with others, different people
from other nations and all other countries.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.640
And this is an absolute great pleace for them
to discover life. So I would really suggest

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.860
that you go have a look and maybe try to lead
some children to join Wikipedia. So that's

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.360
it. Thank you.
