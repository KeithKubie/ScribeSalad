&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Hi, I'm Brady Forrest.
[ Applause ]

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.750
Mike, you have to hit "next slide." There
we go.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.550
And welcome to Ignite! This is our third year
here and, wow, we are bigger than ever. This

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.010
room holds 800 people and we were able to
get beer. So if you would like a drink, feel

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.940
free to line up. Please do it rather quietly
because geeks like to share. They like to

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.190
share their ideas, and that's what we are
going to be doing here at Ignite today.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.010
However, everybody shares a little more freely
when they know that the audience has been

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.330
pacified, when they know that the audience
is a little more receptive. And geeks like

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.510
beer so we figured that's the best way to
get you into the mood for the nine next talks

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.799
that are coming up.
Who here has been to Ignite before?

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.690
All right. Who here has been to Ignite at
I/O before?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.460
All right. Well, for those of you who have
never been here before or been to Ignite before,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.420
Ignite is a geek event. We'll have a series
of five-minute talks. Each speaker gets 20

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.120
slides, 15 seconds per slide. They have no
control over their slides. Once their slides

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.000
start, off they go. So, wisely, they all said
no to beer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.800
They are each going to have one afterwards.
If they come up to the bar, please let them

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.180
jump ahead of you.
We have nine awesome talks tonight. We've

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.470
got the head of security and resource management
from Burning Man. We have got Matt Cutts from

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.430
the Google spam team.
And some administrata. If you have feedback

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.280
about this session, if you want an even bigger
room next year, please vote on that on Pamela

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.350
Fox's feedback system.
Without further ado, I would like to welcome

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.729
my roommate from Boston back in the '90s.
He is now at Twitter, and he is going to instruct

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990
all of our speakers on how to use a microphone.
Please welcome John Adams.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.571
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;John Adams: Thank you, Brady. Thank you

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.810
very much. All right. Speak into the mic.
This thing is a microphone. Everyone has one.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.130
Everyone has been to a conference. Everyone
has used one before. But a lot of people don't

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.879
know how to use them.
I want to do is give you a quick history lesson

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.510
on how we got to where we are today, how we
ended up with this thing in our hand and where

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.890
it goes.
And it all started back in the day with three

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.900
guys. We have Whetstone, Berliner and Hughes.
Whetstone invented this thing called the all-mechanical

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.300
vibration stethoscope. It was two pieces of
metal he used to amplify small sounds.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.610
Now, he did a lot of work on telegraph, on
technology and security and things like that.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.900
He invented the Playfair Cipher.
One of the things that Hughes did is Hughes

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.460
invented this thing called a carbon granular
microphone. This is a brief diagram of it.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.180
We still use this design today in most microphones.
And the funny thing about it is, it is so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.040
simple but it is really bad. The problem with
that is that as an omni-directional move.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.700
This is a Western Electric Microphone for
the 1920s. This microphone pretty much paved

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.530
the way for the talkies for the early movies
that actually had audio to go with them. The

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.520
problem is they were big, ugly. They sat on
a desk, and they were really hard to work

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.630
with.
And by omni-directional, I mean it listens

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.840
to everything.
This microphone is a uni-directional microphone.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.440
If I move it over here, you don't hear me.
If I put it in front of me, you don't hear

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.110
me either. It listens to everything it can
get its hands on in the room.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.950
A lot of work was done in the 1930s to improve
the pickup pattern of microphones.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.370
This is the pickup pattern of Henry Olson's
microphone. He worked for RCA. This is a Figure

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.790
8 microphone. It picks up in the front and
little bit in the back. This is really not

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.730
the best microphone you can have because it
has no rejection. This is a cardiod microphone.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.441
It looks like a heart. Olson refined his microphone
by taking two microphones and putting them

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:41.879
back to back and subtracting one from the
other and using super position of waves was

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.310
able to delete the interference that came
out of the back of the microphone and only

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.680
give you what was in front of it. And that's
the microphone I'm holding today, is a cardiod.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.640
This is another famous microphone, 1937 Olson's
77A microphone. You may have seen this on

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.640
"The David Letterman Show." This microphone
is very popular. It was a ribbon microphone.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.489
It really refined and gave you better audio
quality.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.160
And this is another famous microphone for
the 1940s. This is the Shure 55A. You will

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.630
still see this if you go see a swing band
in any local night club here in San Francisco.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.819
It is the favorite of the Kruners. It is a
really pretty microphone, and it has great,

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.400
great sound, legendary.
In the 1960s, a lot of research went into

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.819
building the electric microphone. The electric
microphone can be seen in everything from

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.449
telephones to answering machines. About a
billion of these microphones were produced.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.169
They are really amazing little things. And
they are based on the original carbon design.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.551
In 1966, something amazing happen. The Shure
Brothers released a microphone called the

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:43.419
Shure SM58. This is actual a beta 52 that
I'm using, it looks like. This microphone

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.210
is absolutely legendary. You will see this
in every nightclub and every conference everywhere.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.650
The one thing about all this is when you finally
get one of these in your hands don't be shy.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.970
People get frequently mic shy. I'm up here
on stage. It is hard to be on stage, I will

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.990
give you that. The thing is you can't be shy
when you have a microphone in your hand. It

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.419
goes right in the mouth. It goes right in
your mouth right here. So the thing is, voices

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.839
come from your head. They don't come from
your chest. They come from your head.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:13.150
Don't be this guy. The microphone does not
sit in the stand down below. You have to have

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.050
the microphone in your mouth. It is kind of
scary. Not too much though. If you put it

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.759
too much in your mouth, you sound terrible.
The big thing about microphones is the distance

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.740
between you and the microphone makes a huge
difference. If I pull back even 4 inches,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.689
the sound completely changes. That's the thing.
That distance controls everything: The size

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.139
of your voice, the volume of your voice and
the way microphone listens to you.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.680
Another very interesting thing about microphones,
if you get the microphone too close, you get

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.449
this thing called a proximity effect. The
proximity effect is a big boost around 400

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.509
hertz. It is a big boost in the volume and
the base of your voice, the big, low mid section.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.259
And sometimes that's good. If you are a rapper,
you want that.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.060
But the thing is you get it too close, you
might be eating the microphone. Eating the

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.849
microphone is not good either. The microphone
does not go in your mouth. It does not go

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.259
on your mouth. It goes in front of your mouth.
Do not eat the microphone.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:08.680
All right. This is -- so overall gain, if
the microphone is too loud, what you actually

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.460
do with your voice is you push the capsule
of the microphone down to the back of the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.389
mic. When you do that, the microphone goes
into overload and it clips and the sound guy

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.949
gets very mad. As a sound guy myself, I have
seen this happen before.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.390
Another interesting problem is feedback. If
the microphone can pick up the speakers that

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.380
are around here -- up on stage, I have a bunch
of these tiny monitor speakers. If I was to

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.589
push this microphone into one of these speakers,
you would get a nice loud squeal and the sound

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.319
guy would probably kill me. You have to be
very careful and very conscious of feedback.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.330
The real thing you want to do is keep that
mic straight on and you are going to get great

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.789
sound.
All you can do is put the mic in front of

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.899
you, even if it is on the stand and you will
get fantastic sound tonight. I hope that all

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.849
the ignite speakers tonight have learned something
from this. And we'll hopefully have great

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.870
sound during the performance. Thank you very
much.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:07:00.159
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: And hopefully all the speakers

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:06.180
for tomorrow have also paid attention.
Our next speaker is the editor-in-chief of

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.129
IO9. She has been giving sci-fi-based Ignite
talks since 2007. Please welcome No. 6, aka

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:13.129
Annalee Newitz.
[ Applause ]

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:24.099
&gt;&gt;Annalee Newitz: I'm going to be talking
to you a little bit about how science fiction

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:28.179
represents the future of social media. And
I'm lucky because I guess I'm getting a little

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:32.710
extra time here.
And I think this is an interesting thing to

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.909
do if you are working with social media, if
you are developing it or using it because

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:39.689
it gives you a chance to kind of sit back
and think a little bit about what kind of

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:45.099
future you might be building with your technology.
And also it gives us a chance to kind of take

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:49.779
the temperature of the culture and, say, Well,
what are people's fantasies about the future

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:53.740
of social media and media that comes from
computer networks? What are our hopes and

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.990
our fears about it?
So I'm going to take you through about four

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.229
common stories that science fiction tells
us about the future of social media. The first

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:06.979
is one that's very popular in science fiction
literature and also among developers, which

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:13.099
is some kind of hive mind or artificial intelligence
will rise up out of our social networks and

00:08:13.099 --> 00:08:19.199
out of our user-generated data. Even Larry
Page is a big fan of this idea and has said

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:24.740
he is enthusiastic and hoping that one day
Google Search will become an artificial intelligence.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.759
The question is: Will this artificial intelligence
be smart or stupid?

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.969
Will it be like the AI in "Neuromancer" by
William Gibson, which is so smart it is able

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:38.680
to eventually be to leave the planet. Will
it be kind of a trickster like in Verner Vinge's

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.200
"Amazing Rainbow's End" or will it be just
as dumb as a shark as it is in a fantastic

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.850
short story by Maureen McCue.
There is also the story of the proverbial

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.840
privacy apocalypse that would be brought on
by social media invading every part of our

00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.040
lives, surveilling us, turning the vessels
of our entertainment into our own -- into

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.640
a spy show.
Obviously, one of the key stories in this

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.340
genre is "1984" where people are watched by
their telescreens.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.750
But there's also a number of other stories
that deal with this in a slightly different

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:21.220
way, which is, for example, in the 1960s Philip
K. Dick's novels including the short story

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.720
"Minority Report" as well as things like "Scanner
Darkly" where he imagines a future of ubiquitous

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.690
advertising and social media that not only
invades our lives but also invades our minds.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:37.191
And I would conclude by talking about a book
that just came out in the U.S. called "The

00:09:37.191 --> 00:09:43.080
Quantum Thief" by Hannu Rajaniemi. It has
been out for about a year in England. He suggests

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.880
in the future the way that we'll handle privacy
will be that our post-human selves will develop

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.190
organs that negotiate privacy each time we
meet with somebody. And so everything -- all

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.140
of our thoughts are saved to the Internet,
but we can decide who gets to remember those

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.210
thoughts and who gets to remember meeting
with us and seeing us.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:09.100
Another fear about social media is that it
will lead to mind control, will jack our minds

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.170
into the networks and suddenly there will
be no difference between what corporations

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.340
want us to think and what we actually are
thinking.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.290
And there is different ways this gets played
out. The matrix is a perfect example where

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.250
everyone's brains are being controlled by
a massive game-like simulation to keep us

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.130
pacified while we are being used by machines
as batteries so we are reduced to the lowest

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.370
common denominator.
There is another fantasy, of course, that

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.400
comes out in Neal Stephenson's classic novel
"Snow Crash" as well as Charlie's Stross'

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.520
terrific book, "Glasshouse" which both are
about how people catch viruses in their brains

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:49.240
from being plugged into media online.
And so, basically, your brain crashes or stops

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.490
behaving correctly.
And then, of course, there is the movie "They

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.540
Live," which is about how media is actually
secretly controlling us, telling us to obey

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.440
these aliens who have taken over the world.
This is a great screen shot from the film

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.060
when the characters finally see what's going
on.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:07.620
The flip side of mind control is the idea
that social media will lead to instant social

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:16.260
revolution and that through using social media
the grassroots, journalists and reporters

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.560
and anyone reporting the news will be able
to continue doing their work even better.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.490
A classic show in this vein is "Max Headroom"
from the 1980s where an intrepid reporter

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:33.220
uses television signals to broadcast ideas
that the corporations don't want us to hear.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.610
This idea is elaborated also in the classic
comic book "Transmetropolitan" by Warren Ellis

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:45.430
which features a reporter who is telling the
truth about crime in the city and using underground

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:51.740
means and using social media.
Also, social media vigilantes like Anonymous

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.760
have used "V for Vendetta," the classic comic
book which actually isn't about social media,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.990
as a symbol for their social media revolutions.
Another book that I would recommend if you

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:11.040
are interested in social media is "Feed" which
is about how bloggers are the only people

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.880
who are willing to report on the zombie apocalypse
and so all of the traditional reporters are

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.680
killed in the zombie apocalypse but the bloggers
survive.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.450
I would say that our hopes and fears about
the future of social media are embodied by

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:31.260
the phrase from the movie "Serenity, You can't
Stop the Signal," which is the idea that revolutionary

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.180
ideas will get out. You can't stop that. But,
also, I think the fear is that you won't be

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.530
able to stop the signal that controls your
mind as well. So there's both a fear and hope

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.660
embodied in that phrase.
Thank you very much.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.220
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you, Annalee.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:52.400
And I do want to second that recommendation,
"Feed" is a really fun book. And I'm a connoisseur

00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:00.190
of the zombie genre. I know, and the sequel
is coming out soon.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.930
Our next speaker has been speaking at O'Reilly
conferences for quite a while, usually talking

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.740
about the interference between body and technology.
He today is going to be talking about the

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.210
Open You project. Please welcome Kyle Machulis.
[ Applause ]

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.211
&gt;&gt;Kyle Machulis: Hey, what's up Ignite? Don't
answer that. I don't have that much time.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:20.260
My name is Kyle Machulis, and this is your
brain but this is also your brain on bugs.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.320
I'm looking to put the U back into code, even
though it didn't have an U in it already,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.460
even maybe if you are British. I don't know.
Here's what I do. I do a lot of stuff, and

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.860
it involves game controllers and Abe Vigoda
and Kinect and everything else.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.170
Basically, I reverse engineer video game hardware
because it is cheap and people can get to

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.240
it and they can use it for research and academia
and robots like you saw upstairs.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.320
So I really, really like numbers obviously.
And now there is this new thing called The

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.360
Quantified Self Movement, which is all about
numbers about you. You can do all these things

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.310
like introspection and journaling and, basically,
making yourself a better person. But really

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.540
it means more hardware because hardware's
awesome. So there's consumer hardware which

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.630
there's things like EEGs and blood pressure
monitors and pedometers and sleep meters.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.510
But the problem is with these, the business
model is that they upload their data back

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:15.050
to a walled garden so you can only access
it through there and you have to pay for it

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.990
and it really sucks.
And beyond that, there's medical hardware,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.180
real honest to God medical hardware. This
is inside people at the moment and they can't

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.250
actually get the data out. Yeah, that's a
pacemaker and it talks wirelessly only to

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.300
the company that owns it. Freaky.
Yeah. So, I started this thing called the

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.280
Open You project. Open You is about reverse
engineering all of this stuff and handing

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.820
it back to the community and then doing really
interesting stuff with it, too, that's just

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.930
fun. For instance, there's the Golden Gate
Wall Project. Golden Gate Wall is all about

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.900
-- I'm skipping ahead of my own slides. I'm
actually going too fast. Awesome.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:53.180
So here's some things that we actually do
in our projects. We've done libfitbit for

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.190
reverse engineering the Fitbit pedometer.
There is Emokit, which is for the emotive

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:03.844
EEG to get the raw waves out. These are available
in C, Python, SWIG. And then we put them all

00:15:03.844 --> 00:15:07.930
together in projects like Golden Gate Wall,
which is all about doing rock climbing the

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.870
most computational way possible. We scan walls.
We take biometrics and trying to do automated

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.640
route generation.
So that really pisses off people.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.381
[ Laughter ]
So what all this needs is a shared time base.

00:15:19.381 --> 00:15:24.260
We need to be able to take all of these sensors,
write our own drivers for them and record

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.029
all of them into the same stream of data.
We are not the only people that are doing

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:30.190
this.
For instance, there is a company called Neurofocus.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.080
They are actually over in Berkeley and they
do this for advertising. They put an EEG on

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.250
you and they show you ads they watch when
your brain reacts to the ad. So they can tell

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:43.190
actually tell whether you really like Tide
before you even know you like Tide.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:48.490
But we -- the thing is, I mean, I like rock
climbing. I'm not really into advertising.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.860
But most of the time, I'm sitting. I'm sitting,
and I'm programming. And I might as well just

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.070
be flipping off my pedometer at this point.
So what can I do about that? The problem is,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.610
when I'm programming, I kind of go into this
hole. I will be like sitting there, and then

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.080
there is some code. It is eight hours later,
but it only feels like one or two. There is

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:12.180
a product, and it is awesome. But I kind of
miss myself at that point. So what can we

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.610
do about that?
That's why I created the Quantified Coder

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:21.590
Project. Quantified Coder is all about getting
us back into our coding because right now,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:27.310
we're sitting there with IDEs but we aren't
really there anymore.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.800
What do we do about that? We need to look
at what metrics can we take from the coding

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.650
environment? There is your chair that we can
put accelerometers on. There is IDE which

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.860
we can track. We can check the stroke force
of your keyboard. We can put EEGs on you.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.980
We can put electromyographs on you. We will
get to that in a sec.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.640
There is lots of information we can take.
We can start instrumenting your IDE because

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.990
obviously everyone is using Emacs, right?
[ Laughter ]

00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:00.130
So there are other scriptable IDEs. Why would
you use them? You can actually add this to

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.220
the time base with the other sensors I mentioned
earlier.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.049
So now we track things -- we track the sensors
on the programmer against their line of code.

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:13.250
What were your brain waves doing when you
wrote this line of code? What was your hand

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.279
doing and how tense was it when you wrote
this line of code? Did you get up? Your pedometer

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:24.329
can actually look at when you left your code.
And then we can see when going into a bug

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:29.820
review, Hey, you are feeling tired when you
wrote this code. You got up. You lost your

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:35.080
concentration when you wrote this code.
[ Laughter ]

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.130
More importantly, we can use machine learning.
We can use machine learning to say, Okay.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.440
There was a bug here. How did you feel at
this time? Now, find all of the other places

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.320
that you felt the same way while writing this
code.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.879
[ Laughter ]
Finally, we can get really crazy with this.

00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:56.169
We can go to social coding projects like Google
code and Gethub and actually upload all of

00:17:56.169 --> 00:18:01.080
our biometrics together to give a human picture
of a library or framework or something like

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.379
that so everyone can know how frustrated you
are when you use it.

00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:07.799
So, anyways, that is the Quantified Coder
Project.

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:11.039
[ Applause ]
I'm looking for help. This is completely open

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:14.101
source. I need everyone's data, and I mean
all of you.

00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:18.580
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you very much, Kyle.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:25.680
I apologize. I spoke with him before about
the Emacs propaganda, and I -- we had a -- Kyle,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.799
not next time!
[Laughter]

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:34.990
All right. Our next speaker, is actually the
chief of emergency services for Burning Man.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:40.220
I biffed his title earlier. And he's here
to talk about risk management at Burning Man

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:46.799
and other amusement parks and how it applies
to your lives. Please welcome Joseph Pred.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:50.039
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Joseph Pred: Burning Man, on the very off

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:55.330
chance you don't know about it, is the annual
fire arts festival that takes place in the

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.999
northern Nevada desert, and out there, we
seek to find the balance, the sweet spot,

00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:04.360
between risk and reward and experience.
And this is the secret sauce, really: that

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:11.380
humans crave and seek intense and vibrant
experiences. So we allow that experience to

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.690
take place between a balance of safety and
risk choice.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.759
And you say to yourself, "Well, I don't do
risk management. How does it really apply

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:23.799
to me?" Well, every time you cross the street,
you're engaging in risk management. Especially

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:27.720
if you're jaywalking, like these people are.
[Laughter]

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.899
And so -- and it shows up everywhere in your
life once you start looking for it.

00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:35.679
And what wouldn't a risk management talk be
without a few disclaimers?

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:42.630
So common sense is not common.
So this doesn't apply to financial risk management

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:52.029
or any number of other risk categories.
And no one likes to be told no. It sacrifices

00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:59.070
the experience. It lacks flexibility. It lacks
creativity. It denies the entire process of

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:04.880
learning your own boundaries.
And it doesn't really -- it's not really a

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.340
form of risk management. It's really bypassing
the entire process. It's confused, sometimes,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.330
with risk management, but you're just eliminating
the experience.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.480
And no one really likes that.
And we're also dealing with a society that's

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.799
got warning label overload.
[Laughter]

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:26.690
And everywhere you turn, there's warnings,
right? "Hot coffee may be hot." "May cause

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:32.929
drowsiness." "Sharp edges may be sharp."
And what that does is it sanitizes the experience

00:20:32.929 --> 00:20:37.429
through the results of all these lawsuits,
and in my mind Disneyland personifies the

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:44.340
sanitized experience. Sure it's fun, but you've
got long lines, barricades, highly controlled

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.480
and engineered environments. Look but don't
touch.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.139
The experience is dictated for you.
Burning Man is a bit of an alternative. Sure,

00:20:53.139 --> 00:20:59.539
it's also engineered for safety, but it's
an open environment where risk can be taken

00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:04.059
as a choice as part of the experience.
And people who come to Burning Man accept

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:08.590
risk as part of that experience. People come
back from the first time, especially, saying,

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:13.140
"My God, I just had the most amazing experience
of my life. I feel completely transformed

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.649
as a person." And the question that I often
ask myself is: How many people say that when

00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:22.279
they return from Disneyland?
So know your own level of risk tolerance.

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:26.590
This is Philippe Petit crossing between the
twin towers on a wire. He certainly knows

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.980
what his level of risk tolerance is. So seek
to understand what your level of aversion

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:38.419
and tolerance is to risk. And this is a slogan
that's really popular in the extended Burning

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:44.309
Man community because if you accept risk,
then experience becomes the first priority,

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:49.559
not safety.
And what's -- if you -- really, if you make

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:54.410
safety a priority, then you lose the immediacy
of the experience.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.639
This is my highly unscientific and subjective
chart.

00:21:58.639 --> 00:22:03.539
You got shuffleboard down there. You got cave
diving up there. And what's at the origin

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:09.350
of danger and fun? In my opinion, it's boredom.
Own your own outcomes. If you're going to

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.340
play with fire, accept the fact that sooner
or later you're going to get burned, so take

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:19.230
and ask others to take responsibility for
their own choices and actions.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.659
Extreme risks are the ones that you want to
eliminate. For example, this is Euchronia.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:30.489
It's several hundred feet in diameter -- and
it's on fire, by the way -- and there's no

00:22:30.489 --> 00:22:33.450
barricades.
This allows for an immediacy and an intimacy

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.299
with the piece that barricades would just
not allow.

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:41.820
This is the ladder to nowhere. It's 108 feet
tall, and no safety harnesses were provided.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.610
So if you chose to engage in this experience
and climb this ladder to see what it felt

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.600
like to be that high up, you were free to
do so.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.450
Or not.
And it's imperative that you communicate to

00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.320
people that they're making choices about risk
and what they're -- they're engaging in. And

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.110
the more you can communicate that risk, the
more people are going to be free to explore

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.870
their own boundaries. The back of the Burning
Man tickets say "By attending this event,

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:14.129
you freely accept the risk of injury or death."
Because lawsuits are everywhere. You cannot

00:23:14.129 --> 00:23:16.980
eliminate the risk of lawsuits.
Disneyland isn't immune. Burning Man isn't

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.809
immune. No business is immune.
The only way to be immune is to not be in

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:24.759
business at all.
So if you accept risk as part of the experience,

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:30.050
then mitigate the risks that you can while
focusing on the experience, and keep in mind

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:34.440
my favorite Voltaire quote: "Perfect is the
enemy of good enough."

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.159
Now, I know for some of you, risk is a little
bit too scary, so you can always, instead,

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:45.799
go home and sit on the Internet and look at
cute pictures of kittens and puppies.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:46.869
Thanks.
[Applause]

00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:58.020
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you very much, Joseph.
Clear the way for him to get a beer.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.730
He was too -- I don't know why he didn't say
it but he's got a book coming out in June

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:07.220
"Show Me How To Survive." If I was going to
read one survival book this year, it would

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.070
be his.
Our next speaker, you wouldn't know it from

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.289
looking at her, but she's actually shy, and
she's here somehow braving the world to come

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:19.149
up here and talk about it. Please welcome
ex-Googler Pamela Fox.

00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:26.350
[Cheers and applause]
&gt;&gt;Pamela Fox: Okay. Hi, everyone. For the

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:53.669
last five years, up until a few months ago,
I worked at Google as 

00:24:53.669 --> 00:25:03.919
a developer advocate. My job was to give talks,
organize events, post in forums and basically

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:12.710
spend all day every day communicating with
developers. So hearing that, you'd probably

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:27.789
think I'm an incredibly outgoing and social
person. But I'm not. I'm shy. I'm really shy!

00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:33.590
What does that mean? Well, for me, it means
I'm afraid of approaching people and talking

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:40.869
to people. Especially when it's me and a group
of strangers. Situations like that I'd much

00:25:40.869 --> 00:25:49.549
rather be standing in the corner, pretending
to amuse myself with some farm animal themed

00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:54.899
mobile app.
Now, ultimately it's because it's a -- I have

00:25:54.899 --> 00:26:02.950
a fear of rejection. You know, as long as
I don't approach people, I don't have to worry

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:10.240
that they're going to ignore me or turn me
away. And I could not worry about it and just

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:19.200
live in a hole for the rest of my life, but
eventually holes get lonely and you need a

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.309
little of that human touch.
Quick survey time. How many of you guys consider

00:26:22.309 --> 00:26:32.080
yourselves shy? Don't be shy. Raise your hands.
Okay. And how many of you want a little of

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.309
that human touch? Okay. Now, touch your neighbor.
Okay. Great.

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:42.890
[Laughter]
Okay. So you guys, you know, you kind of know

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:55.320
what I'm talking about, right?
Now, I've been shy for a long time and I've

00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:07.490
also been wanting to not be shy for a long
time, so I've spent approximately my whole

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:13.200
lifetime developing work-arounds, and since
I think the world would be a better place

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:25.519
if we weren't all deathly afraid of each other,
I'm going to share some of my ideas with you

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:32.659
guys today.
So my main approach takes a couple of different

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:38.601
forms, but it basically boils down to this:
Since I'm afraid of approaching people, I

00:27:38.601 --> 00:27:48.130
need to get other people to approach me, so
that means giving them a really good excuse

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:53.940
to talk to me. And I can do that a couple
different ways.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:03.559
One way is to get myself in a group of leadership
-- position of leadership over a group of

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:12.289
people. It may be a group that already exists
or it may be a group I create myself, like

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:22.769
a club. And once you do that, the people can
approach you with group-related matters.

00:28:22.769 --> 00:28:32.200
Like when I was class president in high school,
my classmates would talk to me about what

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.750
love songs we should play at prom. Now, once
you're in charge of that group, you can organize

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:48.049
events. Of course you have to get people to
actually show up at the events, but usually

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:58.929
if you're interested in something, somebody
else will be too. Except this one time when

00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:05.759
I organized the viewing of Moulin Rouge. That
was just me.

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:08.679
[Laughter]
But stick with tech buzzwords, you'll be okay.

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:14.549
So maybe you think it's too much effort to
actually organize a club in order to get people

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:24.371
to talk to you. I understand. So a step down
from that is actually be a speaker. When you

00:29:24.371 --> 00:29:33.419
deliver a talk to a group of people, like
I'm doing now, there will be a whole room

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:48.809
of people afterwards that know who you are
and, even better, who know what conversation

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:55.840
topics they can approach you with.
Speaking isn't easy. I still get sick right

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:12.359
before I go on stage, but it's worth it. When
I went to Sydney, Australia, moved there,

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:22.929
didn't know anyone, I gave two talks at the
local bar camp my first weekend there and

00:30:22.929 --> 00:30:34.090
met 90% of my Ozzie friends. Find a topic
you're passionate about. Find a group of people.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:40.759
Speak about it.
And when you do find an event to talk at,

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:56.629
try and talk early in the event, right? If
it's a multiday conference, speak on the first

00:30:56.629 --> 00:31:07.090
day. If it's a one-day conference, speak before
lunch. You're giving people the most amount

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:15.460
of time that they can actually approach you
and talk to you about stuff in your talk.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:26.029
Okay. So maybe you're not up for speaking,
but clearly you guys are about attending events

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:31.950
because you're all here today, and I applaud
you for that because it's really nerve-wracking

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:41.909
to show up at an event with thousands of people
you don't know, right? How does anyone approach

00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:50.740
you in a sea of strangers? Well, they need
some conversation topic they know interests

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:56.899
both of you.
Ideally, we'd all walk around with augmented

00:31:56.899 --> 00:32:03.549
reality Android apps that would visualize
auras of hash-tags around each other and auto-target

00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:10.200
us to whoever has the most overlapping tags.
Doesn't exist yet. Maybe after tomorrow's

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.849
keynote it will. I don't know.
Until then, you can use your clothing and

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:23.979
accessories to convey your interests to others.
Like when I have bright pink hair, pretty

00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:31.090
much everybody approaches me on the street.
Or I can just wear a geek shirt like this

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.639
one and you can come up, we can talk about
get repos or maybe after a few drinks, hard-core

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:36.639
forking action.
[Laughter]

00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:43.010
Now, if you get really desperate, just give
away free shit. People love free shit. When

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:50.509
I was a kid in grade school, I used to bring
brags of candy to lunch during the holidays

00:32:50.509 --> 00:33:01.559
and all my classmates became my best friends.
As a Googler, I basically did the same thing

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:09.789
except with free shirts and beer, which is
the adult equivalent. But sometimes it can

00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:18.619
get exhausting to try and be approachable,
sometimes it can get expensive, and sometimes

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:27.799
it just doesn't work. So sometimes you just
simply have to admit you're shy, let people

00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:45.470
know, and help them make it better for you.
With Google, you know, we all eat in these

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:57.879
big cafés, and, you know, my colleagues would
all wander off in different packs today and

00:33:57.879 --> 00:34:07.659
I'd often wander into the café alone. I'd
look around at all the lunch tables, be way

00:34:07.659 --> 00:34:16.370
too scared to sit at any of them, and bring
lunch back to my desk. I pretended to be all

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:29.110
absorbed in my work, but it was just a really
sad moment for me every day. And I was tired

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.180
of being sad every afternoon, so I eventually
told my colleagues about my lunchtime shyness.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:46.340
From then on, he explicitly invited me to
lunch every day and made sure I had a seat

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:58.270
at his table, and so I no longer dreaded lunchtime.
So really, my actually hack in combating shyness

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:15.290
was to get a job that forced me to employ
all these work-arounds on a near daily base.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:40.660
I basically got paid to face my fears for
four years and now I've got techniques to

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:55.020
last me a lifetime. I still get shy but I've
got the work-arounds.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:12.480
Okay. So now that I've shared all my shyness
hacks with you, I want to hear about some

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:32.040
of yours, and I've now given you every possible
excuse to approach me and I want you to use

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:42.940
some of those excuses at the afterparty tonight.
I'd be in the corner, pink shirt -- pink share,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.850
geek shirt. Thanks.
[Applause]

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:56.760
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you very much, Pamela.
And now we've got another Googler. He still

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:10.980
works for the company, as you may know. We
all know him as the guy we go to with any

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:22.090
website questions, SEO questions, web spam
questions, but it turns out he does a whole

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:32.410
bunch of other stuff outside of his job, and
he's here to talk about his 30-day challenges.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.450
Please welcome Matt Cutts.
[Applause]

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:45.650
&gt;&gt;Matt Cutts: All right. My name is Matt.
I work in search quality, but I'm going to

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:52.390
talk about something completely different.
A series of experiments I've been running

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:58.910
where I try new and different things for 30
days.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:15.060
All I'm doing is saying, "Look, my life is
in a little bit of a rut, so I'm going to

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:23.750
follow in the footsteps of the great American
Philsopher, Morgan Spurlock." If you remember,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:32.850
a few years ago, he recorded himself eating
McDonald's food for 30 days. Now he's a really

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:38.591
well-known filmmaker.
So anybody can do this. Anybody can try a

00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:42.880
challenge.
You can do two major types of challenges.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:55.930
You can either add something to your routine,
so walking 10,000 steps a day, or biking to

00:38:55.930 --> 00:39:10.170
work, or if you're interested, you can also
subtract something from your daily routine.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:16.060
Is Robert Scovel in the audience?
[Laughter]

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:23.010
He's not. Okay. I can make Robert Scovel jokes.
I once did a 30-day challenge where all I

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:28.530
did was try to get rid of Robert Scovel from
of my life? Out of my Twitter.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.310
[Applause]
It's surprisingly easy.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:40.270
I'm kidding. I love Robert Scovel.
The things that I learned when I did my 30-day

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:50.880
challenges. Number one, the time is much more
memorable. This was part of a challenge I

00:39:50.880 --> 00:40:02.320
did to take a different picture every day,
and I remember exactly where I was and what

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:12.720
I was doing that day.
I also discovered that as I did more and more

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:29.280
30-day challenges, I couldn't help but start
to get in a little bit better shape, because

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:46.870
some of them were things like biking to work.
So this is me from a few years ago. I look

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:59.660
a little more chipmunk moon pie. But I started
out doing a 30-day challenge where I biked

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:07.660
to work, and I found after a few days, I actually
liked biking to work.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:14.250
That was completely different for me.
And so I've lost about 40 pounds over the

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:18.060
last few years just from exercising.
[Applause]

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:24.040
Thank you.
I also discovered that I became a little more

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.230
adventurous, so last year I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro,
the highest mountain in Africa. I would never

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:34.770
have been that adventurous. It helps a lot
with things like being shy if you're willing

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:39.180
to take on a new adventure on every 30 days.
Once you've done something like climb Mt.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.930
Kilimanjaro, you think about what do you really
want to do. And I've always wanted to bring

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:48.650
a book. Every November, tens of thousands
of people try to write a book from scratch

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.930
in 30 days.
Now, it turns out it's not that hard. All

00:41:53.930 --> 00:42:00.650
you have to do is write 1667 words a day for
an entire month.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.400
[Laughter]
Here's the secret: All you have to do is make

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:17.300
sure that you write your words before you
go to sleep that night. You might be sleep-deprived,

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:26.360
but you will finish your book.
Now, a lot of people come up to me and they

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:33.150
say "Matt, can I read your book" or "Is it
the great next American novel"?

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.450
And the answer is: No! I wrote it in 30 days.
It's awful!

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:41.170
[Laughter]
But for the rest of my life, when I go to

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:46.990
a party, I don't have to introduce myself
as a computer scientist.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:52.730
[Applause]
If I want to, I can say I'm a novelist.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:43:00.570
So those are my 30-day challenges. But everybody's
going to be interested in something different,

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:07.920
right? The lady who cuts my hair decided she
wanted to go running with her dog every day.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:20.740
And she discovered she was a morning person.
That would not have been my 30-day challenge,

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:29.330
but it worked really well for her. It might
be trying to go, instead of right-handed,

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:33.270
going left-handed for a month. It doesn't
matter. You pick what's right for you. Now,

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:38.650
I'm going to violate the cardinal rule and
be silent while you think of a 30-day challenge

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.600
you want. And here's a few ideas.
Got one? Okay.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.420
Here's a few tips about how to do a 30-day
challenge.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:54.540
My first one was giving up television for
30 days. I made it easy by watching all the

00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:05.850
good season finales and then when the crappy
summer reality TV came on, that's when I did

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.650
my 30-day challenge, right?
[Laughter]

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:12.330
So make it easy on yourself.
I've learned that there's nothing wrong with

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:17.470
big huge challenges. In fact, they're a ton
of fun. But small ones are more likely to

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:29.100
stick. They're more likely to be sustainable.
It's also much easier to add a habit than

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:41.310
remove a habit. When I gave up sugar for 30
days, day 31 looked like this.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:50.130
[Laughter]
My wife and I went to Krispy Kreme, the grocery

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.180
store, and every candy store, getting all
kinds of candy. It was fantastic. I couldn't

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.180
move for like a day.
[Laughter]

00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:01.880
But the thing is, doing that with my wife
made me realize it's really helpful to have

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:11.430
a buddy. A buddy keeps you on track. So whether
it's writing a book or doing whatever, they're

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:18.530
going to keep you honest. They're going to
make sure that you're making good progress

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:24.010
on it.
Here's my final tip. You want to pick a challenge

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:28.750
that's kind of interesting.
You want the sort of reaction like this, right?

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:35.720
It's not just something small. You want to
be thinking about what's going to be a good

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:41.260
conversation starter? What's going to help
me strike up a good conversation with people?

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:54.600
So I want to close with a very simple question.
The next 30 days are going to pass, no matter

00:45:54.600 --> 00:46:04.520
what. I guarantee it. So why not pick something
you have always wanted to try and give it

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:11.630
a shot for the next 30 days?
Thanks.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:16.670
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you very much, Matt.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:31.060
Our next speaker was inspired by the tiger
mom's article that came out in the Wall Street

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:45.730
Journal a little while ago, and luckily she
happens to work as a data scientist at LinkedIn

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:51.860
and decided to see if there's any truth to
it. Please welcome up Monica Rogati.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.510
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Monica Rogati: Thanks, Brady.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:47:02.520
Hi, everybody. I'm Monica Rogati. I'm a data
scientist at LinkedIn, and I'm here to talk

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:21.970
to you about finding stories in the data.
So a few months ago, there was this big controversy

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:29.670
about tiger moms and their parenting styles
and their outcomes. So I'm a data geek, so

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.810
my first instinct was, well, let's look at
the data.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:39.010
But what kind of data do we have? Well, on
LinkedIn, we have a hundred million profiles,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:49.300
and on those profiles, you can see things
like people's last name, their job titles,

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:56.160
and their region.
So basically, what you can do is you can look

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:07.110
at this data at the global level and sprinkle
in some machine learning, and then you can

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:20.110
have a pretty reasonable guess about where
each of those names originate from.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:27.570
Right?
So then you can take what you've learned,

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:33.250
take it back to the United States, and look
at people's profiles.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:39.760
And when you do that, you can look at what
job titles are overrepresented for a particular

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.050
region.
And going back to the tiger moms, well, so

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:45.720
as it turns out, the tiger cubs --
[Laughter]

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.300
-- do value scholastic achievement and statistics,
but they're not the only ones.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.910
It turns out you can do this kind of analysis
for any type of region or any type of name

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.910
origin.
So we did this for eastern European names.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:52.910
They look pretty similar. And you can contrast
them with western European names and they

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.910
optimize for slightly different metrics.
So what else is on LinkedIn? We have career

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.810
histories of a hundred million people, and
what you can do with that data at the aggregate

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:57.990
level, you can ask questions like: What's
-- where are people going? What's the hottest

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.350
industry right now? What are the fastest growing
job titles in a given year?

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:02.110
So if you do that, you can discover the tech
boom in 1999 and the corresponding bubble

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.110
burst when everybody went back to school.
[Laughter]

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.820
And you can look at today, right? And see
the rise in social media and data scientists,

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:11.420
of course. And you can see fads like gurus
going to ninjas going to rock stars.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.940
So how do you find these data -- the stories
in the data?

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:18.560
Well, there are three simple ingredients.
Aggregate, normalize, and dig.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.470
So aggregate across interesting dimensions,
normalize your raw data, and dig. Ask why.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:24.860
Find the reason for the trend.
So when you aggregate, you can take some interesting

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.980
data like when people changed their job and
get a promotion, and you can aggregate it

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:37.200
by country and by month.
And then you can find interesting trends like

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.790
rediscovering India's fiscal year.
Then you have to normalize. That's crucial.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:49.130
You have to find the denominator. There is
always a denominator. You have to look for

00:49:49.130 --> 00:50:00.420
what's overrepresented, not just popular.
Here if we wanted to see a trend, we had to

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:05.060
look at relative change.
So then you have to dig. You have to ask why.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.200
Why do you see that trend?
In this case, we looked at when people were

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:15.450
born, and we found our answer. It's the millennials.
They don't care what month of the year it

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.760
is. They want their promotion. So...
So let's see. Let's take another story. Top

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.400
overrepresented CEO names on LinkedIn.
Peter, Bob, Jack, you might look at those

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:30.890
names and say, "Well, those are just popular
baby names 50 years ago," and you're right.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:36.670
But that's not the whole story.
To find the real story, you have to dig.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:44.160
And look at the length of the names. If you
look at that, you'll find quintessential sales

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:54.830
guys like Chip, Todd and Trey, right?
The CEO distribution is not as skewed. Jack,

00:50:54.830 --> 00:51:01.110
Fred, Bill.
But you can -- they still want you to be a

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:07.990
friend, so they use nicknames.
So the media allows this stuff, so the question

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:12.660
is: How do you communicate the data stories?
The infographics are awesome, but the story

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.410
itself has to be compelling. It has to be
interesting, it has to be accessible, and

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:19.430
it has to be relatable.
Howard Stern covered this, because one of

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.430
the CEO names was Howard.
So obviously there's lots of interesting data

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:24.570
stories, and we all love data and we want
more of it. I'm no different. That's my license

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.570
plate.
[Laughter]

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.980
But the data isn't enough. What you want is
you want to dig and find the story in the

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:35.390
data.
So if you like finding stories in data and

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:39.730
love big data, let's chat. Thanks.
[Applause]

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.272
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: Thank you very much, Monica.
Our next speaker is also going to talk about

00:51:41.272 --> 00:51:42.272
data, except it's about inane data. Please
welcome NYU's Patrick Davison.

00:51:42.272 --> 00:51:43.272
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Patrick Davison: So it was just before Thanksgiving

00:51:43.272 --> 00:51:44.272
of 2009 when my roommate, Mike Rugnetta, came
into the living room to tell me that the music

00:51:44.272 --> 00:51:45.272
video for Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" had
been deleted from YouTube. He and I knew this,

00:51:45.272 --> 00:51:48.710
because Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" was part
of what we call the Golden Four, which was,

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.710
to our knowledge, the first four YouTube videos
to have over 100 million views. Now Mike Rugnetta

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:50.710
and I are a little different than a lot of
people because we see the YouTube comments

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.710
as having a distinct cultural value.
[ Laughter ]

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:52.710
So we've been looking at these for the last
two years, and we've come up with three challenges

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:53.710
in doing so. And that's what I want talk about
today.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.710
Challenge number one is that YouTube comments
are kind of hard to hold on to. In the case

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:55.710
of Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" if the video
disappears, so do all of your comments. And,

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.710
even if the video doesn't disappear, it turns
out that Google and YouTube's API only allows

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:57.710
you to grab the last 1,000 comments which
I talked to the API guys a couple hours ago.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:58.710
And they said they're going to undo that by
the end of the month. So maybe challenge one

00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:59.710
is gone, so never mind. Also spoiler alert:
If you're, like, really worried about the

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:00.710
Avril Lavigne situation, you should know that
it just got taken down so they could convert

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:01.710
it to Vivo. So it's back up, and you might
find it if you Google or YouTuble that. That's

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.710
fine.
Challenge 2 is global warming. As the world

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:03.710
gets warmer, YouTube comments tend to stick
together -- I don't know anything about global

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:04.710
warming. This is not true at all. There's
a very smart historian named Paul N. Edwards

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:05.710
who has studied the history of climate science.
And he said something like this: Virtually

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:06.710
everything we know about anything complex
depends on computer models. Right? When you

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.710
have a system of data that's as complex as
the world's climate system, you need computers

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.710
to help out. Right?
He puts it shortly this way: No one lives

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.710
in a global climate. Right? There's no single
person in the entire world who has experienced

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:10.710
the weather of the entire world. That's where
the computers come in. It's funny he says

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:11.710
this. Because there's another theorist named
Wendy Chun. She doesn't write about the weather,

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:12.710
but she does say is a global picture of new
media possible?

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:13.710
So, if we believe that one person can't experience
all the weather of the world, I think it's

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:14.710
easy to believe that one person can't experience
all of the YouTube comments in the world.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.710
Right?
I mean, it only takes a little while looking

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:16.710
at this list of all of the user names of everyone
who's commented on Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend"

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:17.710
to realize how complex this system actually
is. And that's before you realize this is

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:18.710
just for one video and it's just the people
who commented in the last three weeks. If

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:19.710
you take every comment for every video from
all of time, that system seems to be just

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:20.710
about as complex as maybe the world's weather
system.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:21.710
So what do we do with this.
Right?

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.710
Well, there's some differences. Climate data
is definitely scientific data, right?

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:23.710
It's things that you can count and measure.
But YouTube comments tend to be made of cultural

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:24.710
data. It's things like language and sentiment
that are a little bit harder to pour into

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.710
a database. Right?
I mean, if you think about Shakespeare, for

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.710
instance, what do we do with Shakespeare?
We read Shakespeare. We don't use it to make

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.710
a tag cloud.
[ Laughter ]

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:28.710
If we do, it feels kind of wrong, kind of
dirty like you're not doing it justice. But,

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:29.710
you know, YouTube is not Shakespeare.
[ Applause ]

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:30.710
But, I mean, if you spend enough time looking
at YouTube comments, which I do, you'll find

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.710
what I would describe as hidden poetry.
[ Laughter ]

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.710
So we've got the first two challenges. Where
does this leave us?

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:33.710
We've got access and the need for models that
give us a giant system of cultural data that's

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:34.710
a little hard to get at. What's our third
challenge?

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:35.710
Well, our third challenge makes the first
two harder. So me and my roommate, Mike, we

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:36.710
can sit at home and come up with grassroots
methods and show people lists and analyses

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.710
that we've made sitting in our bedroom. But
the reaction is always going to be the same.

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:38.710
Whoever we show this to is, "Okay, great.
YouTube comments are worthless. Why did you

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:39.710
do this?"
Maybe my dad summed it up best last week when

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.710
he tweeted at me saying, "YouTube comments
are more like verbal vomit."

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:41.710
This third challenge is the attitude that
people have toward towards this kind of data.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.710
So, if there's one lesson I can leave you
with that global warming has taught me about

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:43.710
YouTube comments it's this: Climate scientists,
they study the weather. Whether it's bad weather

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:44.710
or good weather, it's data to them. And, if
we want to be serious about being cultural

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:45.710
scientists, then we need to treat that data
the same way. YouTube comments might be the

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.710
shitty snowstorm of the Internet, but we still
need to pay attention. Thanks.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:47.710
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: If you enjoyed Patrick's

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:48.710
talk, he's also a writer and on "No, you're
mean," which we all love. And then he also

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:49.710
did my all-time favorite Ignite talk called
"Plight of the Digital Chickens," which you

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:50.710
can find on YouTuble.
Our last speaker is also an ex-Googler. And

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:51.710
he's here to talk about open versus closed.
Please welcome Kevin Marks.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.710
&gt;&gt;Kevin Marks: Thank you. So I spent a lot
of time on the Gilmore Gang talking about

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.710
openness versus closedness with the guys there.
And I wonder what got me there, so I thought

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.710
I'd look back through my history and work
out how I came to these conclusions in the

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:55.710
first place. That isn't actually my history.
It's my country's history. Back in feudal

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:56.710
times, land was the key to everything. If
you owned land, that gave you control. That

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:57.710
gave you power over other people. You could
force them to do things. Land ownership is

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.710
key. And you have to compete over it. If I
have it, you can't have it. And this spread

00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:59.710
into culture, too.
When professions are were set up, they were

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.710
granted royal charters. They were, basically,
given monopoly over their profession to decide

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:01.710
who could and couldn't do it. That was the
assumption that came from land. It moved along

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:02.710
that way. And it fed into copyrights and patents,
too. In effect, the copyright rules are medieval

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:03.710
monopolies granted by the state that says
you can do this and nobody else can. It's

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:04.710
like the same charter they granted the British
East India Company that said only you get

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:05.710
to go to India. Excluding others was what
they thought was the key to extracting value.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:06.710
If you look patents like this one for an eraser
that goes over your finger, the whole point

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:07.710
is that's a brilliant idea. Nobody else can
possibly do this without paying. But, actually,

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:08.710
we know exclusivity is the enemy of culture.
I rehearsed the argument. Lessig has been

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:09.710
doing this for 10 years. Go read some of his
books. Watch his presentations. The whole

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:10.710
point is culture is built on other people's
thoughts and ideas, too. That's how we connect

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:11.710
together. That's how we get culture in the
first place. And keeping this stuff locked

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.710
up is really fragile. If you stop people copying
stuff and sharing stuff, you can lose it.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.710
The Internet archive is trying to preserve
the Internet from these kind of losses. And

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:14.710
they said, if you keep stuff secret, it would
cost you thousands of dollars to preserve

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:15.710
it forever. If you share it in public, it's
a different story.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.710
Back to my personal story. I joined the BBC
in 1998. One of the first places I worked

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:17.710
was the BBC archive where they had racks and
racks of videotapes and films on the walls.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.710
The thing is they weren't copying the videotapes.
The oxide fell off the tapes, and they lost

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:19.710
10 years' worth of programming because they
weren't doing rolling backups. What they had

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:20.710
to do was go around to the people who had
been illegally copying the tapes onto private

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:21.710
stuff and get them back so we could see old
Dr. Who's. There's a project called LOCKSS,

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:22.710
Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff at Stanford, which
is trying to do this digitally. I recommend

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:23.710
looking at that, the principles of that. The
point is, if you want culture to persist,

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:24.710
you have to have lots of copies of it.
So I worked on a CD-ROM title called 3D Atlas.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.710
If you bought a Mac around that time, you
probably got it bundled. We sold two million

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.710
copies. It was pretty successful. Things were
great. We thought great. We'll burn lots of

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:27.710
CD-ROMs. Couple years later CD-ROMs weren't
so hot. There was an Internet thing. And we

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:28.710
had a brilliant idea. What if, instead of
making 3D rendered movies, we chopped up pictures

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:29.710
of the earth into little tiles and stored
those all on a server and fetched them over

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:30.710
the Internet and stuck them together with
a 3D card?

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:31.710
We built this in '97. But the people who owned
the company decided they didn't want to do

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.710
this. They'd rather shut the company down.
So I had to go and find another job. But I

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:33.710
couldn't take the idea with me. So when Keyhole
and Google Earth came out a few years later,

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.710
oh, yeah, somebody did it too. Sort of personally
painful.

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:35.710
[ Laughter ]
But I'm glad somebody else did it.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:36.710
So in 1987, Apple produced this thing called
HyperCard. Anybody remember this thing?

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:37.710
Some of you are as old as me. It let you do
this web-like thing of making little textual

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:38.710
things that linked together. In '91 they had
a thing called QuickTime. It played movies

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:39.710
over the net. It was powerful. I worked there
at Apple. I joined in 1997. And they were

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:40.710
going to join them together. Combine HyperCard
with QuickTime. It was a beautiful thing.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:41.710
But Steve Jobs killed it. And he's proud of
that. He boasted about it last year. He said,

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:42.710
"We were right to kill HyperCard. It was crap,"
just like Flash is.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.710
I paraphrase slightly.
So the problem with closed software is it's

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.710
fragile. It takes one bad decision to kill
it. And all those people who built businesses

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.710
on HyperCard were no longer able to do anything.
They were waiting for the release from Apple.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:46.710
The release was there. They built it for OS10.
It's still sitting in the box. But it's been

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:47.710
shut off.
So open source is great for engineers. Because

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.710
engineers, even if they leave the company,
can take their source with them. If I had

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:49.710
open sourced the 3D Atlas thing in '96, I
could have carried on working after they shut

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:50.710
the company down. That would have been great
for me. But it's also great for the companies.

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:51.710
Because be the companies can still have access
to the engineers after they've left.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:52.710
This is a long quote from Ian Hickson. But,
basically, he's saying the point of the HTML5

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:53.710
project is to preserve culture, to make sure
we can still read the web in the future by

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.710
documenting how the stuff works. The real
value of the openness stuff is summed up by

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:55.710
Doc Searls. No one owns. Everyone can use
it. Anyone can improve it. The point is you

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:56.710
gain more control by giving up ownership because
you're giving everyone else control, too.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:57.710
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Brady Forrest: All right. Thank you all

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.710
for coming out. The videos will be up on igniteshow.com
and up on YouTube later.

00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:59.710
Now, in case you've never been to an Ignite
before or there isn't one locally, Ignite

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:00.710
is all over the world. It's in 200 cities.
And all you need is a projector, beer, and

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:01.710
gullible people. So, if you want to start
an Ignite -- there's hundreds more of these

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:02.710
logos where these came from -- just contact
me or go to igniteshow.com/howto or start

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:03.710
your own.
I'd like to thank Google for having us back

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:04.710
for the third year.
And thanks to all of our speakers.

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.710
Can you give them a round of applause?
[ Applause ]

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.714
Thank you very much.
