00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.330
Forty two years and counting

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.330
our classmate Senator Edward M. Kennedy

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.240
thank you very much, and George

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.090
George Abrams

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.600
I don't think we could have had a class of
nineteen fifty four if we didn't have George Abrams

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.680
I will tell you

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.939
he has been so devoted to this the class over
so many years and I think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.869
those that have been closely associated
with it

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.860
the know it and he's been a dear and 
valued friend

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.800
he's been such a dear and valued friend that he's
put me on the last, I'm the last speaker that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.960
you have

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.970
and I'm the last speaker before happy hour

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.130
and I don't know what it was

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.280
put me on at five minutes to five here but in any
event

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.980
I thank you George I know I did something
to you back there in those times

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.970
years ago but

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.070
I have

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.540
he's been a dear and valued friend he
and Mada

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.750
have been such dear friends to me

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.100
and I thank him for all he has done

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.670
for when he came to the United States senate
was the chairman of our refugee committee that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.290
did so

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.909
impressive work down there and has been
so devoted to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.850
this great celebration, really a pleasure
to be with George

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.729
let me 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.220
say a 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.780
word about my colleagues
I've

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.159
added up and it's been a pleasure to have
served and continue to serve with

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.560
all of them. I did my math among us we've
clocked a total of a hundred and eight years

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.240
in the senate and house of representatives
and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920
Connecticut good neighbor Nancy Johnson is a republican
power in the house

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.830
these days, it's always a pleasure to be with
her

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.750
and Tony Beilenson and I were both elected
at the age of thirty

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
he was the pioneer of the environmental issues

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.079
on family planning

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:57.600
national

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.340
health service

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.390
his son

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.380
he is a leader on these that issues in a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.579
the leading a great city, has been selected
as the outstanding public servant

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.329
so he's not only had a great career myself

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.620
but he's inspired another generation so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.679
it's a pleasure to be with Tony.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.009
David Boehm was a voice of reason on civil
rights but it wasn't easy

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.049
a pleasure to be with him.

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.680
But it is a special place to be
with the an old friend a very dear friend

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.349
and

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.939
but John Culver and I have been vast friends
for

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.829
of some fifty years he helped me get started
in the united states

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.059
senate

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.549
after that went back

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.790
to Iowa, elected the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.379
to the congress of the united states then
to the united states the senate

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.139
and in many ways the most enjoyable
years I spent in congress were the sixteen

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.509
great years that we served together and I
wish he was still there.

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.949
John

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.219
as 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.899
George mentioned, wrote a brilliant book

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.289
on Henry Wallace

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.109
I thought it deserved a Pulitzer prize

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.419
 it is just the a very very special historical

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.819
document that is a great addition and help
in understanding

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.349
an extraordinary period of time in American
history

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.899
John I

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.899
as you remember particularly with regard to
John

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.989
had been a good football friends on campus
and 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.650
we made a good team in the senate, John was
the fullback carrying the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.589
ball grinding out the yardage on the field
later on the issues

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.799
shaking off republican tacklers

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.539
I was the left end

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.769
which everyone thought was where I learned my
political philosophy

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.229
so, but thank you John

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.409
it's good to be here with the class of fifty
four and an article

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.289
in yesterday's Boston globe mentioned that

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.399
a pretty good case could be made for the class

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.889
as the Harvard’s greatest class, sounds good
to me,

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.289
the globe 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.680
the globe article also referred to a  

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.529
certain class poll that

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.930
asked extraordinary personal and interesting
questions about

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.659
the reading habits

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.229
and shall we say lifestyle

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.629
of the members of the class.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.019
I was interested to know that we read an
average

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.389
of seventeen books a year

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.659
and that

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.389
four percent

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.869
of the class

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:29.659
has a more interesting personal life

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.630
than ever before

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.630
well done class! well done!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.600
fifty years so much has

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.759
changed in government and politics but so much
as the stayed the same

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.340
especially the power of the nation's ideals

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.439
to attract talented men and women

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.389
to public life.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.280
I find the senate is every bit as inspiring
to me today as it was

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.349
in nineteen sixty two

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.340
the key to enacting

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.019
progressive legislation is very simple

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:06.400
ninety percent of it is hard work

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.359
and the other fifty percent

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:11.019
is Irish luck

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.529
I learned early from my brothers and from
my grandfather, the Boston mayor,

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.919
that the best way to meet a challenge

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.110
is to see an opportunity

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.879
and the miracle in Philadelphia in seventeen
eighty seven

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.509
makes it possible to treat every challenge
that way

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.280
we may not always live up to those ideals
but it's endlessly gratifying that so

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.289
many in each new generation are so eager to
try

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.669
and it's also gratifying that Harvard and
the school of government named for my brother

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.849
and it's institute of politics

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.219
are at the heart but that effort

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.809
you learn very quickly that young men and
women

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:51.900
are ready to sign on

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.729
for community and public service

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.409
if only somebody asked them

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.569
Harvard asked

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.259
and the response has been truly extraordinary

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.960
I've been in the united states senate for
nearly forty two years that

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.959
is not quite the fifty-year milestone that
we celebrate today for the class

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:13.770
of fifty four but it’s a lot longer than I ever
would have contemplated

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.800
when I first entered public life

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.270
and during those forty two years I've served
under nine

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.449
presidents four democrats five republicans

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.449
one of those presidents, my brother Jack,
was also a Harvard man and

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.900
his administration was filled with Harvard
men

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.960
and women including my brother Bob as an attorney
general

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.050
and from where I sit those were extraordinary
days in our nation's history and I'm so proud

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.940
and honored

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.239
to have been a part of them.

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:49.239
Throughout its history

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.750
throughout its history the senate has and
by and large been

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.119
an extraordinary collegial place

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:02.629
and with fierce opponents debating an issue
on the senate floor and then working together

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.620
to pass the legislation the next day

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.370
even in the fiercely partisan time during
the Clinton administration you could still find

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.210
that

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.439
kind of

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.469
collegiality.

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.870
I remember 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.960
one time when I was going to offer the minimum
wage

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.319
legislation, increase in the minimum wage

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.300
it's a legislation that was sponsored by

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.660
Senator Murkowski that was going to

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.539
increase the national parks

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:30.319
in communities around the country

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.949
and I went up to our leaders and to
Daschle and

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.649
I said you know

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:37.419
Senator Murkowski said that if I didn't

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.879
offer the amendment on the increase in
the minimum wage

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.590
he would put

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.669
my

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:47.749
parks, new national park which was new Bedford

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:52.129
which is the home of the Melville in the
great whaling tradition deserve on its

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:53.719
merits to be included in it

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:56.469
but if I offered the minimum wage he would
not include it

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:57.509
I told them

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.459
I said I'm still going to offer the minimum
wage

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.809
so I offered it we were defeated

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:04.559
and they call the roll

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:06.560
and the bill

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.330
carried and  Senator Murkowski came up to
me and said

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.539
well Senator Kennedy don't feel too bad about
that

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:14.400
because I left yours

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.519
but left out one of Bob Dole's who's the majority
leader

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:19.449
so it really wasn't partisan

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.860
because I left out his and left out yours

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.609
so I said well that helps out a lot and I thank
you very much

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:29.569
so they finish with the a roll call and the
senate wound up and I was

00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:32.149
cleaning up my desk and I saw

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:34.860
Bob dole sitting over there

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.940
and that I said to Bob dole I said

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.330
oh what a about

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.270
another parks bill, national parks bill

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.070
he said what have you got mind

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.850
I say yours and mine

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.800
he was the majority leader at that time

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.690
he said

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.100
will Daschle clear that?

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.489
absolutely.

00:08:55.489 --> 00:08:56.730
because Daschle knew

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.780
that I could have gotten mine in
but as a matter of

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.820
principle that I hadn't offered that thing

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.239
he said 

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:04.670
draft it up

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.870
it passed in the next fifteen minutes his bill

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.410
his park and mine

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.010
the most interesting

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.160
it went to the conference

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.130
and when it got to the conference

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.640
there were those

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.330
with all deference to

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.440
my colleague here, republicans

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.180
that said okay we'll take Dole's

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.270
but we won't take yours

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.610
and dole said no

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.630
we went in together and we're coming back together

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.940
now that was collegiality

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.690
even though we differed with Bob dole on ninety
percent

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.670
that would no more happen today

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.110
that kind of working together that kind of
understanding

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.030
that kind of

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.320
opportunity just doesn't exist.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.170
it's become a cliché to suggest that collegiality
is gone

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.430
and partisanship rules the day

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.240
but I don't think that tells the entire story

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.520
there's still time, for it's possible to reach
across the aisle to accomplish something good

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.190
for the American people, I had great hopes

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.770
for the no child left behind legislation but
those opportunities are harder to find

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.780
in any election season.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.620
there is also a more personal tone in disagreements
these days

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.170
Until a few years ago no Senator would ever
dream of going to the floor

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.360
to mention another Senator by name

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.670
without first notifying that Senator in advance

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.970
thus the notified senator had the opportunity
to sit on the floor

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.810
the hear the other Senator take him to task

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.570
and usually in the quite

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.060
polite terms, the gentleman from Massachusetts,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.480
and the like

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.510
without question the tone of the speeches
was much milder

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.040
when you had to look the opposing Senator

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.320
in the eye.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.980
I recall that just a few years ago a republican
Senator went to the floor to challenge and

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.500
contradict

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.260
one of Senator Bob Byrd’s statements

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.430
and he mentioned

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.290
Senator Byrd by name without first notifying

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:54.310
and as the informal historian and keeper of
the senate tradition

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.230
Bob Byrd was livid at the breach of senate
procedure

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.570
he ran to the floor to excoriate the offending
Senator

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.240
for failing to notify in advance and by the end
of the episode the republican Senator was

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.560
publicly apologizing to Senator Byrd

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.010
and the substantive issue of disagreement
faded in the background

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.110
well the issue a protocol breached took

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.430
the center stage

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.320
unfortunately for the senate however

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.700
that sense of protocol is today honored more
often in the breach

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.560
perhaps not as it relates to Senator Byrd
but certainly as it relates to the ninety

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.040
nine

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.080
other members of the senate

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.640
this aggressive and personal partisanship
was not as evident

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.340
even ten years ago.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.610
for example when Mitt Romney challenged me in
nineteen ninety four he asked Orrin Hatch

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.780
certainly a fierce republican partisan, to come
to Massachusetts to campaign for him

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.220
but Orrin was on the ranking member of the health
committee and I was the chairman and Orrin

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.180
refused to come in to Massachusetts

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.620
to campaign against me

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.280
collegiality particularly on our committee

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.810
trumped partisanship

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.860
contrast that with what we see today

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.100
in just this last month the senate majority
leader Bill Friske went to south Dakota

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.240
to actively campaign against the minority
leader

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.550
Tom Daschle

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.390
that is a dramatic and unprecedented move that
certainly does nothing

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.540
to advance the collegiality.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.620
for nearly the entire history of the senate
collegiality didn't stop at the party line

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.609
but after some seat change

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:24.289
you're beginning to see that collegiality
is going to join the ranks

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:26.450
of hand written letters

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.210
soon to be considered a quaint old-fashioned
custom

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.960
this decrease in collegiality is not in
my judgment the result of having any particular

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.550
party

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.740
in control

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.490
I think it is partly the result of twenty
four hour news cycles

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.920
in which talk radio and TV personalities keep
ratings up

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.350
by engaging in strident and aggressively personal
attacks

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.810
on politicians

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.059
and that tone then spreads to discourse

00:12:51.059 --> 00:12:52.520
on capitol hill

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.150
I certainly know something

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.800
about throwing a little partisan red meat

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.880
but I'm talking about something different
from that

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.470
it's more of a take-no-prisoners approach

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.640
to government

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.140
that I do not believe is in the best interest
of the American people

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.300
another reason for the changed tone of the
senate I believe is that today many more members

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.330
come to the senate

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.170
from the house of representatives

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.870
and the house has a very different set of
rules and atmosphere then you have historically

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.190
found in the senate

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.380
my colleagues from the house can speak more
directly to this but the party line voting

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.740
and the all-or-nothing philosophy

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.030
it permeates the house of representatives

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.620
has not been a part of the senate dynamic

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.610
until very recently

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.620
believe it or not this is also the first time
in the entire fifty years

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.310
since the graduation of the class of fifty
four

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.119
that the republican party has been in control
of both the white house and the senate

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:46.800
and the house of representatives

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.819
and an overwhelming majority of the federal judiciary

00:13:49.819 --> 00:13:50.890
has been appointed

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.630
by the republican administration

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.920
often in those fifty years democrats had control

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.930
but on those occasions it was never a significant
strain on the system

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:07.780
of checks and balances because democratic
unity is such an unusual phenomenon

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.660
as the saying goes

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.940
we tend to line up in a circle

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:18.940
when we try to form a firing squad

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.340
the checks and balances

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.240
are less effective when the party in control
is more monolithic

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.020
the only real check on a bad idea today

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.920
it's a filibuster in the senate

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.910
the challenge is especially serious when the
pressure from the right is so determined

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.949
to extend its control to the judicial branch
of the government

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:38.750
as well

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.030
fortunately we have an election every two
years they can restore

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.680
the balance when the strain is too severe

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.680
I think of Winston Churchill often these
days

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.400
Democracy is the worst form of government
except for all the others that have been tried

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.420
from time to time

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.300
if it could transform thirteen tiny quarreling
colonies

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.890
into a free nation two hundred years ago

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.430
if it could transform Europe and Japan after
world war two

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.860
and bring down the Berlin Wall as well

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.929
it can also produced good to the many
challenges

00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:12.650
that we face today at home and around
the world.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.450
I'm an optimist though,

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.350
I like to think that the times are auspicious,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:22.210
that we can tap into the wave of new hope
and commitments stirring in the country now

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.380
after the very moving dedication of the world
war two memorial a week ago

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.200
the sixtieth anniversary of D-DAY

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.050
we are all in this together

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.340
the greed

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.850
the special interests

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.649
the petty partisan passions

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.860
the poison politics

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.550
can't endlessly stop an idea

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.540
who's time has come.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.189
again Churchill said it best, America will
do the right thing

00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:51.210
after it's tried everything else

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.830
legislating is not exactly

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.920
instant gratification

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.970
in the sixties as a young Senator I was drawn
to the issue of civil rights education and

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.620
health care

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.010
and I still am

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.990
and Harvard’s been an indispensable resource

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.830
you can assemble the best minds on any
issue

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.640
and then try to form a coalition of the willing
to fight for it.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.350
usually you have to sustain some losses and
then regroup

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.970
we you can come back to fight again

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.650
most of the real gains and policies happen
that way

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.830
incrementally

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.250
nothing happens if you let the best

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.030
become the enemy of the good

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.920
we've been struggling for two hundred years
to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.050
for all

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.940
the year the class of fifty four graduated
was the year of the modern revolution in

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.050
civil rights began

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.579
with the landmark school desegregation decision

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.370
by the supreme court

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.380
we've made progress since then

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.090
but we know that civil rights is still the
unfinished business

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.290
of America

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.959
in education we began to argue in congress
the sixties about aid

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.730
to low-income students and high poverty districts

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.160
and we still are

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.299
and today we continue those battles and higher
education we still have glaring

00:16:58.299 --> 00:16:59.070
inequalities

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:04.869
and qualified low-income students only a quarter
is likely to attend college as the more

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.159
qualified but wealthy as equally qualified
or no more

00:17:08.159 --> 00:17:08.890
qualified than

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:14.700
but wealthier fellow students
the GI bill for the world war two generation

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.020
wasn't early giant step

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.620
but we still have miles to go to close the gap

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.840
The president 

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.960
has announced an enormously interesting innovative
program

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.880
that any child that is basically
in the bottom third

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.980
of the economic income but is able to
meet the criteria are the standards here at

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.190
Harvard before the income from forty thousand
dollars less

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.169
will not

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:38.410
 have to pay

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.510
 the tuition

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.110
leading

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.080
advance and in terms of colleges

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.350
that challenge other colleges 
across this country

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.110
health care policy is never easy either

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.500
in nineteen fifty four we were just a few years
away from Harry Truman’s

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.950
unsuccessful effort to enact universal health
care

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.530
still hasn't happened

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.060
even though every other industrial nation
the world did it

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.720
years ago, made health care

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.630
a fundamental right for all

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.430
we shouldn't be going it alone

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.800
on foreign policy

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.500
and we shouldn't be pretending

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.119
on health care that everyone is out of step

00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:20.119
but Uncle Same. let me

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.700
when my brother Jack was in congress and senate

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.160
in the nineteen forties and fifties the senate
would recess

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.820
in June

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.020
for the rest of the year

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.050
some members spent more time on the links
of the burning tree country club

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.660
than on the floor the united states senate

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.930
but with the seriousness of the issues on
civil rights and the war in Vietnam the senate

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.410
changed

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.650
to a five-day week

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.470
twelve month calendar with some votes

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.490
being held between Christmas and new year's
day

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.809
the challenges facing the country

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:58.560
were too important to ignore

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.880
the time in actual session is shorter 
now

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.650
we don't get out in June but votes usually only
take place between Tuesdays and Thursdays

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:10.360
there are many more recesses than there used
to be and they are longer

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.270
but the problems that we're facing in our
country are as great

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.700
as or greater than at any time in our nation's
history

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.839
and I believe that we will rise

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:21.110
to meet them

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.980
it took Lyndon Johnson’s landslide in nineteen
sixty four

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.019
to make Medicare happen in nineteen sixty
five

00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:30.729
and a John Kerry landslide in two thousand four

00:19:30.729 --> 00:19:33.860
might just be what the doctor ordered for
two thousand five

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.410
thank you very much
